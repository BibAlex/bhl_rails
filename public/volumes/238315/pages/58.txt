only four had been above 200 mm total shell
length, the largest of which was 206 mm. The
average length was only 142.9 mm.
The relationship between shell length and
whole wet weight is shown in Fig. 4. In obtain-
ing the relationship of log,,, W = -3.42983 +
2.97281 log,,, L, 1,213 pairs of observations were
used. Due to an oversight, the 66 geoducks of
less than 50 mm shell length of Fig. 4 were not
included in the equation. Data from the length-
weight and age-length curves were combined in
Figure 5. The curve shows that the greatest
annual weight gain occurs between the third
and seventh year of life.
The average whole, freshly-dug geoduck con-
sists of about 56% meat. Meat is defined as all
portions of the clam minus the shell and water
of the major body cavities.
