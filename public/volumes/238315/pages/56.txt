SPAWNING AND GROWTH OF SUBTIDAL GEODUCKS

ary 1971 when another sample was taken (Fig.
2-C). They had increased to an average shell
length of 50 mm. Some of these clams were
marked at this time and replanted, thereby al-
lowing positive identification of the year class at
future sampling dates. Another year class was
present which resulted from a set in the spring
of 1970, and averaged 21 mm total shell length.
The large adult clams were still present and
unchanged at an average of 165 mm in total
shell length.
Both small year classes were present in Sep-
tember 1971, February 1972, and December
1972, as well as the large adult clams which
remained unchanged in average total shell
length (Fig. 2-D, 2-E, and 2-F).
The Dosewallips River flats were sampled on
two occasions, and the geoducks are depicted in
Fig. 2-G and 2-H. This population has been
intensively harvested by recreational clam dig-

gers for many years. The distance between the
peaks in the curves of Fig. 2 indicates that for
the first 2 years of life, geoducks grow about 30
mm/year. The average length of the various
year classes is shown in Table 4.
GROWTH DISCUSSION
The mark and recapture experiments showed
that growth in small geoducks was substantial
but very slow, if at all, in large geoducks.
Growth was found to be set back by the marking
and planting procedure. Large clams seemed to
be more affected than small ones. Due to the
setback, the rate of growth estimated by this
method is thought to be slightly less than the
true rate. The growth estimate determined from
length-frequency distributions probably gave
the most accurate results and is a reliable
method when enough is known about the popu-
lation studied to be sure of making accurate
judgments of the various year classes in the
population.
A growth curve based on the data of Table 4 is
shown in Fig. 3. The end point of the curve (158
mm) is the average adult size for geoducks in
Puget Sound. The average age was calculated
from 22 locations where at least 20 geoducks
were taken (Table 5). The largest one-half of the
geoducks of each sample was selected and an
average shell length calculated. These mean
lengths varied from a high of 183.9 mm at Kili-
sut Harbor to a low of 138.7 mm at Foulweather
Bluff, and averaged 157.7 mm.
