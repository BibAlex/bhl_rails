CLAM MARICULTURE IN NORTHWEST FLORIDA

at a low spring tide. At each location one of the
control plots was covered with an open bottom,
1.2 cm mesh plastic-coated wire cage, which was
pressed into the bottom 5-7.5 cm. The top sur-
face of the cage was 7.5-10 cm above the bottom.
The plantings at each location were examined
at intervals and at the termination of the exper-
iment the entire area of each plot was dug care-
fully and the clams recovered.
RESULTS
The bottom substrate analysis showed no sig-
nificant differences at the 5% level (Student t
test) in sand and silt at the two locations. Per-
centage sand ranged from 91-99. There were
significant differences (Student t test at 5%
level) in clay (mean 0.6% at Alligator Harbor,
3.5% at Turkey Point), organics (mean 0.5%
Alligator Harbor, 1.5% Turkey Point) and car-
bonates (mean 1.2% Alligator Harbor, 7.1%
Turkey Point). These higher values at Turkey
Point may have been due to the presence of a
four-year old spoil deposit of sand, clay and
limestone ca. 100 meters west and extensive
seagrass beds ca. 25 meters south of the loca-
tion.
Table 1 summarizes the plantings at the two
locations and the survival under each treat-
ment. The clams at the time of termination
were ca. 1.5 years old and had been exposed to
the open environment ca. 0.8 years. The sur-
vival was very low in the plots containing
gravel and shell, only slightly better than the
control plots with no protection at all. Pea
gravel did provide better protection than shell.
The best survival was under the cages.
Various known predators were observed on
the plots at the two locations, and on occasions
were observed feeding on the planted clams.

The predators appeared to be more numerous at
Alligator Harbor, but no quantitative data are
available. The predators include lightening
whelks, Busycon contrarium (Conrad), moon
snails, Polinices duplicatus (Say), blue crabs,
Callinectes sapidus (Rathbun), and stone crabs,
Menippe mercenaria (Say). Feeding depressions
created by sting rays, Dasyatis spp. and butter-
fly rays, Gymnura micrura (Bloch & Schnei-
der), were seen in the plots. Many broken as
well as intact, empty shells were recovered
when the experiment was terminated, but their
numbers were not recorded nor were attempts
made to determine the probable cause of mortal-
ity.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Although clam survival under the wire cage
control plots at Turkey Point is considered to be
commercially satisfactory, the survival at Alli-
gator Harbor was lower than usually obtained
from other observations with caged enclosures.
Perhaps the relatively low survival can be ex-
plained by predators gaining entry. No routine
inspections were made to be certain that the
cage was firmly entrenched in the bottom. On
one occasion a corner of the cage was found to be
out of the bottom.
Survival in protective substrates was several
fold greater than in control plots with no preda-
tor protection, but unacceptably low for com-
mercial operations. It is assumed that the mor-
tality resulted from predation and not from
some other factor(s). There is little or no current
at either location that might aid clam migra-
tion, besides the abundance of dead marked
shells many showing evidence of predation, be-
lied this as a factor in the recovery of live clams.
There is a remote possibility that gravel and
shell hash caused mortality. A control for as-
sessment of this possibility was not included in
the tests, i.e. no graveled or shell planted plots
were covered with wire cages.
The different survival rates obtained in Vir-
ginia and Florida, using similar substrate addi-
tives, could be explained in several ways. First,
particle size and amount of protective substrate
may have been different. Second, we have a
plethora of predators in Florida, more so than in
Virginia, and our milder winter season permits
activity of predators almost year round.
