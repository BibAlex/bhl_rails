CHANGES IN THE PACIFIC OYSTER DURING STARVATION

water, then the energy provided by each sub-
strate is derivable. Lipids were the most impor-
tant substrate in terms of total energy (Table 7).
Oysters are usually considered to have a carbo-
hydrate-oriented metabolism because of their
high glycogen content. The data presented indi-
cates that during starvation lipid and protein
are the major energy reserves.
One of the physiological effects of starvation
in molluscs is the decrease in oxygen consump-
tion which implies a decrease in the metabolic
activity of the starving organism with time. It is
possible to calculate the change in energy re-
quirements during starvation assuming com-
plete oxidation of energy reserves. The total
energy requirements decreased substantially
for the first 125 days after which a dramatic
increase in energy requirements occurred (Ta-
ble 7). During the last 50 days there was a large
increase in utilization of lipid; the major con-
tributor being the gonad. It is known that the
eggs of oysters are rich in lipid. The rate of dry
weight loss was increased for every body compo-
nent, except the digestive gland, during the last
50 days relative to the values for 125 days (Table
8). Possibly during the late stages of starvation
there is a decrease in the efficiency of the meta-
bolic pathways, accounting for the apparent in-
crease in the energy requirements during the
final sample period. It is quite possible that
incomplete oxidation of protein and lipid is oc-
curring.
Decreases in the free amino acid content of
the extracellular and intracellular body fluids of
stressed bivalves seem to be common (Jeffries,
1972; Feng, Khairallah and Canzonier, 1970).
Stressed bivalves show a decrease in the free
amino acid pools of both intracellular and extra-
cellular fluids. It is interesting to compare the
response of the free amino acid pools of stressed
bivalves with that of bivalves subjected to salin-

ity changes. Lynch and Wood (1966) found that
with decreasing environmental salinity there
was a concomitant decrease in the free amino
acid pool of the adductor muscle of C. virginica.
Some of the free amino acids showed less re-
sponse than others. Aspartic acid exhibited lit-
tle response to change in salinity. The data of
Feng et al. (1970) and Jeffries (1972) indicate
that aspartic acid did not decrease with stress
but actually increased. In my study aspartic
acid was the only free amino acid to show an
increase during starvation. Apparently whether
oysters are exposed to stress by environmental
pollution, parasitism, starvation or decreased
salinity the free amino acid pools are generally
affected in the same way with the major excep-
tion of the non-protein amino acid taurine. I did
not measure taurine, but in the studies by Jef-
fries (1972) and Feng, et al. (1970) taurine was
measured and found to increase with stress. In
general, bivalves subjected to decreasing salin-
ity show a decrease in taurine content (Schof-
feniels and Gilles, 1972).
It is possible to speculate on what the similar-
ity between the salinity induced change and
that due to starvation means. When a euryha-
line mollusc is placed in a medium of low salin-
ity, the extracellular fluid tends to adjust and to
reflect the osmotic pressure of the external me-
dium. The intracellular osmotic pressure re-
flects that of the extracellular fluid (Schoffen-
iels and Gilles, 1972). In marine molluscs free
amino acids are present in high concentrations
relative to vertebrates. These free amino acids
serve as solutes for raising the osmotic pressure
of body fluids and especially that of the intracel-
lular fluids (Campbell and Bishop, 1970). When
subjected to dilute media the tissues lose os-
motic components, especially amino acids, and
