nomic status of amoeboid organisms from tissue
and mantle fluid of C. virginica. The present
report concerns both a specific pathological re-
sponse and the documentation of the probable
etiologic agent.
METHODS
Histological sections of 1,337 oysters, C. vir-
ginica, collected from New Haven Harbor, Con-
necticut were examined during 1966 and 1967
(Newman, 1971). Monthly samples from rivers
and tributaries of Chesapeake Bay, Maryland
were similarly examined during 1970 and 1973.
Tissue sections were stained with Harris hema-
toxylin and eosin, Fuelgen reaction with fast-
green counter-stain, or the PAS (Schiff) proce-
dure. Microscopic examinations were made of
all specimens in each monthly sample and data
were analyzed to determine whether seasonal
variations were associated with histopathologi-
cal findings. Water temperature and salinity
were recorded at the time of all but one of the
collections from Maryland (Table 1).
RESULTS
Histological examination of oysters collected
in Connecticut showed that an amoeboid para-
site was present in the gut epithelium of 14 of
1,337 oysters (1%) (Newman, 1971). All infec-
tions in Connecticut oysters except for one in
February and one in June were detected in the
months of March and April. Subsequent obser-
vations on oysters collected in Maryland showed
that a similar parasite was present only in April
1970 and 1973. The number of infected oysters in
Maryland ranged from 1 in 25 to 7 in 25 (Table
1). In all of the infected oysters the parasites
were restricted to the columnar epithelium of
the digestive tract, always in localized foci, and
never beyond the limit of the basement mem-
brane. Oysters sampled in the areas listed in
Table 1 were studied throughout the year and
their generally healthy condition indicated that
significant mortalities were not associated with
the seasonal appearance of the parasite.
The smallest recognizable stage of the para-
site was a spherical form found in localized
areas of the intestinal epithelium (Fig. 1-2).
Round forms had a distinct central sphere
which stained deep red with the Feulgen reac-
tion and was surrounded by a wide halo after
staining with hematoxylin. Another stage re-
sembled an emerging sporozoite (Fig. 3) which
may have progressed to a pyriform body (Fig. 4)
and developed to a trophozoite (Fig. 5). Tro-
phonts, apparently in syzygy (Fig. 6), had an
ovoid deutomerite and the elongate filamentous
protomerite. Encysted forms, possibly young ga-
metocytes (Fig. 7) were found infrequently. (See
Newman, 1971, Fig. 7, for comparison.)
Specific pathological response in infected oys-
ters was evidenced by sloughing of degenerate
cells of the columnar epithelium or the displace-
ment of healthy host tissue by trophonts or
spherical forms. Proliferating asexual stages of
the parasites were not observed in any of the
oysters examined. Life cycle stages of the para-
site found in the oysters resembled forms which
typically have been illustrated for gregarine par-
asites of crustaceans and suggest that growth in
molluscs possibly was atypical.
DISCUSSION
Further observations on the occurrence of an
apparent gregarine parasite in C. virginica are
presented to extend its geographical range to
