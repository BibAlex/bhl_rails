inorganic ions, and assume osmotic pressures
comparable to that of the media. In some cases
the decreases in osmotic pressure of intracellu-
lar fluids may be due to increased tissue hydra-
tion (Campbell and Bishop, 1970), but normally
changes in cell volume of euryhaline inverte-
brates are slight (Gilles, 1969). In crustaceans
the concentration of intracellular free amino
acids is regulated partly by a mechanism in-
volving changes in the permeability of the cell
membrane and partly by modification of the
pathways normally responsible for the metabo-
lism of amino acids (Gilles, 1969). The modifica-
tion of these pathways is believed to be due in
part to changes in intracellular ionic concentra-
tion. It is quite likely that this same mechanism
is present in marine molluscs ( Schoffeniels and
Gilles, 1972).
In this study the decrease in the extracellular
free amino acids probably reflected an intracel-
lular decrease. This postulated intracellular de-
crease could be due to the increased hydration of
the cells due to the depletion of polymeric re-
serves, the alterations in the pathways of amino
acid metabolism. It is possible that this intracel-
lular decrease could be partly compensated for
by an increased concentration of taurine.
A study to determine the effects of starvation
on the extracellular and intracellular non-pro-
tein amino acids would seem to be warranted.
