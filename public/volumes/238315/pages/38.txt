ORGANIC CONTENT OF SHELLS AND TISSUES OF MOLLUSCS
31
ing their life is in the form of gametes, mucus
and excretory products which are expelled from
the living organism and not included in our
estimate of total organic matter. Bernard (1974)
estimated that for a mature Crassostrea gigas
reef, 0.05% of the potential food available (0.4%
of estimated assimilation) goes into shell pro-
tein matrix over the year. This protein matrix
production was equal to the amount of energy
excreted by the reef.
Energy dynamics studies of estuarine and
freshwater systems indicate that the majority of
molluscs utilize detritus, algae and phytoplank-
ton as energy sources. In return, the soft parts
of these organisms and their feces and pseudo-
feces supply energy and nutrients to both
aquatic and terrestrial carnivores and to the
microbial and detrital community. Within
aquatic systems the soft tissues and biodeposits
are recycled rapidly but a different situation
occurs for the organic matrix of molluscan
shells. Williams and Murdoch (1970) stated that
with one important exception all of the organic
matter produced in the estuarine eco-
system appears readily available to other
trophic levels. The exception is the organic ma-
trix of molluscan shells. There appears to be no
information on the ability of organisms, which
either ingest shell material or bore into shells,
to extract organic material from the shell, but it
is potentially available. In addition, burial in
the sediment of all or some of the organic mat-
ter contained in the shell would represent a
substantial drainage of organic matter from the
system since recycling of this organic matrix is
extremely slow.
