ORGANIC CONTENT OF SHELLS AND TISSUES OF MOLLUSCS
29
organic content of the shell of 10.6% using a
technique similar to the one we employed. Our
M. demissus data from New Jersey, Virginia,
North Carolina and Georgia, and data on M.
demissus granosissima from Florida, however,
indicate an average shell organic content of
5.5% (coefficient of variation of mean values of
7.9%), with a range in the five geographic sam-
ples of 6.1%. (New Jersey) to 4.6% (North Caro-
lina) (Table 2).
Ash-free dry weights of each component for
each species were summed and the percent of
the total represented by each component was
computed (Table 3). The percent of the total
represented by the meat component ranged
from 25.5% in Crassostrea to 87.0% in Tagelus
and averaged 62.3% for all species. Organic
matter contributed by the shell component
ranged from 12.2% for Argopecten irradians to
71.9% in Crassostrea and averaged 35.4% of the
total organic matter. That percent contributed
by pallial fluid averaged 4.9% and ranged from
2.6% of the total for Crassostrea to 9.1% for
Modiolus demissus collected from North Caro-
lina. For the three gastropod species analyzed,
the meats and shells contributed 64.1% and
35.9%; for pelecypods the mean contribution to
the total organic content by these components
was 62.0 and 38.0%, respectively.
The contribution by the meat and shell com-
ponents to the total organic content appeared
related to size. The contribution to the total by
the shells tended to increase with size whereas
the meat contribution decreased with increas-
ing size. For example, in Tagelus less than 5.1 g
wet weight, the shell contributed 10% of the
total and the meat 90%, whereas these compo-
nents contributed 16% and 84%, respectively, in
organisms between 15-25 g; for Modiolus
(North Carolina) the shell contributed 45% of
the total in organisms less than 20 g and 50% in
organisms 60-75 g, whereas the meat showed a
decreasing contribution with size. A final exam-
ple of this relation is in Crassostrea virgin ica in
which the shells of smaller organisms (less than
90 g) contributed 71% of the total and for orga-
nisms greater than 150 g the shell contribution
was 85%. These are only trends since there was
no statistical significance between size groups.
Data for Modiolus (Table 3) were analyzed to
determine if geographic location influenced the
proportion of the total organics contributed by
each of the three components. Analysis of vari-
ance of data indicated that there was a signifi-
