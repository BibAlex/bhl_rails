tailed petroleum hydrocarbon analyses were not
conducted, since they were available in this lab-
oratory through bioassay studies with other es-
tuarine species (Neff and Anderson, 1973; An-
derson, Neff, Cox, Tatem and Hightower, 1974).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Reliable TL 5 „ data were difficult to obtain in
these bioassay experiments because of the oys-
ters' tendency to cease pumping and close their
valves, as well as their ability to rapidly depur-
ate petroleum fractions. Results of the 96-hour
bioassays with the test oils and reference toxin
show the oysters' low sensitivity to these mate-
rials (Tables 1 and 2). The reference toxin, DSS,
consistently resulted in lower TL 50 values than
the four test oils, while oysters collected in late
fall showed greater resistance than summer-
collected test animals. In all bioassays, includ-
ing long-term studies (Table 3), #2 fuel and
Venezuela bunker C oils were most toxic, with
the two crude oils. South Louisiana and Ku-
wait, being considerably less toxic. Kuwait
crude demonstrated the lowest toxicity of the
petroleum hydrocarbons tested (Table 3).
Additional bioassays conducted with oysters
collected in winter months revealed a pattern of
increased resistance to test oils (Anderson,
1973). Again, this resistance was substantiated
by testing with the reference toxin. Winter oys-
ters also proved less sensitive to the standard
toxicant than did summer-collected specimens.
The water phase data for this study were
generated by Anderson (1973), Neff and Ander-
son (1973) and Anderson, Neff, Cox, Tatem and
Hightower (1974). These investigators reported

that the concentration of total hydrocarbons in
oil-water dispersions was a function of the
amount of oil added to the bioassay container.
They found that the concentration of total hy-
drocarbons derived from South Louisiana and
Kuwait crude oil increased linearly with the
amount of oil added. For South Louisiana and
Kuwait crude, the amount of oil in the water
phase ranged from approximately 16 to 80 ppm
for 0.01 to 10% oil added. For Kuwait crude, the
range was approximately 19 to 42 ppm for 0.01
to 10% oil added. Using #2 fuel oil, they found
