spat was begun to substantiate the results of
previous experiments on St. Croix and to com-
pare growth in other natural environments —
Long Island Sound, Virginia, Florida, and Salt
River Inlet. Presently, there are O. edulis in
only two of these locations — the St. Croix mari-
culture system and Greenport, Long Island.
Oysters sent to the Virginia Institute of Marine
Sciences (Michael Castagna, Eastern Shore
Laboratory) arrived in very poor condition and
died within a week. From Florida State Univer-
sity, R. Winston Menzel reported that the O.
edulis were in satisfactory condition on arrival
but died after being suspended in flowing sea
water. After 55 days, none of the O. edulis in
the Salt River Inlet population survived. Silta-
