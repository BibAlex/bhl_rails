distribution of geoducks, these clams in Puget
Sound exist in many temperature regimes.
SPAWNING
Histological methods
Spawning information was obtained from his-
tological examination of gonads from 124 speci-
mens collected by divers in several locations
from July 1968 to August 1969. Sections from
transverse slices from the gonads were pre-
served in Davidsons' fixative and prepared by
standard techniques of dehydrating in alcohol,
embedding in paraffin, and staining with Har-
ris' hematoxylin and eosin.
Sex ratio
Of the 124 geoducks studied, 58 were females
and 66 were males, virtually a 1:1 ratio (Table 1;
Fig. 1). None were observed with both sex prod-
ucts. They ranged in size from 65 to 198 mm
total shell length. Of the 29 which were less
than 120 mm, 15 were females and 14 were
males. This information suggests a lack of sex
reversal. Anderson (1971) found a ratio of males
to females of 51:3 in geoducks shorter than 100
mm, but concluded that they are gonochoristic
