the structural and biochemical integrity of the
oyster. It is natural that they should show the
least evidence of destructive metabolism. For
the first 125 days, the mantle and digestive
gland showed the greatest dry weight loss.
These two organs are generally considered the
major storage organs of the oyster. The diges-
tive gland showed the most rapid dry weight
loss. The early weight loss of the digestive gland
was probably accentuated by the presence of
undigested food in the stomach of the oysters
taken as the pre-starved sample. There was
considerable evidence of active shell layering in
the starved oysters. As mentioned previously
one of the visible effects of starvation was the
shrinkage of the mantle from the valve periph-
ery and the consequent layering of new shell
material. The gonad showed relatively little
weight loss during the early stages of starva-

tion. It was during this period that maturation
of the gonad was occurring. Evidently the abil-
ity of the gonad to ripen was not totally deterred
by the extreme conditions of starvation. The
degree to which gonadal maturation occurred
was considerably less than that occurring under
natural conditions at the same period. Oysters
were taken from North Humboldt Bay from the
same site from which the starved specimens
were originally collected. These oysters were
dissected and treated in the same manner as the
starved oysters. Comparable data on gonadal
development were thus obtained. Gonadal de-
velopment was considerably retarded in the
starved oysters (Table 6).
During the early stages of starvation the pro-
tein content of the gonad increased and the lipid
content remained constant (Table 4). This was
somewhat different from the response of the
other body components, (with the exception of
the gills) which exhibited decreases in all of
their energy reserves. The large decrease in the
carbohydrate reserve of the gonad concomitant
with the increase in protein suggests that the
material and energy for gonadal maturation
was drawn directly from the carbohydrate re-
serve of the gonad.
Carbohydrate was the most metabolized re-
serve in terms of grams utilized. If the utilized
amounts of carbohydrate, protein, and lipid
were completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and
