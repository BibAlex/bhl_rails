ter â€” as juveniles, densities greater than 25/ft-
were acceptable; at 40-mm length, 15 to 16/ft-,
and at 75-mm length, 7 to 8/ft 2 . Feeding the
oysters three species of diatoms on a rotating
schedule appeared to be adequate. Oxygen con-
centration in the shellfish tanks was kept at 5
ppt or greater.
The excellent growth of O. edulis in the artifi-
cial upwelling mariculture system can be attrib-
uted to the constant food supply, the deep water
source relatively free of particulate matter, and
the extended growing season.
Planned improvements in the supply of food
and management of the oysters in the artificial
upwelling system should further reduce the
time they require to reach market size.
