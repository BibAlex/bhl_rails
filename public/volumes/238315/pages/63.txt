In our experiments the sizes of clams, when
planted, was much greater than the sand-grain
size reported in Virginia. This larger size should
have lessened the clams' vulnerability to preda-
tors and the survival rate should have been
higher than that obtained for Virginia waters.
In conclusion, for commercial mariculture,
survival of planted clams must be at a profitable
level, which we judge to be not less than 509c.
Based on our observations in Florida, adequate
survival cannot be obtained with protective sub-
strate additives such as gravel and shell. Fenc-
ing, with constant attention to make certain
that predators do not gain entry, does give good
survival. This method is expensive and cheaper
and effective methods must be found before
clam mariculture will become financially re-
warding.
