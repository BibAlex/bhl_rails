reduce their metabolic rates and could well be
directly or indirectly lethal to most or all of
them. At other seasons and in other harbours
the discharge of ballast water might be less
shocking to organisms it contains.
The Twofold Bay study supports the often-
quoted conjecture of Peters and Panning (1933)
that ballast water is a vector for long-dustance
dissemination of aquatic organisms and may be
responsible for mysterious appearances of exotic
species.
Pacific oysters appeared mysteriously in New
Zealand recently (Dinamani, 1974) and may
have been introduced in this way because, ex-
cept for salinities, the tabulated data show that
ballast water conditions were close to optimum
for larvae of that species (Fujiya, 1970; Quayle,
1969).
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This study was assigned jointly to me and my
then colleague, Mr. E. A. Scribner (chemist), by
the Director of the Fisheries Branch of the New
South Wales Chief Secretary's Department in
which I was employed in 1972-73. I thank Mr.
Scribner for personal communication of data
and for helpful discussions of the draft of this
paper.

Wales State Fisheries, Sydney, N.S.W., Aus-
