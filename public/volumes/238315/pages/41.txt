those in the present study grew at a rather
constant rate for the entire 46 weeks. Therefore,
while the yearly growth of the oysters in our
system was comparable to or better than natu-
ral growth, the daily growth during the respec-
tive growing seasons was somewhat less than
natural growth.
Nevertheless, the results of the present study
show that it is unquestionably possible to grow
oysters in recirculating seawater systems on a
diet consisting solely of cultured phytoplankton.
There is no particular reason why this method
of culturing oysters must be conducted adjacent
to or even near a source of natural seawater.
The possibilities for mariculture of oysters at
inland sites is certainly not out of the question,
and in the least, our techniques allow the main-
tenance of filter-feeding marine bivalves at in-
land research facilities.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The authors wish to thank their colleagues
Dr. Richard Srna for providing the water qual-
ity analyses and Mr. Gary Pruder for oversee-
ing the design and construction of the culture
system. Mr. Dennis Logan, Mr. Andrew Marin-
ucci, and Mr. Robert Flaak fed the animals on
weekends while Ms. Christine Turk and Mr.
Earl Greenhaugh were responsible for the daily
maintenance of the shellfish and algae over the
46 weeks of the experiment. Dr. Ellis Bolton
provided light intensity measurements.
