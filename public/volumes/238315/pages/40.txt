The algae used in this study were chosen
because of their wide taxonomic variety and
because they had been shown to have some
utility as foods for oysters in other studies
(Goodrich et al., 1968). While it is impossible to
make any statistical inference concerning the
relative food-value of the individual algal spe-
cies used in the experiment, it can be seen that
Carteria chuii was a component of the diets fed
to both of the fastest growing groups, and it
makes up fully half (in terms of numbers of
cells) of the composition of Diet B which pro-
duced second fastest growth. Since Phaeodac-
tylum tricornutum, which makes up the other
half of Diet B, is undoubtedly a poor food, it can
be inferred that Carteria chuii is one of the
more important components of the diets tested.
This is further substantiated by the fact that
Isochrysis galbana. when combined with
Phaeodactylum tricornutum, alone, promoted
significantly slower growth than any of the
diets containing Carteria chuii and that Croom-
onas salina, when combined with Phaeodac-
tylum tricornutum alone, produced slower
growth than any diet other than the one-part
Phaeodactylum tricornutum diet.
Animals in the fastest growing group reached
a mean shell height of slightly greater than 27
mm after 46 weeks of growth. This compares
favorably with growth of oysters in natural wa-
ters of the Middle Atlantic region during their
first growing season. Shaw (1966) indicated that
oysters which set in Broad Creek, Maryland,
during the summer of 1960, had reached a mean
shell height of about 25 mm by May, 1961, and
Beaven (1952) reported that oysters from sev-
eral Maryland locations in the Chesapeake Bay
reached a shell height of about 30 mm by the
beginning of their second growing season.
Maurer and Aprill (1973) found that hatchery-
reared spat grown in off-bottom culture in var-
ious rivers in Delaware reached a mean shell
height of between 10 and 20 mm (depending on
location) by the beginning of their second grow-
ing season. It must be pointed out, however,
that those animals living in nature grew only
during the warmer months of the year while
