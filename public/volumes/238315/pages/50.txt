tion was suspected as the cause of death in the
Florida and in the Salt River Inlet populations.
In July 1974, the oysters in Greenport, New
York (Paul Chanley, Shelter Island Oyster
Company) averaged 44 mm; in June 1974, the O.
edulis in the St. Croix mariculture operation
averaged 69 mm in length (Fig. 3). Marketable
adults were obtained after 12 months in the
mariculture operation; mortality in this experi-
ment was 24.3%.
CONCLUSION
Due to improved handling techniques for op-
timization of growth, each successive batch of
O. edulis grown in the St. Croix system at-
tained market size in a shorter period of time
(Fig. 4). The food and oxygen requirements and
growth densities were established for the O.
edulis grown in the St. Croix mariculture sys-
tem. Densities varied with the size of the oys-
