the greatest amount of filtration. However, the
rate of filtration and the percentage assimila-
tion were inversely related between the me-
dium and high algal concentration (Fig. 2).
Table 1 summarizes the various aspects of
energy partitioning in the oyster. The mean
assimilation efficiency obtained from the three
food concentrations was 67.6%.
Students' 't test (Sokal and Rholf, 1969) was
performed on data comparing the three food
concentration levels with one another for each
part of the energy budget (Table 2). The nota-
tion A-B, A-C, and B-C was the mean of calories
cleared; for example, at a concentration of 1.0 x
10 5 cell/ml (A) when compared with calories
cleared at concentration 5.0 x 10 4 cell/ml (B),
etc., there were significant differences for the
