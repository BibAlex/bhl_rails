ORGANIC CONTENT OF SHELLS AND TISSUES OF MOLLUSCS
27
organic production from the system since utili-
zation and breakdown of the organic matrix
appears extremely slow.
Numerous fish species feed upon molluscs.
These fishes may be able to decalcify some of the
shell material, and its organic matrix might
serve as a source of energy. This aspect of en-
ergy exchange and the whole concept of organic
matrix availability in molluscan shells have re-
ceived little attention.
Since pelecypods and gastropods form a sig-
nificant part of the biomass and food web in
estuarine systems (Thayer, Adams and La-
Croix, 1975; Price, Thayer and Montgomery
1974), and since the organic matrix of the shells
constitutes a significant portion of this biomass,
the invertebrate studies being carried out at the
Atlantic Estuarine Fisheries Center includes
analyses of the organic matrix of shells (Thayer
et al. 1973). This paper presents the results of
analyses on the contribution of molluscan
shells, meats and, in some cases, pallial fluid, to
the total organic content of several estuarine
molluscs.
METHODS
We determined the organic content of 14 spe-
cies of pelecypods, including one species (Modi-
olus demissus) from four geographic areas and
one subspecies (M. d. granosissima), and three
species of gastropods (Table 1). In most cases, 50
individuals of each species were analyzed sepa-
rately. Small molluscs, however, were not
treated separately. Each individual was
scrubbed with a soft brush to remove attached
organisms. On some of the larger bivalves, the
pallial fluid was collected by draining for ap-
proximately two minutes during shucking. The
organisms were shucked and separated into
shell, meat and pallial fluid components.
Gastropod shells also were scrubbed with a
soft brush to remove encrusting organisms,
after which the gastropods were frozen at -20°
C until analysis. After thawing, the meats of
Ilyanassa were pulled gently from the shell.
The soft tissues of Littorina and Urosalpinx,
however, were removed by air pressure after a
small hole had been drilled in the apex of the
shell.
The shell and meat of all specimens were
blotted on filter paper and wet weights of the
three components — shell, meat and pallial
fluid — was obtained. These components were
dried to a constant weight at 100° C and
weighed. The organic content of each compo-
nent was estimated from loss of weight upon
