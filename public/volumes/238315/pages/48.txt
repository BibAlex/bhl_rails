anoff and Davis (1963) report that 18°-20°C is
optimal for the setting of O. edulis. Throughout
the larval study, no antibiotics were added to
the standing larval culture.
In October 1972, an experiment designed to
compare the growth of O. edulis (8-mm juve-
niles) in a controlled environment (the artificial
upwelling mariculture operation) to growth in
an uncontrolled natural environment (Salt
River Inlet, see Table 1) was started. The O.
edulis in the mariculture operation reached 75
mm in length in 10 months; after 82 days no O.
edulis survived in the Salt River Inlet popula-
tion (Fig. 2). Land run-off caused by heavy rains
increased the silt content of Salt River Inlet.
The oysters were covered with 10-20 mm of silt
in their trays; this was believed to be the cause
of the 100% mortality. During these rains, the
salinity in Salt River Inlet reached a low of
33.7%o . However, fouling by sponges and algae
was heavy and predators (crabs and drills, Mu-
rex pornum Gmelin and Murex brevifrons La-
marck) were present.
Mortality for the batch of oysters grown in the
controlled environment was 81%. This in-
creased mortality (first experiment was 19%)
can be attributed to the saturated NaCl-dip
given to this batch to remove infestations of the
bryozoan, Bowerbankia gracilis Leidy. The
shellfish were placed in a saturated salt solution
(300 gm NaCl per liter of sea water) immedi-
ately after they were removed from the shellfish
tanks. After one minute in the vigorously aer-

ated salt dip, the shellfish were air-dried for one
hour. On two occasions, however, the oysters
were out of water almost an hour before the salt
treatment and several days later high mortali-
ties occurred. The total mortality for this exper-
imental batch was 35% if the percent mortality
reported is corrected for the deaths caused by
the salt treatments. These oysters were checked
for possible disease and/or pathogenic bacteria
and nothing was found.
