ashing at 475 ± 5° C for 36 hr. This temperature
is sufficient to oxidize organic carbon to carbon
dioxide but will not break down carbonate com-
pounds (Paine 1964, 1966).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The percentages of organic matter in the total
dry weight of the shell, meat and pallial fluid of
the species analyzed are shown in Table 2.
Meats are largely organic matter, ranging from
67.2% organic matter for Ilyanassa obsoleta to
93.9% for Rangia cuneata and averaging 80.9%
for all species. The shell material contained an
average 4.3% organic matter and ranged from
1.4% of the shell of Argopecten irradians to
21.4% for shells of Solemya velum. The pallial
fluid was intermediate in organic content, aver-
aging 30.9% and ranged from 20.0% for Crassos-
trea virginica to 60.2% for Rangia cuneata. The
organic content of shells and meats of pelecy-
pods averaged 4.6% and 79.5%, respectively,
and that of gastropods averaged 3.0% and
77.8%, respectively.
Shell and meat organic content appears re-
lated to age or size of the organisms, and since a
wide range of sizes were used for each species,
this relation was in part responsible for the
variation observed for each species. The percent
organic matter in the shell tended to be greater
for small individuals and least for larger orga-
nisms, whereas the reverse was true for the
meat component. Casual observation also sug-
gested that the smaller the percent organic con-
tent of the shell the more brittle is the shell.
There are few data available in the literature
on the organic content of the shell component of
molluscs. Vinogradov (1953) noted that the or-
ganic content of pelecypods generally varies
from 0.1-4.0% of the shell and that they gener-
ally have more organic matter in their shell
than do gastropods. For example, the organic
content of the shell of Pecten varius reportedly
is 0.7% and that of Mytilus edulis is 3.9% (Vino-
gradov 1953); Bernard (1974) reported a shell
organic content of 2% for Crassostrea gigas. Our
data (Table 2) agree with Vinogradov's data on
the range of organic content of shell and indi-
cate that the organic content of the shells of the
pelecypods we analyzed was greater than that of
gastropod shells (4.6% vs. 3.0%). Vinogradov
also noted that estuarine and marine molluscs
have a higher organic content in their shell
than do freshwater molluscs. Kuenzler (1961),
studying the energetics of Modiolus demissus
in a Georgia salt marsh, obtained an average
