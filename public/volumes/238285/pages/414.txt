FIRE-PROOF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION.

half inches. It will be observed that for the same reason as in beam
construction, and as before explained, the iron rods for re-enforcing
were placed near the bottom of the work, so as to resist the tensional
stresses due to the load, while that due to compression in the upper

portion would be sustained by the beton alone. In this manner, and
by this process, over thirteen thousand square feet of flooring and
roofing were constructed in the building.
The only test of any consequence upon the combined strength of
the floors and beams together was made on a section of the widest
floor in the house, where the beams are eighteen feet span and six feet
between centers. Casks of plaster were placed upon the floor over the
beam, forming a triangular load of thirty tons, which was sustained
â– without any injury to the floor, or measurable permanent deflection.
The dimensions of the beam that sustained this load were, seven by
sixteen inches, and eighteen feet span, re-enforced in its lower portion
with a seven-inch I-beam, weighing fifty-five pounds to the yard.
This test indicates that in addition to its admitted fire-resisting
qualities, the re-enforced system of construction challenges comparison
with other methods of building in matters of strength and of cost,
whether for buildings requiring long or short floor-spans.
