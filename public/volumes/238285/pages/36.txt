MICROSCOPIC LIFE IN THE AIR.

and diminishes their nutritive properties. To obviate this, we must
find means to sterilize the liquids without heating them. Filtration
has been employed, and a number of adaptations of apparatus have
been devised- by means of which this object is accomplished satisfac-
torily.
In order to study the germs in the air, we must not only possess a
sensitive and wholly pure liquid, but must have means of arranging it
for the cultivation of the organisms, under such circumstances that
we may be sure it shall contain no germs except those that are de-
rived from the air we introduce for the experiment. IVfM. Chamber-
land and Miquel have employed simple apparatus which seem to effect
this purpose perfectly.

If the experiments are made with rain-water, to ascertain the num-
ber of germs it collects in passing through the air, it may sometimes
happen that, when a determined volume of water is evenly distributed
in a considerable number of the cultivation-tubes, only a part of the
tubes will become troubled. Generally, it may be said that if the
water contains as the average one bacterium per cubic centimetre,
