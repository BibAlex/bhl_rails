tools ; but by abridging a little the numher
of daily recitations and adding an hour to
the usual school-day, they find time for
drawing and tool-work. Besides the usual
literary training, the students are given a
course of tool-instruction, including carpen-
try, wood-turning, forging, soldering, and
bench and machine work in iron, for which
shops are conveniently fitted up, and free-
hand and mechanical drawing. Each pupil
before receiving a diploma must execute a
project — the actual construction of a ma-
chine, with a full set of working drawings
— satisfactory to the faculty. By the pecul-
iar course pursued, the zeal and enthusiasm
of the students, in all the departments of
the work, have been developed to a most
gratifying extent.
