THE EAILKOAD PROBLEM m THE UMTED STATES.
Bt GEORGE ILES.
GEORGE STEPHEXSON, in October, 1829, made his memorable
journey in the Rocket over the Rainhill trial course ; the next
year the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was opened, and soon
every civilized nation adopted the new method of locomotion. In the
United States a variety of circumstances have concurred to make the
railways the most extensive, the most economical in working, and the
most influential in the world. The immense area of the country, the
small value of most of the land required for the roads, the easy grades
marked out by the great water-courses of the continent, and the broad
prairie-sweeps, conjoined with the ease and cheapness of obtaining
charters, make American railroads but one third as costly in construc-
tion as those of Great Britain and the European Continent, and much
less expensive in operation. On this side of the Atlantic railways are
built with embankments, culverts, bridges, and tunnels, much less
elaborate and substantial than those of England and France. The re-
quirement here is not the best but usually the cheapest thing that will
serve. This is one of the reasons among others why American freight
charges are the lowest in the world. In 1881 the average cost of mov-
ing a ton of freight a mile was 1'66 cent in France, 1*5 cent in Bel-
gium, and but 0-9 cent in the United States. The railways of the
Union are now 114,000 miles in extent, and construction proceeds at
the rate of thirty miles a day. The aggregate capital of tlie lines is
$6,500,000,000, one eighth the valuation of all kinds of property in the
country, according to the best estimates.
Less than fifty years ago, within the clear recollection of men now
living who were then actively engaged in business, the great problem
was, how soon the country could be provided with railroads. Far-
