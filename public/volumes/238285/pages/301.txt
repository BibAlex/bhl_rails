then, is the liistory of this movement? Fifty years ago, the foreign
clement in Xew England was very small. In Massachusetts the census
reports that in 1830 it was only 9,6:20, and increased as follows : In
1840 it was 34,818; 1850, 104,448; 1800, 260,114; 1870, 357,319;
and 1880, 443,402.
It should be borne in mind that these figures represent only the
" foreign-born," and not their children or descendants, which would
greatly increase the number. In the other New England States the
whole foreign element combined is not so large as that in Massachu-
setts, and has not increased so fast. In Maine, in 1850, it numbered
31,450, and in 1880 it was 58,883 ; in New Hampshire in 1850, 13,571,
and in 1880, 40,294 ; in Vermont, 1850, 32,931, and 1880, 40,959 ; in
Rhode Island, 1850, 23,111, and in 1880, 73,993 ; and in Connecticut,
1850, 37,473, and in 1880. 129,992. The whole number of foreign-
born in New England, reported by the census of 1880, was 793,122, and
360,649 of these emigrated from Ireland.
The census reports the whole population of New England, born in
the United States, as 3,234,317, but large numbers reported here as
natives are of foreign descent. It is impossible here to draw the line,
but, from the best evidences before us, we should say there must be
about half as many in this class as that of the foreign-born, which
would increase the foreign element to 1,200,000 in New England. It
may be larger. The " Catholic Directory " six years ago stated that
there were at that time 890,000 souls in New England connected with
that church, and the number must have since considerably increased.
Then, of the 793,122 reported by the census " foreign-born,'' there must
be a large number of Protestants â€” being over 100,000 emigrants from
England and Scotland. The same organ also six years ago stated that
" nearly 25 per cent of the population of New England is composed of
Roman Catholics." The census reports the whole population of New
England as 4,027,439 in 1880. At the present time (1883) the foreign
element must number over 1,200,000 persons in New England.
But it is quite imequally distributed. In Massachusetts, Connecti-
cut, and Rhode Island, it numbers more than a third of the population ;
but in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, it is not one quarter.
As the birth-rate of this class is more than twice as large as the Amer-
ican, the foreign element will constantly gain in numbers upon the
American.
Connected with this large addition to our population composed
of a different people in race, type, and character, there are several
points that deserve careful consideration. A few years ago it was
thought that emigration from Ireland would very much diminish, if
not cease, but of late it has taken a new start, and may again flour-
ish. Emigration from England and Scotland is sure to continue ; so
also from the British Provinces and Canada. But this foreign element
is destined to increase hereafter more by births than by immigration.
