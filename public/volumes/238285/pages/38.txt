MICROSCOPIC LIFE IN THE AIR.

the only means of discovering the nature of the organisms, for char-
acteristics deduced from their shape are of no significance. Most fre-
quently they can be distinguished only by the fermentations they
produce. Numerous experiments based on this principle will be re-
quired for the exact determination of the bacteria in the atmosphere.
In the present condition of the science, we have to limit ourselves to
the general statistics of the Micrococci, Vibrios, Bacteria, Bacilli,
and Cladothrices that live in the air, without undertaking to classify
in any precise way all the beings comprehended under each of these
denominations.
The observations conducted at the Observatory of Montsouris show
that there are on the average eighty bacteria in a cubic metre of air.
The highest number was observed in the fall, the lowest in the winter.
There were found fifty bacteria in December and January, only thirty-
three in February, one hundred and five in May, fifty in June, and one
hundred and seventy in October. The diagrams of daily observations

show that the number of spores of these algae increases with the tem-
perature. Inversely to what takes place in the case of the molds, the
number of the schizophytes, small in rainy weather, rises when all the
moisture has disappeared from the surface of the soil. The counter-
action of moisture is stronger than the direct action of temperature ;
and this fact accounts for the rarity of the bacteria after the great
rains of February, April, and June. Still a long period of dry weather
does not appear to be favorable to the development of the plants.
