Macbeth when bracing up his courage for the " dreadful deed,"
promises Lady Macbeth —
"Ere the bat hath flown
His cloister'd flight ; ere to black Hecate's summons
The shard-borne beetle, with his drowsy hums,
Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
A deed of dreadful note." — Macbeth, in., 2.
" Shard " appears to have been a common term, for we find the
friend of Mark Antony images the close unity of the Triumvirs
when he speaks of Lepidus —
" They are his shards and he their beetle."
Antonu and Cleojiatra, iii., 4.
Again Belarius in the mountains of Wales in voicing his love of
the wild freedom and the healthy pleasure there is in danger, says —
" Often to our comfort do we find
The sharded beetle in a safer hold
Than is the full-wing'd eagle." — Cijinhelinc, iii., 3.
Not that ''shard" always has this meaning, for it occurs in its
primitive English significance — a piece of broken tile — when the
priest says of Ophelia —
" Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her."
Hamlet, v., 1.
There is some ambiguity in the wording put by the poet into the
mouth of Isabel imaging her fear for Claudio in prison and in
expectation of death — •
" The poor beetle that we tread upon
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
As when a giant dies." — Measure for Measure, iii., 1.
It would appear at first that the ancient view that insects suffered
pain was here voiced, but like many a text divorced from its context,
a wrong impression is produced. Close students of Shakspere years
ago pointed out that there were few instances of a more complete
perversion of the meaning of a poetical quotation by omission of the
context than in this passage. The lines preceding the passage
quoted —
" Oh ! I do fear thee, Claudio ; and I quake.
Lest thou a feverous life should'st entertain,
And six or seven winters more respect
Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die ?
The sense of death is most in apprehension ;"
