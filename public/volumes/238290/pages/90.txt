considered as a form of hyperantits, previously dealt with by him
(I.e., p. 195). (" If it be included here at all it must be as a var."
J. W. Tutt in lit.).
In 1781, Barbut, in his famous work " Genera Insectorum of
Linnaeus," used hyperantus as the British exponent of the Festivi
section of the Danai group of the Linnsean Papilio.
In 1783, Retzius, in his " Genera et Species Insectorum " of de
Geer, re-named the species as Papilio tristan (p. 38) giving as a
synonym Linneus' name hyperantus.
In 1799 (?), Hiibner, in " Sammlung Europaischer Schmetterlinge,"
jBgured Papilio polymeda (172,173), and in 1806 gave the text
referring to the figures (p. 28) indicating fig. 173 as the form
arete which he wrongly ascribed to Schneider, " Systematische
Beschreibung," p. 102 (1787).
In 1801, Schrank, in his "Fauna Boica " (vol. ii., pt. 1), placed
hyperant{h)ns in his second group in a comprehensive genus, diag-
nosed in some detail, Maniola.
Our own Haworth, in 1803, in " Lepidoptera Britannica " (vol.
i., p. 14), gives the typical form and refers to a form "alls utraque
inocellatis vel punctis obscuris loco ocellorum," i.e., the form arete
of Miiller. This is our first reference of its being found in Britain.
In 1805, Latreille, in his " Histoire Naturelle, g^nerale et par-
ticuliere des Crustaces et des Insectes " of Buffon's works, placed
hyperant{h)us in his Satyri section of the very "omnibus" genus
Ny^nphalix.
In 1807, in " Illiger's Magazin," (vol. vi., p. 277, etc.), appeared
a long article on the Classification of the Butterflies and Sphingids,
giving the new genera proposed by Fabricius in his " Systema
Glossatorum " (unpublished), and by Latreille in his "Histoire
Naturelle." In this article hyperant{h)us is placed in the genus
Hipparchia.
In 1810, Latreille, in his " Considerationes Generales " (pp. 355
and 440), proposed the genus Satyrus, but did not indicate all the
species it embraced until 1819 in his article in the " EncyclopMie
Methodique." Here he put hyperant{k)us in his section H of the
comprehensive genus Satyrus.
Previous to this inclusion in Satyrus Hiibner had issued his
famous " Verzeichniss bekannter Schmetterlinge," in 1816, and
there described the genus Knodia (p. 61), placing in it the three
species andromache, dejanira, and hyperanthe (polymeda, Scop.)
(hyprant{h)us, L.).
In the same year, 1816, Dalman published a " Systematic
