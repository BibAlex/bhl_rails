are distinctly more pointed." He goes into considerable more
minnte detail. [Tutt remarked on this author, " Fuchs, is on the
whole, one too many for me," in lit.]
In 1892 Staudinger, in the " Memoires Romanoff" (vol. vi., p,
206), described the hypcrantus-iorm from the Amur district of Asia,
as a»nireiisis, a much larger form, in which the wings are consider-
ably widened. In "Cat.," ed. iii., 1901, he afterwards acknowledged
that this was identical with the ocellatus of Butler.
In 1895 J. W. Shipp, in the " Entomologist " (vol. xxviii., p. 17) r
described the form figured in 1893 by R. South (vol. xxvi., p. 281),
and named it lanceolata. The chief points in it are — " Upper
surface, hindwings with four similar ocellated lanceolate spots,"
"in one or two instances produced to a point." "Underside,
forewings with two large semi-lanceolate ocellated spots," "hind-
wings with five lanceolate ocellated spots," etc.
In 1896, Tutt, in his " British Butterflies ; Hedgerow Series "
(p. 412), introduced a form obsoleta, " with no trace of ocellated
spots."
In 1908, Seitz, in " Alacrolepidoptera of the World. Palfearctia
Fauna" (vol. i., p. 137), described and figured the following two
forms of hyperajitna; (1) arctica, a small form from the highest
north, and (2) cenlrifera, the form with the white eye-centres, i.e.,
small rings filled in with white dots often visible on the upperside
as well.
[I have endeavoured to find out the origin of the aberrant
spelling, which one occasionally meets, of hyperantus as hypemnthes^
but without success so far. — H.J.T.]
In 1903 the Rev. G. Wheeler, in his " Butterflies of Switzer-
land " (pp. 115-116), gave the direction of the variation obtainable'
in hyperanthiis as follows : —
{a) Great diminution of size, e.g., ab. minor, ab. arctica.
(h) Loss of eye-spots, e.g., ab. arete, ab. ccEca, ab. obsoleta.
(c) Number of eye-spots. See Stephens' " 111. Brit. Ent.," I., 60,
(of) Arrangement of eye-spots, e.g., ab. vidua, ab. octocidata.
(e) Shape of eye-spots, e.g., ab. lanceolata.
(/) Presence or absence of eye-spots upper side.
(g) Traces of transverse lines on underside, v. rarely.
During the subsequent debate other lines of aberration were
instanced as follows : —
(h) Occurrence of a band on the under side of the hindwing.
{i) Presence of white points in the upper side eye-spots.
