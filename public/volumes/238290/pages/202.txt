end of the mine from which a portion of the leaf had been cut to
form a flat circular case, the pupa being secured between the two
surfaces of the leaf. The case when completed was separated and
fell to the ground.
3. The beautiful open network cocoon of the Micro-lepidopteron,
Chrywcortjs festaliella, an anomalous species which systematists had
placed in various positions in the lists. It was attached to a rose leaf.

" Although the latter days of March had been so inclement, the 1st
