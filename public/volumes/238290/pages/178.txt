When, like the bee, tolling from every flower
The virtuous sweets,
Our thighs are packed with wax, our mouths with honey ;
We bring it to the hive ; and, like the bees.
Are murder'd for our pains." — 2 Henry IV., iv., 4.
Even up to our own times this killing of the bees to obtain the
honey was practiced. The poet more than once shows his objection
to this useless method by the terms he used, as when Talbot
describes the method of the " witch " Joan of Arc in repulsing the
British troops —

That Shakspere appreciated the differing characters of bee and
wasp we know from various passages.
When the spirits before Prospero's cell discuss the ways of Venus,
Cupid is described as —

reconciled to his former bosom friend Cassius, he protests that
henceforth —
" I'll use you for my mirth ; yea, for my laughter.
When you are waspish." — JkUks Caesar, iv. 3.
So also in the wooing of Katherine —
" Pet. Come, come, you wasp, i' faith you are too angry.
Kath. If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
Pet. My remedy is then to pluck it out.
R(tth. Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.
Pet. Who knows not where a wasp doth wear his sting ?
In his tail." — Tamiiuj of the S/irew., ii., 1.

When the wretched Queen Tamore urges her sons to murder she
