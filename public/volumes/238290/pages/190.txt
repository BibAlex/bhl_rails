ABSTRACT OF PROCEEDINGS.
FEBRUARY 10th, 1916.
Ml. Hy. J. Turner, F.E.S., President, in the chair.
Mr. Stanley Edwards exhibited a fasciated branch of the ash
tree from Blackheath, obtained by Dr. Ofenheim.
Mr. L. W. Newman exhibited a spray of hawthorn in almost full
leaf, and also the fully opened catkins of willow. He stated that
he had on the previous day seen quite fully 50 bushes of sallow in
full bloom in the N. Kent area. Mr. Newman also showed a
gynandromorphous specimen of Polygonia c-alhnni and pointed out
that the sexes differed in size, contour of the outer margins of the
wings, and also in the markings of the undersides. These differ-
ences were quite apparent in the exhibit.
Mr. Turner stated he had examined all records of gynandro-
raorphs up to a recent date and as far as he had ascertained the
example was unique. Mr. Frohawk confirmed this opmion.
Mr. Sperring exhibited aberrations of Ari/i/nnis adippe and Auimpha
popnli. The A. udippe was taken at Swinley, during the Field Meet-
ing in 1915, and had an enlargement and coalescence of the black
spots crossing the disc of the fore wings. The A. popidi had the large
inner-marginal blotch on the hindwing of a bright orange-red
colour instead of dull brick-red.
Mr. C. B. Williams exhibited some very good coloured drawings,
magnified about 30 diameters, of the larvas of two British species of
Neuroptera, Cuniopterijx tineifonais and Seiiiidalis olenrodiformis.
These larviP are predaceous and feed on young scale insects, mites,
and eggs of insects and spiders. The drawings were made by
Mr. H. J. Osterstock.
Mr. Hugh Main exhibited one of his observation cages in which
he was rearing the larvfe of the Coleopteron (leotrnpes apinvjer from
â€¢ova. He stated that many of his observations were absolutely at
variance with those published by the late M. Jules Fabre.
