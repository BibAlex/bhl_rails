the time taken to perform the different operations', etc. ; but I must
postpone the record of them till after further observations and
confirmations of some of the notes already made. In the meantime
I hope that others may take the opportunity of making some of the
cages and watching these most fas'cinating insects for themselves.
Although the beetles are carrying out the lowly work of scavengers,
their work is a most important one, a? they convey large quantities
of obnoxious matter below the surface of the soil, much being
abandoned by the insects during the time when they are engaged
upon feeding and not ovipositing, and so serving as a fertiliser.
Their habits and mode of work make them appear to be endowed
with many virtues and much intelligence. A good deal has been
written about them by Fabre in which speculation however plays a
large part. His votaries did not show him the insect actually
engaged on much of their work, but his assiduit}- and devotion in
recording in most delightful language his observations and specula-
tions make his works an inspiration to many besides his own
countrymen. It is not sufhcient however for one to be satisfied
with reading about things which can be seen for oneself in ones
own immediate neighbourhood, hence the evolving of the
" Observation, cages," and these notes.
