The afternoon was extremely hot, and some of the party indulged
in a paddle in one of the numerous ponds deserted by the
brickmakers, much to the disgust of a water vole which sought
refuge in flight.
Among the Heterocera the following species were reported. â€”
Zyyitna trifolii (a form intermediate between the large palustris
form and the small chalk hill form, including several nice confluent
specimens which are as a rule of much less common occurrence in

many parts of England. The chief type of variation was the
