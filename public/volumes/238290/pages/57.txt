Ischnoptera natalensis, Wlk. — One imported to Kew Gardens.
Nauphoeta brazzse, Bolivar. — Four imported into Kew Gardens,
October 18th, 1898. (Figured in " Kew Wild Fauna and Flora,"
VI.)
Nauphoeta cinerea, Oliv. — One imported to Kew Gardens,
April, 1901. One exhibited at S. Lond. Ent. and Nat. Hist. Soc,
September 9th, 1909, as N. circunn-anans by H. Main — no doubt
this species. (Figured in " Kew Wild Fauna and Flora," VI.)
As there seems little likelihood of any of these casuals establishing
themselves in the British Isles, their occurrence here is quite un-
important, and their names should not be added to the list of our
Orthoptera.
