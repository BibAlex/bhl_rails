the larva of /-. me<jera is elongated, villose, with two short points
at the tail, and the pupa is short, thick, with small angular points,
and two points at the head ; it is suspended by the tail. The
chrysalis of L. iiiaera, according to M. Marloy, is suspended by the
tail in the open air ; it is naked and angular with two points on the
head, and with broad brown bands on the wing-covers. This genus
corresponds with the first section of Hipparchia, of Curtis and
Stephens, and with Dnponchel's fifth group, Vicu-tden, the species
being said to occur in the neighbourhood of habitations. Stephens
more correctly states that they frequent woods, lanes, and highways.
They form Hubner's two groups I'arann' and Ih'ra."
In 1840, Boisduval brought out another "Ind. Meth.," in which
he much subdivided the genus Sati/rus, including under "oculi
hirti," cli/iiie)U', roxelaiia, iiiaera, hiera, )iie[/era, oeitcria (and var.
.rijihia), and dejanira {achine).
In 1813 Herrich-Schaeffer, " Sys. Bearb. Schm. Eur.," vol. i.,
spelled the genus Farania, possibly copying Heydenreich, " Verz.,"
and included the same species.
Duponchel. in 1844, "Cat. Meth. Lep.,"' used S«^//n/.s in the same
sense as Boisduval, much dividing it into sections.
In 1850 Stephens, "Cat. Lep. B. M.," restricted his former
extended use of Hipparchia for all the Satyrids to comprise only
seiiii'le,ja)iiia&ndtithoitiis. He adopted the genus Lasinnnnata oi
Westwood for cwiieria and )iiei/i'ra.
In 1850 Doubieday, Westwood and Hewitson, " Gen. Diur. Lep.,"
vol. ii., p. 885, in a very elaborate way, redescribed the genus
Lasioiimiata and made it very comprehensive, including the follow-
ing somewhat heterogeneous mass of species : dimenc, roxelana,
niacra, Iiiera [li/!<sa), iiiei/era {tt'.(/eliiis), aef/eria, xipliia, tiejaiiii a =^ achine,
cfersinanni, schakra, cordace, satriciis, montrollii, vlenuion [.■), zac-
liaeits (/), uiernpe, phileynpe, bcntksia, Jiobartia, arhanta {.-), simja (''),
abcoua (/), latltoniella (/), and making it an omnibus genus to cover
/)//•(/, I'ararije, Epini'jdiele and F.noilia of Iliib. Some of the above
specie.s were included doubtfully, and in fact the last thirteen have
been since definitely and properly removed from Lasionnnata in
which they were certainly misplaced.
In 1852 Lederer, ''Verb, zool.-bot. Ver. Wien.," used LUuaiija for
aeijeria, nici/era, etc., copying the spelling of Herrich-Schaeft'er, etc.
In 1856 Herrich-Schilfter, "Sys. Bearb.," vol. i. and vi., p. 3
(Verz.), still spelt Hiibncr's genus as I'arartja, and arranged the
species thus : —
1 . (h'/aiiira = achiitr.
II. 1. A. rb/inene (var. rtKcandra) and roxdniia.
B. (a) {ti;/diiis), hiaera (var. adraxta), and ineffera.
(b) hiera.
2. aeijeria, meone and xiphia.
