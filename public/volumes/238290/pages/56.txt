Quite a number of species of Cockroaches have occurred in Britain
casually. Those mentioned below probably do not exhaust the list.
It is quite possible that in some cases the identification is not
absolutely reliable.
Nyctibora holosericea, Kl. — One taken at Covent Garden, July
6th, 1897, figured in "Entom.," 1900, p. 3. Probably an immature
specimen of the same species, brought to Mr. W. Daws of Mansfield,
April, 1908. One captured at Kew, June, 1904. One from Ship
Canal, Manchester, exhibited at Lanes, and Ches. Ent. Soc, March
19th, 1906.
Nyctibora brunnea, Thunb. — From Bradford Market, Yorkshire
(" Naturalist," March, 1909, p. 113).
Blat&a melanocephala, ? . — Exhibited at Entom. Soc. Lond.,
April 5th, 1869, as having been found destructive in orchid-houses
in this country ("Ent. Mo. Mag.," 1869, p. 302) [ = ? L. snrinawensis,
W.J.L.] .
Stylopyga decorata, Brunner. — One, Worksop, March 20th,
1902. One, Nat. Hist. Museum, November 16th, 1907— so named
by Kirby ; but Burr calls it Dorylea rlwmhifolia (see " Proc. Ent.
Soc. Lend.," November 20th, 1907).
Rhyparobia mtideraB, Fabr.— This species often occurs, but
always casually. There is no suspicion of its becoming naturahsed.
Captures have been too frequent to enumerate.
Blabera gigantea, Linn.- — This very large cockroach, called the
"Drummer" in the VVest Indies, has been taken in Liverpool Docks
(" Entom," 1899, p. 139), West India Docks (" Entom," 1896, p.
161), and at Bradford in Yorkshire (" Naturalist," 1897, p. 26).
Blabera cubensis, S.— Two at Oxford, August 16th, 1906, and
September 2nd, 1906 (A. H. Hamm).
Panchlora exoleta, Klug. — Three mstances have been noted: —
one at Coalville, Leicestershire, June, 1902 ; one at Maxwelltown,
Dumfries, 1902 ; and at Mansfield, Notts, October 25th, 1906.

ber 21st, 1905. (5) Warrington, Lancashire. (6) Hoylake, Cheshire,
August 9th, 1906. (7) Warrington, November, 1907. (8) One
exhibited at Entom. Soc. Lond., May 6th, 1908 (the last probably).

Ches. Ent. Soc, March 2 1st, 1904 ; occasionally imported mto Edin-
burgh (Evans); Romsey, May 3rd, 1901. (Of the last two the identi-
