ANNUAL ADDRESS TO THE MEMBERS
OF THE
Soutb ITonbou (l-ntomo|ogital uub llaturiii .^istor];
Society.
Read January '2oth, 1917.
By Hy. J. Turner, F.E.S.
IT is usual for the member, whom you annually select to preside
over your meetings for the year, to give in the Address, which
the Bye-laws state that he shall make, a few words on the
state and progress of the Society. As you have already had a more
or less detailed report of this from the Council I need only say that
all our activities have been l^ept going and even our field-meetings
have been successful. There is however one other item of our
work, which I cannot pass over, and that is the admirable volume
of Proceedings which the Society has published, probably the best
of its series, and for which so many active members in one way and
another by their mutual help and mutual confidence have had a
share in perfecting.
There is another duty and that a ?ad one: to enumerate those
who have passed.
We all knew Fred Enock, many a time has he entertained us in
this room with his inimitable expositions of insect life-histories.
We had thought to see and bear him again, but with enfeebled
health and more than 70 years of a strenuous life he passed away
in quiet retirement at Hastings.
Chas. A. Briggs, was scarcely known to most of those who now
attend our meetings, but a quarter of a century ago and more he
was a most active and enthusiastic member, whose hospitality those
present at a field meeting more than once enjoyed. Although for
years past he had lived at Lynmouth, he still retained his love for the
Society and kept up his membership to the day of his death, at the
age of 65.
