In conclusion, I will mention that of 62 cocoons, gathered at
random off oaks, 61, or 82%, produced Tnrtrix viridana. Three
female pupae of this species produced hymenopterous parasites and
one pupa died. Thus nearly 89% of the pupa gathered belonged to
the green Tortrix. The first emerged June 8th, the last June 18th.
The sexes were equally divided in the 34 instances noted. Of the
remaining seven pupae, four yielded Pandeiiiis ribeana, one, Tortrix
loeflhujiana, one, Cacoecia lecheana and one, Gypwnoma dealbana,
all belonging to the Tortricina.
The dates of the appearances of the various stages of this insect
will vary from year to year in sympathy with the advanceinent or
retardation of the Spring and also in accordance with the latitude
of the locality investigated.
