On a single leaflet of one of the compound leaves I counted
84 of the pseudomorphic larvse together with seven cast
skins of the same.
The question as to whether these abnormal larvfe moult is
thus no longer in doubt.
The larvfe on this leaflet were, without exception, of the
pseudomorphic (" Periphylliis") form.
(2) The ramifications of the " nerves " in the folioles of these
sloughs were, in some cases, clearly seen to be filled with
air, thus demonstrating their vascular character.
(3) From the same leaves of Box-elder I removed 24 black n-inf/ed
females, and deposited them in four tubes, placing six
aphides in each tube. Three days after, one of these tubes
contained a live pseudomorph.
This establishes the fact that both the alate and apterous black
females may produce the pseudomorphic larvae.
(4) In the month of July I obtained two larvfe of the normal
form from an isolated black apterous female.
(5) July 22nd. On a single leaf of Acer campestre I counted on
the upper side 269 pseudomorphic larvse and on the lower
side 98, making a total of 367 on the whole leaf.
