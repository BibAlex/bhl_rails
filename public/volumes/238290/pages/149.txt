REPORT OF THE COUNCIL 1916.
THE Council of the South London Entomological and Natural
History Society, in presenting the forty-fifth Annual
Eeport, is able to state that the Society continues in a
satisfactory condition.
Possibly owing to the present circumstances only two new
members have been elected, and one old member, who resigned
some years ago, has rejoined.
The Society has to deplore the loss of five members by death,
viz., J. Piatt Barrett, C. A. Briggs, F. Enock, H. W. Martin and
H. A. Sauze, and three have resigned.
The Membership at present stands as follows : 3 Hon. Members,
7 Life Members, 131 Ordinary Members and 22 Country Members,
â€”total 163.
During the year several of our active members have undertaken
military duties, this and the darkness of the streets has somewhat
interfered with the attendance at the meetings, nevertheless a
good average has been maintained.
The Council would like to place on record their great appreciation
of Mr. Step's hearty co-operation in all that has been brought
forward for the advancement of the objects of the Society for many
years past, and trust that in the near future circumstances will
again permit him to continue his useful work amongst them.
The Balance Sheet, duly audited, is printed on pages xiv-xv.
The Special Exhibition of " Orders other than Lepidoptera," was
held on May 11th, when there were numerous exhibits of great
interest.
The Annual Special Exhibition of Varieties and other objects of
special interest was held on December 14th. Although the attend-
ance was smaller than in previous years, yet the exhibits, especially
those of Lepidoptera, were of more than usual interest.
