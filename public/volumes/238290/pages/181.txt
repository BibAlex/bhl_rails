That with his pretty buzzing melody
Came here to make us merry, and thou hast kill'd him."
TituR AndronkiiH, iii., 2.
The diminutive size of flies on the whole is often noted. Lear
mentions —
" The small gilded fly." — Lear, iv., 6.
Queen Mab's driver is described —
" For waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat."
Midsnnniier Xif/Jifs Dream, i., 4.
So Imogen says that her eyes had followed her lord —
" till he had melted from
The smallness of a gnat, to air." — Cijnibeline, i., 4.
Antipholus of Syracuse reviles his servant Dromio for his un-
wonted levity, and enforces his remarks by a homely simile —
" When the sun shines, let foolish gnats make sport;
But creep in crannies, when he hides his beams."
(Jo)neily of Errors, ii., 2.
Flavius to more fully impress Tiinon that his bought friends are
unreliable, says —
" One cloud of winter showers,
These flies have couched." — TiiiKm of Athens, ii., 2.
The sufferings and terror shown by cattle are aptly portrayed in
more than one passage. Nestor, the leader in the Grecian camp, in
a punning reference, says that the fleet is susceptible more to the
winds than the enemy —
" The herd hath more annoyance by the brize
Than by the tiger." — Trtolns and Cressida, i., 3.
Scarus describes the flight of Cleopatra after the battle of Actium
in no unmeasured terms —
" Yon ribald nag of Egypt,
Whom leprosy o'ertake ! i' the midst o' the fight,
When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd
Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,
The brize upon her, like a cow in June,
Hoists sail, and flies." — Antonij and Cleopatra, iii., 8.
The curious belief, which once held sway, that flies become blind
in autumn, appears in the remarks of Burgundy —
" Maids well summer'd and warm kept, are like flies at
Bartholomew tide, — blind though they have their eyes."
Henry V., v., 2.
