Mr. Robert Adkin exhibited series of Fuhjommatns icams. from
Scotland, including the Orkney Isles (representing its most northerly
British range) and the Outer Hebrides, North and South Ireland,
North Wales, the North and South of England, the Isle of Man, and
the Scilly Isles. The series from the North of Ireland were remark-
able for the large size of the individuals comprised in them, some of
the males measuring 88mm. in expanse, and for the brilliant blue
coloration and large size and intensity of the red submarginal spots
of the females. Many of the Scotch specimens also were of large
size, especially those from Orkney and the Hebrides, but the females
were generally less brilliant except in the case of those from the last
named locality, which closely approached the Irish. The South
English series included many well-marked undersides, intensely
blue and brown females, with many intermediates, and a couple of
gynandromorphs taken respectively on Wandsworth Common, in
1860, and at Dover, in 1900.
