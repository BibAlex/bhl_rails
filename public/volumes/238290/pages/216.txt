1903. Ml'. Carpenter. — I.e., p. 59. Mr. Joy had a brood of larvje
from ova laid by a bred $ paired in captivity.
1904. Mr. Joy. — I.e., p. 84. Insects bred from above pairing and
two sets from a pairing of them exhibited. 80% hiber-
nated as pupae, emerging early in May. 20% hibernated
as larvte (half-fed) and emerged in June.
YII. Variation.
1. Characteristics. The best summary is Stephens (" 111. Brit.
Ent.," vol. i., p. 54). " This insect varies much in the intensity of
its colours, particularly on its under surface ; in some specimens
the posterior wings are nearly plain griseous, in others they have a
distinct broad, very irregular, central band." He refers to fine
specimens having on the underside of the hindwings " the hinder
margin purplish, with a series of white dots in lieu of the ocelli."
2. Lines of variation.
a. Depth of ground colour, upperside.
b. Intensity of the spots.
e. Depth of ground and intensity of spots together,
d. Number of eye-spots on lower wings (8-6).
e. Development and extent of purple on lower wing underside.
/. Shape of forewings (rounding of apex).
ff. Size and number of markings on the upperside (coalescence
rare).
/(. Development of clouds to blotches (rare on hindwings).
i. Duplication of apical spot (rare).
Ic. Tendency of spots on hindwing to reduction to dots.
I. Most constant spots on forewings are two in 1st transverse row,
four in 2nd row, in size, shape and distinctness.
3. Sexual Variation.
Tutt ("Brit. Butt.," p. 388; 1896) says, "The males are
considerably darker, having the pale spots much more restricted
than the females, whilst towards the centre of the wing is an
oblique shiny patch of androconial scales, easily detected if the
butterfly be looked at sideways."
4. Aberrations. Striking aberrations seem rare.
a. The apical ocellus duplicated. Said to occur regularly in the
Channel Islands. The bipupiUata of Mosley.
b. Figure by Mosley "111. Var. Brit. Lep.," Sati/nm, pi. 1,
collection Sam Stevens. Dark area much decreased on all
