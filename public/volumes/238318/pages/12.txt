The above Steam Engine is extremely well adapted for Agricultural
purposes ; having an oscillating cylinder which greatly reduces the num-
ber of working parts, thereby rendering it much less liable to get out of
repair, better to be understood, and easier to manage than the ordinary
table or top beam Engine. The annexed prices include all complete to
the end of the fly-wheel shaft and fixing, (exclusive of masonry and brick
work), and putting to work, but not carriage beyond Lincoln Railway
Station.
