iv] INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
â– what the result would be when defective steam machinery was put in the hands of
inexperienced farm laborers.
C. S. & Co. have for many years been engaged in the manufacture of steam engines,
but have of late directed their attention almost exclusively to a class of engines (portable
and fixed) best adapted for agricultural purposes, and at the same time have closely
studied the requirements and best method of arranging the in-door implements of a farm
when intended to be driven by steam power, and are prepared to give plans and speci-
fications for either large or small occupations, with cost for the whole complete and
set to work.
C. S. & Co. send printed instructions for the easy and complete management of their
Steam Engines, a copy of which is given to every purchaser, and by a strict adherence
to the directions therein contained, their Engines may be effectually worked by any
steady agricultural laborer.
