AGRICULTURAL MACHINES.
In situations that will admit of the thrashing machines being fixtures,
and elevated upon a second floor, C. S. & Co. recommend a blowing or
chaffing machine, and a straw shaker, with revolving cloth underneath
the same, all upon one frame, with elevators to take the corn up into the
dressing or finishing machine. But as different situations involve in
almost every case an alteration of arrangement, it would be impossible to
quote a definite price for such work completed. C. S. & Co. will in such
cases gladly give plans and specifications, with price, for the whole com-
plete, and set to work.
