AGRICULTURAL MACHINES.
The stones are 2 ft. 8 in. diameter, fixed in a metal cylindrical frame
3 ft, 6 in. diameter, and 4 ft. 7 in. high, from floor to top of bedstone.
The top or runner stone is carried round by the upright spindle
which receives its motion from the pair of bevelled wheels at bottom,
one of which is geared with wood to prevent noise ; the pulley shown
on the outside is for running the strap, which may be taken direct
from the engine driving wheel ; the small hand wheel at the bottom
in front is for adjusting the stones to their faces, by which means, and in
a moment's notice, they may be made to grind to the finest flour, wheat
or barley, or be so adjusted as only to bruise or kibble beans, peas, and
oats. The quantity of work done in a given time will vary according to
the required fineness of the flour ; with Derbyshire grey stones six bushels
of barley, per hour, may be ground to fine meal, and if only required to
be kibbled or partially broken, a much greater quantity may be done.
If wheat is intended to be ground, French burr stones are indispensable,
and in most cases they are best suited for agricultural purposes, being
much harder, consequently do not require dressing or sharpening so often
as Derbyshire grey stones.
