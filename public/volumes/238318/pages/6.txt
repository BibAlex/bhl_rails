CLAYTON, SHUTTLEWORTH, & Co. beg to call the attention of Agriculturists
and the Public generally to their fixed and portable Steam Engines, Thrashing
Machines, Straw Shakers, Grinding Mills, Bone Mills, Circular Saws, &c. ; and, in doing
this, they deem it necessary to make a few observations in reference to the use of Steam
Engines for agricultural purposes, to the manufacture of which C. S. & Co. have paid
special attention, and the circumstance of their having manufactured upon their own
premises, and sold the large number of upwards of one hundred and fifty of their Portable
Steam Engines since they commenced supplying themâ€” fifty five of which, of various powers,
(all for agricultural purposes,) being disposed of in the year 1849. These statements
fully prove the demand and indispensable necessity for such engines; in fact, the
great economy effected in agricultural operations by the use of steam power, can no longer
be considered a theoretical question, but is, we believe, admitted to be a great advantage
by all employed or interested in agricultural pursuits, diminishing the necessity for em-
ploying so large a number of horses on the farm, thereby effecting an estimated saving
of twenty-five per cent.
That Steam Engines would have been used for farm purposes much earlier than the
present time, and to a much greater extent, there can be no doubt, had it not been for
the very clumsy and badly constructed engines and boilers which were put into the
hands of the agriculturists, the consequence of which was that there was a great deal of
money wasted, and after many attempts, and after almost as many disappointments, the ap-
plication of steam power for the purposes of husbandry was pronounced a failure, which
was wrongfully attributed to the want of skill on the part of the farm laborer to manage
the same; but the real cause of all this annoyance, loss, and disappointment, arose not
so much from the want of ability on the part of the farm laborer, as from want of
mechanical knowledge in the makers of those engines and boilers. Steam Engines for
farm purposes, were first made, and to some extent at the present time continue to be
manufactured by persons who are not steam Engineers, but only farm implement
makers, who know nothing of the theory or first principles of a steam engine, conse-
quently can know but little of its manufacture. It may therefore readily be imagined
