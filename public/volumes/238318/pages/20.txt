Gentlemen,
I have great pleasure in testifying
to the very excellent arrangement and
quality of workmanship displayed in your
Portable Steam Engines : as exhibited at
the North Lincolnshire Agricultural Meet-
ing, July, 1 849, where they were awarded
the first prize.
I am, Gentlemen,
Yours most obediently,
N. Peacock.

Gentlemen, i
It is with much pleasure, I assure
you, that your engine is all that I could
wish, whether as regards its admirable
simplicity or the beauty of its construc-
tion, — its movements are as those of a
watch, and it is so simple that any intelli-
gent farm laborer may be taught to work
it in a day.
I am, Gentlemen,
Yours truly,
J. Brown.

Chattekis, Nov. 1, 1849.
Dear Sir,
Your Engine, certainly, has more
than equalled my expectations, as far as
regards its regularity of movement, and
the simplicity of management required in <
working it I think there is no doubt of
you soon being required to send into our
district two or three similar engines, when
certain parties here have seen a little more j
of the working of this one, which has ex-
cited universal admiration. ;
I am, dear Sir,
Yours truly, ■■

July 26th, 1849.
Gentlemen,
Having given your Engine a fair
trial, and duly tested its powers, I thought
it incumbent upon me to state my entire
satisfaction of the same, and trust, at a
future period, to be enabled, (with the ex-
perience of my partners also), to signify
our approval in every way.
I remain, Gentlemen,
Yours respectfully,
Geo. Clark.

Gunton Park, Cromer, 4th Jan., 1848. '.
Gentlemen,
The Steam Engine and Thrashing
Machine received from you have now been
fairly tried, and I am glad to be able to
express my entire satisfaction with both;
the latter I should have been glad to have
tried upon a barley stack, but the weather '
has been so unfavourable for oat-door \
operations, that I have not had the oppor-
tunity, but have no doubt of its capability
to do this work without detriment to the
grain.
I remain, Gentlemen, yours truly,
Henry Smith.

Burcott, Abingdon,
•27th August, 1849.
Dear Sirs,
The Engine started and has con-
tinued to perform its work to the satisfac-
tion of us all. The ever true and noiseless
way in which it works in every part, is
gratifying to see, and a proof of the nature
of its workmanship.
In haste,
Yours very truly,
Henry Hannam.
Messrs. Clayton & Co.
