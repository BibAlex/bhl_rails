AGRICULTURAL MACHINES.
many of these engines both for private use and for letting out for hire ;
they are alike suitable for a small or great day's work, and only consume
fuel in proportion to the quantity of work done, therefore they are the
most desirable engines for persons who thrash for hire, as they can accom-
modate either a large or small customer. With a fair average crop,
sixty qrs. of mown wheat may be thrashed out in a day of ten hours, with
great ease, with one of these engines.
For the information of our readers, and in order to enable them to
determine the comparative merits of engines made by various manufac-
turers, we re-publish the following Tabular Statement of the performance
of each engine tested under the Judges' direction, at the Royal Agricul-
tural Society's Show, held at Norwich, 1S49.

From the foregoing table the following results may be fairly deduced :
1st. That the engines manufactured by Clayton, Shuttleworth, & Co.
get steam up in the least time. 2nd. They require the smallest quantity
of fuel in getting up the steam. And 3rd. What is most important, these
engines consume less fuel per horse, per hour, than any which were
exhibited at Norwich, thereby showing the great superiority of these
engines over every other exhibited there.
