TESTIMONIALS.
Blofield, Norwich,
15th Dec. 1849.
Gentlemen,
I consider I am in duty bound to
inform you that the engine you sent me
works admirably well, surpassing my most
sanguine anticipation ; it has been work-
ing almost every day since I have had it,
and not the least thing of any importance
has got out of order. I consider it su-
perior to anything of the sort that has
come under my notice ; in this opinion
every Agriculturist who has seen it work
coincides. Should I ever want another, I
shall certainly give you the order. Gar-
rett, of Leiston, has sent two engines to
near neighbours of mine ; without speak-
ing partially, I have no hesitation in say-
ing they are inferior to yours, which I
believe is chiefly owing to the bad con-
struction of their fire-place.
I am, yours truly,
A. B. Postle.

Gentlemen,
It gives me much pleasure, now
that I have had my engine nearly eight
months, and since harvest, constantly at
work, that is, three and four days per
week, to express my great satisfaction
with it, â€” I reckon that it does for me the
work of seven horses, thrashing and dress-
ing corn out of the chaff, and crushing at
the same time. My man appears to me
thoroughly to understand the working of
it, and I have not the slightest trouble in
the management. I expect you will hear
of some more customers in our neigh-
bourhood.
I am, Gentlemen,
Your most obedient servant,
H. E. Blyth.
