at all times desirable, and when not working at their full limit will only
consume fuel in proportion to the work done. We have sold two of
these engines for farm purposes in Scotland, and they are very much
liked. (See letter from Mr. Dudgeon, of Almond Hill, near Edinburgh,
inserted at the end of this catalogue.) There is scarcely any limit to the
quantity which may be thrashed with an engine of this power, but in a

of mown wheat in ten hours.
The foregoing Engines and Boilers are made of the very best materials,
and by the most skilled workmen that can be got, and are equal in finish
to a locomotive. They are fitted with an improved governor which acts
with such precision as to have the entire control of the engine, regulating
its speed to the greatest nicety under all changes or irregularities of the
work. The boiler is covered with hair felt, over which is placed a
neat wood casing, giving a handsome finish to the whole, and prevents
radiation of heat, thereby effecting a great saving of fuel, especially in
cold weather.
The prices given with each engine include every requisite necessary, not
a single item of extras being required. The requisites comprise patent
waterproof cover for engine, tube cleaner, fire pricker and rake, screw
keys and screw hammer, oil tin, spare guage glass, &c.
