causation beyond matter, who discover causes that are not material
(called spiritual), who believe that the Great First Cause (the Unknow-
able of materialists) is an infinite spiritual power or basis of all things,
and who recognize in man also a spiritual power of which they are
conscious, widely different from matter, partaking of the nature of the
Divine, and, being a very positive entity the greatest of all realities
to us destined, in accordance with the doctrine of the persistence of
force, to a duration analogous to that of matter.
To the materialist, who finds in matter " the promise and potency "
of all things, there is no higlier object of reverence and love than the
examples of men and women within his reach ; there is no future life
to conij^ensate for the wrongs and sufferings of this, the triumph of
fraud, or the unmerited agonies of disease and poverty ; there is no
apparent controlling purpose of benevolence or justice in the universe,
but only a chance medley of strife, in which strong-handed selfishness
is best rewarded, and when " man dies as the dog dies " the account
is closed, and the self-imposed martyrdom of the loving hero appears
a final loss and folly.
To the spiritualist, the universe has a deeper meaning, a nobler
destiny. The wisdom of the Infinite, which is unutterably beyond his
reach, is a consoling reality, and the little play upon this theatre, the
life-struggle of threescore and ten years, is but the beginning, the
gestation and birth of a career corresi^onding to our noblest aspira-
tions and our faith in the Divine benevolence.
Man has such immeasurable powers of adaptation that a strong
moral nature may exist under the gloomiest views of materialism
(which naturally tend to the pessimism of SchoiDenhauer and Hart-
mann), and sustain itself by its constitutional energy and buoyancy ;
but there are millions to whom materialism teaches the daily lesson
that to " put money in thy purse " is the chief aim of life, and to riot
in sensual pleasure on ill-gotten gain, until the candle burns out, is
the best wisdom.
The glow of hope, the removal of anxiety, the exaltation of happi-
ness, the enlargement of sympathy and love, which thousands have
experienced when they have passed from the dark nescience of ma-
terialism to the brilliant certainties of spiritualism, and learned the
grandeur of human destiny whether the change has been effected by
emotional eloquence and historical argument in the bosom of the
Church, or by scientific investigation and experimental inquiry in
pneumatology, or by that direct perception of spiritual existence now
enjoyed by a few (and destined to be enjoyed by all when the human
race shall have attained maturity of development) should satisfy
any impartial thinker that the diffusion of spiritual knowledge is as
noble and practical a form of philanthropy as a good man can labor for.
But, in laboring for these ennobling truths, he encounters a strong
resistance in the animal nature of man, in the selfish and depressing
