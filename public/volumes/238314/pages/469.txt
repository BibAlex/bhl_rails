SNOKING, AND HOW TO STOP IT.
By JOHN A. WYETH, M. D.
TO those unacquainted with the mysterious parlance of the anat-
omist, the use of strictly scientific terms might prove discour-
aging and fail to interest. I shall therefore discard the scie)}tijic in
favor of the every-day phrases, in explanation of the following figure
(1), which, it will be observed, represents a human head split from
above downward through the central line.
Through the only two channels in which the air travels in going to
the lungs, namely, through the nose and mouth, are drawn two arrows,
Fig. 1.
a and b. These two passages unite in a common cavity at/, and from
that point there is but one tube leading to the lungs.
At c is a bone called the hard palate, which forms the roof of the
mouth and the floor of the nose, separating these two air-channels
from each other. At the inner or posterior end of the bone, c, is seen
a little body, d, called the soft palate, made of muscle and covered
with a delicate skin. This soft palate is attached at one end to c, the
hard palate ; the other end hangs loose, and moves or flaps in the act
of breathing, something like a window-curtain when acted upon by a
current of air. This is its condition while we are asleep or awake,
though during sleep it lacks in tonicity, being much more relaxed, or
flabby, than when we are awake. At e is represented the tongue.
