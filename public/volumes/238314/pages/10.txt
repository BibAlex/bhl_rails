SOME readers of The Popular Science Monthly may never have

bone made up of a series of segments or vertebrce. But this common
definition is not wholly accurate. For the very young of man and
monkeys, quadrupeds and birds, reptiles and fishes, have no skeleton
at all ; and some of the lowest fishes, the Amphioxus and the lam-
prey-eels, have no bones. So the vertebrates are now said to include
all animals having a longitudinal axis or spine (whether membrane,
cartilage, or bone) separating an upper or dorsal cavity, containing
the spinal cord and brain, from a lower or ventral cavity, containing
