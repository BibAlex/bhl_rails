the trustees of the institution elected him as its president in 1864,
which office he still holds. Coincident with his accession to the presi-
dency of Columbia College, an important step was taken by the man-
agers of the institution for the promotion of scientific education by
the establishment of the School of Mines, and the appointment of an
able faculty to carry it on. This branch of the college has been so
well administered as to become a great success. Its facilities for sci-
entific training are ample and well directed, and in the number of its
students it is already the rival of the classical department.
Di'. Barnard has written miich upon both scientific and educa-
tional topics, and done a good deal of important work in connection
with the various international expositions of industry, to which he
has been commissioned by our Government. His last important liter-
ary undertaking has been the editorship of Johnson's " New Illus-
trated Universal Cyclopaedia." He has received many honors from
institutions of learning and leading scientific societies, both in this
country and abroad, and has been President of the American Associ-
ation for the Advancement of Science, of the American Microscopical
Society, and of the American Institute, New York. The following
are President Barnard's most important publications :
