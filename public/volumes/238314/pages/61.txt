on December 1st, as to Schmidt on November 24th, it appeared to be
of from tlie third to the fourth magnitude ; on December 3d it had
fallen to the fourth magcnitude, and on December 4th to the fifth
magnitude. The right ascension was 24'' 36 50.4'; declination, +42

THE Swan ; Etoile Nouvelle the New Star.
We may observe here that there is nothing in common between
this new star and those wliich made their appearance in 1600 in the
neck of the Swan, and in 1670 near /3 of the same constellation. The
onlj^ point of agreement between them is their nearness to the Milky-
Way.
In comparing Schmidt's observations with those of Prosper Henry,
we note two important facts : tlie first is, the diminution of lustre,
varying in eight days from the third to the fifth magnitude ; and,
second, the notable change of color, from a pronounced yellow to
greenish blue a change so patent that it cannot be referred to in-
dividual differences of judgment, or to atmospheric influences.
The new star of the Swan has been made the subject of a very
interesting spectroscopical study. As early as December 2d, Coruu
applied a spectroscope to the great equatorial in the eastern tower of
the Paris Observatory. Cazin, too, employed for the same purpose
the nine-inch equatorial telescope (the object-glass of which is by Leon
Foucault). Both of these observers arrived at the same conclusion.
The spectrum of the star, observed during a brief interval of clear
sky, appeared to " consist in great part of bright lines, and hence
