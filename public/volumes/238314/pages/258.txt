THE CLIMATIC INFLUENCE OF VEGETATION. A
PLEA FOR OUE FOEESTS.
By F. L. OSWALD, M. U.
" A S a fellow-Unitarian, I feel sorry for the Turks," Dr. Schlie-
JOJl. mann writes from Salon ica, " but, as a respecter of God's
physical laws, I must own that they deserve their fate. Men who
for twenty generations have proved themselves tree-destroyers on
principle, have no right to complain if the world rises against them."
It would be well for the world if for the last twenty generations
the Turks had been the only " tree-destroyers on principle." Since
the advent of the Christian religion, the physical history of our planet
records the steady growth of a desert, which made its first appear-
ance on the dry table-land of Southern Syria, and gradually spreading
eastward down the Euphrates toward Afghanistan, and westward
along both shores of the Mediterranean, now extends from Eastern
Persia to the western extremity of Portugal, and sends its harbingers
into Southern France and the southeastern provinces of European
Russia. Like a virulent cancer, the azoic sand-drifts of the Moab
Desert have eaten their way into Southern Europe and Northern
Africa, and dried up the life-springs of districts which beyond all dis-
pute were once the garden-regions of this earth.
Prince de Ligne, countryman and contemporary of Maria Theresa,
wrote an essay "On the Location of the Earthly Paradise," and, after
some reflections on the hygienic influence of different climates, calls
attention to the fact that " pnradise-traditions, in locatinjr the garden
of Eden, differ only in regard to longitude, but not to latitude. The
latitude keeps always near the snow-houndary, a line just south of the
regions where snow may fall, but will not stay on the ground. It
passes through Thibet, Cashmere, Northern Persia, and Asia Minor,
