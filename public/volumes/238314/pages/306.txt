THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN. 445
carried on ; and necessarily the more males are drafted off for military
service, the more females must be called on to fill their places as work-
ers. Hence the extent to which in Germany women are occupied in
rough, out-of-door tasks digging, wheeling, carrying burdens ; hence
the extent to which in France heavy field-operations are shared in by
women. That the English housewife is less a drudge than her Ger-
man sister, that among shopkeepers in England she is not required to
take so large a share in the business as she is among shoj^keepers in
France, and tjiat in England the out-of-door work done by women is
both smaller in quantity and lighter in kind, is clear; as it is clear
that this difierence is associated with a lessened demand on the male
population for purposes of offense and defense. And then there may
be added the fact of kindred meaning, that in the United States, where
till the late war the degree of militancy had been so small, and the
industrial type of social structure and action so predominant, women
have reached a higher status than anywhere else.
Evidence furnished by existing Eastern nations, so far as it can
be disentangled, supports this view. China, with its long history of
wars causing consolidations, dissolutions, reconsolidations, etc., going
back more than 2,000 years b, c, and continuing during Tartar and
Mongol conquests to be militant in its activities and arrangementSj
has, notwithstanding industrial growth, retained the militant type of
Structure ; and absolutism in the state has been accompanied by ab-
solutism in the family, qualified in the one as in the other only by the
customs and sentiments which industrialism has fostered : wives are
bought ; concubinage is common among those adequately well off;
widows are sometimes sold as concubines by fahters-in-law ; and
women join in hard work, sometimes to the extent of being harnessed
to the plough ; while, nevertheless, this low status is practically raised
by a public opinion that checks the harsh treatment legally allowable.
Similarly Japan, which, passing through long periods of internal con-
flict ending in integration, acquired an organization completely mili-
tant, under which political freedom was unknown, showed a simul-
taneous absence of freedom in the household buying of wives, concu-
binage, divorce at mere will of husband, crucifixion or decapitation
for wife's adulteiy ; while, along with the growth of industrialism
characterizing the later days of Japan, there went such improvement
in the legal status of women that the husband was no longer allowed
to take the law into his own hands in case of adultery ; and now,
though women are occasionally seen using the flail, yet mostly the
men, according to Sir Rutherford Alcock, " leave their women to the
lighter work of the house, and perform themselves the harder out-door
labor."
It is, of course, difficult to generalize phenomena into the genesis
of which there enter factors so numerous and involved character of
