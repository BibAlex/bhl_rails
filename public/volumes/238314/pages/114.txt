OUR AMERICAN OWLS. 149
inches. It is common South. A quaint and lively bird, its actions
look like antics, for it is an oddity, even among its own folks. His
portrait is that of a gay, unsuspecting fellow. He has queer ways
for an owl ; he is not sedate enough. In the deep woods, and in broad
daylight, when all owldom is abed, he will set up his comical half-
laugh, half-cry, " Whah ! whah ! whah-a-a-aa ! " which has in it some-
thing of the affectation of an exquisite. He is the dandy-owl as he
has been called the buffoon of the woods.
A much graver person, and the giant of American owls, is the
great gray owl {S. cinerium, Aud.). His length is thirty inches. The
cry is not unlike that of the mottled owl. The bird is common in
Canada, and has been shot in New Jersev.

As representing the gray owls well, we must instance the brown
or tawny owl, so called in England, although its upper parts are ashen
gray {see Fig. 7) {S. aluco, Linn.). This bird is found in Great Britain,
on the Continent, and in Japan. It is only some fifteen inches long,
and of retiring habits, as it loves the deep, dark woods, which it will
make ring with its dolorous, wolf-like cry of " Hoo ! hoo ! hoo ! " It
is an indiscriminate feeder, regaling itself on slugs, insects, small
quadrupeds, birds, and fish. And it is quite a clever fisherman in
its way, having been known to carry a pound-weight trout to its young.
Its mode of angling is to stand stock-still, and patiently, on a protrud-
ing stone in a rippling stream, and, when an unsuspicious swimmer
comes along, to invest five talons promptly, and take the venture out
in fish.
In this group belongs the genus Nyctale^ which contains the pretty
little saw-whet, or Acadian owl {Nyctale Acadice, Bonap.). This is the
smallest owl in the Eastern and Middle States, being but eight indies
long. Its cry is said to resemble the filing or whetting of the teeth
