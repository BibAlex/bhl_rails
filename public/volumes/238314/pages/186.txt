AND here we come in face of the fact before obliquely glanced at,
that Sir Henry Maine's hypothesis takes account of no stages
in human progress earlier than the pastoral or agricultural. The
groups he describes as severally formed of the patriarch, his wife,
descendants, slaves, flocks, and herds, are groups implying that
animals of several kinds have been domesticated. But before the
domestication of animals was achieved, there passed long stages
stretching back through prehistoric times. To understand the patri-
archal group, we must inquire how it grew out of the less-organized
groups that preceded it.
The answer is not difficult to find if we ask what kind of life the
domestication of herbivorous animals entailed. Where pasture is
abundant and covers large areas, the keeping of flocks and herds does
not necessitate separation into very small clusters : instance the Co-
manches, who, with their hunting, join the keeping of cattle, which
the members of the tribe combine to guard. But where pasture is
not abundant, or is distributed in patches, cattle cannot be kept to-
gether in great numbers; and their owners consequently have to part.
Naturally, the division of the owners will be into such clusters as are
already vaguely marked off" in the original aggregate: individual men
with such women as they have taken possession of, such animals as
they have acquired by force or otherwise, and all their other belong-
ings, will wander hither and thither in search of food for their sheep
and oxen. As already pointed out, we have, in prepastoral stages,
as among the Bushmen, cases where scarcity of wild food necessitates
parting into very small groups ; and clearly when, instead of game
