AMONG the many ways in which electricity is called in to give
assistance in various physical investigations, one of the most
elegant and interesting is the application of the electric spark to
render momentarily visible a body that is rapidly moving or changing
its form. The duration of the electric spark is so short probably
not more than ^4-5-07; ^^ ^ second that a body, such as a rotating
wheel or oscillating rod, moving in a dark room with extreme rapidity,
will, if illumined by an electric spark, seem stationary, since the wheel
or rod has not time to change its position appreciably during the
short instant for which it is visible. If the spark be bright, the im-
pression is left on the eye long enough for the attention to be directed
to it, and for a clear idea to be formed of what has been seen.
The writer of this article has recently applied this method to
watching the changes of form in drops of various liquids falling verti-
cally on a horizontal plate. As usually seen, a drop of water falling

from a height of ten or twelve inches on a smooth solid substance,
such as glass or wood, seems to make an indiscriminate splash. The
whole splash takes place so quickly that the eye cannot follow the
changes of form ; the impression made by the last part of the splash
succeeding that of the first part so quickly as to confuse it.
A little careful observation, however, shows that the drop passes
through very definite symmetrical forms, and that a splash is by no
means an irregular, hap-hazard phenomenon.
