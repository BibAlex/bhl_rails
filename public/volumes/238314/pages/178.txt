Proposed Scientific Expedition around
tlic World. For some months Mr. James
0. Woodruff", of Indianapolis, has been busi-
ly engaged in organizing a " scientific ex-
pedition around the world," the object of
which is to visit points of general and spe-
cial interest, to study architecture, archcEol-
ogy, geology, and the fauna and flora of
new or little known localities, and to make
collections and studies in natural history
generally.
It is proposed to start from New York
some time next fall, in a steamship of a
thousand tons, officered by experienced men
from our navy, and fitted with all the ap-
pliances necessary for such an expedition.
Ten scientific professors, selected from the
faculties of our leadiug universities, are to
go along in the capacity of teachers, giving
lectures and instruction in the various sub-
jects of study.
The island of Marajo, at the mouth of
the Amazon, Valparaiso, some of the less
known islands of the Central Pacific, New
Guinea, Borneo, Ceylon, and Alexandria,
are a few of the more prominent points it
is proposed to visit; the ship returning by
the way of France and England. Inland
excursions, for the purposes of exploration
and the collection of .specimens, will be a
feature of the expedition. Eighty students
can be accommodated. The trip is expected
to consume two years, and will cost each
student, according to published estimates,
about $5,000.
Fruit-Farming in England. The home-
supply of fruit in England being very in-
adequate to the demand, foreign fruit has to
be imported in enormous quantity. Hence
the price of fruit is very high, and the great
