which have led the Norwegians in former times to institute a special
form of prayer against their invasions. There are several species
of lemming, easily recognizable, and with well-marked geographical
range ; but it is to the Scandinavian species only that the following

an extremely severe winter, the whole army of animals, in the a\itumn
and at night, migrates in a direct line." According to Olaus Magnus
