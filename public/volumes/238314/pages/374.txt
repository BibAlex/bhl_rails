ON DROPS.

case corresponds to that of a simple pendulum started with a blow so
violent as to break the string.
But the liquid star and the complicated pattern on the smoked
glass show that the splash is not a simple spreading out of the drop
equally in all directions, to return again.

In order to observe the form of the drop at any given instant dur-
ing the splash, it is necessary to make use of the electric spark, and to
take advantage of the fact that drops of the same size falling from
the same height will all behave in the same way.
It will be necessary to let a drop, say of mercury, fall on a plate
in comparative darkness, and to produce a strong spark at the instant
the bottom of the drop comes in contact with the plate, and so illumine
it ; the observer will then see the drop in the form it has at that m-
stant.
A second drop must be let fall in the same way, and be illumined
by the spark not at the first moment of contact, but a shade later, say
^i_ second later, when the drop will have spread itself out slightly on
the plate; and similarly we must illuminate a third drop a shade later
than the second, and so on. The observer can, after a little practice,
draw from memory on each occasion the drop in the form in which he
has seen it. It will be seen that the pi'ocess consists in isolating con-
secutive phases of the splash from those that precede and follow, and
which take place in darkness, and so do not confuse what has been
seen as they would do in continuous daylight.
The device adopted by the writer for so timing the appearance of
the spark as to illumine the drop at any desired phase of the splash
consisted essentially in breaking the current of an electro-magnet at
the instant the drop began to fall*, the magnet, thus ceasing to act,
releases a spring which immediately begins to pull the terminal wire
of a strong electric current out of the other terminal, which is a cup
of mercury, and the strength of the spring and the depth of immersion
of the wire in the mercury are so adjusted that the wire leaves the
surface of the mercury, and the required spark is produced at the
instant the drop reaches the plate.
