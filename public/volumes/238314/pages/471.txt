MAES AND ITS SATELLITES.
By Peofessos DAKIEL KIEKWOOD.
THE recent and wholly unexpected discovery of two Martial
satellites has awakened a new and lively interest in all that
relates to our neighboring planet. Its telescopic aspect and the
probable natui-e of its physical constitution are especially worthy of
renewed consideration.
The mean distance of Mars from the snn is 139,877,000 miles.*
Its orbit deviates more from the circular form than that of any other
principal planet with the exception of Mercury; its eccentricity being
0.09326. The difference, therefore, between its greatest and -least
distance amounts to about 27,000,000 miles. But the eccentricity,
though great, is nevertheless increasing; and, when it shall have
attained its superior limit, the aphelion distance will be 196,000,000
miles. This is greater than the perihelion distance of many as-
teroids. Mars, therefore, occasionally invades the cluster of minor
planets. Is it not possible that his' superior force may attach some
of its members to his retinue of satellites ?
Mars was the first planet to exhibit indications of an axial revolu-
tion. As early as 1636 Fontana, a Neapolitan astronomer, had an
imperfect view of a spot on the planet's disk. He reobserved the
same figure in 1638, and from the changes noticed in its position and
aspect he inferred the jDrobability of the planet's rotation. He seems,
however, to have made no eflbrt to determine its period. Dr. Hooke,
in 1666, noticed some well-defined spots, which he found to change
their appearance on the surface, to disappear and return at regular
intervals ; whence he inferred that the planet completes a rotation
either in twelve or twenty-four hours. During the same year Cassini
observed spots on each hemisphere of the planet, from the motions
of which he concluded the period of rotation to be 24'' 40". In 1704
Mai'aldi, the nephew and pupil of Cassini, made a series of observa-
tions on the spots, from which he deduced a period of 24'' sg*". In
1719 he renewed his observations under favorable circumstances, and
obtained a period precisely equal to that originally found by Cassini.
In order to determine the exact period of rotation. Sir William Her-
schel undertook a series of observations in 1777, which he again
resumed in 1779. From the changes which he observed in the ap-
pearances of the planet he fixed the time of revolution at 24^" 39""
21.67'. The determination by Kunowsky in 1821 gave 24"' 36" 40\
The observations of Beer and Mildler in 1830 indicated a period of
24h 3i^m -|^Qs_ Their observations, however, in 1832, combined with
- This value corresponds to a solar parallax of 8.88".
