prairie-dog, which generously shares its hole with bird and snake. The
American burrowing owl is essentially a prairie-bird. It occupies, no
doubt of choice, the deserted burrows of the Gynomys Ludoviciaims
(Baird). But if alarmed, as it would be by the presence of man, it would
betake itself to the nearest hole for a refuge. In other lands the bur-
rowing owl has no prairie-dogs to take advantage of, and in these
places the owls burrow for themselves. They are diurnal prowlers
feeding chiefly on grasshoppers, crickets, and field-mice, and not im-
probably an occasional prairie-dog puppy. One species lives entirely

west of the Mississippi, on both sides of the Rocky Mountains. India
has a number of species, which do their own burrow-making, and are
an incessantly noisy crew.
We cannot pass by that little marvel, the Liliputian of them all,
named Whitney's owl {Micrathene Whitneyi, Coues), It was discov-
ered by Dr. Cooper at Fort Mojave in 1860. This owl is an arboreal
bird. It is partly diurnal in habit, and feeds on insects. The little
thing is hardly as large as the average sparrow.
5. The JVyctei7iince, or day-owls. This small group has but two
genera, with one species in each. But here occurs the very hand-
somest species of the American owls. Fig. 9 shows that splendid
bird known as the snowy owl, the arctic owl (Nyctea nivea, Gray). It
has been found with a length of twenty-seven inches. Some adults
are nearly all white hence, as a show-bird, it is a favorite. We saw
not long since a fine mounted specimen in a New Jersey tavern.
