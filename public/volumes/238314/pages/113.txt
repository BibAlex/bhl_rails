screech-owl, with its staring eyes and pert, ear-like tufts, has a de-
cidedly cattish look. In truth, it wears a grave, grimalkin cast of

mounted specimen in my parlor was an object of dread to a little girl
visiting us from the city. It availed nothing to tell the child that
little Motley would not hurt her, while the unbird-like little thing
would stare at her so.
To the naturalist Scops asio has been a provoking elf. It is to
be hoped that the sage-looking little fellow did not scoff behind his
gravity at these learned men, or count any of them asinine whom he
so misled by his eccentric freakiness in dress. Coming before a man
of science at one time wearing a suit of sober frieze, again appearing

troversy is over now, and to write the sti'ife down as history would be

a nest, and take possession. The facial disk is perfect. Its home is
temperate America, up to Hudson's Bay. " Its cry is plaintive, con-
sisting of two or three prolonged notes repeated at intervals."
3. The Syrnince, or gray owls. In this sub-family is found the
largest bird of the species known in America ; also the smallest speci-
men east of the Mississippi. Their tails are large and round. Even
for owls, they have large heads, but smallish eyes, and no ear-tufts, or
these almost unnoticeable. One of these is represented by Fig. 6, the
barred owl {Syrnium nehulosum, Boie). The average size is twenty
