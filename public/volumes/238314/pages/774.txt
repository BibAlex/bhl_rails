THE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY.
ment of this century broached the doctrine
that there is in living beings a continuous
series of gradations as well as a consistent
and general plan of organization ; and that
the creation, therefore, or origin of the dif-
ferent forms of plants and animals must have
been the result of a gradual process of de-
velopment or of derivation one from another,
the whole standing connected together in
cei'tain causal relations. But in Britain such
views, tliough known and not altogether re-
pulsive to a few, obtained little favor, and,
by some strange process of reasoning, were
looked upon by the great majority as little
short of impious questionings of the supreme
power of the Almighty.
" How different is the position of matters
in this respect in our day ! when the cau-
tious naturalist receives and adopts with
the greatest reserve the statement of fixed
and permanent specific characters as belong-
ing to the different forms of organized beings,
and is fully persuaded of the constant ten-
dency to variation which all species show
even in the present condition of the earth,
and of the still greater liability to change
which must have existed in the earlier pe-
riods of its formation when the belief pre-
vails that so far from being the direct prod-
uct of distinct acts of creation, the various
forms of plants and animals have been grad-
ually evolved in a slow gradation of increas-
ing complexity ; and when it is recognized
by a large majority of naturalists that the
explanation of this wonderful relation of
connection between previously-existing and
later forms is to be found in the constant
tendency to variation during development
and growth, and the perpetuation of such va-
riations by hereditary transmission through
successive generations in the long but in-
calculable lapse of the earth's natural muta-
tions. These, as you must all be aware, are
in their essential features the views now
known as Darwinism, which were first simul-
taneously brought forward by Wallace and
Darwin in 1858, and which, after being more
fully elaborated in the works of the latter
and ably supported by the former, secured,
in the incredibly short space of ten or twelve
years, the general approval of a large por-
tion of the scientific world. The change of
opinion is, in fact, now such that there are
few scientific works on natural history,
whether of a special or more general charac-
ter, in which the relation whicli the facts of
science bear to the newer doctrines is not
carefully pointed out; that, with the gen-
eral public too, the words 'Evolution' and
'Development' have ceased to excite the
feelings, amounting almost to horror, which
they at first produced in the minds of those
to whom they were equally unfamiliar and
suspicious ; and that even in popular litera-
ture and ephemeral effusions direct or met-
aphorical illustrations are drawn in such
terms of the Darwinian theory as ' struggle
for existence,' ' natural selection,' ' survival
of the fittest,' ' heredity,' ' atavism,' and
the like.
" It caqpot be doubted that in this coun-
try, as on the Continent, the influence of au-
thority had much to do with the persistence
of the older teleological views ; and, as has
been well remarked by Haeckel, one of the
ablest and keenest supporters of the modern
doctrine, the combined influence more espe-
cially of the opinions held by three of the
greatest naturalists and biologists who have
ever lived, viz., Linnaeus, Haller, and Cu-
vier, men unsurpassed in the learning of
their time, and the authors of important dis-
coveries in a wide range of biological sci-
ence, was decidedly adverse to the free cur-
rent of speculative thought upon the more
general doctrines of biology. And if it were
warrantable to attribute so great a cliange
of opinion as that to which I have adverted
as occurring in my own time to the influ-
ence of any single intellect, it must be ad-
mitted that it is justly due to the vast range
and accuracy of his knowledge of scientific
facts, the quick appreciation of their mutual
interdependence, and above all the unexam-
pled clearness and candor in statement of
Charles Darwin.
" But while we readily acknowledge the
large share which Darwin has had in guiding
scientific thought into the newer tracts of
biological doctrine, we shall also be disposed
to allow that the slow and ditficult process of
emancipation from the thralldom of dogmatic
opinion in regard to a system of creation,
and the adoption of large and independent
views more consistent with observation, rea-
son, philosophy, and religion, has only been
possible under the effect of the general prog-
ress of scientific knowledge and the acquisi-
tion of sounder methods of applying its prin-
ciples to the explanation of natural phenom-
ena."
President Thomson's address con-
cludes with the following words: "I
consider it impossible, therefore, for
any one to be a faithful student of em-
bryology, in the present state of science,
witliout at the same time becoming an
evolutionist. There may still be many
