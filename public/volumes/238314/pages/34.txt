filtering-places, those of the Claudia and Anio Novus were under-
ground, and now appear simply as mounds. The others were above-
ground, but covered over. From this point two magnificent arcades,
the Marciau and the Claudian, extended to the city the one carrying
three aqueducts, the other two. They were not more than 100 yards
apart, and the Marcian was 30 feet high, the Claudian 50. The filter-
ing-places were of peculiar construction and admirable design. They
consisted of four chambers, two on a level with the conduit, and two
directly below (Fig. 2). The water flowing into the first descended

through an opening in the roof to the fourth, where it found its origi-

opening afforded access into the chambers beneath, and by the assist-
ance of sluice-gates the water could be turned directly from the
first chamber into the fourth, so that the mud could be cleaned out
of the chambers below. It is remarkable that this ingjenious device
for filtering has not occurred to modern aqueduct-builders, for its
simplicity and utility are conspicuous.
The details of distribution are interesting, but we have not space
to go far into them. There were 247 main reservoirs in the city, from
which the water was distributed to 19 barracks for the use of the
army, 95 public establishments, 39 theatres and places of amusement,
and 591 open reservoirs for the public. That was in the time of
