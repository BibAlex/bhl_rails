movable spine at the base of the tail we may merely mention the
herbivorous lancet-fish, although in its general outline it is scarcely
more remarkable than a perch or a bream.
'"Sea-ravens" {Hemipterua^ Fig. 23), "sea-robins" (Frio)iotus),
" sea-swallows " [Dactylopterus), and sculpins ( Coitus)^ may well be
called strange fishes, for their forms are so marked and so strange that
they at once arrest the attention of the commonest observer at the

sea-side. While all these have a certain general resemblance to one
another, all agreeing in being remarkably ugly, each has its own
marked peculiarities in -the development of the head and fins, and in
the curious fleshy filaments which are found upon some of them.
We may also justly include the little star-gazers ( Uranoscopiis,
Fig. 24) of the Atlantic, whose eyes are so placed that they appear as
if looking constantly toward the heavens, and whose mouth is cleft
vertically, and has in it a long filament wliich can be protruded at
will, and which is said to be used in attracting small fishes while the
owner lies concealed in the mud.
Next we may mention the remora (Fig. 25), on whose head there
is a sort of disk composed of laminae which are serrated and movable,
by means of which the fish can firmly attach itself to other animals.

It is said that it can be made useful by putting a ring attached to a
line around its tail, and then allowing it to swim away in searcli of a
victim ; when it has firmly attached itself to a fish, both the remora
and its captive are hauled in together.
Remarkable and strancre as are all the forms of fishes which we
have so far noticed, not one of them exhibits any want of bilateral
symmetry. But we now come to a whole group of fishes, including
