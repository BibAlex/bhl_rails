THE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY.
Shade - Trees, Indigenous Shrubs, and
Vines, by T. Stewart, M. D., and In-
sects THAT Infest Them, by Miss Emma
A. Smith, Entomologist. Peoria, 111. :
Transcript Company. 18YV.
This pamphlet was prepared for the re-
gion about Peoria, 111., but contains much
that will be of value elsewhere. It gives
a brief account of the indigenous trees and
shrubs best adapted to the locality, and the
paper by Miss Smith treats of the insects
which infest them, of which figures are
given. Publications like this do excellent
service in directing public attention to the
cultivation of trees and the planting of for-
ests.
Science-Lectures at South Kensington.
London and New York : Macmillan.
Under the above general title Macmillan
& Co. have published a series of small vol-
umes containing lectures delivered at the
South Kensington Museum during the loan
collection of scientific apparatus last year.
One of the volumes contains two lectures
by Prof. Roscoe on " Technical Chemistry,"
the first treating of the manufacture of sul-
phuric acid, and the second of the alkali
manufacture. In another volume are two
lectures by Prof. Stokes, on " Absorption
of Light and the Colors of Natural Bodies,"
and on "Fluorescence." The third volume
of the series contains two lectures on the
" Steam-Engine," by F. J. Bramwell. Finally,
there is a volume entitled " Outlines of Field
Geology," by Prof. Geikie. These lectures
are all addressed to science-teachers, and not
to popular audiences ; hence they are rather
technical, and possess an interest for the
practical student of science rather than for
the general reader. The prices are : for
the first two volumes, 20 cents each ; for
the other two, 25 cents.
J. W. Bouton announces " Isis Un-
veiled: A Master-Key to the Mysteries of
Ancient and Modern Science and Theology,"
by H. P. Blavatsky, Corresponding Secre-
tary of the Theosophical Society. This work
is announced as a philosophical study of
Orientalism, by a native of Asia, whose
life has been passed in the study of tradi-
tions, languages, literature, mythology, phi-
losophy, and mysticism, of Eastern peoples.
and who considers Oriental thought and
history with reference to modern ideas.
The work is to be issued in two large octavo
volumes.
