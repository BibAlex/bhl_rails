then also the state of the air was anything but desirable. It was only
with 2,120 cubic feet that the medical and other authorities fourd
themselves satisfied.

Such are the changes of times.
Now the many crevices, holes, and pores in our dwellings will no
longer be considered by you as unlimited means of change of the air,
since you know how large that change has to be ; you will rather feel
anxious whence to procure such enormous quantities when you sit
quietly within your four walls where you do not feel the least draught,
where no curtain moves, and a feather lies quietly on the floor. This
sensation of calm we owe to the insensibility of our nerves and yet
the air moves.
In order to give you some idea of the influences of differences of
temperatm-e of more or less well-shutting doors and windows, of a fire
in a stove opening into the room, and of the partial opening of a win-
dow, I will give you shortly the results I obtained with the aid of the
carbonic-acid measurement. The room had brick walls, and its size
was 2,650 cubic feet.
With a difference of temperature of 34 Fahr. (66 in- and 32 out-
side), the contents of the room .changed once in one hour, equal to
2,650 cubic feet.
With the same difference, but a good fire in the stove, whose com-
munication with the chinmey was made as free as possible, the change
of the air rose to 3,320 cubic feet, or about twenty-five per cent. When
all openings, crevices in windows and doors, were thoroughly pasted
up, there was still a change of 1,060 cubic feet per hour, or a fall of
twenty-eight per cent. With a difference of temperature of 71 in- and
64 outside, the change amounted to 780 cubic feet only per hour.
When opening a window of eight square feet, the change rose to 1,060
cubic feet per hour. These quantities are instructive. They show
that a difference of temperature of 34 with carefully-shut openings
