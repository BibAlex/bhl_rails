AQUEDUCTS. 35
to insure its being pure, and is then pumped up into service-reser-
voirs, whence it is distributed in the usual manner. The Chicago tun-
nel is three miles long, that of Milwaukee is shorter.
The Washington Aqueduct leads from a reservoir which impounds
the river-water at the Potomac Falls, is 16 miles long, and supplies
the cities of Washington and Georgetown. Its capacity is 70,000,000
gallons per day. The water is conveyed in a brick-and-rubble masonry
conduit, of circular form, to the service-reservoir five miles from the
city, and the rest of the way in three large cast-iron pipes capable of
delivering 30,000,000 gallons per day. This aqueduct was constructed
at the expense of the United States Government, and cost 13,000.000.
It has several fine bridges, of which the most notable is the one across
Cabin John Creek. This is a single granite arch, 100 feet high and
220 long. Another remarkable example of the wide, single arch oc-
curs on the Lisbon Aqueduct, finished in 1738. It is 115 feet wide
and 250 high.
By far the finest aqueduct in America is the Croton. This was
begun in 1837, and finished in 1842, at a cost of |8,575,000, with-
out the means of distribution, which cost $1,800,000 more. The
length of conduit from the impounding to the receiving-reservoirs in
Central Park is 38^ miles, for 33 of which the conduit is built of
stone, brick, and cement, arched above and below, 8 feet 5 inches
high, Q)\ feet wide at the bottom, and 7f at the top. The water
crosses Harlem River in two cast-iron pipes 3 feet in diameter, and
one wrought-iron pipe 7 feet 6 inches in diameter, laid upon High
Bridge, a magnificent granite arcade 1,460 feet long and 114 high.
It comprises 15 arches, 7 of which have 50 feet span, and 8, those over
the river, 80 feet. The fall is 1.10 foot per mile, the velocity of the
water 1^ mile an hour, and the possible discharge 115,000,000 gal-
lons per day.
For the first six years after the completion of the aqueduct, the
quantity of water used was only 18,000,000 gallons per day, but it has
now increased to over 88,000,000. The supply is drawn from Croton
River, a small stream that flows into the Hudson, a short distance
above Sing Sing. The river was arrested by a dam 40 feet high, and
made to form what is now called Croton Lake. The mouth of the
aqueduct is 12 feet below the surface of the lake, whereby it is pro-
tected from freezing up in winter, and the water is obtained pure
and cool in summer. The lake has an area of 400 acres, and usually
affords a daily supply of 50,000,000 gallons ; but this fell oflf, during a
severe drought seven or eight years ago, to only 27,000,000, and since
then another source has been added by damming up the western branch
of Croton River. The receiving-reservoirs, two in number, are located
in Central Park : the " old " covers 35 acres, and holds 150,000,000
gallons; the "new" covers 100 acres, and holds 1,030,000,000. The
distributing-reservoir is situated 2\ miles farther down, between Fifth
