20 THE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY,
this state (which he designated as hypnotism) could be induced in a
large proportion of individuals of either sex, and of all ranks, ages,
and temperaments, who determinately fix their gaze for several minutes
consecutively on an object brought so near to theii- eyes as to require
a degree of convergence of their axes that is maintainable only by a
strong effort.*
The first state thus induced is usually one of profound comatose
sleep ; the " subject " not being capable of being roused by sensory
impressions of any oi'dinary kind, and bearing without the least indi-
cation of consciousness what would ordinarily produce intolerable un-
easiness or even severe pain. But, after some little time, this state
very commonly passes into one of somnambulism, which again corre-
sponds closely on the one hand with natural, and on the other with
mesmeric, somnambulism. In fact, it has been by the study of the
somnambulism artificially induced by Mr. Braid's process that the
essential nature of this condition has been elucidated, and that a
scientific rationale can now be given of a large proportion of the
phenomena repoi'ted by mesmerizers as having been presented by
their somnambules.
It has been claimed for certain mesmeric somnambules, however,
that they occasionally possess an intelligence altogether superhuman
as to things present, past, and future, which has received the designa-
tion " lucidity ; " and it is contended that the testimony on which we
accept thereality of phenomena which are conformable to our scientific
experience ought to satisfy us equally as to the genuineness of those
designated as " the higher," which not only transcend but absolutely
contradict what the mass of enlightened men would regard as univer-
sal experience. This contention, however, seems to me to rest upon
an entirely incorrect appreciation of the probative force of evidence ;
for, as I shall endeavor to prove to you in my succeeding lecture, the
only secure basis for our belief on any subject is the confirmation
afforded to external testimony by our sense of the inherent probability
of the fact testified to; so that, as has been well remarked, " evidence
tendered in support of what is new must correspond in strength with
the degree of its incompatibility with doctrines generally admitted as
true; and, where statements obviously contravene all past experience
' Mr. Braid's peculiar success in inducing this state seemed to depend partly upon
his mode of working his method, and partly upon the " expectancy " of bis subjects.
Finding a bright object preferable, he usually employed his silver lancet-case, which he
held in the first place at ordinary reading-distance, rather above the plane of the eyes ;
he then slowly approximated it toward the middle point, a little above the bridge of
the nose, keeping his own eyes steadily fixed upon those of his " subject," and watch-
ing carefully the direction of their axes. If he perceived their convergence to be at all
relaxed, he withdrew the object until the axes were both again directed to it; and then
again approximated it as closely as was compatible with their continued convergence.
When this could be maintained for a sufficient length of time upon an object at no more
than about three inches' distance, the comatose state generally supervened.
