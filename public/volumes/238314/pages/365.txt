As for the gars, I should not mention them in this article, although
they are quite peculiar in several respects, were it not for one fact
connected with the nature of their skeleton. Their bones are of a

Nor is there anything very peculiar about the flying-fishes, except

ferent from all the fishes we have hitherto noticed. Their respiratory
