DOMESTIC EETEOSPECT AND PEOSPECT.'
By HEKBERT SPENCER.
INDUCTION has greatly predominated over deduction throughout
the foregoing chapters ; and readers who have "borne in mind
that Part II. closes with a proposal to interpret social })henomena
deductively, may infer either that this intention has been lost sight of,
or that it has proved impracticable to deal with the facts of domestic
life otherwise than by empirical generalization. On gathering to-
gether the threads of the argument, however, we shall find that the
chief conclusions forced on us by the evidence are those which Evo-
lution implies.
We have first the fact that, little as it might have been expected,
the genesis of the family fulKlls the law of Evolution under its lead-
ing aspects. In the rudest social groups nothing to be called mar-
riage exists : the unions of the sexes are extremely incoherent. Fam-
ily groups, consisting of mothers and such few children as can be
reared without permanent paternal assistance, are necessarily small
and soon dissolve : integration is slight. Within each group the re-
lationships are less definite ; since the children are mostly half-broth-
ers or half-sisters, and the paternity is often uncertain. From such
primitive families, thus small, incoherent, and indefinite, there arise,
in conformity with the law of Evolution, divergent and redivergent
types of families some characterized by a mixed polyandry and
polygyny ; some that are polyandrous, difierentiating into the fraternal
and non-fraternal ; some that are polygynous, differentiating into
those composed of wives and those composed of a legitimate wife and
concubines ; some that are monogamous, among which, besides the
ordinary form, there is the aberrant form distinguished by a wife
