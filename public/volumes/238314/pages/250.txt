In this diagram, the sun's rays being S', S", etc., BO, FO, etc.
will be the reflected rays ; and the several angles between these lines
of incidence and reflection, together with the number of rays reflected
^"-^^IW^.
NEBtTLOus Ring, with the Earth fob its Centre.
[The relative proportions of tiie earth and the ring, and also its distance, are of course not given
in this diagram with any etibrt at certainty ; the upward extent of the ring is probably far
greater than can be here represented. The diagram is, however, sufficiently correct for our
present purposes of elucidation.]
