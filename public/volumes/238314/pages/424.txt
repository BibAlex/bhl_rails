Death of Prof. Sanborn Tenney. We
have learned with regret of the death of
Prof. Tenney, which took place on July
9th, at Buchanan, Michigan. The sad event
was unexpected, as the deceased had, one
week previously, seemed to enjoy perfect
health. The cause of death is supposed to
have been heart-disease. From an appre-
ciative biographical sketch of the deceased
which has appeared in the New York World
we gather the following particulars about his
scientific labors : In 1808 he was Professor
of Natural History in Vassar College, and
in the same year accepted a like position in
Williams College. He had already pub-
lished an elementary text-book of geology,
which is still, after repeated revisions,
largely used in high-schools and academies.
He was a frequent contributor to periodi-
cal literature of scientific articles of a pop-
ular kind. The present number of the
Monthly contains probably the latest essay
of this description written by him. He was
an enthusiastic and careful student, a pupil
and admirer of Agassiz, and like his distin-
guished preceptor he excelled as a teacher.
Besides the " Geology " mentioned above.
Prof Tenney compiled several other pop-
ular text-books, among them one on zoolo-
gy. He occupied the chair of Natural His-
tory in Williams College down to the time
of his death. He was to have been in
charge of an expedition of college-students
to the far West this season, and on the
day he died was to have joined the expedi-
tion at Chicago.
Remains that were not prehistoric.
We have received from a source unknown
to us two clippings, from the Weekly Press,
presumably of Santa Bai'bara, Cahfornia, in
