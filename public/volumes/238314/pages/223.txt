At this moment I took two or three inhalations of oxygen, and at
once the pulse fell to 71. Then I omitted the oxygen, and moved a
little, when the pulse rose to 100, falling again to VO when I returned
to the oxygen. Ten times during an interval of one hour and twenty
minutes, and with the pressure ranging between 40 and 50 centimetres,
I at will produced these sudden oscillations, causing my pulse instant-
ly to rise or fall 20 beats. I may add that this is an experiment which
I do not mean to repeat, having suffered during that evening slight
congestive symptoms, which I attributed to these sudden changes of
cerebral circulation.
On the other hand, those experiments in which oxygen is respired
continuously are not followed by any injurious effects. Fig. 4 states
