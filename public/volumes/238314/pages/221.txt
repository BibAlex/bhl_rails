life of the bird is plainly not at all endangered. If I were to admit
oxygen once again, I might diminish the pressure still more.
Hence it appears that it is not the lowering of mechanical pressure
that produces the symptoms, but the low tension of the oxygen of the

dilated air, which low tension prevents the oxygen from entering the
blood in sufficient quantity.
This experiment I have made not only with sparrows, but also on
my own person ; and in the latter case the results are quite as strik-
ing as in the former, and I dare affirm, without vanity, no less inter-
esting.
By the kindness and liberality of Dr. Jourdanet, I have been en-
abled to set up in the jDhysiological laboratory of the Sorbonne great
apparatus, by the aid of which I have studied the effects of compressed
and dilated air. The dilated air-chamber consists of two cylinders of
riveted sheet-iron, from which the air is gradually exhausted by means
of a steam-pump (Fig. 2).
This apparatus I have entered, taking with me a large India-rubber
bag filled with oxygen. As the pump began to work, I experienced
all the well-known symptoms of mountain-sickness, viz., quickening of
respiration and pulse, which was considerably augmented by the least
movement ; sense of loathing, nausea, sensorial and intellectual pertur-
bation. I felt indifferent to everything and incapable of action. On
one occasion, having counted my pulse-beats for one-third of a minute,
I tried to multiply the number of beats by three, but could not do it,
and so was obliged to write on my bit of paper, " It is too difficult."
