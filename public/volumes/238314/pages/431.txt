the flora being derived chiefly from the
former, and the fauna mostly from the lat-
ter. The marine fauna of the coral region
of South Florida he pronounces a West In-
dian colony engrafted on the more or less
North American fauna of the east and west
coasts of the peninsula. Of the land ani-
mals the mammals are entirely North Amer-
ican. The batrachia and reptiles, too, belong,
with a very few exceptions, to North Ameri-
can species. The insects are probably of
mixed origin, coming from North America,
Cuba, and the Bahamas. The laud-shells
of the Keys are the same as those of the
mainland.
As regards the flora of Florida and its
Keys, the author says of the pine that it is
confined to the mainland, there being only
one small group of Keys which bears a
growth of pines. Pine-forests, indeed, are
characteristic of the shores of Florida, and
of all the Southern States, while the char-
acteristic trees of the Keys are fig-trees,
quassia, torch-wood, mahogany, and a few
others, interspersed with a dense shrubbery,
in which several species oi Euycnia are per-
haps most common.
How the American Aborigines disposed
of their Dead. The modes of disposing of
the bodies of the dead in use among the
aborigines of America are classed by Mr.
Edwin A. Barber, in the Naturalist, under
four heads, viz. : inhumation, cremation,
embalmment, and aerial sepulture. Of these,
the first was most usually employed, the
bodies being interred either in ordinary
graves, in mounds, or in caves. Several
tribes, among them the Lenni-Lenape, or
Delawares, were accustomed to incase their
dead in stone boxes or tombs. In tumulus-
burial, the dead were generally laid near the
original level of the surface, and the mound
heaped over them. Only isolated instances
of cave-burial have been signalized in the
United States, as in Breckenridge County,
Kentucky, and in the Canons of Utah, Arizo-
na, and New Mexico. Cremation was of two
kinds in graves and in urns. Among the
Pueblos of Arizona and Utah the body was
sometimes burned, and the ashes deposited
in shallow tombs. Several tribes on the
Gila River, in Southern Arizona, burned the
bones of the dead in urns. But few cases
of embalming are known to have occurred
in the limits of the United States. As ex-
amples of this mode of preparing the corpse
may be mentioned the Mammoth Cave and
Salt Cave mummies of Kentucky. These
bodies have been preserved by a rude spe-
cies of embalmment and by exsiccation.
Aerial sepulture was of two kinds the first
by suspension on scaflblds or in trees, the
second by sepulture in canoes. Several
tribes still employ the former mode of burial.
The Sioux elevate the bodies of their dead
into trees, or stretch them out on raised
platforms, wrapping them in blankets and
leaving them to the mercies of the elements
and carnivorous birds.
Accnratc Geological Estimates. A good
illustration of the exactness of modern geo-
logical science is found on comparing the
results actually obtained in the sinking of
artesian wells in London with the conclu-
sions reached by Prof. Prestwich as long
ago as 1851. In a work published in that
year, " A Geological Inquiry respecting the
Water-bearing Strata of the Country around
London," Prestwich made the prediction
that the chalk beneath London would be
found to have a thickness of 050 feet, the'
upper green-sand of 40 feet, and the gault
of 150 feet. At the time of this announce-
ment, as we learn from Nature, no well in
London had been sunk to a greater depth
than 300 feet in the chalk, but now there
are four deep borings which marvelously
confirm Prof. Prestwich's reasonings. We
take from our London contemporary the
following table, showing the results as cal-
culated by Prestwich, and as actually ascer-
tained by borings :

" When it is remembered," adds Nature,
" that the chalk graduates downward insen-
sibly into the upper green-sand, and that it
is almost impossible to decide on their line
of separation, it will be admitted on all
hands that the agreement between the es-
timated and proved results is marvelously
close."
