" What a splendid bird ! " was our remark to an individual who prac-
tised at the bar. " Yes, fine enough when stufied. But, you see, we
had to do it, he got so nasty." We observed tliat the plumage did
not indicate it. The man replied, quickly : " Oh, there was no rum-

whether by day or by night it would seem that want of food must
have started these birds on their journey. Could the severe arctic
winter, so disastrous to Captain Nare's expedition, have made this
scarcity ? It was during a pleasant autumn that these birds came
upon us. There must have been some sixty shot in my own vicinity.
A string of thirteen hung by a store in New York ; there were many
in the markets. One taxidermist in this city, it is said, had sixty left
with him to be stufied. Another in Philadelphia had about as many.
As early as September flocks of ten to fifteen were seen in difierent
places in Massachusetts. A number were shot in the city of Boston,
