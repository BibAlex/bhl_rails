AQUEDUCTS.

aqueduct on the west side of Rome ; and Sixtus V. (1585) restored
the aqueduct of Trajan by mistake for the Marcian. These two, the
former called Paola, and the latter Felice, continued to be the only
means of supply until 1870, when the real Marcian was restored by a
company of Englishmen and Romans. The water is brought as far as
Tivoli in a stone conduit, and the rest of the way in cast-iron pipes.
It has sufficient pressure to supply the tops of all the houses.

Reference has been made to the aqueduct now building for Paris.
The supply of water required is 22,000,000 gallons per day, and the
aqueduct was designed to convey that quantity. It is intended for
household use only, the existing supply, which is abundant for other
purposes, having become somewhat polluted. It was calculated that
the aggregate yield of the three rivers which are to be turned to ac-
count would be 28,000,000 gallons per day ; but subsequent observa-
tion has shown that in very dry seasons it falls considerably below
the quantity required. It was therefore found necessary to sink wells
or shafts into the chalky formation in which the rivers have their rise,
to artificially increase the supply. The plan comprises conduits for
collecting the waters from the several soiirces called " conduits of
derivation," and a main aqueduct to which these converge. The
former are together about 50 English miles long, and the latter is 110.
The main aqueduct has a fall of 73f feet, and terminates in service-
reservoirs at Belleville 83f feet above the level of the city. Along
