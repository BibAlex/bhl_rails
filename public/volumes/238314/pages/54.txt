ON THE HABITS OF ANTS.

paper bridges, I proceeded as follows : Any friends who came with
her were excluded from the bridges when she was on them. If she
was not there, as soon as a friend arrived at the bridge <?, I took up e
in my fingers and rubbed it lightly, with a view of removing or blur-
ring the scent ; and as soon as the ant arrived on d I took up the
bridge c, and put it across the chasm from d to h'. Now, if the ant
went by description, she would of course cross e to b. If, on the
(-)
other hand, she went by scent, then she would be at the least as
likely to go over c to b'. The results were that, out of about one hun-
dred and twenty friends who passed over J, only twenty went to the
food, while nearly one hundred passed over c to the empty glass.
In this case the friends generally came more or less in sight of one
another to the bridge c, and, once there, could hardly avoid arriving
either at b or b'. I therefore modified the experiment as follows : I
established and endowed an ant as before, imprisoning the friends
who came with her. When she got to know her way thoroughly,
I allowed her to return to the nest on her own legs, but as soon
as she emerged again I took her up and transferred her to the
food.
Under these circumstances, as will be seen, very few ants indeed
ever found their way to the food. I began this at 5.30, when she
retuimed to the nest. At 5.34 she came out with no less than ten
friends, and was then transferred to the food. The others wandered
about a little, but by degrees returned to the nest, not one of them
finding her way to the food. The first ant took some food, returned,
and again came out of the nest at 5.39 with eight friends, when ex-
actly the same happened. She again came out
