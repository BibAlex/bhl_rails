OK THE EVOLUTION OF THE FAMILY.
By HERBERT SPENCER.
LET US now look at the connections between types of family and
social types. Do societies of different degrees of composition
habitually present different forms of domestic arrangement? Are
different forms of domestic arrangement associated with the militant
system of organization and the industrial system of organization ?
To the first of these questions, no satisfactory answer can be given.
The same marital relation occurs in the simplest groups and in the
most compound groups. A strict monogamy is observed by the mis-
erable Wood Veddahs, living so widely scattered that they can scarce-
ly be said to have reached the social state ; and the wandering
Bushmen, similarly low, though not debarred polygyny, are usually
monogamic. Certain settled and slightly advanced tribes, too, are
monogamic ; as instance the New Guinea people, and as instance also
the Dyaks, who have reached a stage passing from simple into com-
pound. And then we have monogamy habitual with nations which
have become vast by aggregation and reaggregation. Polyandry,
again, is not restricted to societies of one order of composition. We
find it in simple groups, as among the Fuegians, the Aleutians, and
the Todas ; and we find it in compound groups in Ceylon, in Malabar,
in Thibet. Similarly with the distribution of polygyny. It is common
to simple, compound, doubly-compound, and even trebly-compound
societies.
One kind of connection between the type of family and the degree
of social composition may, however, be alleged. Formation of com-
pound groups, implying greater coordination and the strengthening
of restraints, implies more settled arrangements, public and private.
