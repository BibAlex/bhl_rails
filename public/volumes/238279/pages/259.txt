Anniversary meethig, Col. R. L. Taylor in the chair, and after all
the usual routine business had been transacted, and a vote of thanks
unanimously passed to the Treasurer for his efficient services, on
his announcing a balance to the credit of the Club of £14 7s. Id. on
the year, the resignation of the Kev. H. H. Winwood, as Hon. Sec,
was accepted with great regret, and it was unanimously decided to
present him with a small token of the esteem and gratitude of
the members of the club. A sum of £25 from the funds of
the club was voted towards the purchase of a suitable object, the
selection of which was left to the decision of the committee.
This article was subsequently selected to be a Petrological
Microscope, designed and patented by Mr. Allan B. Dick, and
manufactured by Messrs. Swift and Son, of 81, Tottenham Court
Road, with its necessary fittings and adjuncts.
At an aftei-noon meeting on March 16th, largely attended by
members of the club, and lady visitors, the chair was taken by
Mr. H. D. Skrine, the Chairman of the Field Club.
The Chairman, prior to the commencement of the proceedings,
read a letter from the Rev. L. Blomefield, the following being an
extract : —
Belmont, Bath ; March 15th, 1892.
Dear Mr. Chairman,— I much regret that my great age, with its
attendant infirmities, renders it impossible for me to be present on tlie
occasion for which the members of the Field Club meet together to-
morrow. Otherwise, it would have given me great pleasure, as
president of the club, to be the instrument of presenting to so old a
friend, and for so long a time one of the most active members of the
club, as Mr. Winwood, our secretary, the intended testimonial. . . .
