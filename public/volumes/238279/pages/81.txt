appended balance sheet will show, and the members are indebted
to Mr. Graham for havmg undertaken the office of Treasurer
during the absence of C^olonel Chandler from England. Seven
vacancies have occurred by death and resignations, and ten new
members have been elected during the year, so that the numbers
remain about the same. In conclusion, the attention of members
is called to the great advantage that may arise to tlie study both
of Archseology and Geology by the more frequent use of the
camera. Many old houses and important historical bits, as well
as geological sections, may be preserved from oblivion by its use.
Whilst several additions have been made during the past year to
the Club's album through the kindness of Dr. Mantell and
Mr. Norman, there is still plenty of room for more, and there
are several sections asking to be photographed before they are
grown over and lost to view.

Note. â€” Since the above was being prepared we regret to
record the decease, on Easter Eve, at Tangier, of the Vice-
President of the Club, the Rev. Preb. Scarth. As one of the
original members and an ardent archaeologist his loss will be-
much felt, and his place supplied with difficulty.
