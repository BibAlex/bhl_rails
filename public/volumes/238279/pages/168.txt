Kingswood Forest, so that it is not very long ago when there
were special reasons for giving special names to enclosures,
marking them as legal (or sometimes, probably, illegal),
enclosures from the surrounding open country or forest. We
have a good instance of such a country in the neighbouring
county of Wilts, where very large farms exist, but where
the enclosed parts of the farms are often not more than one-tenth
or even one-twenlieth of the whole ; the rest is all open unen-
closed country. In connection with this I would mention that
we have several fields still called moor and heath, which, no doubt,
mark the site of old open country though now long enclosed.
We have Kipsley Moor, Kenn Moor, Waddown Moor, Press
Moor, and Aldermoor. We have also Moorcroft which would be
a croft adjoining the moor, and I should have mentioned Croft
among the generic names, for it is a very old word meaning a
little field. It is used in the 14th century by Langland* in
Piers Plowman, who also mentions Parrok. But besides Moor-
croft we have in Bitton only one other field called the Croft now
part of the Vicar's glebe. Besides the moors and the commons
previously mentioned we have Wigley Common, and we have
Hanham Heath, now called Hanham Common, and Caddy or
Cadbury Heath. There is still heather to be gathered on
Hanham Common, but Cadbury Heath is built on and cultivated,
and the nearest place where I can now find heather is on Siston
Common, just over the borders of the Parish, and on the railway
banks adjoining it, and these banks are now getting gradually
covered not only with heather but also like the neighbouring
Kodway Hill with the dwarf gorse, uhx nanus, a somewhat
uncommon plant, very like the common gorse, but sufiiciently
distinguished by some slight botanical differences and especially
by its low prostrate habit, and by its flowering in the autumn
and even in the early winter, instead of in the spring and early
summer.
