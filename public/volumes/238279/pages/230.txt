long entertained, of founding a religious house. "When," says
the Book of Lacock, " Ela had now survived her husband for
seven years in widowhood, she was directed in visions that she
shall build a monastery in honor of S. Mary and S. Bernard, in
the meadow called Snails' Mead, near Lacock. Accordingly on
the 16th April, 1232, she founded two monasteries in one day, in
the morning that of Lacock, in which holy canonesses might dwell

foundations, but its accuracy may be doubted, though there is no
physical impossibility with regard to the transaction, the distance
being between the two places not more than 15 miles. Canon
Bowles, in his " Annals of Lacock Abbey," questions the truth of
this double foundation on the same day, on the authority of the
Chronicle before referred to, which fixes the date of the founda-
tion of Hinton on the 6th November, 1227, and other documents,
but the story is a quaint one and ought to be mentioned in this
connexion.
Ela's object in founding the Hinton Priory was no doubt in
part attributable to respect for her husband's memory and wishes.
Longespe had founded a Carthusian House at Hatherop, in
Gloucestershire,* under the name of " Locus Dei," but the monks
had apparently found the place unsuitable, and Ela accordingly
translated the foundation, gi-anting in exchange for Hatherop her
Manor of Hinton with the advowson of the Church and also the
Manor and advowson of Norton, to found a Carthusian House in the
honour of God, the Blessed Mary, St. John the Baptist and All
Saints, to be erected in the Park of Hinton .f Ela herself took
the veil on Christmas Day, 1238, in the seventh year after the
foundation of Lacock ; and, on the Feast of the Assumption of
