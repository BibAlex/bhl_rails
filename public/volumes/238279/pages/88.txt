Nothing can be wholly devoid of interest, which relates to the
renaissance of Bath in the 18th century, or to the great citizen
and the great statesman, whose names are prefixed to these notes.
I do not, therefore, apologise to the Club for the meagreness of
my immediate subject ; however much I may owe an apology for
