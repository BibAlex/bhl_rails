Dear Sir,
The repeated instances of your kind friendship, and too

account, makes me hope your gooduess will accept them for something.
I send open to you, for your perusal, two letters for Mr. Mayor, one
private in answer to his receivd yesterday, the other for the
Corporation : if you will be so good to seal them, and order them to
be delivered to Mr. Mayor I shall be much obliged to you. You will

able to attend them in person at my Election, the thing will be
utterly impossible, and I trust the necessity of affairs and my
indispensable attendance on His Majesty will excuse me, I shall be
better able towards autumn to wait on the Corporation, and hope no
impression of want of due respect will remain, when the peculiarity of
my situation, at the present moment is considered. I must in this, as

my distress. I am with my whole Heart Dear Sir,
Your ever obliged and
Affectionate Servant,
My best respects W. Pitt.
to Mrs. Allen and
Mrs. Warburton.
