The Eev. W. W. Martin (the newly appointed secretary),
then read a letter from the Eev. Canon EUacombe, M.A., who
was also unable to attend the meeting. An extract from the
letter is appended : —
Bittoa ; March 9th.
Dear Martin, — There is no chance my being able to attend the
meeting on the iSth, and I am very sorry for it. I should very much
have liked to have been present whea the club gave Winwood the
well-earned token of their appreciation of his services. . . . There
is probably no member of the club who can speak from experience so
well of Winwood's services as I can, for I have been a member during
the whole time of his secretaryship. I do not exaggerate when I say
that he has been an ideal secretary. He has not ouly been unwearied
in his work, but has carried it through in a way that has given great
pleasure to others. . . . Speaking for myself, among the many
pleasures of my life, my intercourse with the Bath Field Club has
brought me many happy days, and for much of that 1 feel myself chiefly
indebted to the secretary.
I remain, yours very truly,
Hugh Ellacombe.
In making the presentation, which consisted of a valuable
petrological microscope, the Chairman, on behalf of the Members,
expressed their indebtedness to the Eev. H. H. Winwood for his
earnest exertions in supporting the Club for so many years, and
expressed a hope that he might live long to see it flourish and
continue its delightful discoveries in science, and its observations
into the wonders of nature. The microscope bore the following
inscription : —
Presented to the
Eev. H. H. Winwood, M.A., F.G.S.,
By the Members of the
Bath N. H. and A. Field Club,
On his resigning the post of Honorary Secretary,
Which he had filled with untiriiig zeal and ability
For nearly Thirty Years.
18th February, 1892.
