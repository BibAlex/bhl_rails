the Blessed Virgin, A.D. 1240, she assumed the government of
the Nunnery as Abbess, in which office she remained for 18 years,
after which time she lived in retirement for five years, " and at

Chartreuse, near Grenoble, which had then been in existence
about 100 years, and procured the sending over of Hugo (after-

dedication of Hinton was copied from that of Witham. The site
chosen differed materially from that of the older Priory. Witham
was founded in an " eremus," that is, a wild uncultivated tract,
which was given to the Brethren to bring into cultivation, in
