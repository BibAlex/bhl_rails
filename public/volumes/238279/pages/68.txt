music room, is preserved a table, on which the late Sir Herbert
Stewart burnt his name with a red-hot poker, when a member of
the College, for which he duly received punishment. The
dormitories, the dining hall, the second chapel, and the playing
meads were all visited in turn, and the curious painting of the
" Trusty Servant," in the small room adjoining the kitchen, was

postponed, and a visit to Badminton substituted. The day was
lovely, and the country looked beautiful, but the drive there and
