strength, and may be expected to derive great advantage from
his assistance.
The Anniversary Meeting was held on the 18th of February,
1890, as usual, ■when the Officers and Committee were reappointed,
and the Excursions for the year fixed ; and on Wednesday,
March 5 th, the fourth and last afternoon meeting for the session,
1890, was held at the Literary Institution. Mr. H. D. Skrine
presided, and the first paper read was one by Mr. Austin J. King
on " Some Memorials of Ralph Allen and William Pitt."
This communication, full of interesting local information
respecting the great citizen and the great statesman of the 18th
century, is printed in full at p. 99.
Mr. Skrine, in moving a vote of thanks to Mr. King for his
paper, said that there was a good deal of doubt as to where Allen
obtained the bulk of his wealth. He had considerable property
in quarries, and he wished it to be believed that he made his
money from them. It was generally supposed, however, that he
made more from his mail contracts with the Government. His
first contract was takea for £G,000 and this was afterwards
renewed for £20.000 so that he must have secured a good profit
from it, otherwise he would not have so largely increased his
offer on the renewal.
Llr. Shuji followed, and remarked that the best house in the
Circus, No. 7, was built for William Piit after his first election,
when he had an idea of residing in Bath. Good houses were
scarce in those days, and many were built specially for the great
men who took up their residence here.
The Rev. H. H. WiNWOOD drew attention to the remnant of
Allen's town house which was still standing within a stone's throw
of the Institution, and remarked that it was worth visiting by
anyone who did not know it. He said the club was much
indebted to Mr. King for the addition of some further interesting
pages to local history.
Mr. King, in replying, stated that the letters which he produced
