On February 1st, 1893, a paper was read before the Club by
the Kev. H. H. Win wood, vice-president, on certain deep well
borings in Somerset, and Col. J. T. Chandler presented an
ancient deed lent to him by Major C. H. Simpson, which records
the terms by which the British Crown acquired the regal rights
of the Dukes of AthoU over the Isle of Man. The first paper is
printed at page 335, the second as Appendix II to this Summary.
The Chib starts on a new year with a roll of members numl^er-
ing well nigh the maximum of 100 whereat the bye-laws limit
the number of members. The past year's obituary of members
has been very small. Only two have departed to the Great
Majority, the Eev. Hayes Robinson and Major J. "Wedgwood
Yeeles, the former a member of the Field Club since 1883, the
latter since 1866. Amongst the large number of gentlemen, now
on the Club's register it is to be hoped many will during this year
make their researches in their various sciences and favourite
pursuits with such success that more papers may be forthcoming
at the close of the excursion season on interesting discoveries,
and the particular objects of the Club's formation, the Natural
History, Geology, Botany, and Antiquities of the neighbourhood.
