In comparing the overlying formations met with in Somerset-
shire with those which prevail in the coalfields of the North of
France and Belgium, a remarkable contrast presents itself, there
being there almost an entire absence of everj'thing between the
Coal Measures and the Greensand, which itself is absent in places,
the Chalk resting directly and unconformably upon the upturned
edges of the Coal Measures.
The thickness of strata which has thus disappeared, as esti-
mated by Professor Prestwich from the points of outcrops nearest
London, is as follows : —
2,000
Weald Clay and. Hastings Sand
Purbeck and Portland Beds ...
Kimnieridge Clay
Coral Rag and Oxford Clay . . .
Oolites
Lias
New Eed Sandstone ...

An examination of the overlying formations shows that
throughout the entire range of the French and Belgian Coal-
field, the Coal jNIeasures ai'e either overlaid by the Chtdk alone,
or by the Chalk and Greensand, but in certain areas these are
hidden by a covering of Tertiary Strata, the complete section iu
the latter case being as follows : —
Shaft Sections and Borings near Mons.
Quaregnou Shaft.
Erick Earth and Gravel
Tertiary Sands
White Chalk
Chalk Marl
