warm, and the Mauduit Chapol to the south of the chancel has a
second altar, and is evidently used for the week-day services.
Leaving this church a visit was paid to the magnificent public
baths, a present to the town of Westbury in the Jubilee year of
Her Majesty the Queen from the late member for the borough,
Mr. Laverton. The swimming bath is large and well fitted with
dressing cabinets, seats and a gallery for spectators. The water,
evidently derived from the neighbouring chalkdown, is of an
exquisite azure hue, and is kept at 72 deg. F. Having seen all
that deserves being seen in Westbury the Field Club returned to
the saloon carriage kindly placed at their disposal by the G.W.E.
Company, and found themselves safely back in Bath after a
bitterly cold day, but very instructive excursion.
The Excursions of the year having thus been duly concluded,
the members of the Field Club had the great pleasure of hearing
that their venerable founder and President, the Eev. Leonard
Blomefield, M.A., F.G.S., F.L.S., had received from the Linnean
Society a congratulatory address on his attaining the 70th
anniversary of his election as a member, and a unanimous wish
was expressed by the members of the Field Club to have the said
address and their respected President's reply to the same recorded
in their Proceedings. The consent of the Rev. L. Blomefield
having been graciously accorded, the address and reply here
follow ! â€”
