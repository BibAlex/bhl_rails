ever veins of warm water abound new lodging houses (nova
diversoria) will be immediately built to gratify your luxury.
Whether the meaning here would be equivalent to any thing we
know as a lodging house must be left an open question. Some
accommodation there must have been as the place, with such
magnificent baths, must be judged to have been much what it has
been and may be still, a place of ease and idleness ; a mixture of
groans, music, and flippancy ; a resting place for humanity, old,
infirm and in ruins ; a comfortable thoroughfare from this world
to the next.
Where a ground plan has been so closely built over as here at
Bath fresh discoveries are necessarily somewhat difficult to make.
Caution too should be exercised before determining the use of any
remains. Of Temple or Forum nothing is known, but now that-
so much is known of the extent of the baths, the architectural
details found may have belonged to them rather than to a
Temple, especially as Minerva who is so often indicated in the
finds, was directly the patroness of such waters as these of Bath.
Also, after so long a lapse of time many changes will have^
occurred, so that the line or frontage of any street or way as seen-
must not be too rigidly accepted as original. The line of Westgate
Street and Cheap Street, in the process of widening, and encroach-
ing southward, will be found, like Stall Street, to be over Roman
remains. The Roman street will, probably, be found under the-
northern side. Other less important ways will have deviated
to meet later requirements, whilst others, especially in the north
eastern block will have entirely disappeared. Some portion too
â– would be garden ground. But the chief points herein humbly
suggested may be even now easily and inexpensively proved and
without inconvenience to traffic, by the employment of a couple of
men for a short spell with those useful and necessary exploring,
instruments, the ordinary pick and spade.
