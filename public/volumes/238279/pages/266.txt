Having done full justice to the hostess' excellent repast, the
Eev. Canon Ellacombe gave the company a brief resum6 of the
history of Siideley Castle, and stated that of the building
originally constructed in the reign of King Stephen only a very
small remnant existed in the base of one of the towers. Con-
