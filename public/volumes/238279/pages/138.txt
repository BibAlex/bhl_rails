The amateur photographers having taken some views of the
Manor House and Church, the members rejoined the break and
trundled through the fields to the main road for Bradford, where
they arrived about 3 p.m. ; lunched at the Swan Hotel — about
which the least said the better — and then visited the Ecclesiola
and the Parish Church adjoining. Since the former visit of the
Club to the Saxon Church, a low wall, surmounted by an
ornamental railing, has been erected round the South side ; tliis
■did not meet with approval, the general idea prevailing that
something more in character with the simplicity of the architecture
would have been better. A visit was afterwards paid to the fine
Parish Church, and its architectural details pointed out by
Mr. Browne, and then the steep ascent breasted to the little
hermitage chapel on the hill or torr, called Tory Chapel. The
view from the top was very fine, with the picturesque town of
Bradford and its well built houses bespeaking the former
importance and wealth of its inhabitants, below ; the fine
Elizabethan building, Kingston House, in the middle distance,.
