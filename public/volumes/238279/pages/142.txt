The Library of the CUib continues to receive many valuable
additions from the U.S. Geological Survey and from other
societies with which a mutual exchange of publications takes
place. Owing to the many alterations effected in the Literary
and Scientific Institution during the past year, an arrangement
has been made with the authorities, whereby, for the annual
payment of £5, the Field Club has secured the use of the
Lecture Hall for its Afternoon Meetings and of the Conversation
Room for the Annual, Quarterly and Committee Meetings. In
this latter room the Library will be placed, so that the books
will be more accessible to the members than they have hitherto
been. The members also of the Institution have the privilege of
referring to, but not of taking them away. From the annual
statement of accounts appended, it will be seen that there is a
balance in favour of the Club of only 6d. This may be
accounted for by the exceptional expenditure arising from the
subscription of £5 towards the Scarth Memorial Window, erected
in St. Mary's, Bathwick, and from the sum of £9 expended in
the purchase of an oak bookcase, items which will not occur
again.
