not worth dwelling upon, but they are all old English words,
each with its own history, and each worth stopping with for a
short time.
Field is of course the largest of all. It is a genuine old Saxon
word, found in all the northern nations of Europe in the different
forms of field, feld, veld, velt, etc. It is generally joined with
some word showing the size or shape, as ten-acre field, six acre
field, long field, broad field, (corrupted as a place-name to Brad-
field), 3-cornered field, etc.
Meadow, or Mead, is another very old English word. It occurs
in several of our oldest autliors, and in the different vocabularies it
is always given as the translation oipratum, and in them we also find
mention of the meadow-sweet or meadow-wort, which I have no
doubt is the same plant which we now call by that name.*
And the English meadow was exactly the Latin pratum, culti-
vated ground for grass only, and not brought under the plough
and so always green, (Cicero speaks of inatorum hcrbescens viri-
ditas).-\- And this was certainly the English meadow, which in
its A. S. derivation is the mowed ground. The meadow was
always a jjasture of large extent ( " wide-skirted meads " is
Shakespeare's description), yielding a quantity of rich but not
very superior grass. In our part of the country the meadows are
all lowland pastures, and hay dealers draw a wide distinction
between upland and meadow hay.
Close is also an old English word, though it is derived directly
from the Latin Glausura, or locus indusus. It probably almost
always meant a place enclosed with walls (the Promptorium has
" cloos or yerde, clausura," and yerde is the yard or garden), and so
