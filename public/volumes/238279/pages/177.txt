song was sung, and a " lesson " by the same composer was played
on wind instruments. According to the Stationers' books the
song was published as : The Shepherds Songe before Queen Anne,
in four parts complete musical upon the Playnes of Salisbury.
The Queen was greatly delighted at this episode, and the Vicar
was made Chaplain to the King.* Generally, too, the Queen
received such great entertainment and was so well pleased with

more such progresses. +
The satisfaction thus expressed was evidently real for on the
27th July, little more than a month after her return, she prepared
to repeat the visit. The King preceded her somewhat but did
not forget her, as by Privy Seal he ordered the Treasurer to pay
the Gentleman Usher of his dearest wife ยฃ200, she being purposed
to go to the Bath this Fall to use the benefit of the waters, and

rewards or other services. J The King, starting alone, went first
to Tottenham and then by Lydyard, Bromham, Amesbury, and
Wilton to Salisbury, where he arrived on the 3rd August.
The Queen took another route, going by Oatlands, Elverton
(Elvetham), Basing, Husband (Hurstbourne), dined at Wallop
and then to Salisbury, Mr. Hyde's house and the Dean's house
being prepared for her.ยง At Sahsbury she joined the King.||
Charges were duly entered for making ready the church for the
King and Queen four times ; the Bishop's house for the feast on
the 5th August ; and standings twice for the King and Queen to
see the football play.^ On the 9th a trip was made to Cranborne,
