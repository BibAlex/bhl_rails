the idea or conclusion seems, unavoidable that a Eoman bridge
must have existed there. Such a bridge would be presumably of
timber laid level on stone piers.
As already noticed the actual only authority for much that
Warner has said must be -Tohn Wood, but Wood when wiiting
on any but his own subject, architecture, must not be too easily
credited. Wood then is the first who says without giving
reference or authority, that this bridge and chapel were dedicated
to St. Lawrence. Save that Barton Fair was held on St. Lawrence
day the saint seems hardly localised. St. Katherine should have
been the dedication when all surroundings are considered, she
being everywhere present without and within the city. Her
image stood in Stalls church, practically then the parish church
■of Lyncombe and Widcombe, and to it oblations and gifts were
made. Then in the old oath of a Freeman, often quoted, when
he swore " Seynt Katern day " he would " Kepe holy day " and
" Seynt Katern chapell and the brygge help to mentayne and to
susteyne," Ave have again a very close association. This however
must be taken as simply a passing thought recorded only to draw
attention to the point.
Whilst regretting that all efforts to find more evidences and
more details have at present failed and that after so much
•criticism any point should be left unsettled, there yet remains
the great consolation that some advance has been made, as
without the beautiful drawings now for the first time brought to
aiotice and so well reproduced, no useful criticism was possible.
