2. — Perchers.
Derive tlieir name from the form of the foot which is perfectly
adapted for perching or grasping, the hind toe being always
developed.
This is a very large division in which is found a large propor-
tion of our local birds ; it is sub-divided according to the shape
of the bill.
A. — Wide Billed.
So called from the enormous width of gape, taking food
principally on the wing; feet not well developed.
The Swallow, Swift, Martin and Sand Martin are all summer
visitants ; the Nightjar, also a summer visitant, is the only
nocturnal bird of this series, living on night-flying insects. It
is occasionally seen in the Bath district, the specimen in the
museum comes from Cliffe Pypard, Wilts.
Included in this series is the Kingfisher, whose brilliant
plumage is not unfrequently seen along the banks of our river.
Terry mentions the Bee Eater, but the reference is uncertain,
as the bird was only sighted near Old Widcombe Church in 1850.
B.— Climbers.
Toes arranged in pairs for climbing, also stiff bristly tail to
serve as support ; extensile tongue for catching insects.
It is impossible to refer to all the birds in this group ; so only
mentioning the names of the Common Creeper, Nuthatch, Wren,
Cuckoo and Wryneck we pass to the Woodpeckers.
The Great Black Woodpecker is denied by many ornithologists
to be a British species, but the Eev. A. C. Smith reports one
having been shot at Longleat many years ago, which is now in
the collection of Mr. James Rawlence, Bulbridge, Wilton.
There are three Woodpeckers in the Museum, the Great
Spotted, the Lesser Spotted, and the Green Woodpecker.
