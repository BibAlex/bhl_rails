Gate, where they presented a silver cup with cover and a salver
all in a rich case of crimson velvet laid with gold,* and the
Mayor in most solemn manner on behalf of the city wished the
Queen a happy journey. Outside the city gate the Sheriff and
his men were waiting and conducted the cavalcade to the confines
of the county. All being gone, the Mayor invited the Corporation
to his house, where they drank cheerfully her Majesty's and the
Prince's healths.
The route taken was by Marlborough, where the party was
splendidly received ; the scholars of the Free School recited some
verses and the Town Clerk delivered a long speech. As the
Queen passed she was met by a great number of shepherds with
their crooks and tar boxes, playing upon pipes and reeds ; also a
company of spinners with their wheels appeared, and all tasted
liberally of her Majesty's bounty. So Windsor was safely reached.
The journey seems to have attracted more than usual attention,
as on the 13th, at Kensington, the Lord Mayor and Court of
Aldermen waited on her Majesty to congratulate her on her
arrival from Bath, and invited her to a banquet in the city, which
she accepted.

following year 1703, the Queen determined to repeat her trip
and this being decided, before starting a special survey was made
of the roads, the report being that they were so bad no passage
could be made, and suggesting an indictment.f On the 18th
August accompanied by her husband the Queen set out. The
daily movements are not now detailed on the rolls as of old ; but
the roads must have been repaired as the travelling seems to have
been much faster. Reading and other usual stopping places were
passed, the first night being now spent at the Duke of Somerset's
near Marlborough ; and next day, Thursday, the 19 th, after dining
at Laycock, Bath was reached about seven in the evening. On
