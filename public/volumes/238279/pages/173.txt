sweep of grass, edged on its steep inclines with woods of which
many still remain, it would well represent an ancient lawnde or
Lons.
One field is called the Girt which I cannot explain, but it is a
curiously formed field and I have no doubt the name in some way,
perhaps corrupted, is derived from the peculiarity. The field is a
steep field and near the top is a curious little valley converted
into an orchard, evidently of water-formation, and is a small
combe except that it is at the top instead of at the bottom of the
hill.*
There are two fields called Pilgrim's Pye and Fieldgrove Pye,
of which the last word is a puzzle, and so is the last word of Barn
Show, which may, however, be Barn Shaugh, or Barnwood. And
there are some fields called Kimmercombe, Cammercombe, or
Kimbercombe, of which I suppose the first part to be a proper
name, but, as the land is high ground, the " combe " does not seem
appropriate. We know that Kingswood is Sylva Eegis, but Kings-
field I suppose to be from a proper name and not connected
with Royalty.
I must lump together a few of which I can offer no explana-
tion ; as Trap's Stile, Veltam or Neltam, Pond Leg or Pound Leg,
The Draft, Innox, Neddy Mayle or Myle Ground, Roborrow,
Hencliff,t Lye Ash, Mole House Ground, The Penns, Logus or
Laggage, The Breaches, Blowbottle Patch, Rhymus, and Vara
Shoard.
With respect to the age of these names, I think very few of our
present field names are very old ; I mean they are not in any
sense mediaeval. This would naturally be the case from what I
said before about the modern date of enclosures generally. There
are no old field names in Domesday, I believe ; certainly not in
* It has been suggested to me that girt is simply the local
pronunciation of great. I cannot quite agree to that.
