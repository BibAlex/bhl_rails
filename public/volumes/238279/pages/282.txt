An exploration was made as to the construction of a canal,
which could easily be built 2 kilometres long.
They afterwards passed the Poclimelnyj, Dolgij and Sjamanskij
rapids, and on the 23rd August, the last on the Angara, the
Strelkovskij, and after various adventures arrived eventually at
Yeneseisk
The conclusion arrived at as to the navigability of the Angara
was that a specially constructed steamer drawing 2'4" of water
should be able to travel from Yeneseisk all the way to Irkutsk,
and ascend all the rapids including even the Podun.
The Angara, unlike other Siberian rivers, is almost entirely free
from shifting sandbanks.
The party travelled again in a tarantass from Yeneseisk to
Tomsk, and thence by steamer to within 130 versts of Tjumen,
being prevented by the lowness of the water from proceeding
further and had a further journey of 437 versts in Tarantass to
Ekaterinburg.
On September 9th they passed the border line between Europe
and Asia, and arrived in Petersburg on September 16th, after
having in less than 3 months travelled about 14,000 versts, of
which nearly 4, GOO had been in a Tarantass.
