Excursions.
Berkeley Castle. — The first excursion took place on April 14th to
Berkeley Castle, under the guidance of Mr. AV. Daubeny in the
absence of the Secretary. Eighteen members joined the Midland
train for Berkeley, waited the usual time in the porter's lodge ;
visited the Castle and Church, did full justice to the fare provided
by " mine host " of the Berkeley Arms Hotel, the main portion of
the party enjoying a pleasant Avalk back to Berkeley Road Junction
and returned to Bath 5.22. The weather was beautiful and the
excursion to the old Borough of Berkeley pleasant. Mr. Daubeny
has been prevented from giving his promised " Notes on Berkeley,"
which were too voluminous to read during the excursion.
Stanton Drew. — The Geological excursion to the Lias cuttings
in the Polden Hills on the Bridgwater Eailway was given up
owing to the inability of Mr. Mostyn Clarke the author of the
paper printed in the last number of our Proceedings to be present;
and one to Stanton Drew, conducted by Mr, W. Daubeny
substituted.
A party of nine members started on Tuesday, May 26th, 1891,
at 11.30, in a well appointed drag, supplied by Mr. Ames, for
Stanton Drew, which they reached about 1 p.m. via Keynsham.
More members would have joined the party but for illness and
the uncertain appearance of the weather. The Vicar of Stanton
Drew, the Eev. H. T. Perfect, most kindly met the party at the
church, and pointed out its interesting features, both externally
and internally, and exhibited several drawings of it, taken at
different periods. The church has undergone repeated alterations,
the greater part of it having been rebuilt in 1847, when the top
of the tower was taken down and re-erected. The date, 1629,
appears in the tower, and it is conjectured that the south aisle.
