Dotted promiscuously about the moor are beds of Brick Eartl*
sometimes of considerable extent. Half way to Bawdrip, where
the line crosses the main road, one of these beds descends firm
and hard to a considerable depth, while close beneath the hill ia
Bawdrip itself it becomes very soft, and is much charged with water.

and lastly the Eed Marl of the Trias. There is a belief in the-
locality that in places a vegetable bed underlies the clay. This
seemed to be borne out by a boring sunk close to the crossing of
the Great Western Eailwaj^ which disclosed a thin bed of brownish
coloured sand, containing remains of a species of jointed reed ;
the specimens, unfortunately, fell to pieces. Among these remains
a Saurian's tooth was also found. In cutting the side drains a
thin layer of clay, a fraction of an inch in thickness, was met
with some two feet below the surface of the ground. It was of a
bright blue colour, entirely different from that above and below it,
and extended over that portion of the line which is upon the
moor, and may, perhaps, be a memorial of some great flood or
inundation in bygone times.
We now pass to the most important portion of the Geology of
the railway. The first cutting, lying almost directly north of
Bawdrip Church, is of very slight extent, being only a feAV chains
long, and 14ft. in the deepest place. It is entirely in the Eed
Marl, whose denuded surface probably rises in a gradual slope
from the point where it was previously met with beneath the
bank of King's Sedgemoor Drain. The Eed Marl was also
touched in the foundations of the road-bridge directly north of
Bawdrip Church;
