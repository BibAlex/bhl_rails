N. aisle. The wooden roof of the nave is good 15th century
work, to which date the rest of the architecture belongs, with tlie
exception of the tower which is late Norman, as shown by the
fine &tone pannelled belfry windows. Indications of Norman
work having been utilised in the 15th century appear everywhere
in the walls (which are left in their rough state, a cold look
being the o-esult), especially in a pretty piece of pannelling on
the outside of the S. wall. Some good herring-bone work, coeval
with the tower, is seen at the base of the S. wall of the chancel,
also in the vestry. The N. porch has been considerably altered, and
the present wooden roof lowered in Perpendicular times as there
are evident traces of a room or parvise chamber having formerly
existed above. Two curious Perpendicular corbels supporting the
roof are seen on the inside of the N. aisle projecting on each side
of the window jambs. A Sanctus Cote is on the outside at the
junction of the chancel with the nave, and a curious angular
buttress built against the middle of the N. wall of the tower
between the two flat Norman buttresses, probably for support at
some later period. Attention was directed to the following
epitaph on a plain tombstone in the churchyard at the S. E. end
of the church, stated by the Kev. Wynter Elathwayt, present
Eector of Dyrham, to have been erected by his uncle :—
A. S. B. died 14th Jan., 1840, aged 10 days.
The cup of life, just to her lips she prest ;
Found its taste bitter, and denied the rest.
Averse then turning from the light of day,
She softly sighed her little life away.
Another version —
Just to her lips the cup of life she prest ;
Found the taste bitter, and refused the rest,
Then gently turning from the face of day
She sweetly sighed her little life away.
