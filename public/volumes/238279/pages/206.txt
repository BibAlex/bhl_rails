been found in England during the last few years, and that it was
not generally known that the Lias shales of our own neighbour-
hood had been found to yield that gas, though not of any
commercial value ; he advocated the Neptunean theory of the
production of Minerals, therein differing from the writer of the
paper who had held the theory of the gaseous state of the earth's
centre and had attributed Bitumen to that origin.
On February 15th, 1881, the evening Meeting was set
apart for Charles Moore and myself, Avhen he was to have
communicated his latest investigations on the " Eozoon and
Micropalfeontology," embodying some of his recent microscopic
researches in the Palaeozoic rocks. Death, however, had taken
away my geological friend, and the pen of the earnest, hard-
working student of nature had ceased to write ; he had gone
to his I'est, literally worn out and a victim (may we not say a
martyr ?) to the cause of science, for which he had laboured and
for which he lived. How well I remember the closing scene, or
at any rate the last hours spent with him in endeavouring to
elucidate the fibre mystery. Possessed with the idea that even in
the earliest rocks of the earth's crust he could trace the presence
of organic life, he had selected the room in the Institution
where the least chance of any adventitious or external accidents
could interfere with his researches ; he had prepared some glass
slides coated Avith glycerine over-night, these we were to examine
the following morning microscopically and compare the results of
the night's capture with the residue he proposed to test after
decalcification of the rock by hydrocloric acid in the morning.
The specimen so tested was a slice of the Laurentian rock
containing the so-called Eozoon Canadense. Every precaution
had been taken to exclude any accidental introduction of dust
from the experiment. After two hours work in the room bare of
any furniture that might possibly interfere, he succeeded in fixing
on his glass slides certain transparent fibres or tubes obtained
from the residue, which, when compared with the dust caught on
