■wards drying white. Ranging for a depth of some 5ft, or 6ft. the
shale could be divided anywhere in its laminations, and the
impressions would be disclosed.
Upon the site of the bridge which is situated exactly where the
line crosses the road on the map, in the thin bed of limestone
close to the surface soil, there was found a fossil leaf of Olozamifes,
in admirable preservation. Some 10ft. beneath this, and in the
shale, the vertebra of an Ichthyosaurus was met with, standing in
high relief from the surface of its bed.
Passing further round the curve, another road is crossed..
Beside this road, on the south, a quarry was opened, the stone
being of a good quality. The strata beneath the foundations of
the bridge dipped towards the moor, that is northwards, the slope
being about 20 degrees. No fossils, to the writer's knowledge,
were found in these beds, which belong to the Lower Lias, consist-
ing of thin beds of dark blue limestone interspersed with clays-
and shale. This completes the main cuttings in the Polden Hills.
From the road v/hich is crossed by the bridge just mentioned,
the ground slopes gently down until the general level of the peat
is reached, the line here being actually across a bay of the greater
moor beyond, the division between the two consisting of a low
ridge running in a direction parallel to the general line of the
Polden Hills, round the end of which the two moors meet. They
generally went by the names of Inner and Outer Moors.
Beneath a layer of light coloured peat, close to the last bridge,
a bed of fresh water shells was exposed when cutting the drains,
A boring in the centre of the Inner Moor disclosed about —
