ind Dunraven Castle, and unravelled the geological problems of
the district. In 1866, he took the Club to the Mendip Hills, to
visit his recent discovery of the " Trap dyke," near Stoke Lane ;
passing on the way through Shepton Mallet, he called attention
to the lithological similarity of the white conglomeratic rock,
resting on the upturned edges of the Carboniferous limestone, to
the beds they had seen the preceding year at Sutton, so unlike
the normal Lower Lias beds, near Weston, yet from their con-
tained fossils evidently of the same age.
In the same year, at a joint meeting of the Cotteswold and
Bath Field Clubs, Moore acted as their guide to the Warleigh
valley, visitiug the gravel beds at Freshford, said to be of the same
age as those of Amiens and Abbeville, and in which had been
found the Musk sheep and other extinct animal remains ; the
inferior Oolite section along the canal banks, the 3()ft. there
exposed representing those same beds in the Cotteswold Hills,
developed to a thickness of some 200ft. ; the extremely thin beds
of the Upper Lias with the Middle Lias at the base, opposite
Dundas ; and on their return to Bath pointed out the Coralline
nature of the top beds of the Great Oolite on Hampton Down. In
1867, he conducted an excursion to the Camel Hill section, near
Sparkford Station, and described the Liassic geologj' of that side
(S.) of the Mendip Hills, where the Lias beds attain their
normal thickness, some 700ft. ; and taking them to his typical
classical section so fully described in his paper on the Abnormal
Deposits, read before the Geological Society, pointed out the
physical and palseontological i)eculiarities of each bed, from the
Keuper Marls at the base through the Rhsetic claj'S to the white
Lias, William Smith's " Sun bed," and onward in ascending
order to the Blue Lias proper â€” a succession of beds, 365ft. thick.
In the same year, he visited the Willsbridge section, and showed
the members the Rhsetic and Lower Lias beds, lying in a trough
between the Keuper beds on one side, and the Pennant Sandstone
on the other ; a most instructive section due probably to the
