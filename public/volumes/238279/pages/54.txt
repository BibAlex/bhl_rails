€n a Bhcetic Section at LucJcinglon, and Additional Notes on the
Vohster Quarry. By Rev. H. H. Winwood, M.A., F.G.S.
(Read 12th February, 1890.;
During the past autumn it has been my custom to make a
weekly expedition, with a geological friend, Professor Lloyd
Morgan, to examine some of the interesting problems, still
awaiting solution, afforded by our beautiful neighbourhood.
On one of the fine days, which at that time of the year
•especially make out-door life so enjoyable, our object was to
re-visit the Vobstcr district, and to see whether recent quarrying
•or other works had in any way thrown additional light on those
■complicated disturbances which have employed the pen and
taxed the imagination of so many geologists to explain. We
were fortunate in being accompanied on this particular day by
Mr. McMurtrie, whose researches in the Eadstock Coal Field are
so well known, and the results of which have been so admirably
given in various papers contributed by him to our " Proceedings."
After detraining at Mells Station, we followed the tramway to
Upper Vobster quarry, and found that Mr. Batey, the proprietor
of those fine workable beds of Limestone, had done much of late
to clear up several points, hitherto obscure (but of this more
anon). Leaving this quarry for the time, we passed the Newbury
and Mackintosh pits, and whilst looking about for any exposures of
Limestone, or other rocks in the adjoining fields, dropped into
*' Black Lane " (situated on the line of fault running N. and
S., and joining the great overlap fault nearer Eadstock), and
followed it up to the well-known section of Limestone lying to
the East of Luckington Farm. These two quarries — Upper
Yobster and Luckington — have been rendered classical by past
descriptions. When seen at a little distance off, the section
there exposed appears to be Carboniferous Limestone, with black
shales resting on its exposed surface. These latter, from a cursory
