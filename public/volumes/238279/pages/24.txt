remarkable thing is this — these same germs or similar germs of •
equally simple structure, still exist at the present day. What is
their past history 1 What is their future destiny ? Go almost
anywhere, we find them in the atmosphere, mixed up with more
or less of dust and other extremely small particles of matter.
The dust is easily explained. It comes from the wear and tear,
as also from the decomposition, of all the various substances,
organic or inorganic, existing upon the globe. The motes we see
in a sunbeam are specimens of this dust ; and it is observable
that wherever this dust exists, there also we find the above
microscopic germs, the harbingers — or first forms — of life, waiting,
as it were, to take a higher grade of existence according as
circumstances favour such development or not. The dust in the
air spoken of above is most abundant (as might be expected) in
large toAvns ; in the open country it is much reduced in quantity ;
it is still further diminished by the sea shore, where it lies open
landwards and away from houses, and in the midst of a wide
ocean it scarcely exists at all. And all this may be said in like
manner of the microscopic germs of life. In fact the dust and
the germs go together.*
These microscopic germs are the microbes of Pasteur, that
distinguished French experimentalist of whom we have heard so
much lately, and who has proved them to be the source of so
many of our infectious diseases as well as accidental maladies.
They are inconceivably minute. Huxley says that if one of
them measured only the thousandth part of an inch, it would be
a giant among its fellows. t The writer of the article Atom, in
the " Encyclopaedia Britannica " before alluded to, says, " That
* The above remarks on dust are grounded on experimental
researches made by an observer, and published ; but I am unable to
refer to the original authority.
