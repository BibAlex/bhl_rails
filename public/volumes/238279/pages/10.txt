The Fauna of Bath, as illustrated by the Duncan Local Museum.
By G. NoKMAN, Esq., M.B.
(Read March Uth, 1889;.
The foundation of a local natural history collection for Bath
was laid many years ago by the Brothers Duncan, in honour of
whom the collection has been named.
It owes, however, its present value to the assiduous and
untiring energy of the Rev. Leonard Blomefield, the venerable
President of the Bath Field ('lub.
He anticipated by many years the recent recommendations of
the British Association as to provincial museums generally, viz.,
that the purposes of science would be best served by the
formation of collections as complete as possible of a local
character, rather than by the accumulation of collections of a
general character, which could be rarely rendered complete
enough to serve any useful purpose.
Thus, in 1866, in a report of the Museum sub-Committee, he
said : â€” " The Committee take this opportunity of drawing the
attention of the public to the much greater degree to which the
usefulness and efficiency of the Museum would be increased, if
an endeavour were made to acquire, as far as possible, a complete
collection of the animals of the neighbourhood of Bath. Local
collections of this kind are not only what are of most value and
interest to students of natural history in the district, but what
seems to come more immediately within the province of a local
establishment It is hoped by making this
statement to all friends of the Institution, that they will use
their influence in obtaining for it specimens in illustration of the
fauna of Bath and Somerset, which the Committee think would
be preferable to any large increase in the foreign collections.
" These last, unless restricted to a carefully selected and well-
arranged series of type-forms, representative simply of the larger
groups, serve very imperfectly for the purpose of science or the
instruction of the public."
