The Eock Dove is interesting as being the true wild pigeon^
the ancestor of all the numerous varieties of the Domestic Pigeon,
as is so fully explained by Darwin in his works. A large case in
the central hall of the Natural History Museum at South
Kensington well illustrates this matter. The specimen of the
Eock Dove in the Museum was shot at Dyrham.
There is no need to dwell on the Pheasants, Partridges or
Quails. The Eed Legged Partridge, mentioned by Terry as local
though rare, is not mentioned by Cecil Smith in the " Birds of
Somersetshire," and is recorded by the Eev. A. C. Smith as
found rarely in Wiltshire. The specimen in the Museum was
shot at ClifFe Pypard, in Wiltshire. It is not a bird to be
encouraged, as it drives away its more valuable congener, and the
flavour of its flesh is not to be compared with that of the ordinary
Partridge.
One interesting group of birds belongs to this order— the
Bustards. Cecil Smith mentions that he could find no record of
them in Somersetshire, but Mr. Blomeliekl, in a paper read before
the Field Club in 1872, speaks of a flock of Great Bustards having
appeared near Barnstaple, in the winter of 1870, whence they
dispersed over the adjoining counties, one being found at
Shapwick, in Somerset. It was during the same winter that the
last Bustard was seen and shot on Salisbury Plain, once the
greatest resort of these birds in Britain.
There is no local record of this bird, although Cecil Smith
considers it probable that it once had a habitat in the high open
ground of the Mendips between Bath and Wells.
Water Birds. 1. — waders.
The Waders occupy a middle space between Ground birds
and true Water-fowl, embracing Plovers, Cranes, Herons, Snipe,
Eail, &c.
Distinguished by length of legs and neck, and admirable
developement of feet for wading on soft mud, or running lightly
