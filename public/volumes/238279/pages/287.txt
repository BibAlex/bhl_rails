and on the other George Grenville, North, Thomas Orby Hunter,
James Harris.
The Atholes after a few years considered the compensation given
inadequate. They thought the Government had " the fault of the
Dutch, giving too little and asking too much." They appealed
more than once and further sums (annuities) were granted. In
1825 an Act was passed to authorize the Lords of the Treasury to
treat for the purchase of the Duke's remaining interest in the
Island. The amount awarded by arbitration (in 1829) was
£416,114, of which the Patronage of the Bishopric and the
different Advowsons stood for £100,000. No valuation was put
on the " honorable distinction and service of presenting the Two
Falcons."
A curious anomaly having reference to the position of the
Athole family was mentioned to me lately by a friend, viz. : that
though Queen Victoria was debarred by the Salic Law from
inheriting the Kingdom of Hanover, her subject, Sir Augustus
D'Este, in the case of that Crown having fallen to his father the
Duke of Sussex, would have been eligible to succeed him. His
mother. Lady Augusta Murray, was a member of a Eoyal
Family (of Man) and therefore there was, by German law, no bar
to his succession, although by the Royal Marriage Act it was
illegal in England.
