The group of Woodcock and Snipe, all winter visitants, are
l>ecoming increasingly rare. The Woodcock in the Museum is
from Dyrham, and the Jack Snipe, the rarest species, from
Warleigh. The eggs of this bird are of greater bulk relatively
to its size than those of any other bird, for the bird weighs about
2 ozs. and its four eggs more than IJ oz.
The Grey Phalarope, the Whale bird, belongs rather to ocean
than to land, and is at home within the Artie circle ; it became
very abundant throughout England in the autumn of 1866,
during a period of very heavy weather. The specimen in the
Museum was shot on Midford Ponds in October 1870. We have
a fair collection of the Eails, which are not uncommon in our
district, although difficult to observe on account of their shy and
retiring habits.
The specimen of the Spotted Crake was picked up dead on
the railway between Bath and Kelston in October, 1881 ; it was
supposed that it flew against the telegraph wires, as there was a
deep cut across its breast.
Terry mentions a Water Rail and a little Crake as having been
shot in the pond at the back of Grosvenor, but gives no date.
The Common Coot was obtained on the river near Keynsham.
2. â€” Swimmers.
Boat shaped bodies and webbed feet attest their remarkable
powers of swimming and diving.
A large proportion of these birds have the ocean as their
habitat, and, therefore, can hardly be claimed as local. Still some
are frequenters of our streams, and, with regard to the others,
as it is the custom to include in the list of birds of a district,
all species whether occasional visitants or mere stragglers driven
out of their way by stress of weather, we must foUoAV the usual
custom.
Amongst the Ducks we have local specimens of the Teal,
Common Scoter, Pochard and Golden Eye.
