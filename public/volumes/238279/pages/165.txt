Old Field Names. By Rev. Canoij Ellacombe, Vicar of Bitton.
(Read December IQth, 1891 J
It is now many years since Dr. Prior, writing to me on plant
names, suggested to me that I should look after the Old'Field Names
in my parish. I saw at once that it might be a curious and
interesting subject of inquiry, but I never followed it up, till
accident almost forced it upon me. This year a new Tithe Act
was passed, which has obliged Tithe owners to look up their Tithe
Commutation Awards. As I looked through mine of 1843, 1 wag
struck with the great number of names that were unknown to
me, and which I could see had in many cases passed away ; and
thinking of Dr. Prior's suggestion, I went through them more
carefully, till I came to the conclusion that the search which had
interested me might help to pass one of our winter afternoons in
the Bath Field Club, and might, perhaps, be made interesting to
some of the members. Htnc illce chartce.
Tlie subject is a very large one, and to write anything like an
exhaustive account would require a volume, and a very large
volume, for I think it likely that in every parish in England one
or more field names would be found, peculiar to that parish and
found nowhere else. I shall almost entirely confine myself to ray
own parish of Bitton, and even there the amount of material is so
large, that I am more afraid of wearying you, than of finding too
little to fill up our usual length of paper.
I think the simplest way will be to take first the general names,
and then the more particular and special names. By general
names I mean such as are more or less in use all over England ;
words which we may call generic, applied to a vast number of
fields, and marked off to special fields by some distinguishing
adjunct. I mean such words as field, meadow, close, leaze, tyning,
paddock, barton, hayes, etc. These all sound very simple words.
