Lansflown (in error Kingsdown) twenty chairmen sent by the
city were in waiting with sedans to carry the Queen down should
she wish it. She however preferred to remain in her coach and so
reached the North Gate where she was met by the Corporation
with the maces carried by two J.P.'s, the Mayor being unwell.
The maces and the keys of the city were duly presented and as
duly returned.* Preceded by the Train bands, a company of
grenadiers, and the town music ; the bells ringing, the streets,
galleries and windows, adorned and filled with a vast number of
people, her Majesty was conducted to her lodgings at Dr. Peirce's.
Of her doings whilst there nothing seems recorded, save that a
sermon was preached before her by Richard Duke on the 29th
August from 1 John ii. 6, and published by her command.
