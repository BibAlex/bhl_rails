Mouse are all well-known, but there is no specimen of the Mus
Messorius, Harvest Mouse, which is mentioned in Terry's
catalogue. The Black Eat is now almost extinct, being replaced
by the stronger brown Norway Rat ; the specimens of the Black
Eat in the museum were obtained from old warehouses in Bristol.
The Water Vole, or Water Rat, and the Field Vole, or Short-
tailed Field Mouse are common ; but there is no specimen in the
museum of the Red or Meadow Vole.
The Hare and Rabbit need no mention.
AVES.
The Birds are the largest and perhaps the most interesting
section. A ten mile radius from Bath embraces a great variety
of country, including the valley of the Avon, and innumerable
well-timbered valleys with small streams, open downs, old quarry
grounds, numberless plantations and much underwood, thus
affording habitats for a great variety of land birds. But in
addition to this, from its proximity to the Bristol Channel and
to the marshes of Somerset, the district receives frequent visits
from water birds.
