way has got the name of Knight's Folly Farm. No one can
explain the name, or how it got there ; there never was an owner
of the name of Knight, and I am not aware of any special folly
attaching to the farm, except that the Ordnance Surveyor put the
name on their maps without any authority. I am afraid these
surveyors will have to account for perpetuating a large number
of mistakes all over the kingdom. They are too ready to accept
any information from any informant. I mention these as instances
of names springing up almost of themselves. As an excellent
instance of corruption I will give you one not from Bath but from
the neighbouring Parish of Wick war.* In a survey of 1772 there
are two fields one called King Poleham's and the other Wheelers,
both probably surnames; but in the 1840 Tithe Award they
appear as the King of Poland's Ground and the Queen of Poland's
Ground.
But I must draw to a conclusion. I hope I may have shown
you that even such a commonplace thing as a field-name may be
of interest, and may help in working out our parochial histories,
and though my paper has exceeded the usual limit, I caa assure
you that I have had to curtail a great deal which I could have
added, but I should certainly have wearied you. As it is, I feel
that I must apologise for the length of my paper ; but I do not
apologise for the commonplace character of the subject, for it is
surely well within the work of a Field Club to talk of fields and
their names.
p_S. â€” Since writing this I have received from Lord Moreton a
long list of field names in the Parishes of Sarsden and Churchill in
Oxfordshire. It is a very interesting list and proves what 1 have
said, that every parish can show its own peculiar names. After
deducting those of which I have already spoken in Bitton, and
many which are clearly proper names, there still remain many
which I should like to add as a postcript, but without note or
