The journey to Nisjnij Novgorod was made by railway, and
thence by steamer along the Volga and Kama to the town of
Perm. He gives a description of the boat accommodation and
food which was not luxurious, but fairly comfortable (bedclothes
had to be taken). There is plenty of communication on this
route, Russia's principal commercial highway. The transport of
goods is carried on almost entirely in barges towed by strong
tugboats, which are paddle steamers of from 100 to 180 horse-
power, drawing 3J to 4 feet. On the Volga's tributaries are over
500 steamers, mostly built in the country, and nearly all used as
tugs. The principal traffic is in spring, in summer the water
falls so much that one year vessels drawing over 3 feet could not
float, and the loss to Russia was enormous, as the goods for
Nisjnij fair could not be forwarded.
The frequent movement of the sandbanks on the Volga is a
great hindrance, and the pilotage so difficult that vessels have to
signal to each other to show on which side they are to pass.
Wood is used principally for fuel, but higher up naphtha.
They passed Kosmodemjausk, important by its great timber
fair, and after passing Kasan the Volga joins the Kama, a large
river whose waters are even more muddy than the Volga, and
keep distinct for a considerable distance. In 4 days and nights
they arrived at Perm, and travelled thence by rail to Ekaterinburg,
distant 468 versts,* which took 20 hours and 45 minutes on
account of the long stoppages.
tAt Ekaterinburg they bought Tarantasses or 4-wheeled carriages
for the land journey across Siberia, of which he gives a descrip-
tion : â€” Two pair of wheels are placed at about 10 feet apart, and
their axles are joined by several shaking birch poles of 2 inches
*A verst is roughly about two-thirds of an English mile, exactly 1,166
yards 2 feet.
t There has been now for some years a railway from Ekaterinburg to
Tjumen.
