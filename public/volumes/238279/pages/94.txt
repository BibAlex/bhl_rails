Mr. Mayor,
Give me leave to present to you, and thro' you to the
•Gentlemen of the Corporation of the City of Bath, my most respectfull
and warmest acknowledgements for the high mark of their favour and
Confidence, in vouchsafeing to think of me for their Representative in
Parliament. I have long ambition'd the honoixr of a seat there,
derived from a Body so independent and so truely respectable as the
City of Bath, and which can never fail to reflect Lustre and impart
weight, to whoever they shall be pleased to think not unworthy of so
high and honourable a Trust. As soon as the necessity of affairs will
permit me, on my return again to business, to be absent from my
attendance on his Majestys Commands, I propose to wait on the
Corporation in person, and to assure them more particularly of the
deep and warm sentiment of respect and gratitude, with which I am
and shall ever be devoted to the City of Bath, and to every member of
the Corporation. I am with the greatest consideration,
Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen of the Corporation,
Your most obliged and most
Obedient humble Servant,
W, Pitt.
