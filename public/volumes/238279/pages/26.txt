liere dealing with living molecules of such extreme minuteness
as to defy all attempt at either measurement or analysis. We
know nothing positive as to their origin : we are left to conjecture
only, or to speculation if you like to call it so. And why should
we not speculate? When did science ever make any advance
towards the solution of its more recondite problems without
speculation in the first instance 1 Take the following case. A
phenomenon occurs to an observer of quite a novel character,
such as he had never before witnessed. He naturally sets himself
to consider what can have occasioned it 1 Difficulties are thought
over until the mind suggests a possible way out of them. Facts
are then sought for bearing on the subject in question, in order
to confirm or negative his first speculation, which in the end is
accepted or cast aside as the case may be.
Of course on such an obscure question as that of the origin
of life, there will be difference of opinion; but the more the
question is thought over and discussed, the sooner are we likely
to find the right answer to it.
Some of cur most distinguished men of science at the present
day believe in the closest connection between life and matter.
Herbert Spencer believes that " life in all its forms has arisen by
" an unbroken evolution through the instrumentality of natural
" causes."* Huxley, in his well-known article in the Fortnightly
Revieiv, on the " Physical basis of Life,"t published many years
back, considers " matter and life inseparably connected." He
regards the matter of life as "composed of ordinary matter,
" difi"ering from it only in the manner in which its atoms are
aggregated." Tyndall enquiresâ€”" Divorced from matter where
" is life to be found ? Trace the line of life backwards, and see it
" approaching more and more to what we call the purely physical
" condition."!
