the flora met with on the Continent, but the -writer had frequent
opportunities of discussing witli him the general features of the
district, and he has since been indebted to him for an extensive
series of notes on the Coalfields of Belgium and the North of
France, dealing especially with the physical geology of those
countries in a manner so comprehensive as to furnish material for
a much more exhaustive paper on the subject than is possible on
the present occasion.* Time will only admit of calling attention
to a few of the more important features in typical localities, but
the writer would desire to express his great obligation to Dr.
Hovelacque for the valuable information received on the subject.
Overlying Eocks.
In comparing the geological features of the two coalfields, it
â€¢will be convenient to group these notes under various heads,
beginning with the overlying rocks, which naturally come first in
order.
It is hardly necessary to explain that throughout the greater
part of the Somerset Coalfield, the carboniferous strata do not
come to the surface, being overlaid for the most part by secondary
rocks of varying thickness. Between the Mendip Hills and the
centre of the Eadstock basin these overlying strata consist of the
Lias, Ehjetic and New Red Sandstone, the latter occupying the
bottom and lower slopes of the valleys, while, on the higher
ground, the New Red is overlaid by the Rhajtic and Lias, which
occupy the summit of most of the table lands in and around
Eadstock,
* In a subsequent letter from Dr. Hovelacque, he wished to explain
tliat the notes referred to were not entirely his own, but were rather a
recapitulation of the principal works on the subject, including the
following papers by Professor Gosselet, to which he was largely
indebted, viz., " Etude des terrains primaires du Nord de la France et
du Boulonnais ;" " Esquisse geologique du Nord, 1S80 ;" and
" L'Ardenne, 1889."
