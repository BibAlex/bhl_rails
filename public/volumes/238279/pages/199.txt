system), he considered the specimens shown consisted of a
mineralized or metamorphic condition of rock structure and that
they were not organic. Reviewing the controversy whicli had
been carried on for the last sixteen years, he remarked that
certain facts which he had since worked out had caused him to
alter his opinion. Having decalcified some portions of the rock
he had found in it a clear siliceous-looking fibrous growth of
various colours, black, green, and olive, but so like modern fibre
that he suspected they must have got on the slide by accident and
threw away many such specimens. Persevering, however, in his
researches, he continued to find other traces which he likened to
the finest possible bits of polished golden wire. Examining the
structure of Nummulites Icevigatus, to which Dr. Carpenter and
others considered Eozoon to be allied, he found the same
transparent alga-like fibre abundant in the decalcified specimens ;
also deep yellow, emerald green, and olive-coloured fibre,
absolutely undistinguishable from those obtained from the Eozoon.
From this evidence he was forced to adopt the conclusion of the
organic nature of Eozoon Canadense, and suggested that in the
vast thickness of rocks between it and the Cambrians connecting
links of organic life might still reward the geological investigator.
His last appearance was at York in the following year, 1881,
when he again brings forward the result of his microscopic
examination of the Irish Laurentian and other Palseozoic lime-
stones after being triturated and dissolved in acid ; stating the
care he had taken to eliminate all sources of error, he still found
hair-hke structures and feather-like barbs which he considered
belonged to the rocks. Notwithstanding Dr. Duncan's reply
and his playful allusion to Charles Moore's discovery of the
traces of the last visit of the angels to this earth in the
fibre of one of the feathers of their wings left behind, and
the general opposition this theory met with, Moore, however,
â€¢was not the man to give up easily an idea that had once
taken firm possession of him, and several letters from the
