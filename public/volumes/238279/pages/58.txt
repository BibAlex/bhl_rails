driven some 60ft. through the Mountain Limestone Shales and
Millstone Grit. Since then it has been extended to a length of
218ft., opening out at the E. end into a large quarry, now being
actively worked. An addition of 38ft. 6in. of Grit must now be
made to the 24ft. already shown, making a total of 62ft. 6in.
altogether. The dip of these beds is 46° S. They are followed by
Shales dipping from 46° S. to 60° N. and some 124ft. thick. Im-

of coal, 4in. thick, comes in, succeeded by a band of red rock, 6in.
thick, with a N. dip of 60°, corresponding with that of the coal.
Then follow a series of dark grey Limestones, so much disturbed
that the dip is difficult to make out, succeeded by a dyke or
infilling of a peculiar pinkish streaked crystalline Limestone,
standing up like a wedge in the middle of the quarry — the more
profitable Limestone having been worked out on either side.
The solid beds of Limestone have been excavated for a distance
of 100ft., and then comes the furthest end of the workings, where
the beds dip finally 45" E. The section is worthy of finding a
permanent jDlace in our " Proceedings," but whether it any way
tends to unravel the complications connected with the Vobster
disturbances, j)erhaps some member of the Club may be better
able to decide than I can myself.
