forms of animal and vegetable life, my own doings in Zoology
and Botany, fond as I am of the subject even now in extreme old
age, seems as nothing. Yet the retrospect is not without other
reminiscences of a more pleasurable character. It brings back to
my recollection departed friends, whose names may be found in
the older lists of the Society, with some of whom I joined in the
pursuits that gave us so much pleasure, but who have long since
been called to their rest. I as yet remain ; if I cannot claim
acquaintance with many of the Fellows of the present day, I shall
always liold in grateful remembrance those who were instrumental
in getting up the congratulatory address just received, which shall
always have a place on the walls of my study, whereon there
are several portraits of old Linnean Society Members,
including that of Mr. Macleay (father of Alexander Macleay),
who was, if I remember right. Secretary to the Society on the
evening on which I was admitted ; Mr. Lambert, V.P., being in
the chair.
Once more expressing my gratitude for the great honour that
has been done to me.
Believe me.
Dear Mr. Harting,
Sincere^ yours,
LEONARD BLOMEFIELD.
The papers read before the Field Club during the year are pub-
lished in this number. The first was read on March 16th, 1892,
by Mr. W. H. Tagart, who had lately returned from Siberia and
exhibited a large collection of clothing, and household articles from
Lake Bajkal, with photographs of the natives and country about
the great rivers of Eussian Asia, and the towns of Yeniseisk and
Irkutsk. It was a translation from a very interesting account
published by a Swedish traveller, and a short synopsis of the
paper is printed as Appendix I to this Summary.
