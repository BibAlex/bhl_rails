Could these arcades on the S. have once lead to a side aisle
or chancel, and in later times been filled up ? The low arches
seem to he of much older date than the -walled up space below
them. The chancel is the oldest part of the church, probably
13th century. The pulpit is a good specimen of 17 th century
work, and the small silver chalice, date 1577, is very elegant in
shape. The tower, with turret staircase, on the S. side, has
perpendicular belfry windows, but the base appears to be of
much more ancient work — maybe I^orman. Amongst other bits
of local lore, the Eector alluded to a stone stile leading to the
Church of Llanvair Discoed* (the Church of S. Mary below the-
Wood;, whereon was cut the following : —
Whoever here on Suncbiy
AVill practis playing at ball ;
It may be before Monday,
The devil will have you all, —
an allusion to the game not infrequently carried on against the
church towers or walls, sometimes even during service time.
Amongst other things, too, the Eector said that evidently the site
of the church vras once the highest point within the old walls, and,
that the ground, though risen since, formerly sloped away in all
directions from it. In an orchard to the N. of the church the
Eoman bath, now at Caerleon, was found. Quantities of iesserce
and Eoman coins are unearthed from time to time, and a fine
specimen of Eoman pavement was found only a year ago, in a
garden of the Coach and Horses Inn, but is now covered up
again. Having seen as much of Caerwent as was possible under
the circumstances, the Via Julia was followed to Crick, and
evidences of the late heavy rains were seen in the flooded state
