fine gable-ended house passed before coming to the Church still
bears the name of the Castle, and was probably built by the
Erleighs, certainly inhabited by them. After lunching at the
Woolpack, a name indicative of the staple trade once existing
here, Mr. Medley gave a short anecdote of that " quaint but
uncomfortable" man, Samuel Pepys, who seems to have passed

whether such a thing really existed, as he failed to find it laid
down in the ordnance maps. After making enquiries he (the
speaker) learnt from Mr. Millett, tenant of Prior's Court, that
there were some old stones near Seymour's Court, called the
" Devil's Bed and Bolster," and was taken to the present spot by
his informant. He was also informed by another inhabitant of
the place that at one time it was twice as Urge as it is now,
