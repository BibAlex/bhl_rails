supreme head of the Church. But by the 31st March of that
year, the opposition to the King's demands was broken down and
on that day Prior Horde and fourteen monks signed the
surrender. Two others, one of whom was the said Nicholas
Balland, apparently did not sign the document. The nett value
of the Priory, at the date of surrender, was £248.* Walter Lord
Hungerford was appointed Chief Steward and Surveyor, and the
buildings were sold to him by Tregonwell. Three months later
we find a letter from Hungerford to Cromwell, complaining that
Sir Thos. Arundell had " sold and despoiled and carried away a
great part of the Church and other superfluous buildings," which
shows that the work of demolition was immediately begun.
Hungerford also states that Harry Champneys, of Orchardleigh,
had broken into the Prior's Cell and taken away " King's Evi-
dence," or title deeds, and he begs for the Manors of Norton and
Hinton. These incidents indicate the " ugly rush " which had
set in for Monastic plunder. At the close of the year the site of
the Priory and the Grange, some quarter mile distant, were
granted to Hungerford for 21 years. Hungerford did not, how-
ever, long enjoy his acquisition, for he was attainted and beheaded
on Tower Hill in the following summer, on the same day, it is
said, on which Cromwell was beheaded, and all his property,
Hinton included, passed to the Crown. Several members of the
Hungerford family had shared the same fate, the third Lord
Hungerford having lost his head in the Wars of the Eoses, and
his son. Sir Thomas, eight years later. The Priory came into
Hungerford possession again in 1578, after passing through
several hands. We find the names of John Bartlet, William
Crouch, Matthew Colthurst (who probably erected the present
Manor House), and Edmund Colthurst, who is described in 1573
• The Prior received £11 as a gratuity and an aumiity of £44, and
the Monks gratuities of £29 16s. 8d. and pensions amounting to
£119 6s. 8d.
