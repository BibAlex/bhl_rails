In the following short paper I do not propose to go into the
whole subject of English Vines and Vineyards — I have done that
elsewhere* — but to narrow the subject within the purview of the
Bath Field Club, But really that does not very much narrow the
subject — for the culture of the Vine was almost entirely confined
to the Southern Counties of England (not quite, for there was a
great Vineyard at Ely, and even as far North as Durham) — and
while there are less than forty entries of Vineyards in the
" Domesday Survey," six of them are in these two Counties.
