Here he describes the various routes to Siberia.
1. By steamers from Odessa through Suez Canal to Vladivostok,
2. Tlirough the Arctic Ocean by the Kara Sea and up the
Yenesei.
3. Through Orenburg, Orsk alongside the Ural River, and
then through Omsk.
4. By Perm and Ekaterinburg, and as described above.
He gives a description of the various modes of *travelling by
government post and by free posting.
In spring and summer the traffic is principally by water, the
mail steamer often having in tow a barge full of convicts, but in
winter in long caravans of sometimes over 100 sledges, with one
driver to about eveiy 10.
He shows how by making a few canals it would be possible to
have water communication all the way from Tjumen to Irkutsk,
and thence by the Angara and Selenga, and if a short railway was
made to the Amur right on to the Pacific Ocean.
There are numerous rapids on the Angara, the most important
called " Podun."
The enormous size of the Siberian rivers may be imagined when
you think that the largest rivers of Europe, the Ehine, Rhone,
Danube and Volga would have to join themselves together to
make a Yenesei, Ob or Lena. The length of the Selenga, Angara,
Yenesei, is over 5,000 versts, and Reclus reckons that the whole
of the Yenesei's water system is about 2,900,000 square versts.
The Angara is one of the most beautiful rivers in the world.
Between Irkutsk and Bratskoj Ostrog (a Buriat fortress) there- is
already steamer communication.
He describes the scenery wide, stretching, tilled fields and charm-
ing groves. During the first day's journey they passed Distil-
leries, Tanneries, Saltworks, Cloth Factories, Glass Factories, &c.,
and the banks were well populated. Numerous islands were
