Benefices in the said Island to which they were then Intitled to be

the said Honorary Service of rendering to His Majesty's Heirs and
Successors Kings and Queen's of England Two Falcons on the
days of their respective Coronations and at and under the yearly
Rent of £101 15s. lid." This rent would appear to have been
first charged in the reign ef James I. when fresh Letters
Patent were granted to William, younger son of Henry,
fourth Earl, on the death of his brother Ferdinand, with whose
daughters William had efJected a compromise for their claims
over the Island.
