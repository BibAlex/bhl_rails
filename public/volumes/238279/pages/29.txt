" dust. We have no longer to rest content with the fad that all
" matter is one chemically ; we have the cause."*
Further on he asserts that this " infinitely fine dust, finer
" probahly than anything we can imagine, becomes at last, in the
" celestial spaces, agglomerated into meteoric irons and stones
" with which the earth is being continually bombarded." He
actually speaks of the number of such masses which fall uj^on
the earth every day as exceeding twenty millions.
Now this subject of meteorites, and meteoritic dust, is not —
as some of my hearers might suppose — altogether foreign to the
question we have been considering. For, a few years back, one
of our most distinguished physicists (I think it was Sir W,
Thompson) threw out the suggestion that possibly life had been
introduced into our world by a meteor, which in its flight
through the celestial spaces had been arrested by our earth. But
if meteoric dust is continually being poured down upon the
earth, as would seem to be the case from what Norman Lockyer
says, surely it is far more likely (germs and dust being, as we
have seen above, so generally found together), that fresh life is
being brought to our earth every day — silently— and without our
knowing anything about it.
Moreover, I conceive that statements of this kind, by so
eminent an observer as Norman Lockyer, go far to warrant
much that I have said in the latter half of my paper, which
might otherwise have appeared strange, as well as novel, to some
of my hearers.
