Cuttings through the Folden Hills in Somersetshire. By

The object of the present paper is to place upon record some
account of the Geological formations exposed in the cuttings of the
Bridgwater Railway, the construction of which opened up a
continuous line of excavation through the heart of the Polden
Hills. Belonging mainly to the Lias and Ehsetic Beds, it Avas
anticipated that the Geological sections would be of interest, a
supposition which proved to be not altogether unfounded.
Having had charge of the construction of the railway until
near the completion of the earthwork, the Writer has prepared
the present paper in the belief that his description of the strata
may be of value, when the slopes of the cuttings are overgrown.
The railway extends from Edington to Bridgwater, passing to the
north of the village of Cossington, where the summit is reached of
that portion of the hills through which the Railway runs, and where
there is the longest cutting, which practically extends for a mile.
Starting across King's Sedgemoor from Bridgwater terminus,
the railway extends northwards, crosses the Great Western
Railway, and from that point continues in an almost direct line to
Bawdrip village, where it enters the first cutting. The portion of
the Moor crossed between Bridgwater and Bawdrip lies nearer
the Bristol Channel than the King's Sedgemoor of battle fame,
otherwise some interesting antiquites might have been discovered.
The Moor is level all the way, with only here and there local rises
of a foot or so, and it has been within the range of history little
better than a gigantic marsh. Its strata consist of a grey silty
clay, varying very much from place to place. At Bridgwater, for
instance, it is fairly stiff upon the surface, becoming moister and
more treacherous lower down, until Black Quicksand is reached.
