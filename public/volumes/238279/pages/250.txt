marble tomb of Sir Richard Colt Hoare, the celebrated historian
of " Ancient Wiltshire/' is in the churchyard to the E. of the
church. A white marble sarcophagus has this inscription :
Hoc sepulchretum
Sibi et Posteris
Ricardus Colt Hoare
fieri curavit
Anno MDCCCXix.
Would that the " Posteri " of this celebrated man had cared
more for the magnificent estate handed down to them ! Eeturning
through the pretty village of Stourton, and passing in front of
the house and its lordly portico, looking sad and forsaken as if
a funeral had just passed through its portals, the members
trundled back to Bruton in time to see the fine church, over which
they were kindly shown by the Vicar, the Rev. H. T. Ridley,
who pointed out all the architectural details ; the remains of the
rood loft staircases, the Berkely crypt, the Abbot's tomb in the
churchyard, the double towers, &c., the evening light bringing
out the beautiful proportions and ornamentations of the fine W.
tower. And then the much needed dinner at the Blue Ball was
done justice to before the return to Bath at 7.3 p.m. The day
was perfect throughout, just the sort of autumnal day which
brings out the scenery so well.
Bye-Excursions.
Three very ])leasant Bye-Excursions were arranged, the first to
Hinton Abbey, on Tuesday, April 28th, 1891. A saloon carriage,
kindly provided for them by the G.W.R. authorities, conveyed
24 members and two visitors to Freshford by the 2.38 p.m. train.
A short walk through the straggling village across the "Tyning,"
and a field called the " Fillet" led them to the ruins, where they
were met by Mr. Foxcroft and Mr. Salisbury, the present tenant.
The former had courteously offered to give them a description of
the Abbey, and in the chapel, still remaining almost perfect.
