300
paid by the Priory 4 marks* of good and lawful money in the
Church of the said Priory and six wagon loads of firewood. If
the Vicar serve, in his own person, one of the Churches, he is to
provide a priest for the other ; if he serve neither, then has he to
find two priests, so that each church may have its own priest.
This order is ratified by the Prior of Bath. In 1534, the nett
value of the Vicarage of Norton cum Hinton is set down at
£5 lis. 3d. To this extent had the monks succeeded in im-
poverishing the two Livings. The Church of Hinton was thus
degraded from the position of a Parish Church to serve the needs
of the monks, and its union with the Church of Norton continued
for nearly 200 years, until 1824, when it was again separated and
made a perpetual curacy, the endowment being a " modus," in
lieu of tithes of some £12 a year, which has been supplemented
by small grants from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and Queen
Anne's Bounty. This is a typical instance of what was no doubt
a contributing cause of the Dissolution of Monastic Houses, an
appropriation of Parochial Endowments, which estranged the
goodwill of the Parochial Clergy and the Laity, and which
resulted in the permanent impoverishment of many Livings.
The next incident which I have to record in the history of the
Priory, is another small appropriation of a different kind. At
Longleat, near the site of the present mansion, was a Priory of
Black Canons dedicated to S. Radegund. This Priory had become
exceedingly impoverished, and it was accordingly dissolved in
1529, and what remained of its possessions was transferred to
Hinton and continued to belong to it until its own dissolution,
and it was called " the Cell of the Priory of Longleat."
A curious incident in connexion with a monk of Hinton, one
Nicholas Hopkins, has to be recorded. This Hopkins had been
Confessor to the ambitious Duke of Buckingham, whose fall is
recorded in Shakespeare's Henry VIII. He had indulged in
* £2 13s. 4d.
