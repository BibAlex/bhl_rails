Pitt was in Batli in 1754, at the time of the death of Pelham,
and the Corporation then paid him great attention. Allen, in
particular, had been affected by that glamour, which the great
orator was so well able to cast over those who came within his
circle.
In the year 1757 Pitt was member for Oakhampton, but was
tempted by Allen to resign that seat, and accept the representation.
of Bath. The two sitting members were Sir John Ligonier, K.B.,
and Mr. Robert Henley. The latter was a lawyer, and held the office
of City Recorder. It was proposed to make Henley Lord Keeper,
and this would of course have necessitated his withdrawal from.
Parliament.
The first of the series of letters which I wish to bring before
you is from the Mayor of Bath, Mr. Collibee, to Mr. Robert
Potter, a friend of Mr. Pitt's : —
Sr,
Your obligin«j Favour, dated the 20lh, came to hand yesterday
morning at eight ; in it you hint at a Conversation that pass'd between
us in Regard to Mr. Pitts being a Candidate for this City. I remember
at that time I set forth to you the connections that were between
Mr. Langton and his Friends, and the improbability of their desisting
from the intentioa of serving him till a geaerall Election.
I immediately on the receipt of your letter conven'd my friends on
the Business express'd in it, which I apprehended was unknown to
any other persons ; but at the first outset of treaty with our Party, I
found the Town was canvassing iu favour of Mr. Pitt.
Mr. Langton was sent to, and as his Eesolutions are to oflfer himself
a Candidate, Lis friends are determined to serve him.
I should have given you an answer sooner, but as the affair was
circumstanc'd possibly could not.
I and my friends really have the same due sense and regard for
Mr. Pitt as we have hitherto possess'd, and should be glad of testyfying
that regard when we have an opportunity of doing it,
I am yr. most hum. servt.
Edward Bushell Collibee.
