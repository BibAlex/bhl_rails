Stray Notes on Bath Booh. By F. Shum, F.S.A.

{Read March ISth, 1891.)
It is singular that although Bath is noted for its antiquities and
distinguished by its connection with the earliest English writers
there are no early Bath-printed books.
The connection of this city with ancient English literature is
no idle boast for the first English author was undoubtedly Gildas,
who flourished in the 6th century and was known by two
surnames ; sometimes he was styled Sapiens, at other times
Badonicus, the last indicating either his birth or his residence in
this locality.
In the 10th century within a stone's throw of the building in
which we are now assembled there was a well endowed monastery
over which the celebrated Elphege held sway and the rules of
which he rigidly reformed. He was born in the village of Weston
hard by ; from this Bath monastery he was summoned to preside
over the see of Canterbury, and while holding that high office,
and in discharging its duties, he was cruelly murdered by the
Danes. In the reign of Henry VI. lived a distinguished writer
Thomas Chandler, the author of a work on the two cities of Bath
and Wells, which was known in Leland's time, but is not now
extant. It was entitled "De Laudibus Bairorum et Fonticulorum
Civitatum." In addition to these there were three notable
names about the 12th century, John de Villula, Adelard styled
Athelardus Bathoniensis, a great traveller and linguist as well as
a mathematician, and Peter of Blois better known perhaps as
Peter Blessensis , who for 26 years was Archdeacon of Bath, and
afterwards Archdeacon of London. Learned, but poor all his
life long, he was anxious at the close of life to retire to his native
city of Blois ; he appealed in vain to the Pope, in whose
defence he had employed his pen, for pecuniary aid ; he died in
Vol. VIII., Nq. 3.
