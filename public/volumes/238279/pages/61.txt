In proceeding eastwards these rocks are in tlieir turn overlaid
by other newer formations, which taken in ascending order
consist of Inferior Oolite, Fuller's Earth and rock, and the Great,
or Bath Oolite, of Combe Down, wliich is the highest rock withia
the probable limits of the Somersetshire Coalfield. Many of the
pits have been sunk through the Lias, Ehaetic and New Red Sand-
stone before reaching the Coal Measures, and in some instances, as
at Braysdown, the shaft begins as high up as the Inferior Oolite,
■which is the highest formation that any pit in the district has yet.

Leaving the probable limits of the Somerset Coalfield under tiie
Great Oolite of Combe Down, and tracing our way, with the aid
of a geological map, across the south-eastern counties of England,
we find the following strata appearing at the surface in ascending
order, viz., the Forest Marble with Bradford Clay, the
Cornbrash, Oxford Clay, Coral Eag, Kimmeridge Clay, Purbeck
and Portland beds, Weald Clay and Hastings Sands, Lower
Greensand, Gault, Upper Greensand and Cbalk, above which lie
the Tertiary formations.
Although a survey of the South of England has enabled
Geologists thus to trace the out crops of the various formations
which appear on the surface in regular succession, it must not be
supposed that they are absolutely cumulative, otherwise any
sinkings or borings towards the South East coast would present
insuperable difficulties, the estimated thickness of overlying strata
being 7,150 feet.
On the contrary, recent borings have shown that as one
