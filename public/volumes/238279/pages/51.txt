on English Vines and Vineyards in 1670 " Our English Wines-
are known to us and distinguished most properly by the names-
of deeper and paler coloured Clarets. White Wines are of two-
sorts, either sweeter or more sharp or austere — also a small
Frantinick Wine — these are the Wines which this Climate
most affords " — (Hughes, p. 63^. The general evidence on the-
English Wines shows that they were of a poor quality. I should
suppose tliey were no better than the Wines still occasionally
made in old-f;ishioned farmhouses. Many of you must at times
have beofi compelled to drink such Wine, as I have been, and
have had to put a great strain on our consciences to pronounce it
good, and often a great strain on our palates to drink it.
I have put together these few notes on the Vineyards of our
neighbourhood in the hopes that the members of the Field
Club will add to the many other points, which they observe in
their walks, the evidences of ancient Vineyards — such evidences-
being looked for either in the names of fields, or in the actual
remains of Vineyards still existing — or in notices of them in old
records — I shall consider it a kindness if any member making
any such discovery will kindly inform me of it.
In conclusion, I ought shortly to notice that some writers have
asserted that the so-called Vineyards were only Orchards. Though
some of these writers were good Antiquaries, I must say that.
I see no proof whatever for such a statement. Our ancestors
knew the difference between grapes and apples, and were not.
likely to confuse a Vinea with a Pomarium.
