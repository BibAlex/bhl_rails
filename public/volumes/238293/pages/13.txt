INSTRUCTIONS.
The present volume is published in two parts : Part I contains
(a) Schedules and Indexes in four languages ; (h) An Author Catalogue.
Part II contains (c) A Subject Catalogue.
The Subject Catalogue is divided into sections, each of which is
denoted by a four-figure number between 0000 and 9999 called
u Registration number.
In each section the final arrangement of papers is in the
alphabetical order of authors' names.
In order to find the papers dealing with a particular subject the
reader may either consult the Schedule or the Index to the Schedule.
The numbers given in the index are Registration numbers, and can "be
used at once for turning to the proper page of the Subject Index. This
is done by looking at the numbers at the outer top corners of the pages
If the reader remember the name of the author of a paper on a
given subject, he will probably find it convenient to refer to the
Author Catalogue rather than to the Subject Catalogue.
In the Author Catalogue the numbers placed within square brackets
at the end of each entry are Registration numbers, and serve to
indicate the scope of each paper indexed. The meaning of these
numbers will at once be found by reference to the Schedule.
In case the abbreviated titles of Journals are not understood, a key
to these is provided at the end of the volume.
