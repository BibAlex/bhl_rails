All entries of a general character relating to apparatus,
methods, &c., «&c., shall be arranged in division 6000, under
appropriate headings.
Division 6200 shall include all entries relating to tlie determi-
nation of individual elements in their compounds and in mixtures,
excluding determinations of atomic weight. The entries shall
be arranged in sections distinguished by the elementary symbols
used as registration symbols.
Division 0300 shall include all entries i-elating to the deter-
mination of individual compounds — e.g., alkaloids, carbohydrates,
&c., including that of compound radicles such as acetyl in
acetates, methyl in ethers, &c., but excluding gases. The
entries shall be arranged in sections distinguished by the
elementary symbols of the dominant elements in the compounds
used as registration symbols, or in the case of organic com-
pounds by the registration symbols of the groups to Avhich they
belong. If necessary, gravimetric, volumetric, electrolytic,
physical, &c., methods may be distinguished by letters, such as
g, V, &c.
