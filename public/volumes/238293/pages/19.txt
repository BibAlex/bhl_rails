Each of these divisions shall be subdivided according- to tlie
number of oxygen atoms present in the keto-compound, further
subdivision being- carried out as in the case of hydrocarbons.

Each of the divisions 1610-1640 shall be subdivided into
monainino- diamine-, &c., derivatives, which shall be arranged
as in other series.
Hydroxy lauiine deiivatives shall constitute a sub-section of
the monamino-; hydrazine derivatives, amidines and amidoxims
a sub-section of the diamino ; and diazoimide (NaH) derivatives
a sub-section of the triamino-deiivatives.
Secondary and teitiary amines shall be entered under the
primary amines from \\ iiich they are derived.
Ammonium derivatives shall be entered under the corre-
spending- amino-derivatives.

Hydrazo- and oxyazo- compounds shall be entered under
corresponding- azo-derivatives.
All compounds containing- the azo-grouping- {i.e., disazo, &c.)
shall be classified in this section.
The empirical foimuloe of the compounds in the divisions 1700
to 1750 must be given.
