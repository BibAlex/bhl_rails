Alcohols and Ethers.
!200 General. {See also Q UOb).
J 210 Paraffiu-ols.
1220 Unsaturated open chain-ols.
1230 Benzenoid-ols.
1240 Reduced benzenoid-ols. C^'clic-ols otlier than
benzenoid-ols.
1250 Unclassified alcohols.
Each of these divisions shall be subdivided into ols, di-ols,
tri-ols, &c., each of which shall be further subdivided as under
hydrocarbons.
Haloid and allied derivatives of alcohols, thienols and selenols,
&c , shall be entered under corresponJing- alcohols.
Ethers shall be entered under the alcohols from which they
are derived, also ethereal salts of inorganic acids and of the
cyanic acids.
Acids.
1300 General. {See also Q 1500-1550).
1310 Paraffin acids.
1320 Unsaturated open chain acids.
1330 Benzenoid acids.
1340 Reduced benzenoid acids. Cyclic acids other than
benzenoid acids.
1350 Unclassified acids.
Each of these divisions shall be subdivided according- to the
number of oxygen atoms present in the acid, further subdivision
being- carried ont as in the case of the hydrocarbons from which
the acids may be considered to be derived by substitution of
hydrogen by carboxyl, SO3H, &c.
The position of the acid in the isologous series shall be deduced
from the empirical formula. The empirical or, if possible, the
structural formula should follow the registration number.
Sulphinic and sulphouic acids shall le included under acids in
the subdivisions of the corresponding carboxy acids.
Derivatives of acids shall as far as possible be included under
acids, such as haloid and allied derivatives, hydroxj^ and araino-
acids, aldehydic and keto-acids, ethereal salts, acid chlorides,
acid-amides, oxides, &c.
Aldehydes.
1400 General.
1410 Faraffin-als.
1420 Unsaturated open chain-als.
1430 Benzenoid-als.
1440 Reduced benzenoid and cyclic-als other than
benzenoid-als.
1450 Unclassified aldehydes.
Each of these divisions shall be subdivided according to the
number of oxygen atoms present in the aldehyde, further sub-
division being carried out as in the case of hydrocarbons.
