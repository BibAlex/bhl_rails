trial, in a sea which made boat service impossible and which utterly
destroyed the vessel. Another mode of using the life-car is the follow-
ing : By means of the shot-line, a single hauling-line, something more
than the length of the distance of the wreck from the shore, is drawn
on board, the end of it being made fast to a ring at one extremity of
the life-car. To a ring at the other extremity a similar hauling-line is
attached, the end of which remains on shore. By the first hauling-
line the car is dragged out through the water, as a boat, by those on
board, and, having received its load, is dragged back again through
the water by the line handled by the men on land. This method of
working the life-car is resorted to under certain exigencies, but is less
desirable than the other, because, although the people it contains are
safe, the car is liable to be turned over and over in its passage through
the breakers, much to their discomfort.

The large majority of the vessels now stranded upon our coasts
being coasters (schooners and barks), with crews of from six to ten
men, the breeches-buoy is more commonly used. This is a much
lighter contrivance, and therefore easier to transport and handle,
weighing only twenty-one pounds, and requiring for its use less heavy
