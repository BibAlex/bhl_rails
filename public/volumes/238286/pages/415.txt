DEVELOPMENT OF THE HOUSE-FLY.
By M. H. KOBSON.
THE following remarks on the development of the house-fly are
based on actual observation, and the appended sketches were
made by Mr. G. Harkus from the microscope, with the aid of a Beales
reflector.
Mr. Harkus, with whom I experimented simultaneously, was fortu-
nate, or the reverse, in having the required ova brought to him in this
way : A fly having gained access to a cold joint of lamb considerately
left a sufficient supply for his examination. The objectionable part of
the arrangement was probably counterbalanced by his being enabled to
fix the time of deposition with tolerable certainty. This was on July
28th. The eggs (one of which is represented in Fig. 3, its diameter
one thirtieth of an inch) were placed with a portion of the meat in
a glass vessel, and next day the maggots had emerged as in Fig. 4
(diameter one twenty-fifth of an inch), where the ramifications of the
tracheal system may be traced.
The warm weather, coupled with the indoor heat, matured the
larva rapidly, the change from maggot to chrysalis (Fig. 2) being ap-
parent at each observation, some having assumed this state on July

30th. The perfect stage was reached and the fly emerged on August
5th, or eight days from the deposition of the ova (Fig. 1).
This was a week in advance of the result obtained in my experi-
ment, which I preferred to conduct out of doors. A piece of raw liver
was exposed, which soon had eggs enough attached to it. It would
appear that the fly has to some extent the power of withholding the
