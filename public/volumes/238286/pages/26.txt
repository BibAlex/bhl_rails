kiwi-kiwi (Fig. 4) of New Zealand, a near relative of the ostriches and
running-birds in general, represents a still more degraded condition of
the organs of flight, for the wing
is reduced in size to an extraor-
dinary degree, and exists in a
highly abortive condition; while
only one complete finger is rep-
resented in the hand other
birds, as a rule, possessing three
modified fingers. The logger-
headed duck of South America
has wings so reduced that it
can but "flap along the sur-
face of the water," a condition
of matters closely imitated among ourselves by the Aylesbury duck
although, indeed, the young ducks are able to fly. The wing of the
penguin (Fig. 5) is a mere scaly appendage utterly useless for flight,
but useful as a veritable fin, enabling it to swim under water with great
facility ; and of the auk's wing the same remark holds good. In the

birds, then, there is ample evidence of deterioration of organs in the
rudimentary nature of the wings of many species. How these condi-
tions have been brought about is not difficult to explain in most in-
stances. In New Zealand, where we find a singular absence of quad-
rupeds, wingless birds many being extinct of which the apteryx is a
good example, take the place of the four-footed population. In view
of an immunity from the attack of other animals, the ground-feeding
habits of these birds would become more and more strongly settled as
their special way of life ; and, in the pursuit of such habits, the wings,
