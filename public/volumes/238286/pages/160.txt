THE HISTORY OF GAMES. zz 7
eiation in those passages in the Gospels which show it turned to mock-
ery by the Roman soldiers: "And when they had blindfolded him
.... they buffeted him .... saying, Prophesy unto us, Christ, Who
is he that smote thee?" (Luke xxii. 64 ; Matt. xxvi. 67 ; Markxiv. 65).
Another of the Egyptian pictures plainly represents the game we
know by its Italian name of morra, the Latin micatio, or flashing of
the fingers, which has thus lasted on in the Mediterranean districts
over three thousand years, handed down through a hundred successive
generations who did not improve it, for from the first it was perfect
in its fitting into one little niche in human nature. It is the game of
guessing addition, the players both at once throwing out fingers and
in the same moment shouting their guesses at the total. Morra is the
pastime of the drinking-shop in China as in Italy, and may, perhaps,
be reckoned among the items of culture which the Chinese have bor-
rowed from the Western barbarians. Though so ancient, morra has in
it no touch of prehistoric rudeness, but must owe its origin to a period
when arithmetic had risen quite above the savage level. The same is
true of the other old arithmetical game, odd-and-even, which the poet
couples with riding on a stick as the most childish of diversions,
"Ludere>r irrypar, equitare in arundine longa." But the child play-
ing it must be of a civilized nation, not of a low barbaric tribe, where
no one would think of classing numbers into the odd-and-even series,
so that Europeans have even had to furnish their languages with
words for these ideas. I asked myself the question whether the an-
cient Aryans distinguished odd from even, and curiously enough found
that an answer had been preserved by the unbroken tradition not of
Greek arithmeticians, but of boys at play. A scholiast on the Ploutos
of Aristophanes, where the game is mentioned, happens to remark that
it was also known as %vya ?/ a^vya, "yokes or not-yokes." Now, this
matches so closely in form and sense with the Sanskrit terms for even
and odd numbers, yuj and ayuj, as to be fair evidence that both Hin-
doos and Greeks inherited arithmetical ideas and words familiar to
their Aryan ancestors.
Following up the clews that join the play-life of the ancient and
modern worlds, let us now look at the ball-play, which has always
held its place among sports. Beyond mere tossing and catching, the
simplest kind of ball-play is where a ring of players send the ball
from hand to hand. This gentle pastime has its well-marked place
in history. Thus the ancient Greeks, whose secret of life was to do
even trivial things with artistic perfection, delighted in the game of
Nausikaa, and on their vases is painted many a scene where ball-
play, dance, and song unite in one graceful sport. The ball-dance
is now scarcely to be found but as an out-of-the-way relic of old
custom ; yet it has left curious traces in European languages, where
the ball (Low Latin ballet) has given its name to the dance it went with
(Italian ballare, hallo, French hal, English ball) and even to the song
