THE STORY OF THE NOVEMBER METEORS. 447
in this way without obstruction through the depths of space, are ready
to yield at once the due amount of obedience to the attraction of the
sun. Accordingly, each meteor which traverses the elliptic orbit
represented in the diagram, mends its pace so long as it is gliding
along that half of its course in which it is approaching the sun, because
here the sun is drawing it forward as well as sideways ; and the for-
ward attraction increases its velocity, while the sideward attraction
bends its path into the oval form. The meteor takes upward of six-
teen years to traverse this part of its orbit, and all this time its
velocity is on the increase. It has attained its greatest speed when it
reaches the point of its orbit which is closest to the sun, near to which
is the place where it crosses the earth's path. As it passes this point
its velocity is twenty-seven miles a second. The earth moves at the
rate of nineteen miles a second in very nearly the opposite direction,
so that if the meteor happen to strike the earth, the velocity of its
approach is the sum of these two numbers, or forty-six miles a second;
and it is at this enormous speed that it plunges into our atmosphere.
