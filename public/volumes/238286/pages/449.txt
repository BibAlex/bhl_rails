ers that the violated law can not be bribed to stay its arm by burnt-
offerings nor placated by prayers it is a harmful doctrine, as tending
directly to undermine understanding and to weaken will, to teach that
either prayer or sacrifice will obviate the consequences of want of fore-
sight or want of self-discipline, or that reliance on supernatural aid
will make amends for lack of intelligent will. We still pray half-
heartedly in our churches, as our forefathers prayed with their whole
hearts, when we are afflicted with a plague or pestilence, that God will
" accept of an atonement and command the destroying angel to cease
from punishing " ; and when we are suffering from too much rain we
ask him to send fine weather, " although we for our iniquities have
worthily deserved a plague of rain and waters." Is there a person of
sincere understanding who, uttering that prayer, now believes it in his
heart to be the successful way to stay a fever, plague, or pestilence ?
He knows well that, if it is to be answered, he must clean away dirt,
purify drains, disinfect houses, and put in force those other sanitary
measures which experience has proved to be efficacious, and that the
aid vouchsafed to the prayer will only be given when these are by
themselves successful. Had men gone on believing, as they once be-
lieved, that prayer would stay disease, they would never have learned
and adopted sanitary measures, any more than the savage of Africa
who prays to his fetich to cure disease does now. To get rid of the
notion of supernatural interposition was the essential condition of true
knowledge and self-help in that matter.
Many persons who could not confidently express their belief in the
power of prayer to stop a plague or a deluge of rain, or who actually
disbelieve it, still have a sincere hold of the belief of its miraculous
power in the moral or spiritual world. Nevertheless, if the matter be
made one simply of scientific observation, it must be confessed that
all the evidence goes to prove that the events of the moral world are
matters of law and order equally with those of the physical world,
and that supernatural interpositions have no more place in the one
than in the other ; that he who prays for the creation of a clean heart
and the renewal of a right spirit within him, if he gets at last what
he prays for, gets it by the operation of the ordinary laws of moral
growth and development, in consequence of painstaking watchfulness
over himself and the continual exercise of good resolves. Only when
he gets it in that way will he get the benefit of supernatural aid ; and,
if he rests in the belief of supernatural aid, without taking pains to
get it entirely in that way, he will do himself moral harm ; for if he
can not rely upon special interpositions in the moral any more than in
the physical world, if he has to do entirely with those secondary laws
of nature through which alone the supernatural is made natural, the
invisible visible, it needs no demonstration that the opposite belief can
not strengthen, but must weaken, the understanding and will. It is
plain that true moral hygiene is as impossible to the savage who relies
