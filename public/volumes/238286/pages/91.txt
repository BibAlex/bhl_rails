the more important papers either written or edited by him, and pub-
lished in the "Journal," may be named Rev. Ebenezer Burgess's trans-
lation of the " Surya-Siddhanta " (a Hindoo treatise on astronomy) 1860,
with notes and an appendix; text, with notes, of the " Atharva-Veda
Praticakhya" (1862) ; the text of the " Taittiriya Praticakhya" (1871),
with English version, notes, and native commentary, the last two being
grammatical treatises the edition of the " Taittiriya " won for Pro-
fessor Whitney from the Berlin Academy the Bopp prize reviews of
Lipsius's phonetic alphabet and of the opinions of Biot, Weber, and
Miiller on the lunar zodiac of India, Arabia, and China. He was a con-
tributor to the great Sanskrit Dictionary of Bohtlingk and Roth (St.
Petersburg, 1853-'67, seven volumes). In 1869 he aided in founding
the American Philological Association, and was its first President. His
work, "Language and the Study of Language" (2 vols., 1867, repub-
lished in 1874), was made up of a series of lectures, delivered first at
the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, and repeated at the Lowell
Institute, Boston ; it was translated into German, and edited, with addi-
tions, by J. Jolly, under the title of "Die Sprachwissenschaft " (Munich,
1874). His principal contributions to the "Journal of the American
Oriental Society," "The North American Review," "The New-England-
er," and other periodicals, were collected and published in two volumes,
entitled "Oriental and Linguistic Studies" (1873-'74). To the "Inter-
national Scientific Series" he contributed a volume in 1875, entitled
"The Life and Growth of Language," which was very favorably re-
ceived both at home and abroad, having been translated into French,
German, and Italian. He has prepared several school manuals for the
use of students of the German language, viz., a grammar, a reader, a
dictionary, and texts of certain of the German classics. In 1877 ap-
peared his work, " Essentials of English Grammar." He has now in
press, in Leipsic, a Sanskrit Grammar, in English and German editions.
