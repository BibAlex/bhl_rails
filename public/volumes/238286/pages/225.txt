certain number of millimetres traversed by the style in the vertical
direction. The course of the style, which corresponds to a kilometre,
ought to be experimentally determined for each vehicle, for the perim-
eter of wheels is not always the same. But it is clear that, if from
each kilometre-stone to another we obtain five millimetres, for example,
for the course of the style, this length will always be found to be trav-
ersed each kilometre by the same vehicle. Our apparatus is then a
measurer of distances, and dispenses with the necessity of attending to

the existence of kilometre-stones ; it enables the distance traversed on
any road whatever to be estimated, and even when there is no beaten
track. Thus in a journey of discovery we may measure the distance
traversed by a cart. To remain in the conditions of ordinary life, have
we not sometimes in the country a choice of two or three roads to go
from one place to another ? To know which is the shortest we appeal
to the watch, as if the least duration of a walk corresponded to the
least distance. The odograph will give in this respect very precise
information.
There are again a great number of questions which we ask daily
without being able to solve them. Does such a draught-horse go
quicker than such another ? Does this trot better to-day than yester-
day ? By increasing the ration of oats do we increase speed ? Com-
pare the slope of two curves of rates, and you will have the reply to
all these questions without being obliged to make special ex])erinients
on a measured road, watch in hand.
It is not only to the speed of vehicles that the registering apparatus
applies ; it traces, though with less precision, the rate of progress of
