First Annual Report of the United States
Entomological Commission. Washing-
ton : Government Printing-Office. 1878.
Pp. 800, with Maps and Plates.
We have here in full detail the first
year's labors of the United States Entomo-
logical Commission, appointed by Congress
to study the best methods of preventing the
ravages of the Rocky Mountain locust. The
habits of the insect, its geographical distri-
bution, and many other points in its natu-
ral history, have been pretty satisfactorily
determined by the Commission ; and, if the
Commission has not succeeded in discover-
ing the method of getting rid of the pest, it
has at least indicated many ways of lessen-
ing its violence, and of partially staying its
advance.
Seventh Report of the State Entomolo-
gist on the Noxious and Beneficial
Insects of the State of Illinois. By
C. Thomas, Ph. D., State Entomologist.
Springfield, Illinois : D. W. Lusk print.
Pp. 290.
The most elaborate paper in this report
is one entitled "Notes on Corn Insects, or
Insects injurious to Indian Corn." The au-
thor has been investigating this special sub-
ject for a long time, and his results, as here
stated, are eminently worthy of the attention
of the farmer. These "Notes" occupy the
first one hundred pages of the report ; the
remainder is devoted to miscellaneous notes
and observations on different species of
noxious and beneficial insects.
Progressive Japan : A Studv of the Po-
litical and Social Needs of the Em-
pire. By General Le Gendre. San
Francisco : A. L. Bancroft & Co. 1878.
Pp. 380.
In this study of the social and political
needs of Japan, General Le Gendre has
sought mainly from the history of the Jap-
anese people the aid which others might
perhaps have preferred to ask solely from
abstract Western sciences. " It is," he
writes, " by interpreting a people's tradi-
tions, by carefully listening to the mysteri-
ous teachings of the wise men who, in re-
mote ages, guided its infancy, that one is
apt to discover the early promise of its fu-
ture." Therefore, in the reconstruction of
the political state of Japan, care must be
taken not to do violence to the national ge-
nius by prematurely introducing Western
institutions. The author treats at great
length of "Reconstruction," and points out
the direction which, in his opinion, it must
take in order to produce the largest measure
of good for the Japanese people.
