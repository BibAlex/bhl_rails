THE CONDITION OF WOMEN

secret of influence is a vivid appreciation of the established motives
and incentives to conduct.
The relative power of persuasion of the two sexes, then, may be
tabulated as follows :

According to our hypothesis, the first line of the table should give
the arrangement in which the difference is greatest. In the next line
the difference is less ; still less in the next ; and least of all in the last
case. In all cases, however, the superiority of women in this respect
should be very marked.
Since our feelings are necessarily much more numerous than our
judgments, we" should expect to find it much more easy to persuade
either a man or a woman than to convince ; but, if our theory is cor-
rect, the advantage of influence over argument should be much greater
when a woman is to be moved than when the effort is directed to a
man.
Another difference between the sexes will at once be seen to follow
from the above parallel. Since male character has the variable ele-
ment, and may vary toward either good or bad, it follows that the
ideally perfect male character will be more hard to define and more sel-
dom realized than the ideal female character. It is difficult to prove such
a statement as this, for the sentiments upon which individual opinion of
the subject is based hardly admit of exact statement, but that there is
an accepted standard of female excellence, and that the women who
realize it are not rare exceptions, can, I think, be shown by the study
of female character as depicted by dramatists, novelists, and poets.
An appeal to this test is unfavorable to our hypothesis, for characters
are selected for novels or poems on account of their originality ; but I
think that any one who will review Shakespeare, Thackeray, or George
Eliot with the subject in mind, and who will compare the more impor-
tant female characters, will find that they might be transposed from
one novel or play to another with much less violence than would at-
tend the transposition of the male characters.
It is hardly necessary to call attention to the obvious fact that our
conclusions have a strong leaning to the conservative or old-fashioned
view of the subject to what many will call the " male " view of wo-
men. The positions which women already occupy in society and the
duties which they perform are, in the main, what they should be if our
view is correct ; and any attempt to improve the condition of women
by ignoring or obliterating the intellectual differences between them
