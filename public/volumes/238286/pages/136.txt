OF THE FACULTY OF WONDER. Ig?
the spiritual world any more than in the physical world. That is
beside my argument. My argument at present is simply this, that
within the realm of law, clearly understood as such, there is food for
the faculty of wonder in all its legitimate aspirations far more endur-
ing, far greater, and far grander than anything that can be developed
in the way of those communications of table-turning, table-rapping, or
anything of that kind. And the instance I gave was just one out of
endless instances to try and conceive of the manner in which the
spirit of man, that which he knows to exist, and, in fact, to be himself
his ego communicates through his nerves with his muscles how it
is capable of being so minutely directed that along the lines of nervous
communication it will arrive at a particular muscle or particular group
of muscles, and perform all the complicated muscular acts which we
know to be the physical and tangible results of the manifestations of
our spirit. In other words, the most commonplace appearance of a
spirit that you can name the most every-day manifestation in the
world, and that which we are most certain of in our own consciousness
is, when you come to think of it, an absolute and perfect mystery,
which only becomes comprehensible to us because we know it to be a
fact, and because it lies within the divine order of things. It is physi-
ological. "What spiritism or spiritualism appears to require of us is,
that having got our every-day consciousness of this matter for wonder
having got all this marvelous adaptation of spirit to matter having
a set of thoroughly organized and thoroughly known channels by
which the spiritual world is revealed in the material, and by which the
Great and Supreme Spirit is enabled to reveal himself to every one of
us having, I say, got the absolute proof and evidence in our own
souls and our own bodies of a set of laws appertaining to this matter,
what spiritualism requires of us to do is to cast aside the whole of
these laws, and to admit a set of interferences, not exceptional, not
for grand and very, very exceptional objects, but a set of every-day
constant interferences with the law of the action of spirit and matter
as such, known to all of us interferences which are not only not in
accordance with that law, but which are absolutely subversive of the
ordinary results of that law. Just let us suppose this : Suppose it
proved, once for all, that the spirit of a departed person a disem-
bodied spirit, a spirit that is wandering in space, a spirit which is not
limited by the conditions of matei'ial investment has the power to
appear to you, and to reveal to you what is being done or written, or
has been done by some friend of yours on the other side of the globe,
or who has passed beyond the grave, and that it has had access to
documents no mortal could have seen, what appears to be the neces-
sary consequence of this doctrine ? This, among others, that no scrap
of writing that no single act that a man does could be concealed, or
at least could be perfectly sure of being concealed, from his neighbor
from any man who may have the greatest possible interest in know-
