manifestations, there is protoplasm ; wherever there is protoplasm,
there, too, is life. Thus, coextensive with the whole of organic nature
every vital act being referable to some mode or property of proto-
plasm it becomes to the biologist what the ether is to the physicist ;
only that instead of being an hypothetical conception, accepted as a
reality from its adequacy in the explanation of phenomena, it is a
tangible and visible reality, which the chemist may analyze in his
laboratory, the biologist scrutinize beneath his microscope and his dis-
secting needle.
The chemical composition of protoplasm is very complex, and has
not been exactly determined. It may, however, be stated that pro-
toplasm is essentially a combination of albuminoid bodies, and that
its principal elements are, therefore, oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and
nitrogen. In its typical state it presents the condition of a semi-fluid
substance a tenacious, glairy liquid, with a consistence somewhat like
that of the white of an unboiled egg* While we watch it beneath
the microscope, movements are set up in it : waves traverse its surface,
or it may be seen to flow away in streams, either broad and attaining
but a slight distance from the main mass, or else stretching away far
from their source, as narrow liquid threads, which may continue sim-
ple, or may divide into branches, each following its own independent
course ; or the streams may flow one into the other, as streamlets
would flow into rivulets and rivulets into rivers, and this not only
where gravity would carry them, but in a direction diametrically op-
posed to gravitation : now we see it spreading itself out on all sides
into a thin liquid stratum, and again drawing itself together within
the narrow limits which had at first confined it, and all this without
any obvious impulse from without which would send the ripples over
its surface or set the streams flowing from its margin. Though it is
certain that all these phenomena are in response to some stimulus
exerted on it by the outer world, they are such as we never meet with
in a simply physical fluid they are spontaneous movements resulting
from its proper irritability, from its essential constitution as living
matter.
Examine it closer, bring to bear on it the highest powers of your
microscope you will probably find disseminated through it countless
multitudes of exceedingly minute granules ; but you may also find it
absolutely homogeneous, and, whether containing granules or not, it
is certain that you will find nothing to which the term organization
* In speaking of protoplasm as a liquid, it must be borne in mind that this expression
refers only to its physical consistence a condition depending mainly on the amount of
water with which it is combined, and subject to considerable variation, from the solid
form in which we find it in the dormant embryo of seeds, to the thin, watery state in
which it occurs in the leaves of Valisneria. Its distinguishing properties are totally dif-
ferent from those of a purely physical liquid, and are subject to an entirely different set
of laws.
