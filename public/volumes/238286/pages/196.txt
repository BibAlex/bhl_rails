WASTED FORCES *
By WILLIAM H. WAUL, Ph.D.
THOSE inventions are deserving of special honor, and generally
receive the most substantial recognition, which develop new in-
dustries or utilize waste products.
The glycerine industry, which has attained colossal proportions, is
a notable illustration of a great manufacture based entirely upon the
saving of what until lately was a waste product of the soap-boiler.
As even more important, I may mention the industries connected with
the manufacture of aniline dyes and artificial madder from the refuse
coal-tar that was formerly the curse and nuisance of the gas-works.
Old boots and shoes and leather waste are turned to good account by
the chemical manufacturer in producing the cyanides, ferro and ferrid
cyanides, so indispensable in color-printing and photography. Of the
carcasses of slaughtered animals, not a scrap or morsel is allowed to
go to waste, as you are well aware ; and even the waste blood of the
abattoir is used by the sugar-refiner and the manufacturer of albumen.
Sawdust mixed with blood, or some other agglutinative substance, and
compressed by powerful pressure in heated dies, is formed into door-
knobs, hardware and furniture trimmings, buttons, and a thousand use-
ful and decorative articles ; or, as is the case with the spent bark of
the tanneries, it is utilized for fuel under steam-boilers. Oyster-shells,
of which our barbarous progenitors of ages ago made the shell-mounds
that delight the soul of the anthropologist of to-day, are burned to
lime ; the waste of the linseed-oil manufacturers is eagerly sought
after as food for cattle ; the waste ashes of wood-fires are leached for
potash ; river-mud is mingled with chalk, and burned and ground to
