PEOTOPLASM AND LIFE.*
By Professor G. J. ALLMAN, LL.D., F.K.S.,
PRESIDENT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.
MORE than forty years have now passed away since the French
naturalist, Dujardin, drew attention to the fact that the bodies
of some of the lowest members of the animal kingdom consist of a
structureless, semi-fluid, contractile substance, to which he gave the
name of Sarcode. A similar substance occurring in the cells of plants
was afterward studied by Hugo von Mohl, and named by him Pro-
toplasm. It remained for Max Schultze to demonstrate that the sar-
code of animals and the protoplasm of plants were identical.
The conclusions of Max Schultze have been in all respects con-
firmed by subsequent research, and it has further been rendered cer-
tain that this same protoplasm lies at the base of all the phenomena of
life, whether in the animal or the vegetable kingdom. Thus has arisen
the most important and significant generalization in the whole domain
of biological science.
Within the last few years protoplasm has again been made a sub-
ject of special study ; unexpected and often startling facts have been
brought to light, and a voluminous literature has gathered round this
new center of research. I believe, therefore, that I can not do better
than call your attention to some of the more important results of these
inquiries, and endeavor to give you some knowledge of the properties
of protoplasm, and of the part it plays in the two great kingdoms of
organic nature.
As has just been said, protoplasm lies at the base of every vital
phenomenon. It is, as Huxley has well expressed it, "the physical
basis of life." Wherever there is life, from its lowest to its highest
