instructed to consider the clinching of the jaws and semi-contraction
of the fingers, which have been considered signs of death, to be on
the contrary evidences of vitality, and to borrow from them hope and
confidence for redoubled effort in the work of resuscitation. This is
a discovery of Dr. Labordette, of the Hospital of Lisieux, in France.
He found by numerous experiments that the jaws and hands relax
when death ensues, rigor mortis supervening later.
The Merriman life-saving suit is supplied to the stations, and often
proves useful by enabling surfmen to effect rescues of individuals
struggling in the breakers, and even to reach wrecks and assist be-
numbed crews to set up the life-lines. It consists of footed pantaloons
of India-rubber, and above the waist of a double ply of the same ma-
terial covering all but the face, and inflated severally in breast, back,
and head, between the plies, by three rubber tubes. Being thus buoy-
ant, and also impervious to air, its wearer can neither drown nor freeze.
Since its original introduction at the stations, the exploits of Paul Boy-
ton have given it celebrity.
Upon occasions of boat-service, the life-saving crews are required '
by regulation to wear the cork life-belts devised by Captain Ward,
the Inspector of the Royal National Life-Boat Institution of Great
Britain. These life-belts weigh severally only four and a half pounds ;

are flexible, being composed of a series of small blocks of cork strung
together ; have crenellations under the arms, leaving those members
unimpeded in action ; and, by rendering the surfmen secure from
drowning, double their efficiency to assist others in case of exigency.
The stations are opened for service on the seaboard from Septem-
ber 1st to May 1st, or for a shorter period wherever deemed prudent,
