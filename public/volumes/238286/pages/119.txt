are determined in those cases where experience has shown that they
apply. Those laws of conduct which have been long recognized
gradually assume the shape of habits or intuitions, according to which
conduct is almost unconsciously regulated, and the habits finally be-
come established as one of the hereditary characteristics of the race.
We are apt to confine our attention to the subjective side of hu-
man advancement, and to neglect the structural side, and at the same
time to neglect the subjective side of the evolution of the lower forms
of life, and to confine our attention to the structural side, but of
course no one can doubt that a new habit is represented by a new spe- '
cialization of structure, and is transmitted like any other peculiarity
by heredity.
If this is so, and if the female organism is the conservative organ-
ism, to which is intrusted the keeping of all that has been gained
during the past history of the race, it must follow that the female
mind is a storehouse filled with the instincts, habits, intuitions, and
laws of conduct which have been gained by past experience. The
male organism, on the contrary, being the variable organism, the origi-
nating element in the process of evolution, the male mind must have
the power of extending experience over new fields, and, by comparison
and generalization, of discovering new laws of nature, which are in
their turn to become rules of action, and to be added on to the series
of past experiences.
Our examination of the origin and significance of the physiological
differences between the sexes, and of the parts which they have taken
in the progress of the past, would therefore lead us to expect certain
profound and fundamental psychological differences, having the same
importance ; and it will be interesting to examine what these intellec-
tual and ethical differences are, and how far experience and the com-
mon consent of mankind accord with the demands of our hypothesis.
If, as we suppose, the especial and peculiar function of the male
mind is the expansion of our circle of experience ; the more exact ap-
prehension of all our relations to the external world ; the discovery of
the laws of thought, of society, of physiology, and of the material uni-
verse, and of the bearing of these laws upon individual conduct it
will follow that men must excel women in their power to discover the
manner in Avhich a new external relation shall be met and provided
for by a new internal adjustment. In a case where our instincts, in-
tuitions, feelings, or past experiences furnish no guide to conduct, the
judgment of a man as to the proper course of action will be of more
value than the judgment of a woman.
On the other hand, only a very small proportion of our actions are
directed to new conditions ; experience has already determined the
proper conduct in all the circumstances upon which our preservation
and well-being most directly depend ; and action in these circum-
stances does not demand comparison and judgment, while it must usu-
