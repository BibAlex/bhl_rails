KEMOVAL OF INHERITED TENDENCIES TO
DISEASE.
By J. K. BLACK, M. D.
A LIMITED collection of statistics and the observation of phy-
sicians concur in showing that about two thirds of our people
inherit a tendency to some disease, or to a defective vitality in some
organ of the body. In very many instances the overshadowing heri-
tage is toward an untimely death, while in others it is simply toward
some chronic insufficiency which embitters many a year of life.
The number who think themselves doomed to a premature death
by some innate blood defect is very great. At this moment hundreds
of thousands are ready to interpret every sign of thoracic derange-
ment as the harbinger to the development of that dreaded inheritance
pulmonary consumption. Taking into consideration that, according
to the last census, about seventy thousand throughout our land are
swept into the grave each year by this disease, cause for alarm seems
sufficiently ample. The aggregate of foreboding, of suffering, and of
heart-wringing grief at untimely separations through this scourge
alone, would be terrible to contemplate were we capable of appre-
hending it as a whole. Add to this the heritage in numerous instances
of a tendency to rheumatism, to gout, to epilepsy, to insanity, to can-
cel', and the host of those distressed in mind or in body attains a pain-
ful magnitude. A subordinate and large group of heritages are yet to
be added. Every year thousands are brought into the world with di-
gestive organs so imperfect that the slightest indiscretion precipitates
misery ; others are tormented for life by the development of an inher-
ited tendency to migraine, to neuralgia, or to asthma ; and not a few
through the same agency lose their sight or their hearing during the
prime of life.
