ticular, a complete and trustworthy guide
both for ready reference and for study. In
this connection we hope that it may prove
an effectual impetus to, and become largely
instrumental in, the better, more correct,
and more thorough study of pharmacology
so much needed by pharmacists, druggists,
and physicians, and at the pharmaceutical
aud medical schools of our country.
The publisher deserves due credit for the
good style in which the book has been
brought out. If shortcomings in this re-
spect can be pointed out, they consist main-
ly in the comparative inferiority of quite a
number of the woodcuts. While a few of
them as, for instance, on pages 314, 645,
866, and 1161 are equal to the excellent
illustrations of the corresponding standard
works of the French, and in particular of
the German literature, others are less satis-
factory, and in not a few cases inadequate
to such an elaborate work and to the pres-
ent state of xylography. Future editions
can remedy this want, and in this respect
enhance the value of the work by a liberal
addition of pharmacognostical illustrations.
