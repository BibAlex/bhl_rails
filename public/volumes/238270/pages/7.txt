THE ROYAL CANADIAN INSTITUTE.
PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS, 1915.
We meet here to-night to open the sixty-eighth Session of this Insti-
tute.
The activities of the past year have been necessarily confined by
the commercial conditions which have prevailed, owing to the state
of war that exists.
The greater part of the papers read at the meetings held during the
last Session were upon subjects of very great interest in connection
with warlike operations. The appreciation which was shown by the
members and the public of these papers was very gratifying to
the Council, and seemed to give earnest of an awakened interest
in the proceedings of the Institute which has been worked for and
anticipated for some time past.
You have before you the programme of papers to be read at the six
meetings on each Saturday night from now until and including the 18th
of December. A short consideration of the subjects embraced in that
programme will awaken, I trust, a keen appreciation of the fact that the
Institute is fulfilling its duty, not alone to its members, but to the public
in general, in the most ample way.
One is frequently met in conversation with persons who do not take
the trouble to inform themselves of the work of the Institute, that they
are not drawn towards the meetings of the Institute by reason of the
scientific character which many of the papers possess. We may place
on record our sympathy for these individuals, merely adding that the
compliment conveyed in their reason for want of interest is a tribute
to the value of our work.
