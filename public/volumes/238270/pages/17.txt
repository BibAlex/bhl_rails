PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS, 1915. 15
is of real and immediate importance to-day. Yet the work has scarcely
been begun. There is, for example, as yet no adequate record of the part
England played in the great reconstruction of Europe after the Napole-
onic Wars. Neither Canning nor Palmerston is known to us, except by
loose and inadequate records."
After our day the history of the momentous times in which we live
will be written. We must be content with the fragments of history in
the making which fall to us in the meantime, and from day to day carry
our hopes and disappointments as they come with such fortitude as
we may.
"None of us are prepared to suppose anything so unscientific as that
the Allies are decadent and the Germans superhuman, or that all goes
well with them yonder while all goes ill with the Allies. Let us try to
conceive that a war is a slow and hazardous shifting of unequal values.
Let us recognize that, as this war is vaster in itself than all the cam-
paigns and battles of two centuries put together, a decisive transfor-
mation of values must not be looked for suddenly. We cannot expect
to achieve in teens of months success such as our forefathers could only
gain in teens of years. Reflecting that in the case of the British people
never were the parties, the Kingdom and the Empire united as now,
and that never before had we forces so great and gallant, or Allies so
determined and powerful. Let us not look on the dark side, which is
that never before had we so powerful an enemy. Let us be calm in the
confidence of ultimate success, as British patriots put up with post-
ponement patiently, with the certain conviction that the longer the war
goes on the worse and more lasting will the ruin of Germany be, and the
wider the influence of Great Britain in the vast changed future now to
come."
FRANK ARNOLDI,
President.
