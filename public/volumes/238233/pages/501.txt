ASTRONOMY WITH AN OPERA-GLASS.

terial of which this mountain is formed, would seem to possess a higher
reflective power than that of any other portion of the moons surface.
One is irresistibly reminded of the crystallized mountains described in
the celebrated Moon Hoax of Richard Adams Locke. With an
opera-glass, you can readily recognize Aristarchus as a bright point at
full moon. With a field-glass it is better seen, and some of the short,
light rays surrounding it are perceived, while, when the sun is rising
upon it, about four days after first quarter, its crateriform shape can
be detected with such a glass.

The visibility of Aristarchus on the dark side of the moon leads us
to a brief consideration of the illumination by the earth of that por-
tion of the moons surface which is not touched directly by sunlight at
new and old moon. This phenomenon is shown in our second illus-
tration. Not only can the outlines of the dark part of the moon be
seen under such circumstances, but even the distinction in color be-
tween the dusky seas and the more brilliant table-lands and mount-
ain-regions can be perceived, and with powerful telescopes many
minor features come into sight. A little consideration must convince
any one, as it convinced Galileo more than two hundred and seventy-
five years ago, that the light reflected from the earth upon the moon
is sufficient to produce this faint illumination of the lunar landscapes.
We have only to recall the splendors of a night that is lighted by a
full moon, and then to recollect that at new or old moon the earth
is full as seen from our satellite, and that a full earth must give
some fourteen times as much light as a full moon, in order to realize
the brilliancy of an earth-lit night upon the moon. As the moon
waxes to us, the earth wanes to the moon, and vice versa, and so the
