their various vocations ; but it is a well-known fact that in many rail-
roads only one or two men in a road-gang know how to tamp a tie so
that it will not require resetting the same season ; and extensive lines
are known to the author that do not possess a foreman perhaps not
a supervisor who can adjust a curve with instruments. In these ex-
tensive enterprises the efficiency of the unit the individual workman
becomes an item of grave economic consideration ; for if it be true
that the value of the individuals work (whatever it be) is increased
through greater intelligence and special training, though it be only by
a few cents per day, the total is of no inconsiderable moment, when
his services continue through a series of years, and when, instead of
one workman, thousands are employed. If even a slight deficiency in
the skill and intelligence of one workman makes a few cents or a few
dollars difference in the cost of the products of each weeks labor ; if
the incompetency of one foreman or one manager lacking scientific
training does usually as so positively stated by competent authorities
net an appreciable loss ; multiply the result to corporations like, for
instance, our Eastern trunk-lines (one of which employs at least fifty
thousand people on that part of its system east of the Ohio River, and
more than half as many more west of it) ; realize that in such extensive
organizations few if any of the practical details of the operating de-
partments can be accurately gauged by those whose interests are most
vitally concerned ; comprehend how many important matters, involv-
ing grave consequences in their execution, must be intrusted to super-
intendents, master -mechanics, and foremen ; then obtain a correct
measure of their education and general knowledge (to say nothing
of their scientific attainments), and we shall begin to appreciate the
importance and bearing of this question of technological education,
and the enormous losses the lack of it yearly entails upon investors in
railway securities.
In railway service thei - e is frequent necessity for sending to a dis-
tance, and beyond supervision, one or more thoroughly competent
men, who shall not be simply mechanics, in the ordinary acceptation
of the term, but who shall be able to turn their attention to work
coming under their notice, whether they have before done that thing
or not. At present such men are rarely found enrolled in the rank
and file of railway mechanical departments ; yet it is testified by
many manufacturers who have afforded their operatives the advan-
tages of technological instruction, that they have no difficulty in fill-
ing such positions with boys of twenty or twenty-one years of age,
whom they send long distances and place in their hands work with
which they have had little or no previous acquaintance, and by their
intelligence they not only give the greatest satisfaction, but frequently
develop into competent teachers of others.
The reason for the educational deficiencies of railway operatives
is apparent when we consider how few opportunities they have for
