THE ECONOMIC DISTURBANCES SINCE 1873. 443
through importations, is shown by the circumstance that in the Eng-
lish debates upon the corn laws, about the year 1840, it was estimated,
upon data furnished by Mr. Tooke, in his History of Prices, that a
deficiency of one sixth in the English harvest resulted in a rise of at
least 100 per cent in the price of grain ; and another estimate by Dave-
nant and King, for the close of the seventeenth century, corroborates
this apparently excessive statement. The estimate of these latter
authorities was as follows :
For a deficit There will be a
equal to rise in price of
1-10..... 3-10
2-10 8-10
3-10.. 16-10
4-10 28-10

As late as 1817, the difference in France between the highest and
the lowest prices of grain in different parts of the country was 45 francs
per hectolitre. In 1847 the average difference was 26 francs. Since
1870 the greatest difference at any time has not been in excess of 3*55
francs. The following table, given on German authority, and repre-
senting the price (in silver gulden per hectolitre) of grain for various
periods, exhibits a like progress of price equalization between nations :

For grain henceforth, therefore, the railroad and the steamship
have decided that there shall be but one market the world ; and that
the margin for speculation in this commodity, so essential to the well-
being of humanity, shall be restricted to very narrow limits.
The worlds total product of pig-iron increased slowly and regu-
larly from 1870 to 1879, at the rate of about 2| per cent per annum ;
but after 1879 production increased enormously, until in 1883 the
advance among all nations reached 182*2 per cent on the make of
1870 ; that of the United Kingdom being 143*0, and of other countries
239*1 per cent. {Testimony of Sir Lothian Bell, British Commis-
sion, 1886.) Such an increase, justified perhaps at the moment, was
far in excess of the ratio of increase in the worlds population, and
for a term of years greatly disproportionate to any increase in the
worlds consumption, and finally resulted, as has been before shown
(see previous paper), in an extreme depression in the business, and a
remarkable fall of prices. One experience from this condition of
affairs in the United States is worthy of being placed on record : For
