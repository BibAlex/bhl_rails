a long time the effect of prevailing high prices for pig-iron, coupled
with the influence of high protective duties imposed on the imports of
foreign iron, was to maintain a large number of inferior furnaces in
operation ; but after 1882 83 the most intelligent American iron-pro-
ducers were compelled, as it were, to meet the stagnation and absence
of profit in their business by effecting improvements in the quality of
their furnaces, and undoubtedly also in their management ; and with
such effect that the average weekly capacity of the anthracite fur-
naces of the United States has been increased since 1883 from 220 to
2G4 tons, and of bituminous from 346 tons to 507, or to the extent
of 46 per cent.
In the department of textile manufactures, investigation shows
that, owing to the greater effectiveness of cotton-machinery, the manu-
facture of cotton-goods during recent years has also increased in a
greater ratio than the increase of population ; and that this increase
has been going on at the rate of doubling the production in about
twenty years. In the United States the doubling period of population
is now about thirty-three years ; in Europe, about seventy-five years ;
and, while in Oriental countries the doubling period is not definitely
known, it is unquestionably longer than that of the United States. It
would, therefore, seem certain that not only is the present product of
manufactured cottons in excess of the worlds present exchanging
capacity, but also that, without a decrease in machinery product, the
worlds population must speedily increase their annual per capita con-
sumption, if this state of things is not to continue. The report of the
factory inspectors of the textile industries of Great Britain, for 1885,
shows the following curious changes, consequent on improvements in
machinery, to have taken place in the cotton-manufacture of Great
Britain since 1874 : A decrease of twenty in the whole number of cotton
factories ; a small increase in (throwing) spindles of 2,604,679, or 0*7 of
1 per cent (a result doubtless owing to the great improvement in the
producing capacity of the spindle) ; an increase of 6*1 per cent in the
number of persons employed ; and an increase in the number of looms
of 97,000, or 21 per cent. Taking all the textile industries of Great
Britain into consideration, the number of hands employed in 1884, as
compared with 1874, has not decreased, although the increase, 2*8 per
cent, has been small in proportion to the increase in production. The
number of children employed in 1884 was 34,000 less than 1874, while
the number of male and female adults employed increased about 65,000 ;
a change that implies an improvement in the social condition of the
country, as well as an increased production.
The displacement of muscular labor in some of the cotton-mills of
the United States, within the last ten years, by improved machinery
has been from 33 to 50 per cent ; and the average work of one opera-
tive working one year, in the best mills of the United States, will now,
according to Mr. Atkinson, supply the annual wants of 1,600 fully
