THE ECONOMIC DISTURBANCES SINCE 1873. 591
$1,019,106,616 to $1,885,861,676, so that in that decade there was an
increase of 17,408 establishments, to an increase of only $866,755,060
in the value of products. In 1870 there were 252,148 firms and cor-
porations so employed, producing $4,232,325,442 in manufactured
products ; or an increase of 111,715 establishments in the decade from
1860 to 1870, gave an increase of $2,346,461, in the value of products.
In 1880, the number of manufacturing establishments was returned at
253,852, producing articles valued at $5,365,579,191, or an addition of
only 1,704 firms and corporations was accompanied with an increase of
product of $1,133,537,749. Here, then, is a demonstration that the
average product of a manufacturing establishment in the United States
in 1880 was just sixty per cent greater than it was in 1860.
The following are other illustrations pertinent to this subject :
It is a characteristic and noteworthy feature of banking in Ger-
many, says the London Statist, that the bulk of the business is
gradually shifting from the small bankers, who used to do a thriving
business, to the great banking companies, leaving quite a number of
small customers almost without any chance to prosper in legitimate
operations concentration of capital and business in the hands of a
limited number of powerful customers being the rule of the day.
The tendency to discontinue the building and use of small vessels
for ocean transportation, and the inability of such vessels to compete
with vessels of larger tonnage, is shown by the statement that while a
steamer of from 200 or 300 tons requires one sailor for every 19*8 tons,
a steamer of from 800 to 1,000 tons requires but one sailor for every
41*5 tons. In like manner, while a sailing-vessel of from 200 to 300
tons requires one sailor for every 289 tons, a sailing-vessel of five
times the size, or from 1,000 to 1,600 tons, requires but one sailor for
every 60*3 tons. And as it is also claimed that other economies in the
construction of the hull or the rigging, and in repairing, are concurrent
with the reduction of crews, it is not difficult to understand why it is,
that large vessels are enabled to earn a percentage of profit with rates
of freight which, in the case of small vessels, would inevitably entail
losses.
It was a matter of congratulation after the conclusion of the Ameri-
can war in 1865, that the large plantation system of cotton-raising
would be broken up, and a system of smaller crops, by small and inde-
pendent farmers or yeomanry, would take its place. Experience has
not, however, verified this expectation ; but, on the contrary, has shown
that it is doubtful whether any profit can accrue to a cultivator of cot-
ton whose annual crop is less than fifty bales. Cotton (at the South)
is made an exclusive crop, because it can be sold for cash for an actual
and certain price in gold. It is a mere trifle to get eight or nine cents
for a pound of cotton, but for a bale of 450 pounds it is $40. The
bale of cotton is therefore a reward which the anxious farmer works
for during an entire year, and for which he will spend half as much in
