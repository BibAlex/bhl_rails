financial, industrial, and commercial depression that had never been
equaled.
In the United States the phenomena antecedent to the crisis were
enumerated at the time to be, a rise of prices, great prosperity, large
profits, high wages and strikes for higher ; large importations, a rail-
way mania, expanded credit, over-trading, over-building, and high liv-
ing. The crisis began on the 17th of September, 1873, by the failure
of a comparatively unimportant railway company the New York and
Oswego Midland. On the 18th, the banking-house of Jay Cooke
Co. failed. On the 19th, nineteen other banking-houses failed. Then
followed a succession of bankruptcies, until in four years the mercan-
tile failures had aggregated 1775,865,000 ; and on January 1, 1875,
the amount of American railway bonds in default amounted to $789,-
367,655.
The period of economic disturbance which thus began in Germany
and the United States soon extended to France and Belgium ; and
thereafter, but with varying degrees of severity, to Great Britain (i. e.,
in the latter months of the succeeding year), to the other states of
Europe, and ultimately to the commercial portions of almost every
country. The testimony before the British Parliamentary Commission
(1885-86), however, shows that the depression in Great Britain was
not at once universal ; but that, on the contrary, production, employ-
ment, and profits, at such great manufacturing centers as Birmingham
and Huddersfield, were above the average until 1875.
By many writers on this subject, the depression and disturbance
of industry, which commenced in 1873, are regarded as having termi-
nated in 1878-79 ; but all are agreed that they recommenced, with
somewhat modified conditions, and even with increased severity, in
1882-83. A full consideration of the larger evidence which is now
(1887) available would, however, seem to lead to the conclusion
that there really was no termination of the abnormal course of events,
the marked and definite commencement of which is assigned to 1873,
but that what has been regarded as a termination was only an in-
terruption, occasioned by extraordinary causes, varying locally, and by
no means universal. Thus, a failure during the years 1879, 1880, and
1881, of the cereal crops of Europe and most other countries of the
world, with the exception of the United States a failure for which,
in respect to duration and extent, there had been no parallel in four
centuries occasioned a remarkable demand on the latter country
for all the food-products it could supply at extraordinary prices the
exportations of wheat rising from 40,000,000 bushels in 1877 to 122,-
000,000 in 1879, 153,000,000 in 1880, and 150,000,000 in 1881 ; while
the corresponding values of the amount exported rose from $47,000,-
000 in 1877 to 8130,000,000 in 1879, $190,000,000 in 1880, and
8167,000,000 in 1881. There was also a corresponding increase in the
quantity and value of the American exports of other cereals, and also of
