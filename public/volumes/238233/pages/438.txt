views and to be sold at cost. Its princi-

Journal of the Elisha Mitchell Scien-
tific Society. 1885-86. E. P. Vena-
ble, Chapel Hill, N. C, Secretary. Pp.
146, with Map. Price, 60 cents.
The report covers the third year of the
work of the society, which is also mentioned
as the most prosperous year it has enjoyed.
Regular monthly meetings of members and
invited guests have been held for hearing
papers and discussing scientific questions
of interest. The feature of public lectures
has developed into the University (of North
Carolina) Lecture course, continuing through
the session. Sixty-one papers were read
and presented at the meetings of the socie-
ty, about one third in number of which are
given in the present number of the Jour-
nal. Of these papers two are of very gen-
eral interest, viz. : The Sketch of the Life
and Scientific Work (in botany) of Lewis
David Schweinitz, which is accompanied
by a portrait ; and Messrs. Wood and Mc-
Carthys Wilmington (N. C.) Flora, in-
cluding a list of the plants and date of flow-
ering, and accompanied by a map of Hano-
ver County. A beetle that infests tobaecfc
and cigarettes is described by Mr. G. F.
Atkinson.
Economic Equities. A Compend of the
Natural Laws of Industrial Produc-
tion and Exchange. By J. K. Ingalls.
New York : The Truth-Seeker Company.
Pp. 63. Price, 25 cents.
The author is of opinion that a proper
solution of the questions he has in view
can not be reached while deferring to the
traditions and institutions of barbarous
ages, or to the prejudices and sordid max-
ims of the very rich and powerful ; or by
looking at them from the point of view of
employers or of wage-workers as a class.
He has sought, impartially, to ascertain the
true nature of the relation of earth and
man to social industry and reciprocal ex-
change. The result of his search is an ob-
vious inclination toward the theories of the
kind upheld by Henry George.
Elements of English. By George Hodg-
don Kicker. Chicago : The Interstate
Publishing Company. Pp. IOC. Price,
30 cents.
This book is intended to be an intro-
duction to English grammar for the use of
schools. It aims to make the branch less
difficult, more attractive, and more useful
to young pupils. It is designed for the
lower grades of schools, and to be prepara-
tory to larger works. It consists of a series
of lessons, treating of the parts of speech
and their uses, and of the simple sentence
in its various forms, which are illustrated
by practical exercises composed of words
in common use. It also contains lessons
on spelling, capital letters, punctuation, di-
rections for letter-writing, the principles of
analysis and synthesis ; and brief methods
of parsing.
