ASTRONOMY WITH AN OPERA-GLASS. 491
ion entertained by some selenographers, and apparently justified by
observation. The enormous changes of temperature, from burning
heat under a cloudless sun to the freezing cold of space at night with
no atmospheric blanket to retain heat (which has generally been as-
sumed to be the condition of things on the moon), would be expected
to exert a disintegrating effect upon the lunar rocks. But the question
is now in dispute whether the surface of the moon ever rises above the
freezing-point of water, even under a midday sun.
The Sun. That spots upon the sun may be seen with no greater
optical aid than that of an opera-glass is perhaps well known to many
of my readers, for during the past half dozen years public attention
has been drawn to sun-spots in an especial manner, on account of their
supposed connection with meteorology, and in that time there have
been many spots upon the solar disk which could not only be seen with
an opera-glass, but even with the unassisted eye. At present we are
approaching a minimum period of sun-spots, and the number to be
seen even with a telescope is comparatively very small, yet only a few
days before this page was written there was a spot on the sun large
enough to be conspicuous with the aid of a field-glass. During the
time of a spot-maximum the sun is occasionally a wonderful object, no
matter how small the power of the instrument used in viewing it may

be. Strings of spots of every variety of shape sometimes extend com-
pletely across the disk. Our fourth illustration shows the appearance
of the sun, as drawn by the author on the 1st of September, 1883.
Every one of the spots and spot-groups there represented could be seen
with a good field-glass, and nearly all of them with an opera-glass.
