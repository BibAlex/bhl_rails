EARTHQ UAKES. 3 59
his brain is smaller than when he was a boy between seven and four-
teen, the age when he thought he knew the most.
Dr. Paul Broca gave the following table of average brain-weights :
From 1 to 10 years, 985 IB grammes (34 - 7 oz.).
From 11 to 20 years, 1,465-27 (51-68 oz.).
From 21 to 30 years, 1,341-53 (4767 oz.).
From 31 to 40 years, 1,410-36 (49-74 oz.).
From 41 to 50 years, 1,391-41 (4907 oz.).
From 51 to 60 years, 1,341-19 (4730 oz.).
61 and upward, 1,326-21 (4677 oz.).
By looking over Dr. Boyds table it will be seen that heavy brains
generally belong to tall men ; and so, by our table of individuals, it
appears that the heaviest is that of Turgeneff, who was a man of large
size, while the lighter brains accompanied men of medium or short
stature. Women are generally shorter than men, and their brains
relatively smaller. Quatrefages says : We have known for several
years that the stature has an influence upon the weight of the brain.
It can not be without influence upon the cavity by which the latter is
inclosed. Under similar circumstances in other respects, the weight
of the brain varies proportionately, or almost proportionately, to the
height.
If we accept the above statement that the largest healthy brains
are found in the tallest persons, and add to it the phrenological rule
that brain-size is a true measure of mental power, it will follow that
giants have the greatest minds in the world, which is contradicted by
every days experience. Dr. Ireland, in his work on idiocy and imbe-
cility, mentions two cretins, each six feet high ; several idiot Calibans,
six feet six inches ; several idiots described by Lomboso, one of whom
was eight and a half feet, another seven feet eight inches, with a sister
the same height. Large stature may be a general indication of large
brain-weight, but the latter can not be taken as a safe index of high
intellectual power.
EARTHQUAKES.
By Professor G. H. DARWIN, F. R. S.
THE earthquake-shocks which have recently occurred in America
and Greece, and the great volcanic eruption in New Zealand,
have served to keep the subject vividly before us during many months
past, and have perhaps created in some alarmist minds an ungrounded
expectation that the earth is about to enter on a new period of Plu-
tonic activity. It is natural, then, to ask at the present time what is an
earthquake, and what are its causes. Notwithstanding the necessary
incompleteness in the answers which can be given to these questions,
yet a good deal more is known than appears to be the common prop-
erty of newspaper writers. The object, then, of the present article is
