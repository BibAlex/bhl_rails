shall nourish the highest intellectual pursuits, unhindered by physical
ills and unhampered by ignorant prejudice ; a city, in short, in which the
bodies of the inhabitants shall have become living temples of truth !
There will be no night in that city, since Truth is itself the eternal
source of light, and her torch is never inverted.

MEXICAN ANTIQUITIES.
By KANDOLPII I. GEAEE.
IN the southeast range of the National Museum at Washington is a
collection of casts of Mexican statues, historical stones, and other
figures of American antiquities, an examination of which alone is well
worthy of a visit to the Museum. This collection was installed for
exhibition by its owner, Senor Eufemio Abadiano, and was brought to
Washington from New Orleans, where it had been on view at the Ex-
position in 1885. These casts are reproductions of precious specimens
in the possession of the Nation-
al Museum of Mexico, and of
monuments of immense value
from various parts of that re-
public. Our attention was first
called to the Aztec Calendar
Stone, which, according to
Gama, is a calendar for that
part of the year between the
spring and autumnal equinox,
showing the movements of the
sun and the times at which
should be celebrated the prin-
cipal feasts of the nation. In
the center are four rectangles
which form a figure constitu-
ting the sign of NahiXi Ollin,
and represents the four move-
ments of the sun. The figures
in the circle outside of these
rectangles represent the twenty
days into which the month was
divided. The divisions of the
day are shown by eight large
angles. The stone served as a sun-dial, by means of which the times
for ceremonies and sacrifices were ascertained daily. The original
monument is believed to weigh twenty -one tons. Close by is the
cast of the statue Teoyoamiqid, or Goddess of Death, about eight
Tkotoamiqiti, or Goddess of Death.
