THE ECONOMIC DISTURBANCES SINCE 187S. 783
when it was 14,048,000 tons. After 1879 an extraordinary change
became apparent in the volume of the make, for during the ensuing
five years the average make was 18,000,000 tons, and in 1883 it rose
to 21,063,000, or nearly 50 per cent more than it was in 1879. The
witness further estimated that while the product of iron increased in
the United Kingdom at the rate of 131 per cent from 1870 to 1884,
the increase in the production of the rest of the world during the same
period had been 237 per cent.
The tables of the American Iron and Steel Association, prepared
by Mr. James M. Swank, indicate an increase in the pig-iron product
of the world, from 1870 to 188G inclusive, of about 100 per cent. All
authorities are therefore substantially agreed that the increase in the
production of this commodity in recent years has been not only far in
excess of the increase of the worlds population in general, but also of
the increase of the population of the principal iron-producing countries.
Thus, for example, in the United States, the production increased from
4,044,526 gross tons in 1885 to 5,683,329 in 1886, an increase of 1,638,-
803 tons, or 40 per cent.
Under such circumstances, the price of pig-iron throughout the
world has rapidly declined, and in the case of some varieties touched
in 1885-86 the lowest points in the history of the trade. American
pig, which sold in February, 1880, for $45 per ton, declined almost
continuously until September, 1885, when the low point of $16f was
reached ; while in Great Britain, Cleveland pig, which sold for 4
17s. Id. in 1872, and 2 5*. in 1880, declined to 1 10s. 9d. in 1886.
The decline in Bessemer steel rails in the English market was from
12 Is. Id. in 1874 to less than 4 in 1887. In the United States,
Bessemer steel rails, which commanded $58 per ton at the mills in
1880, fell to $28.25 at the close of the year 1884, reacting to $39 in
March, 1887.
Reviewing, specifically, the causes which have contributed to the
above-noted extraordinary decline in the prices of iron, the following
points are worthy of notice :
First. The testimony of Sir Lowthian Bell shows that foreign coun-
tries have within recent years, and contrary to former experience, in-
creased their production of iron in a far greater ratio than Great
Britain, which was formerly the chief factor in the worlds supply ;
and, in consequence, have become formidable competitors with Great
Britain, not only in their own territories, but also in neutral markets.
New fields of iron-ore have been discovered in Germany, France, and
Belgium, very analogous in point of character to those which by dis-
covery and development, about the year 1850, in the north of England,
led to the subsequent great and rapid increase of British iron pro-
duction.
Second. The power of producing iron with a given amount of labor
and capital has, in recent years, greatly increased. For example, the
