662 THE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY.
as linking together science and art. He accordingly had great pleas-
ure in submitting for acceptance Literature and Art, coupling with
it the name of Lord Lytton, who was not only a distinguished repre-
sentative of modern literature, but had also a distinct hereditary claim
to represent that of the last generation ; and Sir Frederick Leighton,
the distinguished President of the Royal Academy.
The Earl of Lytton. In returning thanks for Literature upon
an occasion when we are all met to honor science in the person of one
of its most illustrious adepts, I can not but forcibly remember that we
are living in an age when inquiry is more active and more wide-spread
than conviction, and it is natural that in minds of the highest order
under these conditions even the imaginative faculty should be more
powerfully attracted to scientific research than to purely literary produc-
tion. But inquiry, I think, would be very sterile if conviction in some
form or another were not the ultimate fruit of it, and I think that for
a period of really vigorous, creative, imaginative art, we must look
forward, in the course of scientific research, to some such general re-
settlement of ideas upon the basis of a common conviction which is
not now, perhaps, altogether attainable as may enable art, instead of
representing, as it does now, merely the mental attitude of the indi-
vidual poet or the individual painter, once more to become the uni-
versally spontaneous and universally recognized imaginative expres-
sion of ideas and emotions which are common to a whole generation
or a whole community. If that is the case, if science is ultimately to
render this great service to literature and art, surely, in the mean
while, we can not but gratefully appreciate the literary labors of those
men of science who, in our own and in other countries, are promoting,
or have promoted, this result, not only as original discoverers, but also
as popular and powerful interpreters of scientific fact, and who, in this
latter capacity, have already enriched contemporary literature with
writings of rare literary value. If, instead of returning thanks for
literature, I were permitted to return thanks on behalf of literature to
those writers who have powerfully influenced my own generation, not
only by thoughts which stimulate and instruct the intellect, but also
by words which stir and elevate the heart, then assuredly I should ask
leave to mention some distinguished names which occupy in the field
of literature a position only second to the high rank they hold in the
hierarchy of science ; and foremost among those names I should not
hesitate to mention with a special personal gratitude the name of the
illustrious man who is the honored guest of this great assembly to-
night. I can not say it is as a student of science that I myself have
studied the writings of Professor Tyndall, but this I can say, and most
truly, that those writings have been to me, from a very early period
of my life, companions so cherished that I learned to look upon their
writer as a dear personal friend and benefactor long before it was my
