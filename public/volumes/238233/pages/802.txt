Meats. The price of meats, according to the statistics of English
markets, exhibits no material decline, comparing the average prices
of 1867-77 and of 1878-85. But during the vears 1885 and 1886
the decline was very considerable, and extended also to most other
animal products. The percentage of fall in the carcass prices of dif-
ferent kinds and quantities of meat in London, as given by the Lon-
don Economist of November 27, 1885, was, in comparison with the
prices for 1879, as follows : For inferior beef, 43 per cent ; prime beef,
18 per cent ; prime mutton, 13 per cent ; large pork, 22 per cent ;
middling mutton, 27 per cent.
The immediate cause of this decline was undoubtedly the new
sources of supply of live animals and fresh meats that have been
opened up to Europe, and especially to Great Britain, from other than
European countries : the value of the imports into Great Britain from
North America of live animals having increased from $1,085,000 in
1876 to $22,980,000 in 1885 ; of fresh meat from 81,950,000 to $11,-
820,000 ; and of fresh meat from Australia and the River Plate
(transported through refrigeration) from $890,000 in 1882 to $5,850,-
000 in 1885 ; a total increase of from $3,025,000 in 1870 to $40,650,000
in 1885. The ability of the three countries named to increase their
exports of meat during such a brief period to such an enormous ex-
tent, constitutes of itself a demonstration of increased product and of
the diminished price that is the invariable accompaniment of a sur-
plus seeking a market. The decline in the average export price of
salt beef in the United States was from 8*2 cents per pound in 1884 to
6 cents in 1886 (26 per cent) ; of salt pork from 82 cents to 59 cents
him so little that a single good crop or two pays for it outright. Then he puts into it
labor of his own, and of men hired, which he could not otherwise utilize at all, and the
cost of which he can not compute, and thus adds year after year to its value. The farmer
who runs into debt can tell what his land costs him yearly, but they are not the majority.
Host farmers get a living out of the land for themselves and families, to begin with, and
make some improvements besides, and meanwhile are gaining more without any effort,
than by all their labor. For, while the farmer is raising four or five crops, a settled State
or county grows up about him. Towns and cities start from the ground. Railroads and
manufacturing establishmeuts come to enhance the value of his land. In a few years, the
ground that he bought for $1.25 to $5 per acre comes to be worth in market price 10,
20, or $30 per acre. Land settled by men who are yet in their prime averages in value
over $20 per acre for the entire State of Iowa, or $13 for the entire State of Minnesota,
or $10 for the entire States of Kansas and Nebraska. That means for the owners of only
a small farm a yearly saving which not many wage-earners are able to accomplish, and in
all the more successful selections of land the increase in value and the consequent return
for labor are far greater.
Just as long as this occupation of new land and development of new territory are
possible in this country, the most scientific calculation of the cost of growing wheat will
have as much to do with its continued production or with its average price as it has to do
with the height of mountains in the moon. Wheat-growing will continue, and the yield
in this country will greatly exceed the demand, and an enormous surplus will be annually
offered for sale, at prices with which British farmers can not easily compete, where the
cost of growing wheat averages about $40 per acre.
