INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION AND RAILWAY SERVICE. 237
interest in scientific subjects on the part of employes, thus developed,
in turn reacts to the pecuniary advantage of their employers, because
mechanics who have been trained in the scientific principles that un-
derlie their handicrafts are thereby enabled to understand the techni-
cal publications affecting their trades, and to utilize new inventions
and improved methods of work ; while men uneducated in the rudi-
ments of science ignore such sources of knowledge, and, quite natu-
rally, oppose all improvements as innovations calculated to work injury
to the laboring-classes. Cultivate a laboring-mans intelligence to a
point where it recognizes improvements and comprehends their nature ;
his opposition ceases, and he will himself likely invent improved pro-
cesses, which will inure to his employers benefit. Technical educa-
tion has been the means of attracting capital not only to specific locali-
ties, but to countries. Indisputable evidence of this is found in
Switzerland, and notably in Zurich, where for years a technical school
has been conducted at government expense. When, recently, the
Federal Council was disposed to lessen the usual grant for its support,
the manufacturers showed, by undeniable evidence, that this single
institution had in a few years been the means of bringing capital to
the country to the extent of millions of pounds sterling.
The British Royal Commissioners testify that a few years ago the
question of technical education in England would have been a debata-
ble one, but that now no argument is needed to convince English em-
ployers of its importance ; that it has been tried, and has given the
highest satisfaction ; that in nearly all the great industrial centers
schools of science and art, of various grades, together with numerous
art and science classes, are to be found in successful operation, and
that their influence may be traced in the improved productions of the
localities in which they are placed ; in the decreased consumption of
crude material, and in saving of time required for the performance of
labor. Through the agency of technical schools, wherever they have
been established, originality has taken the place of servile imitation ;
decaying industries have been revived, and new ones promoted ; while
they have exerted a most marked influence in developing the intelli-
gence and skill, and consequently in securing the permaneut prosperity
of the industrial classes generally, by enabling them to develop the
sources of wealth peculiar to each country.
A noteworthy example of the collective advantages which technical
education can confer is afforded by Switzerland, a country which is
without navigable rivers, canals, mines, fertility, and the other natural
gifts which are the usual foundation of the prosperity of civilized
states, but where industrial education is highly developed. From it
are yearly exported industrial products exceeding in value all the im-
portations of the cantons, and also more than sufficient to cover the
cost of internal administration.
