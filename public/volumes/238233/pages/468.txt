which has been suggested by M. Laveleye, editor of the Moniteur
des Interets Materiels, at Brussels, that the industrial activity of the
greater part of this century has been devoted to equipping fully the
civilized countries of the world with economic tools, and that the work
of the future, in this same sphere, must be necessarily that of repair
and replacements rather than of new constructions. But a more im-
portant inference from this same idea, and one that fully harmonizes
with and rationally explains the phenomena of the existing situation
is, that the equipment having at last been made ready, the work of
using it for production has in turn begun, and has been prosecuted so
efficiently, that the world has within recent years, and for the first
time, become saturated, as it were, under existing conditions for use
and consumption, with the results of these modern improvements.
Again, although the great natural labor-saving agencies had been
recognized and brought into use many years prior to 1870, their pow-
ers were long kept, as it were, in abeyance ; because it required time
for the instrumentalities or methods by which the worlds work of
production and distribution was carried on to adjust themselves to
new conditions ; and until this was accomplished, an almost infinite
number and variety of inventions which genius had produced for facili-
tating and accelerating industrial evolution were matters of promise,
rather than of consummation. But with the extension of popular edu-
cation and the rapid diffusion of intelligence, all new achievements in
science and art have been brought in recent years so much more rap-
idly within the sphere of the every-day activity of the people as
the noted German inventor, Dr. Werner Siemens, has expressed it
that stages of development, which ages ago required centuries for
their consummation, and which at the beginning of our times required
decades, now complete themselves in years, and not unfrequently pre-
sent themselves at once in a state of completeness.
An influence which has been more potent in recent years than ever
before in stimulating the invention and use of labor-saving machinery,
and one which should not be overlooked in reasoning upon this sub-
ject, has been undoubtedly the increasing frequency of strikes and
industrial revolts on the part of the large proportion of the population
of all civilized countries engaged in the so-called mechanical occupa-
tions, which actions in turn on the part of such classes have been cer-
tainly largely prompted by the changes in the conditions of produc-
tion resulting from prior labor-saving inventions and discoveries. As
the London Engineer has already pointed out (see page 291, article
No. 1), the remedy that at once suggests itself to every employer
of labor on the occasion of such trouble with his employes is to
use a tool wherever it is possible instead of a man. A significant
illustration of the quickness with with employers carry out this sug-
gestion, is afforded by the well-authenticated fact that the strike
among the boot and shoe factories of one county in the State of Mas-
