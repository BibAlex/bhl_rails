made this matter a special study, considers one third as the minimum
average that can be accepted for the period above specified.* Other
authorities are inclined to assign a considerably higher average. The
deductions of Mr. William Fowler, Fellow of University College,
London, are to the effect that the saving of labor since 1850 in the
production of any given article amounts to forty per cent ; f and the
British Royal Commission (minority report, 1886) characterizes the
amount of labor required to accomplish a given amount of production
and trausport at the present time as incomparably less than was
requisite forty years ago, and as being constantly reduced.
But be this as it may, out of such results as are definitely known
and accepted have come tremendous industrial and social disturbances,
the extent and effect of which and more especially of the disturb-
ances which have culminated, as it were, in later years it is not easy
to appreciate without the presentation and consideration of certain
typical and specific examples. To a selection of such examples, out of
a large number that are available, attention is accordingly next in-
vited.
Let us go back, in the first instance, to the year 1869, when an
event occurred which was probably productive of more immediate and
serious economic industrial, commercial, and financial changes than
any other event of this century, a period of extensive war excepted.
That was the opening of the Suez Canal. Before that time, and since
the discovery by Vasco da Gama, in 1498, of the route to India by
the Cape of Good Hope, all the trade of the Western hemisphere
with the Indies and the East toiled slowly and uncertainly around the
Cape, at an expenditure in time of from six to eight months for the
manufacture of machines and machinery, 40 per cent ; in the silk-manufacture, 50 per
cent, and so on.
* In a print-cloth factory in New England, in which the conditions of production
were analyzed by Mr. Atkinson, the product per hand was found by him to have advanced
from 26,531 yards, representing 3,382 hours work in 1871, to 32,391 yards, representing
2,695 hours work in 1884 an increase of 22 per cent in product, and a decrease of 20
per cent in hours of labor. Converted into cloth of their own product, the wages of the
operatives in this same mill would have yielded them 6,205 yards in 1871, as compared
with 9,737 yards in 18S4 an increase of 56j% per cent. During the same period of
years the prices of beef, pork, flour, oats, butter, lard, cheese, and wool in the United
States declined more than 25 per cent.
A like investigation by the same authority of an iron-furnace in Pennsylvania showed
that, comparing the results of the five years from 1860 to 1864 with the five years from
1875 to 1879, the product per hand advanced from 776 tons to 1,219 tons; that the
gross value of the product remained about the same ; that the number of hands was
reduced from 76 to 71 ; and that consumers gained a benefit of reduction in price from
$27.95 per ton to $19.08.
f Wages have greatly increased, but the cost of doing a given amount of work has
greatly decreased, so that five men can now do the work which would have demanded
the labor of eight men in 1850. If this be correct, the saving of labor is 40 per cent
in producing any given article. Appreciation of Gold, William Fowler, Fellow of Uni-
versity College, London, 1886.
