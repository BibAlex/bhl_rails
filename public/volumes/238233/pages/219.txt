the two planets will rapidly part company, Saturn sinking toward the
horizon day by day until it is no longer seen, while Venus, moving
eastwardly, rises higher every evening. About the middle of July,
Venus, having reached her greatest eastern elongation, will turn upon

be a superb phenomenon. Being then in that part of her orbit which
passes between the earth and the sun, her illuminated disk will be in
the form of a crescent. A good field-glass, under favorable circum-
stances, will show this crescent form of Venus, and a most beautiful
sight it is. The crescent will grow larger and narrower in proportion
as Venus approaches nearer to the line joining the earth and the sun,
and, as she approaches that line, of course she will draw closer to the
horizon, until about the end of August, she disappears from the even-
ing sky, to reappear in the east as a morning-star in the autumn.
Jupiter will remain in the neighborhood of Spica in Virgo
throughout the summer. The surface features of this majestic planet
are far beyond the reach of an opera- or field-glass, but some of the
