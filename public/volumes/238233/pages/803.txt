THE ECONOMIC DISTURBANCES SINCE 1873. 781
(27 per cent) ; of bacon and hams from 9*6 cents to 75 cents ; and of
lard from 94 cents to 6*9 cents. In the case of lard-oil an exception-
ally great decline in price in recent years i. e., from an average of 94
cents per gallon (Cincinnati market) in 1881-82 to a minimum of
48*8 cents in 1886, is claimed to be due mainly to the large production
and more general use of vegetable oils cotton-seed oil in the United
States, and palm and cocoanut oils in Europe. The effect of the in-
creased quantity and cheapness of these vegetable oils has been espe-
cially marked in England, France, Italy, and Germany ; and has also
undoubtedly influenced the price of tallow, the decline in which in
English markets, comparing the average prices of 1867-77 with those
of 1886, having been 31 per cent, while in the United States the price
for 1884-85 was the lowest on record.
Cheese. American cheese experienced an extraordinary decline
in price from 12 and 13 cents in 1880 to 8| and 10^ cents in 1885 ; and
as the American contribution of this article of food to the worlds con-
sumption has constituted in recent years a large factor, the worlds
prices generally corresponded with those of the American market.
This decline in the United States was due mainly to increased prod-
uct ; the relative prices of butter and cheese during the years 1880-81
being so much to the advantage of the latter, that large quantities of
milk which had previously gone to the creameries to be made into
butter, found their way into factories to be made into cheese ; and
for the years 1883, 1884, and 1885 the annual receipts at New York
city averaged 25 per cent in excess of the receipts for 1880. Demand
for export at the same time largely fell off, and so assisted in the de-
cline of prices ; the same influences existing in the United States hav-
ing also apparently prevailed to a degree in other cheese-producing
countiies, the amount recognized by the trade as supplied to the great
cheese-consuming countries, Great Britain, the Continent of Europe,
and South America, having increased from 1880 to 1884 to the extent
of 14 per cent.
Fish. The year 1884 in the United States was notable for a pleth-
ora of all kinds of dry and pickled fish on the one hand, and of ex-
treme low prices of such commodities on the other ; mackerel having
touched a lower price in the Boston market than for any year since
1849, while for codfish the price was less than at any time since the
year 1838.
Coffee and Tea. The decline in recent years in the prices of
each of these great staple commodities has been almost as remarkable
as has been the case with sugar, coffee having touched the lowest
prices ever known in commerce in the early months of 1886, the price
of ordinary, or exchange standard No. 5, having been 7 cents per
pound in January of that year in the New York market ; while, accord-
ing to Mr. Giffen, of the British Board of Trade, the decline in the price
of tea, comparing 1882 with 1861, has been greater than that of sugar,
