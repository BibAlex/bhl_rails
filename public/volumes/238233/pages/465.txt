THE ECONOMIC DISTURBANCES SINCE 1873. 447
same year 7,780,000 pounds. To-day, two or three chemical estab-
lishments in Germany and England, employing but few men and a
comparatively small capital, manufacture from coal-tar, at a greatly
reduced price, the same coloring principle ; and the former great
business of growing and preparing madder with the land, labor, and
capital involved is gradually becoming extinct ; the importations into
Great Britain for the year 1885 having declined to 2,472,000 pounds,
and into the United States to 1,458,313 pounds.
The old-time art of making millstones entitled to rank among
the very first of labor-saving inventions at the very dawn of civiliza-
tion is rapidly passing into oblivion, because millstones are no
longer necessary or economical for grinding the cereals. The steel
roller produces more and better flour in the same time at less cost, and as
an inevitable consequence is rapidly taking the place of the millstone
in all countries that know how to use machinery. And, as the art of
skillfully grooving the surface of a hard, flinty rock for its conversion
into a millstone is so laborious, so difficult of accomplishment (four
or five vears of service being required in France from an apprentice
before he is allowed to touch a valuable stone), and to a certain extent
so dangerous from the flying particles of steel and stone, humanity,
apart from all economic considerations, may well rejoice at its desue-
tude.
With the substitution of steamers for sailing-vessels upon the
broad ocean, the former extensive business of sail-making, and the
demand upon factories for heavy cloth as material for sails, experi-
enced a notable depression, which in later years has continued and in-
creased, because commerce along coast-lines also now no longer moves
exclusively by sail, but largely in barges dragged or propelled by
steam. For the four years next previous to 1886, the demand for
sails in the United States is estimated to have decreased to the extent
of about twenty-five per cent, although the carrying-trade of the
country by ocean, coast, and inland waters, has, during the same time,
increased very considerably.
Cotton-seed oil an article a few years ago absolutely unknown in
commerce, and prepared from what was formerly regarded almost in
the light of a waste product, is now manufactured in the United
States, and has come into such extensive use as a substitute for lard,
olive, and other oils, for culinary and manufacturing purposes, that
its present annual production and sale are estimated to be equivalent to
about 70,000,000 pounds of lard ; and has contributed not only to
reduce notably the price and the place of that important hog-product
in the worlds markets, but also to impair the production and depress
the price of almost all other vegetable oils the product of the indus-
tries of other countries,
But in respect to no other one article has change in the conditions
of production and distribution been productive of such momentous
