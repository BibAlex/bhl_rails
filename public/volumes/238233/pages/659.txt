by hand, the cylindrical ones when it is done by machinery. Other
machines for punching corks into shape and for grinding them have
been tried and discarded. M. Moreau, the inventor of the latter ma-

so that every house might send out the image of its chief on its wares ;
but the device has not advanced further than to the stage of a happy
thought. Another machine has been invented in which the knife is a
rotating disk, self -sharpening, and the cork also turns.
After having been shaped, the corks are washed in water containing
oxalic acid or chloride of tin, or are sometimes treated with sulphuric
acid. They thus acquire a characteristic salmon tint, and become vel-
vety and soft to the touch. They are then sorted according to size,
tested for quality, counted by hand or by the aid of special machines,
and packed in sacks containing from fifteen to thirty thousand each.
The quality most sought in a good cork is impermeability to gases
and liquids. The bark may be tested for this quality before making
up, by means of an apparatus invented by M. Salleron, in which it is
subjected to the pressure of a liquid which has already been com-
pressed in a hydraulic machine. A cork of the first quality should
stand a pressure of several atmospheres without absorbing any of the
