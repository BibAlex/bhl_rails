THE ECONOMIC DISTURBANCES SINCE 1873. 451
sachusetts in the year 1885, resulted in the capacity for producing by
the same factories during the succeeding year of a fully equal prod-
uct, with reduction of at least fifteen hundred operatives ; one machine
improvement for effecting an operation called lasting having been
introduced, which is capable of doing the former work of from two
hundred to two hundred and fifty men with a force not exceeding
fifty men.
Another fact confirmatory of the above conclusions, is that all
investigators seem to be agreed that the depression of industry
in recent years has been experienced with the greatest severity in
those countries where machinery has been most largely adopted, and
least, or almost not at all, in those countries and in those occupations
where hand-labor and handdabor products have not been materially
interfered with or supplanted. There is no evidence that the mass of
the people of any country removed from the great lines of the worlds
commerce, as in China, India, Turkey, Mexico, and the states of North-
ern Africa, have experienced any economic disturbance prior to
1883, except from variations in crops, or civil commotions ; and if the
experience of a few of such countries has been different since 1883, the
causes may undoubtedly be referred to the final influence of long-de-
layed extraneous disturbances, as has been the case in Mexico, in re-
spect to the universal depreciation of silver,* and in Japan, from an
apparent culmination of a long series of changes in the civilization and
economy of that country. There have, moreover, been no displace-
ments of labor or reduction in the cost of labor or product in all those
industries in civilized countries, where machinery has not been in-
creased ; as, for example, in domestic service, in such departments of
agriculture as the raising and care of stock, the growing of cotton, of
flax, hemp, and of tropical fibers of like character, or in such mechanical
occupations as masonry, painting, upholstering, plastering, and cigar-
making, or those of engineers, firemen, teamsters, watchmen, and
the like.
Finally, it is of the first importance to note how all the other causes
which have been popularly regarded as having directly occasioned, or
essentially contributed to, the recent depression of trade and industry
with the exception of such as are in the nature of natural phenom-
ena, as bad seasons and harvests, diseases of plants and animals, disap-
pearance of fish, and the like, and such as are due to excessive taxa-
tion, consequent on war expenditures, all of which are local, and the
first temporary in character naturally group themselves about the
one great cause that has been suggested, as sequences or derivatives,
and as secondary rather than primary in their influence ; and to the
facts and deductions that are confirmatory of this conclusion atten-
tion will be next invited.

the early months of 1885 to 38 to *76 in the spring of 1886.
