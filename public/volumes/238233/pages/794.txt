whether a pound sterling or a dollar would have bought more or
less of a given number of bushels, yards, or pounds at one time than
another. In all other respects they are little other than curiosities ;
inasmuch as if some articles in a given period have risen and others
have fallen in price, and if the fall of some and the rise of others can
be undoubtedly traced to the action of entirely different causes, the
grouping of these facts into the form of tables, and the endeavor to
reduce the sum of the respective changes to a common average, can
prove nothing whatever as to the cause or causes which have been
operative in producing the changes. And between such discordant
results effected by entirely diverse influences, there would, further-
more, seem to be no possibility of establishing an average ; for the
price of some articles, whose use has been superseded or impaired by
change of fashion or new inventions, may fall nearly or quite to zero,
while the price of others, by reason of increased demand or inter-
rupted supply, may rise almost to infinity by comparison ; and be-
tween such extremes there may be any number of gradations.
All, therefore, that can be confidently affirmed in respect to the ex-
tent of the recent depression of prices is, that comparing the data for
1885-86 with those of 1866-76, the decline has been extraordinary
and has affected most articles and most countries ; and that the esti-
mate of Mr. Sauerbeck (before referred to), of 30 per cent as the
average measure or extent of the decline, is not excessive.
It seems almost unnecessary to remark, that a fall of prices, al-
though commonly so considered, can not, in any comprehensive dis-
cussion, be regarded as in any sense a primary cause of economic dis-
turbances ; but that here again something antecedent in the nature of
a cause or causes, more or less general, must be sought for in explana-
tion. And of such causes, two only that are worthy of attention have
been suggested : First, a great multiplication and cheapening of com-
modities through new conditions of production and distribution, which
in turn have been mainly due to the progress of invention and dis-
covery ; and, second, that the precious metal used for standard money,
viz., gold, has, through relative scarcity, owing to diminished produc-
tion and increased demand, greatly appreciated in value; in consequence
of which a given amount of gold buys more than formerly ; or, what is
the same thing, the price or purchasing power of commodities, in com-
parison with gold, has fallen.
As to which of these two causes has been most influential in occa-
sioning the recent great decline in prices, the best authorities who have
investigated the subject, as is well known, widely differ. It is also
well recognized that the determination of this question is almost funda-
mental in the so-called bimetallic controversy ; the plea for an in-
creased use of silver as money being wholly predicated on an alleged
insufficiency in the supply of gold for effecting the worlds exchanges,
while ample evidence of the scarcity of gold is claimed to be found in
