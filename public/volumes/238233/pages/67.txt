ORIGIN OF COMETS AND METEORS. 57
some way of representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to
the diameter as a fraction of some sort. The fact remains that this
has been proved to be impossible ; and it has equally been shown to
be impossible that any flight of meteors could be captured (that is,
brought into the solar domain for good) as such, by any planet, even
by the giant Jupiter. Either the meteors must lie so very close to-
gether that their mutual attractions would make them practically one
body, and keep them such after capture by the planet, which is not
the case with any of the meteor-streams, or else the differences of per-
turbing action on the meteors would be so great that the flight must
be entirely dispersed in the act of capture not merely dispersed so as
to form a stream or a larger flight, but so dispersed as no longer to
form a meteor system at all.
But, extending our generalized theory to the case of the giant
planets as, be it observed, we are not only entitled but bound to do
we see that as there would be flights of meteors passing always near
the earths orbit because of their original derivation from the earth in
her sun-like stage, so would there be flights of meteors passing always
near the orbit of each one of the giant planets ; unless, indeed, in the
fullness of the vast periods of time which must have elapsed since
their formation, processes such as seem to affect Enckes comet should
have altered their orbits considerably. Even then they would exhibit
an approach to the orbits of their parent planets such as to suggest
the idea of some sort of physical association. And accordingly, we
find this peculiarity so far manifested, that years before the idea ever
occurred to me that any comets or meteor systems could have been
expelled from the giant planets, I wrote an essay on what I called the
Comet Families of the Giant Planets, describing just such comets,
though I was unable to find any interpretation at that time of the
peculiarity in question.
It is worthy of notice that quite a number of difficulties, some of
them very serious ones, disappear, even as these last two have done,
so soon as we adopt this generalization of the special theory to which
we found ourselves forced first by direct evidence.
For example, if the capture theory advanced by Schiaparelli were
accepted, not only would it leave all our perplexities unexplained, not
only would it involve our running directly against mathematical cer-
tainties, but it would introduce this tremendous difficulty : the num-
ber of meteor-flights traveling about in interstellar space must exceed
many millions of times those which visit our solar system, and the
number of such flights visiting our solar system must exceed millions
of millions of times those which chanced, by a strange combination of
accidents, to come within capturing distance of a planet. Again, if
many of the meteor systems which cross our earths orbit are not to
be attributed to a terrestrial origin, then the number of meteor systems
within the solar domain must exceed millions of millions of millions
