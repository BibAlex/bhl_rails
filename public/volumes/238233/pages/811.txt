per man per annum. For Germany, the increase was from 261 tons
in 1881 to 269 tons in 1883 ; and in Belgium, for corresponding years,
from 165 tons to 178 tons per miner.
Recent inventions have also done much to reduce the amount of
coal formerly used to effect industrial results, particularly in the case
of blast-furnaces and coke-ovens. For example, at blast-furnaces, coal
was formerly used for heating the boilers that furnished steam for
blowing, hoisting, etc., and for heating the air which was blown into
the stacks. Now, a well-ordered set of blast-furnaces does not use a
single ounce of coal except what goes in to melt the ore. The whole
of the heat used to produce the steam required in connection with the
furnace, and for heating the stoves for making the hot blast, is ob-
tained from the gases which rise to the top of the stacks in the pro-
cess of smelting the iron, and which formerly was all thrown away.*
Petroleum. Crude petroleum declined in the American market
from an average of $3.86 (gold) per barrel in 1870 to 87 cents per
barrel in 1885, and 71 cents in 1886, a total decline of over 80 per cent.
The American annual production (including Canada) increased
during the same period from 5,510,745 barrels in 1870 to 30,626,100
in 1882, declining to 25,798,000 in 1886.
That the production and price experiences of the great staple
fibers of commerce and consumption in recent years have not been dis-
similar to those of the foods and metals, will also appear from the fol-
lowing :
Cotton - . Comparing 1860 with 1885, the decline in the price of
American cotton (middling uplands) in the New York market has not
been material. The year 1886, however, witnessed a decline to a lower
point (8^-f) than has been reached, with one exception, since the year
1855 ; the exception occurring just after the failure of the Glasgow
Bank in Scotland in 1878, the lowest quotations in both years being
exactly the same. On the other hand, the increase in the worlds sup-
ply of cotton in recent years has been very considerable, the American
crop increasing from 3,930,000 bales in 1872-73 to 6,575,000 in
1885-86, or 67 per cent ; while the supply of the world for the cor-
responding period is estimated to have increased from 6,524,000 bales
to 8,678,000 bales, or at the rate of about 32 per cent. Such an in-
crease in production would undoubtedly have occasioned a more
marked decline in price, had it not been for a great and coincident in-
crease in the worlds consumption of cotton fabrics ; which, in turn,
was undoubtedly in consequence of a material decline in the cost of
the same, as the result of improvements in machinery and methods of
production ; the equivalent of the labor of an operative in the facto-
ries of New England having increased from 12,164 yards in 1850 to
19,293 in 1870, and 28,032 in 1884, while the reduction in the price of
