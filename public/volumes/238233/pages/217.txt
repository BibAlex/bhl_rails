distinctness by the stars Alpha (a), Epsilon (c), Gamma (y), Delta (8),
and Beta (/?), together with some fainter stars lying along the main
beam of the cross between /? and y. The star /?, also called Albireo,
is one of the most beautiful double stars in the heavens. The compo-
nents are sharply contrasted in color, the larger star being golden-

About half way from Albireo to the two stars and e in Aquila, is
a very curious little group consisting of six or seven stars in a straight
row, with a garland of other stars hanging from the center. To see it
best, take a field-glass, although an opera-glass shows it.
I have indicated the place of the celebrated star 61 Cygni in the
map, because of the interest attaching to it as the nearest to us, so far
as we know, of all the stars in the northern hemisphere, and with one
exception the nearest star in all the heavens. Yet it is very faint, and
