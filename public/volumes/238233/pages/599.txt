of human nature under the new conditions. The machinery which thus
cheapens and increases product is, as a rule, most costly, and entails
a like burden of interest, insurance, and care, whether it is at work
or idle ; and the possessor of it, recognizing this fact, naturally desires
to convert outlay into income by utilizing it to the greatest extent
possible. Again, a man who has learned by experience that he can
dispose of a certain amount of product or service at a profit, naturally
reasons that a larger amount will give him, if not a proportionally
greater, at least a larger aggregate profit ; and as the conditions de-
termining demand are not only imperfectly known, but to a certain
extent incapable of exact determination, he discards the idea of any
risk, even if he for a moment entertains it, and pushes industrial
effort to its maximum. And as this process is general, and, as a rule,
involves a steady increase in the improved and constantly improving
instrumentalities of production and distribution, the period at length
arrives when the industrial and commercial world awakens to the
fact that there is a product disproportionate to any current remunera-
tive demand. In this way only is it possible to account for the cir-
cumstance that the supply of the great articles and instrumentalities
of the worlds use and commerce has increased, during the last ten
or fifteen years, in a far greater ratio than the contemporaneous in-
crease in the worlds population, or of its immediate consuming ca-
pacity. But although such is substantially a correct general exposi-
tion of the recent course of industrial events, and although all the
agencies concerned in reducing the time and labor necessary to effect
a given result in the worlds work have undoubtedly acted to a cer-
tain extent and in all cases in unison, the diversity of method, under
which the supply in excess of remunerative demand, or the so-called
over-production has been specially effected, is not a little curious.
Thus, in the case of crude iron and steel, cotton fabrics and textiles
generally, coal, most articles of metal fabrication, ships, and the like,
the increase and cheapened supply have been brought about mainly
through improvements in the machinery and economy of production ;
while in the case of wheat, rice, and other cereals, wool, cotton-fibers,
meats, and petroleum, like results have been mainly occasioned by im-
provements in the machinery and economy of distribution. On the
other hand, in the case of copper, tin, nickel, silver, quicksilver, qui-
nine, and some important chemicals, over-production, in the sense as
above defined, has been almost entirely due to the discovery of new
and abundant natural sources of supply. It is also not to be over-
looked that other factors, which can not properly be included within
the sphere of the influence of recent discoveries and inventions, have
also powerfully contributed to bring about the so-called phenomenon
of over-production. The increase in the consumption of some com-
modities is entirely dependent upon the increase in the tastes and in-
telligence of the masses ; and it is undeniable that the culture of the
