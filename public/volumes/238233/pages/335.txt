VARIATIONS IN HUMAN STATURE.

that results from it that the Anglo-Saxon and Germanic races, and the
northern and eastern French, owe their size and strength. As the
climate grows warm, and the summer heat becomes excessive, nutri-
tion becomes less active and the mean stature of the population de-
creases: Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece are examples of this. The
influence of climate upon stature is therefore a question of faculty of
assimilation and of the quantity of available food. For this last rea-
son, the fertility of the soil has a considerable influence upon the size
of the population. A well-cultivated country, furnishing abundance
of food and cattle, permits its population to acquire a much greater size,
strength, and robustness than would be possible to a population living
on infertile lands insufficiently supporting its inhabitants. By the
same influences members of families in easy circumstances, and stand-
ing in the position of old proprietors, are usually heartier than poorer
families ; the inhabitants of towns than those of the surrounding rural
districts.

Famines and frequent or prolonged dearths have the effect of re-
ducing the size of the peoples who are exposed to them. Wars induce
the same result, and this not only by the operation of the material
disasters and miseries which they occasion, but also through the loss
of a large number of the most vigorous and robust men of the nation,
