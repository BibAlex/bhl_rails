has shown that, under a good organization of clerks, shopmen, porters,
and distributors, it costs much less proportionally to sell a large
amount of goods than a small amount, and that the buyer of large
quantities can, without sacrifice of satisfactory profit, afford to offer
to his retail customers such advantages in respect to prices and range
of selection, as almost to preclude competition on the part of dealers
operating on a smaller scale, no matter how otherwise capable, honest,
and diligent they may be. The various retail trades, in the cities and
larger towns of all civilized countries, are accordingly being rapidly
superseded by vast and skillfully organized establishments and in
Great Britain and Europe by co-operative associations which can
sell at little over wholesale prices a great variety of merchandise
dry-goods, manufactures of leather, books, stationery, furs, ready-
made clothing, hats and caps, and sometimes groceries and hardware
and at the same time give their customers far greater conveniences
than can be offered by the ordinary shopkeeper or tradesman. In
London, the extension of the tramway or street-railroad system is
even advocated, on the single ground that the big stores need quicker
access to their branch establishments, in order to still further promote
the economy of goods distribution.
The spirit of progress conjoined with capital, and having in view
economy in distribution and the equalization of values, is therefore
controlling and concentrating the business of retailing, in the same
manner as the business of wholesale distribution and transporta-
tion, and of production by machinery, is being controlled and con-
centrated, and all to an extent never before known in the worlds
experience.
Keeping economy in distribution constantly in view as an essen-
tial for material progress, the tendency is also everywhere to dispense
to the greatest extent with the middle-man, and put the locomo-
tive and the telegraph in his place. Retail grocers, as before shown,
now buy their teas directly of the Chinaman, and dispense with the
services of the East Indian merchant and his warehouses. Manufact-
urers deal more directly with retailers, with the result, it is claimed,
of steadying supply and demand, and preventing the recurrence of
business crises. The English cotton-spinner at Manchester now buys
his raw cotton by cable in the interior towns of the cotton-growing
States of North America, and dispenses with the services of the
American broker or commission-merchant. European manufacturers
now send their agents with samples of merchandise to almost every
locality in America, Asia, and the Pacific islands, where commerce is
protected and transportation practicable, and offer supplies, even in
comparatively small quantities, on better terms than dealers and con-
sumers can obtain from the established wholesale or retail merchants
of their vicinity. And all of these changes have inevitably occasioned,
and for a long time yet will continue to occasion, great disturbances
