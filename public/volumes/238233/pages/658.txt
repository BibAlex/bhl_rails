that its axis, as it is cut from the bark, be parallel with the axis of the
tree on which the bark grew ; but the broad, flat corks have to be cut
perpendicular to the axis of the tree. Only the finest corks are now
made by hand. A good workman can turn out, in the method de-
scribed, about one thousand corks a day.
We give representations of three machines invented by Demuth,
which are so simple in their operation that any one can make corks
upon them at the first trial. The first machine cuts the cork into
strips (Fig. 1) ; the second into squares eight thousand a day with a

woman or a child to work it (Fig. 2). This machine separates the
squares automatically, according to their sizes, and by an ingenious
arrangement the knives are made to sharpen themselves by passing
over a whetstone-rubber at each forward and return motion. With
the third machine, for shaping the corks, five thousand corks may
be finished in a day (Fig. 3). It is so arranged that the square of
cork, firmly fastened between two pointed jaws, turns with them in
front of a knife-blade, which is managed with the hand after the fash-
ion of a plane. This blade is so connected by a chain-gearing with the
jaws holding the cork, that the movements of the two tools are in
harmony with one another. The parts of this machine can be ar-
ranged to cut corks of any size, and of cylindrical or conical shape as
