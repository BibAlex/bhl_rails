VARIATIONS IN HUMAN STATURE.

exaggerated, while we have a right to regaid as authentic giants whose
height runs up to eight and a half feet. A giant eight feet high was
exhibited at Rouen in 1755. A Swedish peasant, cited by Buffon, was
eight feet and eight lines in height, and the stature of the Finnish
giant Cujanus was the same ; while Frederick William, King of Prus-
sia, had a guard of nearly equal stature. The giant, Gille de Trent, in
the Tyrol, and one of the guards of the Duke of Brunswick, were more
than eight feet four inches in height. The Grecian giant, Amanab,
now eighteen years old, is seven feet eight inches tall ; the Chinese
giant, Chang, eight feet three inches. The Austrian giant, Winckel-
meier, who was recently exhibited in Paris, measuring eight and a half
feet, may be regarded as a specimen of the highest stature attained by
the human species. At the opposite extremes may be found numerous
dwarfs not more than twenty inches, and some even as little as sixteen
and even twelve inches in height ; but such dwarfs are only monsters
with atrophied limbs or twisted back-bones, or stunted infants, whose
age is usually exaggerated by their Barnums. One of the most remark-
able dwarfs on record was the celebrated Borulawsky, who was born
in 1789, and died in 1837, who was never more than twenty-eight
inches in height, was perfect in every limb and proportion, and was
bright and intelligent.
The mean between these two extremes of stature is about five feet
five and a half inches, and the difference between them is six feet one
and a half inch. The mean height is nearly the same with the average
stature of Frenchmen. We give an illustration embodying a compara-
tive representation of these extremes, with three intervals between
