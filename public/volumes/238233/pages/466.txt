consequences as in the case of wheat. On the great wheat-fields of
the Territory of Dakota, where machinery is applied to agriculture to
such an extent that the requirement for manual labor has been reduced
to a minimum, the annual product of one mans labor, working to the
best advantage, is understood to be now equivalent to the produc-
tion of 5,500 bushels of wheat. In the great mills of Minnesota, the
labor of another one man for a year, under similar conditions as regards
machinery, is in like manner equivalent to the conversion of this unit
of 5,500 bushels of wheat into a thousand barrels of flour, leaving 500
bushels for seed-purposes ; and although the conditions for analysis of
the next step in the way of results are more difficult, it is reasonably
certain that the years labor of one and a half men more or at the
most two men employed in railroad transportation, is equivalent to
putting this thousand barrels of flour on a dock in New York ready
for exportation ; where the addition of a fraction of a cent a pound
to the price will further transport and deliver it at almost any port of
Europe.*
Here, then, we have the labor of three men for one year, working
with machinery, resulting in producing all the flour that a thousand
other men ordinarily eat in a year, allowing one barrel of flour for
the average consumption of each adult. Before such a result the
question of wages paid in the different branches of flour production
and transportation becomes an insignificant factor in determining a
market ; and, accordingly, American flour grown in Dakota, and
ground in Minneapolis, from a thousand to fifteen hundred miles
from the nearest seaboard, by the labor of men paid from a dol-
lar and a half to two dollars and a half per clay for their labor, is sold
in European markets at rates which are determinative of the prices
which Russian peasants, Egyptian fellahs, and Indian ryots
can obtain in the same markets for similar grain grown by them on
equally good soil, and with from fifteen to twenty cents per day wages
for their labor.
A great number of other similar and equally remarkable experi-
ences, derived from almost every department of industry except the
handicrafts, might be presented ; but it would seem that enough evi-
dence has been offered to prove abundantly that, in the increased con-
* When the wheat reaches New York city, and comes into the possession of a great
baker, who has established the manufacture of bread on a large scale, and who sells the
best of bread to the working-people of New York at the lowest possible price, we find
that one thousand barrels of flour can be converted into bread and sold over the counter
by the work of three persons for one year. Let us add to the six and a half men already
named the work of another man six months, or a half a man one year, to keep the ma-
chinery in repair, and our modern miracle is, that seven men suffice to give one thousand
persons all the bread they customarily consume in one year. If to these we add three for
the work of providing fuel and other materials to the railroad and the bnker, our final
result is that ten men working one year serve bread to one thousand. Distribution of
