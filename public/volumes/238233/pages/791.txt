THE ECONOMIC DISTURBANCES SINCE 1873. 769
puted, is, that no peculiarity of currency, banking, or standard of value,
or form of government, or incidence and degree of taxation, or mili-
tary system, or condition of land tenure, or legislation respecting
trade, tariffs and bounties, or differences in the relations between
capital and labor in different countries, has been sufficient to guard
and save any nation from the economic disturbances or trade depres-
sion which has been incident to such changes in prices.
An analysis of British exports and imports for 1886, with compari-
sons of similar data for the previous year, 1885 (presented by the
London Economist in its issues for January 22 and 29, 1887), fur-
nishes, moreover, some information, almost, if not fully, in the nature
of a demonstration of the continued tendency of prices to decline dur-
ing the latest period for which accurate data are (at present) accessi-
ble, and also of the continued universality of such tendency. Thus,
looking first at exports, it appears that there was an increase during
the year 188G in the quantities of British and colonial commodities ex-
ported of 602 per cent, as compared with similar aggregates for 1885 ;
or Great Britain sent out 106,020 pounds, tons, or other quantities in
1886, in place of 100,000 in 1885. Comparing, however, the sum which
the quantities actually exported in 1886 would have cost at the prices
of 1885, a decline in price is indicated of 6*34 per cent ; or while sending
away 106,020 pounds, tons, or other quantities in 1886, as compared
with 100,000 in 1885, Great Britain received back in money value
only 893,660 for the same quantities w T hich in the previous year
brought $100,000.
A similar examination of British imports for 1886 also brings
out the further interesting fact that the average decline in the prices
of the goods imported was almost precisely the same as in prices of
goods exported. The increase in quantities of imports was less than
one per cent ; or the country brought in 100,796 pounds, tons, or other
quantities, in place of 100,000 in 1885. But the decline in prices was
6373 per cent ; so that the country paid only $93,627 for the same
quantities for which it paid $100,000 in the previous year. The de-
cline in the general range of prices for the year 1886, as measured by
the actual exports and imports of the greatest exporting and importing
nation of the world, would therefore appear to have been in excess of
six per cent ; and this decline would seem to have occurred during the
same period in all those countries in which Great Britain deals as a
seller equally with those in which she deals as a buyer; or, in other
words, this decline was practically universal. *
The question which here naturally suggests itself, as to what in
general has been the extent of the recent fall in prices, is perhaps best
answered from the basis of English figures, by Mr. Augustus Sauer-
beck, who, as the result of an exhaustive inquiry into the price move-
ments of thirty-eight leading articles of raw produce since 1818-27
