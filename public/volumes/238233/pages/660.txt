liquid. The waste in cork-making amounts to about sixty per cent ;
but the chips can all be put to profitable use in making chalk-powders,
linoleum, and feltings.
A large number of other substitutes for stoppers of cork have
been tried. Those which have given the most satisfaction, in particu-
lar cases, are made of ground-glass and India-rubber ; but no other
device has come into a real competition with cork.

Mr. William Anderson, describing some new applications of the
mechanical properties of cork to the arts, insists, as the peculiar
quality which distinguishes it from all other solid or liquid bodies,
upon its power of altering its volume in a very marked degree m con-
sequence of change of pressure. All liquids and solids are capable
of cubical compression or extension, but to a very small extent ; thus
water is reduced in volume by only g^Vo part by the pressure of
an atmosphere. Liquid carbonic acid yields to pressure much more
than any other fluid, but still the rate is very small. Solid sub-
stances, with the exception of cork, offer equally obstinate resistance
to change of bulk, even India-rubber, which most people would sup-
pose capable of very considerable change of volume, being really very
