the advance that has been made in fifty
years in the opportunities for medical in-
struction. When the university was estab-
lished, it was the fourth medical school
founded west of the Alleghanies. Louis-
ville alone now has as many medical schools,
and there are almost as many between the
Ohio River and the Pacific Ocean, a3 the
university is years old.
Contributions to the Anatomy of Geo-
coccyx Calfiornianus. By R. W.
Shdfeldt. Pp. 281, with Four Plates.
Geococcyx is the ground-cuckoo. The
author had already published a paper on
the genus in 1886. The present memoir,
which is based on a specimen obtained in
California, may be considered a second in-
stallment on the subject. While ornitholo-
gists usually place the genera Geococcyx and
Coccyzus in the same sub-family, Cocci/gince,
the authors examination discloses anatomi-
cal characters in his specimen which are
essentially different from the corresponding
ones as found in the true cuckoos. He there-
fore proposes for them two sub-families
the Centropodince, to contain the ground-
cuckoos ; and the Cuculince for the true
cuckoos ; these, with the third sub-family,
Crotophagince, to make up the family Cu-
culkla;, or North American cuckoos.

American Jurassic Mammals. By Pro-
fessor 0. C. JIarsh. Pp. 20, with Four
Plates.
The author, who is in possession of all
the known remains of mammals from the
Jurassic in this country, had already pub-
lished several articles descriptive of them ;
but a large amount of new material has
been secured, including representatives of
several hundred individuals, and bones of
various parts of the skeleton. The fossils,
though fragmentary, are usually well pre-
served ; but, as a rule, no two bones of the
skeleton are found together. This fact, with
the diminutive size of the animals and other
circumstances, makes investigation difficult.
The first specimens discovered in this coun-
try proved to be very near allies of Euro-
pean forms ; later ones resembled others
described by Owen, but, as the skeletons
were more complete, differences appeared.
A few American genera have no known
representatives in Europe, while some forms
found there are unknown hcie.
