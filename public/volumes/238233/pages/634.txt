nite sub-specialization. Starting from him as the original journalist,
we find his work divided in a neighboring city office in a manner
which may be diagrammed thus :
And this is only the beginning. If we
stepped into a metropolitan newspaper
establishment, we should find the work
still much further divided and subdi-
vided. A whole article would be re-
quired to describe it briefly. And the
same would be true of many other in-
dustries once considered such narrow
specialties that, with some reason, they
were believed to have a narrowing effect
on the minds of those who pursued
them.
The advantages thus gained have
been dwelt upon by all economists since
Adam Smith. They correspond quite
closely to those secured by the specializa-
tions which Nature produces all around
us in the different organs and tissues of
plants and animals. A good deal of
tedious hair-splitting would be required
to define all of them, but they may be
roughly divided as follows :
I. Those that appear immediately, as
the ability to form combinations of effort
not otherwise possible, or not without
greater waste of time or greater expense
for tools. The different parts in a play
must be taken by different persons. This
is made necessary by the very nature of
the work. In other cases the same per-
son might attend to many different tasks,
but he would lose time in passing from
one to another ; and he might require a
greater variety of tools.
II. Those that come a little later,
like the acquired skill of the individual
specialist, and perish with him. Stradi-
varius devoted his energies to the speci-
alty of making violins. By doing so he
gave us the best violins ever made. The
fact that they have never since been
equaled shows that his slowly-acquired
skill died with him.
