its exportation the imports of Eastern rice into Italy alone having
increased from 11,957 tons in 1878 to nearly 70,000 tons in 1883.
That the same causes are also exerting a like influence upon the
marketing of the cereal crops of the United States is shown by the
circumstance that the freight rates on the transport of grain from Bom-
bay to England, by way of the Suez Canal, have declined from 325
cents per bushel in 1880, to 16*2 cents in 1885 ; and to the extent of
this decline has the ability of the Indian ryot to compete with the
American grain-grower, in the markets of Europe, been increased.
How great was the disturbance occasioned in the general prices of
the commodities that enter into Eastern commerce by the opening of
the Suez Canal, and how quickly prices respond to the introduction of
improvements in distribution, is illustrated by the following experi-
ence : The value of the total trade of India with foreign countries, ex-
clusive of its coasting-trade, was estimated at the time of the opening
of the canal in 1869, at 105,500,000 ($527,500,000). In 1874, how-
ever, the value was estimated at only 95,500,000, or at a reduction of
ten per cent ; and the inference might naturally have been that such a
large reduction as ten millions sterling ($50,000,000) in five years, with
a concurrent increase in the worlds population, could only indicate a
reduction of quantities. But that such was not the case was shown
by the fact that 250,000 tons more shipping was employed in trans-
porting commodities between India and foreign countries in 1874 than
in 1869 ; or, that while the value of the trade, through a reduction of
prices had notably declined during this period, the quantities entering
into trade had so greatly increased during the same time, that 250,000
tons more shipping (mainly steam, and therefore equivalent to at least
500,000 more tons of sail) were required to convey it.
In short, the construction of the Suez Canal completely revolution-
ized one of the greatest departments of the worlds commerce and
business ; absolutely destroying an immense amount of what had pre-
viously been wealth, and displacing or changing the employment of
millions of capital and thousands of men; or, as the London Econo-
mist has expressed it, so altered and so twisted many of the exist-
ing modes and channels of business as to create mischief and confu-
sion to an extent sufficient to constitute one great general cause for
a universal commercial and industrial depression and disturbance.
The deductions from the most recent tonnage statistics of Great
Britain come properly next in order for consideration. During the ten
years from 1870 to 1880, inclusive, the British mercantile marine in-
creased its movement, in the matter of foreign entries and clearances
alone, to the extent of twenty-two million tons ; or, to put it more
simply, the British mercantile marine exclusively engaged in foreign
trade did so much more work within the period named ; and yet the
number of men who were employed in effecting this great movement
had decreased in 1880, as compared with 1870, to the extent of about
