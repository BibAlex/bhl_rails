it became necessary for him to expose and prosecute the corruption of
Captain Ilowgate ; again, when it became necessary in self-defense
to expose the true reasons of the failure of the War Department to
properly support and succor the Signal-Service Expedition to Fort
Conger ; and, again, when he had occasion to defend the advantages
of the military character of the combined Signal Service and Weather
Bureau organization against those who would take it from the army
without making a proper provision for its work in any other depart-
ment. The records of his successful defense against attacks prompted
by implacable hate, official stubbornness, and personal ignorance are
to be found in the proceedings of Courts-Martial, Courts of In-
quiry, Committee of Congress on Expenditure, and especially in
the Testimony before the Joint Commission to consider the Present
Organization of the Signal Service, etc., which latter voluminous re-
port with testimony was printed in June, 1886.
General Hazens interest in meteorology, as before said, properly
dates back earlier than 1873, at which time he prepared a letter On
our Barren Lands, or the Interior of the United States, west of the
One Hundredth Meridian and east of the Sierra Nevadas. This was
published in the New York Tribune, February 27, 1874, and led to
a discussion in that paper and in the Minneapolis Tribune between
himself and General A. A. Custer, which is summarized in a pamphlet
of the above title published by Robert Clarke Co., of Cincinnati, in
1875. The motive of General Hazen evidently was the protection of
investors and settlers against the too glowing accounts, which amounted
to virtual misrepresentation, on the part of the employes of the North-
ern Pacific Railroad ; his compilation of climatological data, and his
statement of personal experience, based on long residence in that re-
gion, largely contributed to prevent blind emigration into an inhos-
pitable country, while they doubtless also contributed to direct atten-
tion to the really valuable portions of our Northwest territory, so that
the permanent development of that portion of the United States has
been furthered by his action. It was, however, at the time, on his part,
a very characteristic, outspoken exposition of what seemed to him a
fraud and imposition perpetrated by unscrupulous financiers upon for-
eign immigrants and over-confiding settlers and investors.
During his connection with the Signal-Office, General Hazen fre-
quently took occasion to show his appreciation of the fact that the
weather predictions were essentially not a matter of mere military
routine, but that in all departments the office had need of the work of
specially trained experts ; that it was a mistake to shut ones eyes to
the fact that, in a matter of applied science like this, some of those
whom the scientific world recognizes as meteorologists and physicists
must be employed and be required to keep the chief fully informed of
the progress of science. Perhaps this is best exemplified by a quota-
tion from his letter of March 24, 188G, addressed to a Committee of
