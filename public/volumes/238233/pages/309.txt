THE ECONOMIC DISTURBANCES SINCE 1873. 293
most meat products and provisions.* Such a demand at extraordinary-
prices for crops, beyond the average in quantity and quality, brought
temporary prosperity to American producers, and induced great in-
dustrial and commercial activity throughout the United States ; and
although the crops of other countries were notably far below the aver-
age, yet the great advance in prices undoubtedly went far to alleviate
the distress of the foreign agriculturist, even if it did not in some
cases actually better his condition, and increase his purchasing pow-
er of other than food-products. The extent to which the American
producer availed himself of his increased purchasing power during
the years under consideration is indicated by the increase which oc-
curred in the importation of foreign merchandise on the part of the
United States, namely, from $437,051,000 in 1878 to 1667,954,000 in
1880, and $722,639,000 in 1882. Such an increase represented pay-
ment in part for American exports ($110,575,000 in gold and silver
being imported in addition in 1881), and a corresponding demand for
the products of foreign industries the special effect on British in-
dustry being characterized by a statement from one of the witnesses
before the Royal Commission (a representative of one of the dis-
tricts of Liverpool), that the depression continued until 1880, when
there occurred an American boom, which temporarily lifted prices
and induced activity. The testimony of other witnesses was, how-
ever, to the effect that in many branches of British industry there
was no improvement of condition either in 1878, 1880, or in any sub-
sequent year ; the Commission itself reporting (in December, 1886) that
there was a general agreement among those whom it consulted, that
the depression under consideration, so far as Great Britain was con-
cerned, dates from about the year 1875, and, with the exception of a
short period enjoyed by certain branches of trade in the years 1880 to
1883, it has proceeded with tolerable uniformity, and has affected the
trade and industry of the country generally, especially those branches
connected with agriculture. The Commission further reports that
the information received by them leads to the conclusion that in
Belgium, France, Russia, Scandinavia, Spain, and the United States,
the depression has been almost identical in its leading features with
that existing in the United Kingdom.
In Germany and Belgium the reaction experienced in 1879, it is
admitted, did not extend beyond 1882.
In France the condition of agricultural and other laborers continued
so deplorable that the French Chamber of Deputies appointed a special
commission of inquiry in 1884 with a view to devising measures for re-
* No. 1 spring wheat, which commanded $1.05 per bushel in the New York market on
the 1st January, 1878, was quoted at $1.60 at a corresponding date in 1879; and at $1.39
in 1881. The corresponding advance in corn was from 45 cents per bushel in 1878 to
63 cents in 1879, and 70 cents in 1881 ; while the advance in mess-pork was from $7.05
per barrel in 1878 to $12.62$ in 1879, and $17 in 1881.
