SCIENCE AND PSEUDO-SCIENCE. 215
In the first place, Newton defined the laws, rules, or observed order of
the phenomena of motion, which come under our daily observation,
w T ith greater precision than had been before attained ; and, by follow-
ing out with marvelous power and subtilty the mathematical conse-
quences of these rules, he almost created the modern science of pure
mechanics, In the second place, applying exactly the same method
to the explication of the facts of astronomy as that which was applied
a century and a half later to the facts of geology by Lyell, he set him-
self to solve the following problem : Assuming that all bodies, free
to move, tend to approach one another as the earth and the bodies on
it do ; assuming that the strength of that tendency is directly as the
mass and inversely as the squares of the distances ; assuming that the
laws of motion, determined for terrestrial bodies, hold good through-
out the universe ; assuming that the planets and their satellites were
created and placed at their observed mean distances, and that each
received a certain impulse from the Creator will the form of the or-
bits, the varying rates of motion of the planets, and the ratio between
those rates and their distances from the sun which must follow by
mathematical reasoning from these premises, agree with the order of
facts determined by Kepler and others, or not ?
Newton, employing mathematical methods which are the admira-
tion of adepts, but which no one but himself appears to have been able
to use with ease, not only answered this question in the affirmative,
but stayed not his constructive genius before it had founded modern
physical astronomy.
The historians of mechanical and of astronomical science appear to
be agreed that he was the first person who clearly and distinctly put
forth the hypothesis that the phenomena comprehended under the
general name of gravity follow the same order throughout the uni-
verse, and that all material bodies exhibit these phenomena ; so that,
in this sense, the idea of universal gravitation may, doubtless, be prop-
erly ascribed to him.
Newton proved that the laws of Kepler were particular conse-
quences of the laws of motion and the law of gravitation in other
words, the reason of the first lay in the two latter. But to talk of
the law of gravitation, alone, as the reason of Keplers laws, and still
more as standing in any causal relation to Keplers laws, is simply a
misuse of language. It would really be interesting if the Duke of
Argyll would explain how he proposes to set about showing that the
elliptical form of the orbits of the planets, the constant area described
by the radius vector, and the proportionality of the squares of the
periodic times to the cubes of the distances from the sun, are either
caused by the force of gravitation or deducible from the law of
gravitation. I conceive that it would be about as apposite to say
that the various compounds of nitrogen with oxygen are caused by
chemical attraction and deducible from the atomic theory.
