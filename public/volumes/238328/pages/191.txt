admit and study the effects of animal organisms in disease with the same
thoroughness with which bacterial affections are observed. A considerable
part of this is to be credited to students of tropical medicine. Portions of
protozoology, formerly regarded as an academical science; helminthology, long
looked upon as a distinct and isolated branch of natural history, and entomol-
ogy, which was for centuries tolerated as a hobby of dilettantes, have grad-
ually become co-ordinated into a logical science which touches and explains
a goodly fraction of the important diseases of mankind. The study should
be taught systematically and thoroughly in every medical school in the
country instead of being touched upon in a desultory manner by the bacteri-
ologist, pathologist or clinician." â€” Dr. Creighton Wellman, in the California
State Tournal of Aledicine.
