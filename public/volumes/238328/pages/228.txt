THE CITRUS MEAL^' BUG 299
"A careful nieasurenient with a micromillimeter gives the following re-
sults: joints 1. 2, 3, 4, 5. r,, 7, 8; 96, 88, 96, 68, 80, 81, 44, 104."
"The formula of Conistock's measurements with the eye 8, 3, [2,7 }, (6, 5),
4 omitting joint 1 ; of these by myself with the eye 8. 3, (1, 2), 5, 4, (6, 7),
and with the micromillimeter 8, (1, 3), 2, 6, 5, 4, 7. This, I believe, is the
lirst time that the true measurements of the antennal joints of Dactylopius
citri have been given." From all of the above it is readily seen that there
must be a large degree of variation in the antennal articles of different in-
dividuals. The mounting, and the position of the insect upon the slide, no

doubt, i)lays a very important part in these determinations. For general
work the eye measurements (taken by the eye through a rnicroscope) must
be used by the average student for ready reference. In combining all of the
formula? of eye measurements we may fix a more exact formula as follows :
iS, 3, (1, 2. 7), (5, 6), 4. The combined number of antennal articles equals
about one-nintli the length of the insect's body.
Rostrum â€” Short, stout, and in two distinct divisions, the basal division
being much broader than the apical. The rostral loo]) is nearh- half as long
as the Ijodv.
