There is a great difference in the pvg'idinm of the respective ages, but all
adults examined were egg-laying and the largest obtainable.
Eggs — Elliptical, very small, yellow in color. Laid in a white, cottony or
waxy secretion — usually in masses beneath the female body, but at times in
large irregular masses filling the entire culm of the infested grass. This shows
in the photo (Fig. ).
Young — Of the same general shape as the adult. Color almost white —
sometimes dark pink. Antennje (Fig. 93 B) sometimes 6-articled, with first
three articles co-equal. Normally haired. Pygidium with two spines on lobes,
6-circumanal and two stout spines on lobes forming tufts.
.Habitat — Found in many sections of this county (Ventura) feeding upon
the Wild Rye, Elymus condcnsatiis. It may be found between the blades and

the culm or within the culm if there is a place for entering — such an entrance
is sometimes afforded by holes bored through the culm by the larva of a moth.
Within the culm the eggs are often massed in great quantities and the young
crawl out upon hatching.
The tips of the culms are usually more liable to be infested than any
other part of the plant, where the last blades form an axil.
