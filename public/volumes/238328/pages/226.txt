THE CITRUS MEALY BUG 297
The color of the body is light yellow, turning darker in the more ad-
vanced egg-laying- forms. When boiled in KOH the body contents first become
cardinal and finally change to an amlaer or yellow color. When the contents
h.ave been removed the appendages and body wall become perfectly trans-
i:arent and colorless after they have been cleared in clove oil or in xvlol.

.Intcniiac (Fig. 115 A). \\'hile the articles of the antennre vary to a
marked degree, yet much use can be made of them in determining the species.
From careful micri)scc)|)ic measurements the following formuhe were derived:
S. 3, (2. 1, 7) (4. (i. .T) and 8, 3, 3 (1. 7) (4. (). '?]. In Insect Life. \'ol.
vii, No. 2. ]). 172 (18'H), .Mr. (i. C. Davis offers the following in regard
to the antennal articles: "In tlcstrnctor the basal and terminal segments are
of equal width and Ijroader than the others. The terminal segments are not
nearly truncate. The following shows the length of the different segments
lieginning at the base. The measurements are made b\ using the micrometer;
•_3.5, 2—5. ^—5. 4—3, ,S— 4.25, 6—3.25, 7—4.5. 8— lO."
From these measurements the following formula m;iy be derived: 8,
(2, 3), 7, 5, 1, 6, 4.
