CALIFORNIAN EMESID/E {Hcmiptera)
C. F. BAKER
These remarkable insects are constantl_v being brought to the attention of
both entomologist and layman. Mr. Banks has recently given a synopsis in
"Psyche" of all of the known species of the United States, including Califor-
nia. However, several common Californian species do not appear in his
synopsis, and three of these are apparently new to science.
Herewith we present a complete synopsis of the genera and species of the
State, so far as they are known to us. With the new species presented in this
paper, the Californian list is as follows:
1. Ploiariopsis reticulata Baker.
2. Ploiaria californiensis Baker
3. Ploiariodes californica Banks.
4. Barce baitksii Baker.
5. Eiiicsa brc^'ico.va Banks.
