FUMIGATION STUDIESâ€” II
DOES ORDINARY CONTRACT FUMIGATION PAY?
WRIGHT M. PIERCE
Very little information has ever been puljlished on the cost of fumigation.
The contractor naturally wishes to make the maximum profit, while the
grower must labor to reduce the cost to a minimum. For any well founded
deductions we need complete detailed figures from many sources, and we
are hoping that this paper may arouse enough interest among the growers
to induce them to obtain and send to us their fumigation accounts in detail.
( )ur own observations were confined to a few outfits working in the neigh-
borhood of Claremont. Even these limited and variable data make some
facts in the whole matter very evident, the principal being that throughout
the county there appear to be no standards governing either the work or
the cost of it. Three cases are presented herewith, the trees in all cases being
understood as averaging an ordinary medium size, and the fumigation for
black scale.
Outfit A.
This outfit contracted to fumigate 10 acres, using 22 hours of w(.)rk.
The cost to the fumigator was as follows :
1.S3 pounds of cyanide at .26 $47.58
183 pounds acid at .2 3.66
22 hours of work at $1.95 42.90
giving a total of $94.14. The grower was charged $158 for the joli, leaving
a profit of $63.86 to the fumigator. The tents, in this case, were left over the
trees for forty-five minutes. The formida used was 1-1-3.
