The tests were carried up to boiling point, but no life in any form existed
after 164° F. or 73.3° C. had been passed. For dipping boxes, I am recom-
mending 170° F, or 76.6° C. in order to make sure of all of the eggs, which
may be unusually well protected.
Fumigation. — The power to resist hydrocyanic acid gas, has been very
<lefinitely established in work here. (See Pomona Journal Vol. 1, No. 4, p.
1, and Vol. 2, No. 3, p. 246). The very youngest forms, including those of
the first moult, first succumb and all of these may be destroyed with a very
small dosage. The full-grown adult comes next, while the eggs and the
half-grown forms are most resistant. The length of exposure which gave the
best results was 2 hours, and the dosage, double Schedule No. 1, administered
at the beginning of each hour. An air-tight tent, or an excessive dosage
is not sufficient to kill all forms.
Sprayi)ig. No spray is practical that will not penetrate the cottony cover-
ing. The mealy bugs have great resistive power to everything but very
penetrating oil or acid sprays. (See Pomona Journal Vol. II, No. 4, p. 246).
It might be said, in conclusion, that the mealy bug is a great resister,
/))(/ it can not effectually resist any systematic methods which arc cncrgcticallv
and persistently waged against it.
Birds. — Without doubt birds play a very important part in the distribution
of scale insects. The fact that the orchard trees serve as roosting places for
countless numbers of them, afford excellent opportunities for the young scale
to crawl upon the feet and legs and be carried to other localities. The in-
herent tendency of most insects is to crawl up and there is no choice for the
first broods but to do this, regardless of what they may be ascending. Then,
too, if a bird alights in a tree which is thickly infested with mealy bug,
and ever touches an egg-mass, it is sure to carry .some of it awav, for the
