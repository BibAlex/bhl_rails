hairs on the antennae (Figure 5, N). The cornicles are usually longer, in this
case beino- 0.27 mm. in length. In one individual there were two distinct
tubercles arising from the abdomen just outside of the cornicles. (Figure 4,
A and C.)
Nymph of Apterous Viviparous Female. — These young are about one-
sixth the size of the adult and are like them in most respects.
In color they are somewhat lighter in shade— the eyes, however, are very dark.
The antennae are made up of but five joints, the fifth being very long, with
basal nail-like process. All of the articles except the first two are transversely
scabrous. They have no sensoria. The rostrum is longer than the body.
The cornicles are short, stout, and clavate in form. The style is obscure.

Taken from the lower side of leaves of the common cultivated blue violet
at Claremont, Calif., Nov. 12, 1908. In no case were they found in any
considerable numbers on any single plant, but occurred in twos and threes on
a leaf.

On the same plants and mingled with the wine-colored forms described
above are found numerous green individuals, both winged and apterous, which
diflfer in some characters supposedly of generic value. Possibly one or other
of the forms may be a migrant generation. Although these two
forms are closely associated on the same leaves of the cultivated blue
violet, there is a chance that the green forms are a different species after all.
With the coming of the spring broods this can be ascertained more definitely.
In the meantime a full description of the green form is here given.
Winged Viviparous Female. — Length 1.69 mm., width 0.8 mm.
Prevailing color— dark green. Lf^j— lighter. Thorax— darker. (Figure 4,
