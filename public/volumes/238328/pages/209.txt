A PHYTOPTID GALL ON ARTEMISIA CALIFORNICA
H. V. M. HALL
Eriophyes californica n. sp.
Body cylindrical, length .14 mm., and this is three to four times the
diameter. The shield (Fig. 109A) is broadly crescent shaped, its horns
pointing to the sides and a little caudad. The dorsal seta (Fig. 109 B) is a
little less in length than the depth of the body. The head is short, the legs
short and stout. The claws are longer than the tufts which appear as
groups of short, blunt bristles. The number of rings in the abdomen varies

from 49 to 56. A side view shows that many of these rings run together
along the dorsum, and there form larger, very salient wrinkles. The caudal
setae are nearly half the length of the body and fairly stout; between and
above these are two short fine bristles. Other minor characters will be
evident from the figures.
