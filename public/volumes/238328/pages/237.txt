FEMALE LARVAE AND ADULTS AT SANTA PAULA.
Because of the overlapping of all stages from the larval form to the
adult, I have deemed it necessarv to consider these forms together as one.

A lemon showing three broods of mealy bugs, before the fruit dried up. This is
somewhat of a remarkable picture, for it shows what may be expected of the mealy bug.
The fact that most of the eggs are deposited during the early winter
months would at once lead us to believe that during the early spring there
would be a tremendous hatching of young, and such is the case in normal
weather. If the winter is warm the broods appear just as in the summer and
there is a constant hatching all of the time. Even during the coldest weather
a great many young appear. With the coming of the new growth and young
fruit in the spring, come the hoards of newly hatched mealy bugs which
settle at once upon the most delicate foliage and around the calyx of the
young fruit. It is upon the fruit that the greatest damage is done, for the
pests will remain with it until it is killed and drops or until it is ruined as a
commercial product. From the time that the foliage begins to harden the
mealy bugs seem to decline and during the hot summer months are not notice-
able unless the orchard is badly infested. Then beginning with September the
adults appear in great numbers and begin to deposit eggs. The young
upon hatching exude the honey dew which causes so much black smut upon
the foliage. While there are many individual broods throughout the year
there is always the marlced winter season when the numbers of all forms
