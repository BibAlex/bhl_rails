the development, there is a gradual acquisition of the white powdery covering,
which completely covers the adult female.
Adult (Figs. 113 and 114). The adult mealy bug. as its name suggests,
is completely covered with a thick, white, cottony wax. The body segmenta-
tion is distinctly visible through this covering, though the latter completely
hides the body color. On the ventral surface the covering is very thin or
wanting. At the margins the waxy-covering extends outwardly in the form
of white filaments or ])lates. There are 17 lateral filaments on each side.

At the posterior end there are 2 long filaments, nearly one-fourth the length
of the body, and several shorter filaments extending backward. From every
lateral spine group or large spine there arises a filament, liy counting these
we find 34 lateral filaments on the same number of small spine areas, which
comprise 2 short spines each. 2 long posterior spines arising from the spines
on the anal lobes, 2 short filaments arising from the short spines on the anal
lobes, and 6 filaments arising from the six circumanal spines. The average
length of the adult female is 3 mm., and the average width is 1.5 mm. Some
are much larger. A brown mid-dorsal longitudinal band is a common char-
acteristic of the adults.
