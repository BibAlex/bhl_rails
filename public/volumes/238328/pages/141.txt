In this whole matter several salient truths appear ;
1. That we have no standards set by the Horticultural Commission or
otherwise, governing such work.
2. That the work we are now getting over the county is very variable
in price and in results.
3. That growers, as a rule, do not know enough about fumigation to
make a contract that efficiently protects their own interests.
4. That we must come finally to fumigation by the Exchanges, or by
solid groups of growers, on the block system, if we cannot have it done by
the county as in San Bernardino. Others never will take the interest in
one's welfare that he himself would take, and it behooves growers every-
where to take a real and a live interest in this whole matter.
