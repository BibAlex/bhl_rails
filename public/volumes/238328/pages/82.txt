ESSIG. NOTES ON CALIFORNIA COCCIDAE
93
The body proper (Figs. 39, B, C) is jet black and the size of a small
garden pea. Its chief characteristic is a long anal projection nearly half as
long as the body. This projection or tail corresponds to the anal plate in most
coccids, and is two lobed (Fig. 39 D).
The male has never been obtained.

lobe, instead of the usual two with two smaller lobes and a rudimentary lobe
on both sides. The spine arrangement is as follows : median lobe — 1 large

on middle. Spinnerets — consist in 4 — 6 marginal, 18 — 22 lower laterals, and
18 — 20 upper laterals.
