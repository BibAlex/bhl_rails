Saissetia heuiispliaerica (Targ)
nemlsphcrical Scale
This scale (Fig. 89) is very widely distributed, especially in the regions
along the coast. In this county (Ventura) it is very numerous along the entire
sea-border, feeding on a great variety of plants. The photo shows a normal
condition of a Bignonia infested with this scale, growing on the grounds of
the County Court House.
It is a special greenhouse nuisance, working on nearly all the ferns,
palms, etc., and has been distributed on such stock.
Figure 89. Saissetia hemisphaerica.
The citrus trees do not escape its attacks, but no serious damage has
been done to them. The scales usually settle around the edges of the leaves
and are easily recognized by their smooth, hemispherical, brown bodies. At
some periods of the year it infests these trees almost as badly as the Black
Scale, but is not as persistent. This is especially true in the localities of
Ventura and Oxnard. In the interior it is seldom found on the citrus trees
at all, and few orchardists know of its existence.
In the greenhouses it is usually handled with sprays such as Kerosene
Emulsions, etc. Fumigation will get it in the orchard.
The parasite of the Black Scale, Sciifcllista cyanca, works on this scale
also with about the same efficiency.
