of the Diplopoda is especially unsatisfactory; while of the Symphyla ami
Tauropoda, — undoubtedly represented in the state — so far as known to the

main divisions, the head and the trunk or body proper. The body, enclosed
in a chitinous exo-skeleton free from lime salts, is relatively long and ribbon-

nearly all of which bear each a single pair of six or seven jointed legs. The

sternal plates. The first pair of post-cephalic appendages are modified into
"poison-jaws," commonly referred to in literature as the prehensorial feet.
The coxae of the prehensorial feet fuse in the middle line into a plate termed
