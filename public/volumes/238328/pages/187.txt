as on frontal plates ; not depressed below dorsulum and head ; dorsulum broad
anteriorly, ascending posteriorly, nearly as large as scutum. Wings hyaline,
two and two-thirds times as long as broad, broadest across middle, acute
apically, apex within second marginal cell ; first marginal cell a little larger
than second marginal : radius longer than second cubital, curved midway ;
venation brown to black.
Fem.^le — Abdomen very broad dorso-ventrally, strongly arched dorsally.
Genital segment hirsute, fully as long as four preceding segments, subacute
apically ; both plates of equal length ; style not exserted. M.\le — Abdomen
broad basally, strongly converging. Genital segment very long, nearly as
long as four preceding segments ; genital plate reflexed dorsally ; claspers ellip-
tically arched, closely lying on genital plate, hirsute.
Described from one female and two males, taken by C. F. Baker near
Claremont, Calif. Co-type in Nat. Museum.
Trioza rotundipenuis n. sp.
(Fig. 99, E, J\I, N), (Fig. 98, C).
Length of body 1.9 mm.; length of forewing 2.9 mm. General color red-
dish brown to orange; head brownish, except margin of frontal plates light;
prothorax whitish ; meso- and metathorax mostly reddish brown ; abdomen
brown except genital segment white ; three basal antennal segments white, the
rest black.
Head not deflexed ; with eyes, fully as broad as thorax ; frontal plates
subhorizontal, slightly and finely pubescent, elevated plate-like, broadly de-
pressed discally, and deeply emarginate anteriorly at median suture ; facial
cones black, moderately large, acute, almost horizontal, strongly divergent
and very sparsely and briefly hirsute. Eyes scarcely hemispherical, rather
flattened. Antennae fully twice as long as width of head, inserted somewhat
above cones, without ; two basal segments short and stout, the rest filiform ;
III very long, longer than IV and V combined.
Thorax quite strongly arched, punctate, not pubescent. Pronotum de-
pressed below dorsulum and head, lighter in color than the rest of the thorax ;
dorsulum rather acute anteriorly, ascending strongly especially anteriorly,
about as long as scutum. Wings hyaline, about two and one-fourth times as
long as broad, broadest across first marginal and radial cells midway, very
broadly rounded apically ; radius very short, but fully as long as second
cubital, which is only twice as long as fourth furcal ; marginal cells about
equal ; venation yellow.
Male — Abdomen quite broad basally, dorsal segments descending and
almost disappearing on anal half of abdomen. Genital segments partially re-
flexed dorsally, larger than preceding segment ; genital plate reflexed ; claspers
laterally opposed, fully as long as genital segment, acute at tips, moderately
hirsute.
Described from two males, taken by C. F. Baker near Claremont, Calif,
(mountains). Co-type in Nat. Museum.
