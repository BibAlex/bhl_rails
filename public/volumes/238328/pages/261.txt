elevated over middle half of line between posterior ocelli ; discal area with a
shallow depression on each side in the shape of a spherical triangle with the
bases coincident and raised slightly at median suture, and apeces near an-
terior margin of eyes ; frontal plates raised plate-like, deflexed and emarginate
at median suture anteriorly. Anterior ocellus not visible from above, im-
bedded between frontal emargination, angle of facial cones, and the inter-
mediate converging antennal insertions, as in T. fulvida. Facia) cones long,
divergent, acute, subvertical but very slightly visible from above, moderately
pubescent.
Thorax strongly arched, finely punctate. Pronotum short, depressed be-
low head and dorsulum ; dorsulum strongly ascending to scutum, narrowly
rounded anteriorly, not quite as long as scutum. Wings hyaline, about two
and a half times as long as broad, broadest across first marginal cell, broadly
rounded apically ; radius flexed midway, fully as long as second cubital ;
marginal cells rather small, subequal ; venation yellowish.
Female. — Abdomen dorsally brownish gray, ventrally greenish white.
Genital segment rather short, about as long as anal ventral segmental plate ;
dorsal plate longer and more acute than ventral ; genital pore about one-fourth
as long as dorsal plate, inclined toward anal segment.
Described from one female in the C. F. Baker collection, taken in Van-
couver. Type specimen in National Museum.
Trioza aurantiaca n. sp.
(Figs. 128 W; 129 N ; 130 W, X, Y.)
Length of body, 2.3 mm. ; length of forewing, 3.4 mm. ; greatest width,
1.35 mm. ; width of vertex between eyes, .44 mm. ; with eyes, .72 mm. General
color orange, varying from light yellowish brown in some specimens to deep
orange in others ; abdomen ventrally and anally greenish white.
Head moderately deflexed. very finely punctate, with eyes not as broac'
as thorax. Posterior margin of vertex arcuate, not emarginate at median
suture, slightly and narrowly elevated over middle three-fifths of line between
[josterior ocelli ; discal area with a small shallow fovje midway near posterior
ridge, and a diverging depression extending obliquely toward front and lower
margin of eyes ; frontal plates slightly raised plate-like, deeply emarginate at
median suture. Anterior ocellus not visible from above. Facial cones quite
long, acute, only slightly divergent, subvertical and not visible from above,
sparsely pubescent. Antennae inserted at base of cones, mostly in front.
Thorax arched, finely punctate. Pronotum short, depressed below dor-
sulum and head ; dorsal portion almost vertical, ascending to lower margin
of slightly overhanging dorsulum. Dorsulum strongly ascending, acutely
rounded anteriorly. Wings hyaline, about two and a half times as long as
broad, broadest across base of first marginal cell, subacute apically ; marginal
cells subequl ; venation yellowish.
Female. — Genital segment short, scarcely as long as ventral segmental
plate preceding it ; dorsal plate longer and lecc acute than ventral ; genital pore
about one-fourth as long as dorsal plate, declinate toward anal segment ;
