young forms. The forms obtained seem to be the winter broods according to
the pecuUarity of the antennae which are /-articled on all of the specimens ob-
tained. This may also be due to tlie fact that no fully matured adults were
taken. Whatever the case may be, I am only able to present the material as
it came to me.
Antennae (Winter form) (Fig. 91 C) — /-articled; the comparative
lengths of the respective articles, beginning with the longest, are as follows :
7, 2, (3, 4), 6, (1,5). All of the articles are normally hairy.
Legs (Fig. 91 B) — Coxa and tarsus coequal, femur a little longer than
the tibia. Tibia nearly twice as long as the tarsus. Only a few hairs on the
tibia and tarsus.
Pygidium (Fig. 91 A) — Furnished with six circumanal spines, but no
spines in evidence on any of the anal lobes. There are two small hairs on the
median lobes. On the first lobe is one stout spine and two such spines on
the second lobe.
]\I.\LE — The adult form has not been obtained. The pupa cases are about
1 mm. in length, cylindrical, and snow white. They are seen in great numbers
on the guava leaf in the photograph (Fig. 90).
Food plants — Crawford found this very abundant on the Guava. It has
been reported on Nipa fruticans, and palms.
Habitat — Collected by David Crawford on Guava in the neighborhood of
Guadalajara, Mexico. It was also taken by others from Demerara, Mexico.

Ripersia suiithii n. sp.
Adult Fem.\le (Fig. 92) — Body decidedly long and narrow or elongate-
elliptical in form. Length 4 to 6 mm.; width 1.5 to 2 mm. Color, pinkish to
slate. The waxy covering is very fine and scarcely hides the color of the
body. The waxy appendages are rudimentary and imperfect and the segmenta-
tion indistinct. When boiled in KOH the body first becomes pink and later
perfectly colorless and transparent.
