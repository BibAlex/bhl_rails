Figure 18 of the second number of the Journal was intended to be from
a photograph of this species as it occurs on the twigs of the orange. By mis-
take the cut was replaced by one of the citrus mealy bug on lemon. We now
present herewith (Figure 37), the pro])er cut illustrating this interesting spe-
cies.
Ceroplastes ceriferus Anderson.
Adult Female. â€” The general exterior appearance (Fig. 38, and 39, A)
of this scale reminds one of lumps of dough stuck to the limbs of a plant. The
uneven lobes of the large waxy secretion have the yellowish-white color of
well-kneaded dough. In diameter the secretion varies from 1 mm. to 1J4 mm.,
in height from Vi mm. to 1 mm.
