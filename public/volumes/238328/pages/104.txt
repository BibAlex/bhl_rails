Leptothrips aspersus Hinds
Several specimens of L- aspersus have been taken by the writer on the
foliage of orange trees ; one specimen was taken from a breeding cage in which
orange foliage, infested with yellow scale {Chrysoniphalus aurantii) had been
placed about three weeks before. This species was formerly placed in Crypto-
thrips Uzel, by Hinds, but was later referred to the genus Phyllothrips Hood,
and finally to Leptothrips Hood.
