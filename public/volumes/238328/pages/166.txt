Fe.MALE Scale (Fig. 82) — Is a golden brown with a decided ridge
running down the middle of the dorsum. In shape it is long and narrow,

Pygidium {Fig. 82 D.) — The mesal lobes rather small and rounding, with

appear on the margin to the first segment, and other spines follow as shown
in the figure. There are few tubular spinnerets, in many forms not any show-

circumgenital glands are all run together in most specimens and it is hard to
draw a distinction between the lateral and median group. The approximate
