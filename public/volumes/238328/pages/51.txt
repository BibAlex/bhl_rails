Fseudococcus agrifuliae n. sp.
This species occurs scatteringly under the bark of Ouivciis agrifolia.
So far, it has been taken only in the locaHty of Claremont.
This species (Figure 26) is more or less oval in shape, although many may be
found which are decidedly oblong. In length the body varies from 2 to 6 mm.,
and in width from three-fourths to nearly the length. The pink body, though
nearly naked, is slightly covered with a fine white powdery wax, without distinct
lateral or anal wax appendages.
When boiled in K O H, the body becomes cardinal — the antennae and legs
remain light-yellow.
The antennae (Figure 23 G) are /-articled — the third article being about half
the length of the last. The comparative lengths of all the articles are shown in
the illustration. The mouth-parts are long, reaching nearly to the middle coxae.
The legs (Figure 24 G] are light brown, of medium length, and covered with
Figure 26. Pseudococcus aerifoliae
hair. See the cut for the comparative lengths of the different parts. The spines
of the anal lobes ( Figure 25 G ) are twice as long as the circumanal spines. Each
lobe is furnished with two ventral denticles. There is very little or no hair on the
body.
This species lives beneath the bark and in the cracks of the bark of Qucrcus
agrifolia. It was first taken by P. E. Smith at Santa Paula. It difl^ers from
P. quercus in the following :
P. quercus: — Body, greenish-brown ; antennae. 8-articled : tarsus, one-third as long
as tibia; host-plant, Quercus chrysoiepis.
P. agrifoliac : — Body, pink ; antennae, 7-articled ; tarsus, nearly as long as tibia ;
host-plant, Quercus agrifolia.
