THE NOCTUIDAE OF CALIFORNIA 11 279
Coast species, and extends northward to Vancouver and into British Columbia.
Hypena modesta Smith, is the smallest of the species, expanding scarcely
over an inch or less, and it has, proportionately, the longest palpi and the
best marked angle in the outer margin of primaries. It is of a quiet, almost
pearl gray in the male, somewhat powdery ; in the female a little more
reddish, with better defined markings, the s. t. space with a markedly blue-
gray tinge which can scarcely be called contrasting. The t. p. line is abso-
lutely rigid, without curve or bend to the internal vein, where there is a
moderate inward tooth.
The actual record of Californian Hypciiinac is therefore, as follows:
Bpi::cu.\-is Hbn.
E. OCCIDENTALIS Smith.
E. COBETA Barnes.
Tetanolita Grote.
T. PALLIGERA Smith.
T. GRETA Smith.
Bomolocha Hbn.
B. VEGA Smith.
Hypena Schrank.
H. DECORATA Smith,
H. CALIFORNICA Behr.
H. MODESTA Smith.
Note : It is my desire to take up the series in a somewhat systematic
manner if the necessary material can be secured. The Mominac, including
Panthea, Charadra and allies, and the species of Acronycta will therefore be
undertaken next if possible. The Californian species of Acronycta are not
well known, and their limits are distinctly doubtful. Any help that I can
get in the way of loan of material will be appreciated, and will collectors
please remember that one specimen does not represent a species. There
ought to be at least a male and a female and, in this genus, a series is almost
imperative. I will gladly return unique specimens loaned me for study,
except in the case of undescribed species. The completeness of this series of
papers depends largely upon the co-operation of California collectors.
