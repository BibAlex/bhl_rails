In the Entomological News, Vol. xiii, No. 8, p. 257 (1902), Mr. Geo. B.
King makes the following interesting statements regarding this matter: "Again
take the common mealy bug (so-called) of our greenhouse, Dactyloj^iits citri
(now Pseudococcus citri). Prof. Comstock described the antennae and says
joint 8 is longest, twice as long as 3, 2 and 7 equal, 5 and 6 equal, and 4
shortest. I have tried my eye with the following results : 8 and 3 longest ;
3 distinctly shorter than 8 ; 1 and 2 next longest and about equal ; 5 a little
longer than 4; 6 and 7 shortest and about equal."
