Phenacocciis raiiionae n. sp.
The form (Figure 28) is distinctly oval, tapering slightly toward the anal
end. The body varies from 4 to 6 mm. in length, and from 1 to 3 mm. in width.
The covering is a snow-white cottony wax, which entirely hides the insect's body.
The segmentation is very distinct. Along the median line of the dorsum there
extends a well-defined ridge, on either side of which is a similar indistinct ridge
parallel to it. On the margin of each segment is a stout waxy lateral plate, the
two anal wax plates being twice as long as any of the rest, and much heavier.
Beneath the covering the body is greenish-yellow. \\'hen treated with K O H
the body becomes perfectly colorless and transparent, the legs and antennae re-
main brown.
The antennae (Figure 23 E) are /-articled, long and rather stout. Article 3

is longer than 8. The comparative lengths of the remaining articles may be found
in the cut. All of the articles are hairy. The mouth-parts are short and stout â€”
the rostral loop, reaching nearly to the caudal end of the body. The legs (Figure
24 E) are long, stout, and covered with short hair. The femur is longer than
the tibia, the tarsus about one-half the length of the tibia, the claw is slightly
curved with a tooth on the inner margin. The spines of the anal lobes (Figure
25 E) are shorter than the six circumanal spines. The body is covered with hair.
On the lateral margins of all the segments are dark callouses bearing from 2 to 8
denticles.
