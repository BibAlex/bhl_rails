AMERICAN PSYLLIDAE II 3SS
from near posterior margin and closer to median suture than to posterior
ocelli toward lower margin of eyes ; sulcas connected posteriorly by a shal-
lower transverse sulcus ; frontal plates not raised plate-like ; vertex distinctly
emarginate anteriorly at median suture, making anterior ocellus visible from
above. Facial cones moderately long scarcely divergent, acute at tips, sub-
horizontal and visible from above, slightly pubescent. Antennas inserted on
frons between lower margin of eye and base of facial cone on each side ;
two basal segments large, not globose, the remaining segments filiform.
Thorax somewhat arched, slightly punctate. Pronotum very short, de-
pressed below dorsulum and head, ascending toward dorsulum, with a fovea
on each side just above episternum. Dorsulum ascending strongly, triangular,
roundly pointed anteriorly. Wings hyaline, moderately slender, about two
and two-thirds times as long as broad, broadest across first furcal. quite
acute apically ; radius distinctly shorter than second cubital ; second marginal
cell smaller than first ; second cubital terminating at apex of wing.
Female. — Abdomen darker in color than thorax. Genital segment long,
almost as long as rest of abdomen, distinctly deflexed ; dorsal plate slender,
quite acute, overreaching ventral plate and receding farther back basally ;
genital pore large, elliptical, conspicuous ; pubescence very light and sparse.
Miilc. — Abdomen more slender than in female. Genital segment longer than
two preceding, quite stout, tapering toward tip: claspers simple, curved in-
ward and slightly serrated apically ; anal segment produced dorsally into a
large, broad double projection, bilobate w-hen viewed from the side, with a
more or less distinct ridge extending from the base into each lobe ; posterior
lobe, viewed from behind, with two recurved flaps ; upper rim of projection
bordered with a fringe of about twenty-four long hairs ; pubescence sparse but
moderately conspicuous. ( In the accompanying illustrations the claspers are
shown as partially enclosed and held by anal projection, which may or not
be the natural position for them in all specimens.)
Described from two females and three males in the C. F. Baker collection,
taken in Colorado. Type specimen in National ATuseum.

Length of body, 2.0 mm. ; length of forewing, 3.0 mm. ; greatest width,
1.3 mm.; width of vertex between eyes, .38 mm.; with eves, .60 mm. General
color, yellowish green to greenish white, abdomen ventrally darker. ai)ical
half of antennae and middle tarsi black.
Head slightly deflexed, with eyes fully as broad as thorax, coarsely
punctate ; posterior margin of vertex arcuate, not emarginate at median suture,
scarcely elevated ; discal area with fovea on each side between median suture
and po.sterior ocelli near posterior margin ; depression scarcely sulcate ; vertex
roundly emarginate anteriorly at median suture ; anterior ocellus barely visible
from above. Facial cones rather short, stout at base, acute, quite divergent,
subvcrtical but slightly npcurved and partially visible from above, sparselv
