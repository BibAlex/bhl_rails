The scale of the male is narrow and much smaller than the scale of the
female. In color it is considerably lighter, with marginal exuviae a littlel darker.

This is more strictly a Florida scale, and is seldom found in California. Its
color is so near that of the bark that infections are very difficult to find when
only on the trunk or stems. However, it readily attacks the leaves and fruit so
that it soon becomes very evident. Inspector C. H. Vary found this scale in
great numbers infesting trunk (Figure 18), leaves, and fruit of a single orange
tree in the very center of Pomona. It was promptly eradicated, for it was feared
that it might do the damage here that it has done in Florida. Mr. E. K. Carnes
reports this scale in only two districts in the State.
