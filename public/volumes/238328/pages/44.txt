ESSIG, NOTÂ£S ON CALIFORNIAN COCCIDAE 33
Around the margins of the body is quite a wide colorless band extending lialf-way
from the margin to the light median line on the dorsum. The general back-
ground color is a gray. The bodies are rather long, and may be so thick on the
branches as to overlap so as to completely hide the surface of the branch. The
antennae are /-articled and small, as are also the legs.
The scale multiplies with wonderful rapidity, and so far as our examination
goes, they are nearly free from parasites. They attack principally the younger
shoots. Soft Brown Scale seems to limit its attacks by preference to the young
trees, but this scale works as successfully on the old trees as on the young, but
generally on the new growth. So far, it has been reported in only two orchards
in any considerable numbers. Due to the fact that it is an unarmored scale, and
so soft, it will probably not require any special fumigation dosage to rid the
orchards of it. An ordinary Black-Scale dosage will do the work. But because
of its ability to increase in such enormous numbers, care must be taken to rid the
orchards of it before a great deal of damage has been done. Like most imported
scale"; it has probably been struggling under changed climatic conditions, and is
just beginning to thrive.

The female scale is irregularly elongated about 1 mm. in length, gray with
darker marginal exuviae. The female body has three pairs of well-developed anal
lobes (Figure 19), and a less developed fourth lobe resembling a papilla. Be-
tween the lobes and extending along the lateral margins are numerous hairs which
arise from well-defined lateral lobes. There are four groups of circumgenital
pores, the two upper groups usually having six, the two groups near cauda having
seven. The whole body shows the segmentation very plainly.
