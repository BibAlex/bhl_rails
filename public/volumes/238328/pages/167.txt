numbers are as follows: lower laterals — 14 to 16; vipper laterals — 21 to 27;
median — 9 to 12.
According to the mounted specimen shown in Figure 82, D., it would
appear that the young were born alive and crawl from beneath the shell as
in the case of the ovoviviparous forms. The yeung body (Fig. 82A) resembles
the young of most scale. The whole thorax is apparently undivided while
the abdomen is markedly segmented. The antennae are rather short and
stout with the normal number of spines. The pygidium has two very distinct
and stout spines — one on either anal lobe, with several smaller spines also.
The eyes are black.
Food plants — Podocavpus chincnsis, Pinus.
Habitat — A native of Japan, but shipped into this state on nursery stock ;
the described species was collected at Bakersfield and sent to this office by
Mr. Edw. IM. Ehrhorn when he w-as Quarantine Commissioner at San Fran-
cisco.

Heinichionaspis aspidistrae Sign
Female; Scale (Fig. 83, B) — Long and narrow, differing greatly in shape.
Some are oyster-shaped while others are straight with all the possible grad-
uations between these two. In general, however, the body-end is nearly
pointed and the scale gradually widens to the posterior end which is the
widest and rounded. Length 2 to 2.5 mm., width about one-third the length.
Color — Straw to a deep brown, and in extreme cases almost purplish-black.
Exuvia about as long as the width of the body at its widest place, with a
distinct ridge running down the dorsum.
Female Body (Fig. 83, A) — Nearly as long as the shell and deeply seg-
mented. Color — yellow to brown.
