POMONA COLLEGE
"Our Tribute to Christian Civilization"
The best located, and best housed and outfitted College on the West Coast,
with a very full corps of unusually enthusiastic and energetic professors, and
a large and very vigorous student body. The laboratories in Biology,
Chemistry, Physics and Astronomy are not excelled by any college of this
class in Western America, and in some respects are unequalled by any institu-
tions of any grade. Offers full Literary, Classical, and Scientific courses.
Possesses well-manned schools of Music and Art, and offers exceptional facili-
ties in library and athletics. The College should bejudged by its out put â€” its
graduates are a power wherever they go.
Claremont is admittedly at the center of one of the most salubrious, beau-
tifully located and desirable residence districts in California.
