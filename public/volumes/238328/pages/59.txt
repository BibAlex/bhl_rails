by digitules, these digitules also cover the entire body in great numbers, as is
shown in the cut, but disappear with age, as there are none on the adults.
Antennae (Figure 36 D) five-jointed and short, being 0.58 mm. long. The com-
parative lengths of the various articles are: I .05 mm., II .05 mm., Ill 1.18 mm.,
IV 0.2 mm., V 0.1 mm. The margins of the abdomen are deeply serrulated
between the many digitules. Rostrum very short, scarcely reaching beyond the
pro-thora.x. Legs as in the adult, only the hind tibia are marked, but in many
cases the middle tibia, and in some cases, all the tibia are marked at the distal
end with a conspicuous black blotch.
Of all the Southern California .\phids this form, commonly known as the
Walnut Aphid, is of the greatest economic importance because of the damage it
does to the Walnut trees. Introduced from Europe on nursery stock, it is
attacking the walnut, Juglans regiae, so vigorously as to threaten the out-put
greatly. Its appearance is so sudden and it often occurs in such countless num-
bers that the damage is done before the orchardist is aware of its presence. Last
year it threatened to ruin the entire crop on the Limoneira Ranch. It appears
to infest walnut trees throughout Southern California, settling on the under side
of the leaves, in numbers which at times entirely hide the whole surface.
