piceoiis, the two long articles thickly covered with long soft hairs. Coxae and
tibiae I pale, the former once banded, the latter dark towards tip. Legs II
and III straw colored with three small dark bands on femora. Wings rather
heavily reticulated with dark smoky lines and spots in the cells, the veins
unmargined, the markings along the median area distally becoming merged into
a broad dark stripe.
Femur I (Fig. 97, H, I, J) with about five large spines and fourteen small
ones. Tarsus I just reaches the spined tip of coxae. Head longer than pro-
thorax, the eyes very large and prominently bulged below lower margin. Pro-
thorax strongly constricted posteriorly, the hind margin strongly prominent all
around. Frontal lobe of head strongly swollen and broadly rounded.
This very pretty species is common at Claremont, California. Our speci-
mens collected partly by C. F. Baker and partly by Charles Metz. It is nearest
hirticornis, but differs in coloration of wings, in the spineless head, prothorax
much shorter than mesothorax, etc.

Length of body 9 mm. Dark brown, legs and antennae pale yellowish, a

Tibia I strongly haired within. Prothorax somewhat constricted posteriorly,
