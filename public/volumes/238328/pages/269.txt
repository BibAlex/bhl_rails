more properly belonging to the dorsal side as would be natural in some in-
dividuals that have been studied, giving the formula 1, 4, 3, 1 — 1, 4, 3, 2 instead
of 1, 3, 2, 1. The species in some features is variable and shows a tendency
to dimorphism.
While B. xanti, as above indicated, prevails in Southern California and
along the coast and in the Coast Mt., the present species replaces it in the
Sierras and ranges northward into Oregon and Washington, where it is
abundant.
Genus Lithobius Leach.
Two subgenera of this large genus, when considered in the prevalent
manner, are known to occur in California. The following key will aid in
the sparation of these subgenera and of the species known under each.
