of the very young throughout hfe, and are always active. They secrete a waxy
covering that serves to protect them, and often crawl into crevices and even into
the earth and so are difficult to combat. Their habit of movement throughout
life, makes their spread more easy and rapid. They are seriously destructive.
The second sub-family, Coccinae, are unarmored, and so when we touch
the scale, we touch the insect. We are familiar with these in the black scale,
the frosted scale and the soft brown scale. The absence of armor or a separate
scale to shelter them makes their destruction more easy.
The third sub-family Diaspinae, has a separate scale wliich consists of a
central projecting portion, made up of exviviae or cast skins of the young
or larval insect, and a flatter border, a secretion, which is gray or brown. We
are familiar with these in the red, yellow, purple, greedy and lemon-peel or ivy
scale. This protection makes their destruction more difficult ; hence the in-

creased dosage for red and purple scale when we fumigate. In both these last
two sub-families, the young insects soon become anchored, by their long beaks,
and so move but little, though the Coccinae can, and upon occasion do so
move till quite late in their development. With the first moult the Diaspinae
lose their feet and antennae, and the motion that they seem to make must be
largely through their rostrum or beak.
REPRODUCTION OF THE COCCIDS.
Many scale insects, like the black and purple scale, are oviparous, that is
they are egg-laying. These are likely to be more regular or periodic in their
appearance, and so we may find most all eggs, or young, or mature, at one
and the same time. This, of course, is favorable to their destruction, as we
