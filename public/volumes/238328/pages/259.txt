therein ; pubescence very sparse. Male. — Abdomen more slender. Genital
segment shorter than anal segment, subcylindrical, concave dorsally ; claspers
short, simple, acute and slightly toothed on inner margin apically ; penis ex-
serted between and behind claspers ; anal segment concave as in female,
produced dorsally into a short erect projection with two recurved flaps
extending horizontally toward claspers ; pubescence very sparse and incon-
spicuous.
Described from three females and one male in the C. F. Baker collection,
taken in Arizona. Type specimen in National Museum.
Trioza nigra n. sp.
(Figs. 128 S; 129 H: 130 P.)
Length of body, 2.1 mm.; length of forewing, 3.5 mm.; greatest width,
1.4 mm.; width of vertex between eyes, .46 mm.; with eyes, .74 mm. General
color, dark reddish brown to black, abdomen lighter ventrally, head quite black.
Head more or less deflexed, finely punctate. Posterior margin of vertex
arcuate, narrowly elevated between posterior ocelli over inner half of each
frontal plate, not emarginate at median suture; discal area of frontal plates
with a shallow depression over posterior half; anterior portion rovmdly lobate,
and distinctly projecting, emarginate at median suture. Anterior ocellus not
visible from above. Facial cones rather short, moderately acute apically, di-
vergent but not strongly so, subvertical and not visible from above, somewhat
rugulose transversely, almost glabrous, slightly pubescent, .\ntennae inserted
at base of cones below eyes, without.
Thorax arched, very finely punctate dorsally. Pronotum very short, de-
pressed below dorsulum and head, descending strongly toward head; dor-
sulum ascending to scutum, roundly pointed anteriorly and slightly over-
hanging pronotum ; scutum broader than head, with eyes. Wings, hyaline,
about two and one-third times as long as broad, broadest across first marginal
cell, roundly pointed apically ; radius scarcely as long as second cubital ; mar-
ginal cells subequal.
Female. — Genital segment very short, scarcely as long as anal ventral
segmental plate ; dorsal and ventral plates of equal length, the former more
acute ; pubescence sparse and apical. Male. — Genital segment medium in size,
rather upcurved ; claspers simple, moderately long, slender, acute, arcuate,
briefly pubescent ; anal projection long, bilobate when viewed laterally, pos-
terior lobe at right angles to anterior and erect lobe ; posterior lobe, when
viewed from above, composed of two recurved flaps ; pubescence sparse.
Described from five males collected in Colorado by C. F. Baker ; two
females, apparently belonging to this species, were collected in Louisiana
by G. R. Pilate, and two other males at Algonquin. Illinois, by Dr. Nason.
