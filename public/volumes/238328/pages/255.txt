matter of quarantine, fumigation and general inspection to the legal and

it is being inspected for duties by Federal authority."

hand bags, boxes, etc., coming over the International line and have to resort
to the subterfuge even at San Francisco, of looking over the shoulder (by
tolerance or consent) of the customs officers."
