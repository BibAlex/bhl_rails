and inconspicuously pubescent. Antennae inserted above base of cones, slightly
without.
Thorax arched, punctate. Pronotum quite short, depressed below dor-
sulum and head ; dorsulum quite strongly ascending, with a brownish spot
on each side of median line anteriorly ; roundly pointed at anterior margin.
Wings hyaline, about two and one-third times as long as broad, broadest
across first marginal cell, round and very slightly angulated apically ; radius
somewhat flexed midway, fully as long as second cubital ; first furcal very
short : venation inconspicuous.
Male.— Abdomen slender; dorsal segmental plates very short, reaching
about to middle of third ventral segment ; anal end of abdomen dorsally con-
cave. Genital segment moderately large, semi-erect ; claspers quite long,
simple, laterally opposed, recurved at tips ; anal projection long, spatulate when
viewed from the side, anterior margin longer than posterior ; upper margin
with several conspicuous hairs ; pubescence sparse.
Described from three males taken by C. F. Baker at Claremont, Cali-
fornia (mountains).

(Figs. 128 P; 129 G; 130 O.)
Length of body, 2.2 mm. ; length of forewing, 3.3 mm. ; greatest width,
1.2 mm. ; width of vertex between eyes, .44 mm. ; with eyes, .71 mm. General
color, orange yellow, abdomen whitish ventrally, antennse and legs light
colored.
Head somewhat deflexed, with eyes not quite as broad as thorax, very
finely punctate ; posterior margin of vertex arcuate, narrowly elevated, not
emarginate at median suture ; discal area with an oblique and diverging de-
pression on each side extending from near median suture posteriorly toward
insertion of antennae : vertex scarcely emarginate anteriorly at median suture,
distinctly overhanging and concealing anterior ocellus when viewed from
above. Facial cones rather short, subacute, only slightly divergent, sub-
vertical and not visible from above, darker than vertex, very sparsely pube-
scent. Antennse inserted between lower margin of eye and base of facial
cone, a trifle within ; two basal segments large as usual in genus, the re-
maining segments slender, filiform.
Thorax arched, finely punctate. Pronotum moderately short, depressed
below dorsulum and head ; dorsulum quite heavy, ascending to scutum, about
equal to scutum, in length, roundly pointed anteriorly. Wings hyaline, except
lower margin bordered with brown stripe extending through marginal cells
and from anal angle to apex of wing ; a little less than three times as long as
broad, broadest across first furcal ; somewhat angulate on radial margin
apically, quite acute ; radius distinctly shorter than second cubital.
Female. — Abdomen quite stout. Genital segment very short, scarcely
longer than anal segment ; dorsal plate slightly overreaching ventral, arched
dorsally; both plates with short, acute, beak-like projection apically; posterior
dorsal surface of anal segment concave, with genital pore partially concealed
