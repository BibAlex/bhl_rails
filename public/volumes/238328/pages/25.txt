propagated. These settled usually (Figure 10) along the midrib of the dorsal
and ventral surfaces of the leaf. At an early stage, a week after birth,
the young began to secrete honey-dew in considerable quantities, and also
numbers of very delicate waxy filaments. Along these latter the subsequent
honey-dev/ passes and collects at the tips in the form of clear transparent
globules. The wax filaments vary from a half inch to three inches in length,
and are so frail that the slightest disturbance of any kind would detach them,
and yet they are able to support quite a large drop of honey-dew. Upon the
Figure lO. Young Icerya purchasi on orange leaf
dorsal surface of the leaves these filaments extend in a very confused state,
same appearing to be independent of the large globules of honey-dew shown
in the accompanying cut. The confusion is due to the fact that the filaments
not being able to hang down as they are excreted, drop over and are shoved
along the surface of the leaf. The honey-dew, passing out along these fila-
ments, collects in the large transparent globules shown in the figure. Those
globules isolated, are so, simply because the delicate waxy threads have been
blown away.
Such a state of affairs cannot exist in open air because of the disturbances
in the trees caused by wind, for even the slightest breath will blow them all
away.
