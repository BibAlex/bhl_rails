This species undoubtedly belongs in the genus Phyllothrips, being closely
related to P. aspcrsus Hinds, and to P. citricornis Hood, but differs from the
generic description as given by Mr. Hood, in the following points ; Head
narrowed anteriorly instead of posteriorly. Mouth cone very blunt, reaching
to middle of prothorax. Fore-tarsi in both sexes with small tooth. It, how-
ever, shows abundant evidence of the closest relationship to the other species
of Phyllothrips, even in minor details.
Phyllothrips fasciculata var. stenoceps, n. var.
The specimens of this variety ( Fig. 48 H ) resemble the species fascicu-
lata in almost every respect, but differ in the following: the insect is some-
what smaller, and the head converges distinctly posteriorly instead of ante-
riorly. The specimens were taken among specimens of P. fasciculata. The
existence of this variety shows that the form of the head does not furnish in
this genus a character of even certain specific value.
