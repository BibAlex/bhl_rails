POMONA COLLEGE JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY
Subscription price, $1.00 to domestic and $1.25 to foreign postal countries.
Reprints of any of the articles can be obtained at a nominal price.
The pages of the Journal are open especially to West American entomol-
ogists, but also general taxonomic papers from any source will be welcome.
Especially is this Journal offered in exchange for all entomological and
zoological journals, and proceedings, transactions, and reports of societies, mu-
seums, laboratories, and expeditions. The separates are likewise offered in
exchange for other entomological and zoological separates.
During 1909 the existence of the Journal was credited to the support of
the Ontario-Cucamonga Citrus Association. It is to be noted, however, with
due appreciation, that one member of that Exchange, Mr. A. P. Harwood,
was the donor of one-half of the amount from that source. During 1910, the
Journal is pleased to acknowledge a wider support, now including the Ontario-
Cucamonga Exchange, with Mr. A. P. Harwood, The San Antonio Fruit Ex-
change, The A. C. G. Emit Exchange, and The Covina Fruit Exchange.
