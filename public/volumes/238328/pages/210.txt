A PHYTOPTID GALL ON ARTEMISIA 281
This mite causes a white or pinkish swelHng on one side of the leaf of
Artemisia calif ornica. At the infected point the leaf is often bent or some-
times sharply folded. The gall is composed of a woolly mass of tangled fibres
and stands out from two to four times the thickness of the leaf. The general
shape of the gall is indefinite, several gall areas often running together.
Very abundant at Claremont, California, on Artemisia calif ornica.
This species appears to be entirely distinct from the Eriophyes artemisiae
Can., of Europe.
A NEW SPIDER
BY KARL R. COOLIDGE
Epeira labyrinthea griunelli n. var.
Differs from the typical form, in the decidedly increased size, in the
coloration being more pronounced on the head, cephalothorax and abdomen^
the bands of the legs, particularly on the femora, are wider and heavier ; the
abdomen is wider and more pointed apically, more rounded basally, forming
an inverted cone, at the apex of which well underneath are the spinnerets.
Habitat — Specimens from Palo Alto, Santa Clara County ; Pasadena,
Los Angeles County; Lompoc, Santa Barbara County. £. labyrinthea
Hentz ranges throughout the entire United States, and south through
Mexico and Central America into the northern parts of South America.
It also occurs commonly in the Barbadoes and West Indies. As McCook
has previously noted and figured (Amer. Spid., vol. 3, pi. VII, Figs.
12, 12a, 1893), Pacific Coast and tropical representatives differ considerably
from those of the Atlantic seaboard, and are, I believe, worthy of good
subspecific rank, to which I have above given the name grinnelli, for my friend
Mr. Fordyce Grinnell, Jr., of Pasadena, California.
