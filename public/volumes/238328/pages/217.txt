POMONA COLLEGE
"Our Tribute to Christian Civilization"
One of the best located, and best housed and outfitted Colleges on the West
Coast, with a very full corps of unusually enthusiastic and energetic professors,
and a large and very vigorous student body. The laboratories in Biology,
Chemistry, Physics and Astronomy are splendidly equipped, and such as any
college might be thoroughly proud of. Oflfers full Literary, Classical, and
Scientific courses. Possesses well-manned schools of Music and Art, and offers
exceptional facilities in Library and Athletics. The College should be judged
by its output â€” Pomona has been very proud of hers.
Claremont is admittedly at the center of one of the most salubrious, beauti-
fully located and desirable residence districts in California.
