POMONA COLLEGE JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY
Beginning now as a quarterly, it is hoped next year to make this journal bi-
monthly. In both cases the subscription price will be the same, $1.00 to domestic
and $1.25 to foreign postal countries. Reprints of any of the articles can be
obtained at a nominal price.
The pages of the journal are open especially to West American entomologists,
but also general taxonomic papers from any source will be welcome.
Especially is this journal offered in exchange for all entomological and
zoological journals, and proceedings, transactions, and reports of societies, mu-
seums, laboratories, and expeditions. The separates are likewise offered in ex-
change for other entomological and zoological separates.
