Outfit B.
This contract covered 15 acres, and the grower paid for the materiahs
separately, the contractor merely doing the work of fumigating. The entire
bill to the grower was ;
529 pounds cyanide at .255 $134.90
870 pounds acid at .02 17.40
35 hours service of estimator at .40 14.00
1436 trees, tenting, at .08 114.88
or a total of $281.18.
The actual cost to the fumigator in this case was,
35 hours with five men at .30 $52.50
35 hours with 1 man at .40 14.00
or a total cost of $66.50. Subtracting this from the entire amount paid for
the application ($114.88), we have $48.38, the profit to the fumigator. The
tents in this case were left on one hour.
Outfit C.
In the case under observation this outfit was working on a contract
covering 21 acres. The entire cost was as follows :
837 pounds cyanide at .255 $213.44
1800 pounds acid at .02 36.00
100 trees, tented, at .065 6.50
1980 trees, tented, at .08 158.40
50.5 hours estimator, at .40 20.20
or a total of $434.54. The cost to the fumigator was as follows :
5 men for 503^2 hours at .30
1 man for SOj^ hours at .45, together $98.50
Subtracting this from $164.90 gives the actual profit to the fumigator as
$66.60 for his 50yi hours' work. The tents in this case were left over the
trees forty-five minutes. Formula same as in B.
One of the above outfits which used an exposure of but forty-five min-
utes, required 30 to 35 minutes to throw the tents over a row of 35 to 40
trees, giving a rest of 10 to 15 minutes on each row during which time all
were idle, excepting the one man who fills the water tank. In another
outfit, however, where the trees were larger and the rows longer, even though
the tents were left on for one hour, the gang had comparatively no time to
waste. In this latter outfit there were only four men, and they were doing
the - I'k of six or seven in other orchards. These men worked for 30 cents
per hour for ordinary help and 40 cents for foreman, so there was practically
a saving of 60 cents per hour over other outfits, the work being practically
all done by hand, one team serving several outfits for moving, etc.
Since the earliest days of fumigating the ordinary contract in this region
has covered both materials and labor, so that there are many opportunities
for shortcomings on the part of the fumigator, he thereby realizing a greater
profit for his effort. Without the control of fumigating by either the County
or by the Exchanges, the partial contract covering only the labor is by
