COOK. THE RED SCALE
can plan to fight them, while they are all young and more easily killed In
our warm climate, this regularity is likely to disappear. Other scale insects,
like the red, the yellow and the soft brown, are ovoviviparous, that is. no eggs
are ever laid, but the insects are born alive, and are active at once. We are
likely to find these in all stages of growth and development at any day or week
of the year. Of course, this makes their destruction the more difficult.
NATIVITY OF THE RED SC.XLE.
China has been claimed as the original habitat of the red scale. This may
or may not be true. The fact, however, as we shall see, that it feeds on a
great variety of food plants, has resulted in its being spread all over the
earth, so that now it is found on all continents, in New Zealand, Hawaii, and
many other islands. This fact is important, as it makes their introduction into

new localities more easy and probable. We are not surprised then to learn that
this pernicious scale is in every county of Southern California. Localities, like
Claremont, that are free from its ravages, should spare no effort to keep it
out; those not so fortunate, should, for self-interest and good of neighbors
alike, be equally active to exterminate the pest in their orchards. Of course,
this is very difficult, when the insects have become thoroughly distributed.
DESCRIPTION AND LIFE HISTORY.
The scale of this species is very minute, hardly larger than a small pin-
head, approximately circular if covering the female, and slightly elongate, in
the male. It is sufficiently transparent to show the insect beneath, and so, at
