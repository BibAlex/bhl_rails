432 PHYTOLOGIA volume 6Q(6):428-435 December 1990
Perennial subscapose herbs 25-35 cm bigh. Stems mostly single to each
rosette, arising from a tuft of dirty white or white hairs, unbranched below,
any stem leaves reduced to short hnear bracts. Leaves mostly 5-18 cm long;
petioles 1-8 cm long; blades runcinately lobed to rhomboid triangular, glabrous
or nearly so. Heads mostly 2-10 to each scape, borne in erect terminal cymes,
the ultimate peduncles mostly 1-3 cm long, both glandular pubescent and
white flocculose just below the heads. Involucres campanulate, 3-4 seriate, the
involucral bracts 21-34, the middle and inner series subequal, 11-13 mm long,
dark green and densely pubescent with mostly black glandular hairs 1-2 mm
long. Florets 50-80 per head, the corollas yellow, 13-15 mm long, the sinuses
between the terminal lobes up to 2 mm deep. Achenes immature, the pappus
bristles numerous, white, 7-8 mm long. Chromosome number, n — 9 pairs.
ADDIT10N.\L SPECIMENS EXAMINED (Paratypes): MEXICO. Oax-
aca: Cerro Quiexobra, timberline vegetation in open glades along ridges and in
mountain saddles, dominated below by pine forest, occasional in rock crevices
on exposed cliffs, SE exposure, 3650-3800 m, 10 Dec 1989, McDonald 2950
(MEXU, TEX); between La Cienegilla and San Gregorio Ozolotepec (ca. 16°
08' N, 96° 20' W) cloud forest dominated by pines, Clethra, and Quercus,
2500-3000 m, on red soil on steep slope, 12 Dec 1989, McDonald 2963 {MEXU,
TEX).
In their original description of Hieracium. macdonaldii, Beaman & Turner
cited all of the above specimens, except for the type of the presently described
var. quiexohranum. At the time, both authors took these to be but high ele-
vational phases of a single variable taxon. Restudy of all the specimens con-
cerned, plus the additional (type) collection obtained after publication of H.
m.acdonaldii, has convinced its junior author that the typical var. macdonaldii
is markedly different from what I have described here as var. quiexohranum..
The latter appears to be largely centered on Cerro Quiexobra at elevations
from 3500-3800 m, and differs from var. -macdonaldit by numerous quantita-
tive characters of the capitulum, including involucral bract numbers (21-34 vs.
13-17), involucre height (10-14 mm high vs. 7-8 mm), floret number (50-80 per
head vs. 25-40), pappus length (7-8 mm long vs. 3-5 mm), to say no- thing
of the marked habital and branching differences. Indeed, were it not for the
im.mature, somewhat aberrant collection, McDonald 2963, which superficially
appears somewhat intermediate between the two varieties, I would not hesi-
tate to call the two taxa distinct species; certainly they are as morphologically
distinct as many another species pair recognized by Beaman (1990) in his ex-
ceptional treatment of the group in Mexico. The peculiar leaves of the two
taxa are very similar, however, and their close geographical proximit}' (Figure
4) strongly suggest that the two are closely related phyletically. But perhaps
not more so than the var. quiexohranum. is to H. hintomi Beaman, as might
be inferred from the original description of H. macdonaldii in which it is com-
pared with H. hinionii. Actually, type material of H. macdonaldii only faintly
