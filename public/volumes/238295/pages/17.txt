430 PHYTOLOGIA volume 69(6):428-435 December 1990
Perennial herbs 20-50 cm high, the flowering scapes arising out of a moder-
ate tuft of long rusty brown hairs. Stems weak and arcuate, sparsely to mod-
erately pilose, especially below, with very long hairs (mostly 5-9 mm long).
Basal leaves mostly 8-25 cm long, 2-3 cm wide; petioles 1-8 cm long; blades
lanceolate to oblanceolate, glabrous above, sparsely pilose below, especially
along the mid ribs and major veins, the margins remotely serrulate. Stem
leaves 3-6, similar to the basal leaves, but mostly sessile and cordate-clasping.
Heads 1-15 to a stem, arranged in rather open cymes, the ultimate bracteolate
peduncles 1-5 cm long, both tomentulose and glandular pubescent. Involucres
campanulate, 2-3 seriate, the bracts ca. 21, mostly subequal, the inner series
8-10 mm long, moderately glandular pubescent. Florets 30-60 per head, the
coroUas yellow, ca. 15 mm long, sparsely pilose, the ligule deeply lobed at the
apices, the sinuses to 4 mm deep. Achenes (immature), glabrous, the pappus
of numerous tawny bristles 4-5 mm long.
ADDITIONAL SPECIMENS EXAMINED (Paratypes): MEXICO. Ver-
acruz: Mpio. Huayacocotla, between Ocotes and Agua de la Calabaza, 14 km
NE of Huayacocotla (20째 36' N, 98째 28' W), ca. 1650 m, 23 Apr 1981, Juarez
& Vasquez 50 (TEX, XAL). Mpio. Tonayan, higher parts of the Sierra de la
Magdalina, pine-oak forest, ca. 2500 m, Jun 1981, M. Chazaro B. 155^ (XAL).
Beaman (1990) did not account for any of the above cited specimens in his
treatment of Hieracium of Mexico, although he did examine the type material
and the Juarez & \'asquez collection. He annotated both of the sheets con-
cerned with yellow note tabs, as follows, "May be a new species but someone
else is welcome to it." ( Tenorio L. 8681 - dated 5 May 1990) and "I leave this
and Tenorio L. 8681 for BLT to describe as a new species." [Juarez G. - dated
5 May 1990). I have taken on that responsibility here, and take pleasure asso-
ciating my name with his in the creation of the appellation concerned. John
Beaman is a sound scholar, very dedicated systematist and, more important
to me, an exceptionally fine person, fully deserving of the recognition accorded
here.
