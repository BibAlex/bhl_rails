what plant systematists do and the importance of the work of plant system-

many events (including some of the dangers) that can occur during field work
(many humorous, some not so humorous). Many illustrations (both color, and
black and white) are interspersed with the text. These illustrations include
photographs of plants, scenic views, and maps, and are useful in conveying
information difficult to explain in the text.
