ABSTRACT
Solidago petiolaris Ait., a species of the central and eastern United
States and north central Mexico, is considered here to be variable but
without formally recognized infraspecific taxa. Solidago buckleyi Torr.
& A. Gray, which has sometimes been considered a synonym of S. peti-
olaris, is provisionally maintained as a distinct species. Solidago ori-
entalis comb. nov. of northeastern Mexico is recognized at the specific
rank, apparently most closely related to the more western 5. wnghtii A.
Gray. These last two, in turn, as well as 5. hinioniorum Nesom, an en-
demic of the eastern Sierra Madre of Mexico, are most closely related to
S. petiolaris. A key distinguishes S. petiolaris and the Mexican species
centered around it.

Solidago petiolaris Ait. has been considered to comprise several infraspecific
taxa, although there has been no general agreement regarding their status. The
species, in turn, is part of a larger group from the United States and Mexico
united by the common production of cylindric capitulescences, relatively large
heads and ray flowers, glabrous or glabrate achenes, and uninerved, epetiolate
to short petiolate leaves that are only slightly reduced in size upwards. The
present study first considers the taxonomy of S. petiolaris and then the status
of the Mexican taxa related to it.
I. TAXONOMY OF SOLIDAGO PETIOLARIS
Solidago petiolaris is recognized here as a variable species including as syn-
onyms a number of varieties and species. It is distributed from central Texas to
445
