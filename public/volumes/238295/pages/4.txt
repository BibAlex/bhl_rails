ABSTRACT
A previously undescribed cultivated variety of diili-pepper ( Cap-
sicum chinense Jacq.) is recognized as "Datil." It is the only variety
of C. chinense commercially cultivated in the United States. Datil is
most similar in fruit morphologj' to the Habauero pepper (also C. chi-
nense), from which it perhaps was derived. It has been cultivated for
at least 100 years in Florida, where its characteristics apparently have
been selected.
KEY WORDS: Capsicum, Solanaceae, cultivar
In my continued sampling and exploration of the variation among domes-
ticated peppers (Andrews 1984), a distinctive variety of Capsicum chinense
Jacq., has come to my attention. It apparently is restricted to Florida, where
it has been cultivated for probably more than a century, and I can find no
mention in the literature of this pepper. It is formally provided here with a
name, adopted from the name informally applied to it by the local growers.
