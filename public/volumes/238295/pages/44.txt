Melcbert: Bidtns cohmana, new species from Mexico 463
style branches yellow, exserted. Achenes unknown, but apparently 2 awned
(i.e., 2 yellow awns protruding among the outer disc florets at early anthesis,
these ca. 4 mm long, retrorsely barbed).
ADDITIONAL SPECIMEN EXAMINED: MEXICO. Jalisco: Upper slopes
of Cerro Tequila, occasional on steep mountain sides in mature oak forest with
many epiphytes, 2400-2800 m, 14 Sep 1967, R. McVaugh 23910 (MICH!).
The Cerro Tequila plant hsted above differs from the type as follows: stems
totally sprawling, radiating from a seemingly vertical rhizome (root system
not present on the Volcan Colima plant); leaves deeply bipinnatisect, most
3-5 cm long, 2-4 cm wide, the segments with scattered pubescence below,
particularly on the midrib, terminal segments of midcauline leaves narrowly
lanceolate, mostly 3-4 mm wide; outer involucral bracts 10-14, mostly 5-7 mm
long, somewhat exceeding the inner involucre in the bud stage, outer surface
with short hairs on the dark midnerve; inner involucral bracts rosaceous, their
tips yellow-pubescent; pappus awns of outer disc florets 3.0-3.8 mm long at
anthesis.
This specimen superficially resembles the very common weed, Bidens odor-
ata (white rays and bipinnatisect leaves), but the latter is annual and has
sharply tetragonal stems.
