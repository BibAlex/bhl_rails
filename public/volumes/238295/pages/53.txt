population of another morphotype of C. vindis. Several other examples of C.
vindis with slender spines have been seen in DeWitt, Burleson, and Dallas
counties but are not detailed here. We only wish to make the point that such
spines, though not common, sometimes occur in C. vindis. However, none of
these examples produce the quantity of spines seen in C. deseriorum.
As is the case with so many other hawthorns, the most appropriate taxo-
nomic rank of Crataegus deseriorum is arguable. The plants of C. deseriorum
from Uvalde and Bandera counties are apparently disjunct from the remainder
of C. viridis and morphologically distinct from it in their consistent production
of numerous spines. However, because spines are encountered in C. viridis, and
because we can find no other consistent morphological character to separate
the two taxa, we feel that C. deseriorum is best considered a locaHzed variant
of C. viridis as formally designated below.
Crataegus viridis L. var. desertorum (Sarg.) Keeney k Enquist, siai. ei
comb. nov. (Figure 1). BASIONYM: Crataegus desertorum Sarg., J.
Arnold Arb. 3:187-188. 1922. HOLOTYPE: U.S.A. Texas: Uvalde
County, Uvalde, 17 June 1917, E.J. Palmer 12279 (GH!; Isotype: GH!).
The holotype bears the word "Type" written in script (presumably
by Sargent), but the sheet is numbered 12279 rather than 12379 as cited
in the original protologue, and as noted in the annotation by David
BoufTord. The duplicate bears no annotation by Sargent.
