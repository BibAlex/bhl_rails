Solidago hinioniorum Nesom, which is partiaUy sympatric with S. onen-
talis and very similar to it in habit, is also closely related to 5. peiiolaris but
distinctive in its complete lack of glands and its sparse, loosely villous vesti-
ture. The following key updates one presented in an earher discussion of S.
peiiolaris and Mexican relatives (Nesom 1989).
KEY TO THE MEXICAN SPECIES OF THE SOLIDAGO PETIOLARIS
GROUP
1. Capitulescence a terminal corymb usually as wide as long or an open
paniculate cluster of similar corymbs; leaves mostly entire; achenes con-
sistently strigose S. wrightii
V Capitulescence cylindric; leaves prominently toothed to subentire or entire;
achenes sparsely strigose or glabrous (2)
2. Plants completely eglandular; stems sparsely villous with loose,
spreading hairs 0.5-1.0 mm long; phyUaries (l-)3(-5) veined; leaves
toothed; achenes strigose 5. hintomorum
2' At least the phyUaries viscid with stipitate to minutely granular
glands, the upper stems and leaves glandular or densely puberu-
lent with upcurved hairs mostly less than 0.1 mm long; phyUaries
l(-3) veined; leaves toothed to entire; achenes strigose or glabrous
(3)
3. Upper stems densely stipitate glandular, sometimes with a mixture of
dense glands and sparse, erect, nonglandular hairs, the upper leaves
and phyUaries usuaUy minutely glandular as well; leaves prominently
toothed; achenes usuaUy sparsely strigose, sometimes glabrous
S. orientatis
3' Upper stems densely short puberulent and eglandular, less commonly
minutely glandular immediately beneath the heads, the leaves eglan-
dular but the phyUaries minutely granular or stipitate glandular; leaves
entire to toothed; achenes glabrous or less commonly sparsely strigose
S. peiiolaris
