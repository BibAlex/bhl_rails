The size and intensity of the diagnostic spot on the ligule varies consider-
ably within single populations. Although most individuals in the population
sampled by Melchert, et al. [67-131, 71-222) displayed a very conspicuous an-
thocyanin spot at the center of each ligule (Figure 2), in a few individuals, this
spot was either reduced to a mere trace or absent entirely (Figure 2). Iden-
tification of such "atypical" specimens poses no problem however, because no
other terete stemmed, yellow rayed, annual Bidens has copiously (nearly sil-
ver) pubescent outer involucral bracts or terminally truncated, deeply notched
ligules.
As is common in many species of Bidens, the leaves of B. ocellatus are
highly heteromorphic. Within single populations, some plants have 3-5 partite
leaves with lance-ovate segments, while others (usually the vast majority) have
2-3 pinnatisect leaves with narrower divisions. The two varieties recognized
by Sherff (1955) are clearly only leaf forms of a single species.
According to Pringle's field notes, the type specimen of Cosmos ocellatus
(Pringle 8386) was collected 14 Oct 1900 on Sierra Tepoxtlan in the state of
Morelos (Davis 1936). Unfortunately, the label on the type specimen erro-
neously lists this site as being in Guerrero; and, in the original description of
this species, Greenman (1905) gives the collection date as 4 Oct 1900 (not 14
Oct 1900, as correctly noted on the label).
