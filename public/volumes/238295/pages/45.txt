ABSTRACT
Information gained from a detailed comparative morphometric in-
vestigation of the liverwort Haplomitnum Nees, has led to a re-evaluation
of its phylogenetic alliances and the creation of a new subclass, the Met-
zgeriidae, to contain the orders Haplomitriales and Metzgeriales. This
subclass, as circumscribed by Bartholomew-Began (1990), is herein val-
idated.
KEY WORDS: Haplomitrium, Metzgeriidae, Hepatophyta
DISCUSSION
The placement of Haplomitrium Nees above tlie ordinal rank has varied
with the changing phylogenetic concepts regarding the origin of bryophyte
groups. However, the classification of Haplomitnum has consistently reflected
the belief that it is an ancient, isolated taxon with only remote affinities to
other groups. Stotler &: Crandall-Stotler (1977), who viewed the bryophytes
as a polyphyletic group, placed Haplom.ilrium^ with Takakia Hatt. &c Inoue, in
the class Haplomitriopsida of the division Hepatophyta, coordinate with the
Jungermanniopsida (comprising the Metzgeriales and Jungermanniales), and
the Marchantiopsida. In contrast, Schuster (1984), considered the hepatics
as a class of the division Bryophyta. He rejected the organization presented
by Stotler & Crandall-Stotler (1977) in favor of a system in which the hepatic
