ABSTRACT
Crataegus desertorum. Sargent, previously known only from historic
collections, has recently been rediscovered in Bandera and Uvalde coun-
ties in Texas. Its habitat is described and it is reduced in rank to
Crataegus viridis L. var. desertorum comb. nov.
KEY WORDS: Crataegus, Rosaceae, United States, Texas, new
combination
INTRODUCTION
In 1917 and 1918, E.J. Palmer collected a spiny hawthorn of the series
Virides in the city of Uvalde, Texas. A few years later, C.S. Sargent described
it as a new species, Crataegus desertorum Sargent (Sargent 1922). In May
of 1919, Palmer revisited the type locahty and collected additional specimens,
but we do not know if these have been mounted and distributed. To our knowl-
edge, the taxon was not again seen or collected after 1919 except for the very
recent collections discussed below. In later years, the species was apparently
reduced in taxonomic rank to that of a form, as Vines (1960) referred to it as
"C glabriuscula f. desertorum Sargent." In view of new evidence presented
here, the authors feel it is appropriate to revise the taxonomic status of C.
desertorum.
