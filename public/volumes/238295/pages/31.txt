soulheastern Colorado, north to Nebrabka. Missouri, and Illinois, and eastward
to North Carolina and Florida (Map 1). A series of disjunct populations in
the Sierra del Carmen, Sierra de Jardin, and Sierra de la Encantada of north-
eastern Coahuila, Mexico, are not distinguishable from the closest conspecific
populations in Texas.
Among all its closest relatives, Solidago petiolaris is distinctive in its lack
of persistent basal leaves, the cauline leaves mostly even sized upwards along
the stem, and particularly in its glandular phyllaries, which are almost alwaj's
at least slightly viscid with granular or minutely stipitale glands. Sometimes
such glands can be found only along the phyllary margins, but their presence
may be taken as evidence of the identity of these plants as 5. petiolaris. The
nomenclature of 5. petiolaris is presented below with comments following on
variability and differing opinions regarding its taxonomic treatment.

Plants of two other collections (NY!) by Hale from Alexandria have
broader leaves and were tentatively identified (by Torrey?) as "5.

cited a collection by Engelmann made near Hot Springs, .Arkansas.
