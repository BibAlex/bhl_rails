Turner: New species of Hieracium from Mexico 435
resembles H. hintomi, but all of the collections of var. quiexobranum strongly
resemble H. hintomi, especially in characters of the involucre. Unfortunately,
mature achenes of var. quiexobranum are not available, but it seems clear to
me that the achenes are likely to be larger (up to 4.5 mm long as in H. hintomi,
vs. ca. 2-3 mm long in var. macdonaldii) with longer pappus bristles.
Hieracium macdonaldii var. quiexobranum might with equal validity be
treated as a localized endemic species of near alpine elevations. As noted
above, I do not view McDonald 2963, which was collected between 2500-3000
m, as intermediate between var. quiexobranum and var. macdonaldii. I can
only justify the varietal rank conferred upon the present taxon as reflecting
my desire to caU attention to our conservative treatment in the first place,
but also to put on record my personcJ feeling that the taxa concerned might
ultimately prove worthy of specific rank.
In addition to the above, the following new combination is made for my
forthcoming treatment of Hieracium for the Asteraceae of Mexico (Turner
& Nesom, in prep.), all recognizable morphogeographic taxa being accorded
varietal rank.
Hieracium fendleri Schultz-Bip. var. ostreophyllum (Standi, h Steyerm.)
