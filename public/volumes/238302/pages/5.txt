2 PHYTOLOGIA Vol. 62, No. 1
In the northern part of the range of Ophioqiossum
petiolatum , it is most commonly found near buildings (such
as churches and schools) along the south wall where it grows
with mosses in the moist sand where the water from the roof
hits the ground. This is the most common habitat in Arkansas,
Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, and Mississippi. It occurs
in wet lawns, wet pastures, and wet spots in cemeteries
in Texas and Louisiana and east to the Atlantic. In Florida
it is abundant in shallow, sloped, mown ditches along most
roads. It is extremely abundant in wet sand along the edge
of Mobile Bay in Alabama. In coastal areas of the Carolines
it is common in lawns and near buildings. In Georgia the
most common habitat seems to be along streams under bridges.
In southern Louisiana (St. Mary and Assumption parishes)
it grows with Psilotum nudum on the low levies in bottomland
hardwood forests. This fern is also weedy when grown under
greenhouse conditions.
