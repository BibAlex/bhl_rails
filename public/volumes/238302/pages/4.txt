Stalked adders-tongue ( Ophioglossum petiolatum Hooker)
was first collected in the United States from Florida in 1935
(Wherry 1964). It was collected from Jefferson County, Texas
in 1937 (Thomas 1979). It is now distributed from Wink County,
Texas (Correll 1956) and McCurtain County, Oklahoma (Thomas
1978a) through Louisiana and Arkansas (Thomas 1978b) north
to the bootheel of Missouri (Thomas, Marx, and Lawson 1974),
east through Mississippi (Thomas and Rogers 1973}, Alabama,
Florida, Georgia, and north near the coast through South
Carolina, North Carolina (Thomas and Marx 1979), and now
in Virginia.
The first collection of Ophioglossum petiolatum from
Virginia was made by two of the authors in 1979. The citation
is: Virginia Beach, Virginia; lawn of Tabernacle United
Methodist Church west of Sandbridge Beach and southeast of
Norfolk; R. Dale Thomas, P. Pias (now Cox), R. Twyman, and
D. Dixon RDT 62948 & PP 4020 . 1 April 1979. This west sandy
lawn contained ten or so plants just emerging from the ground.
The site was revisited on April 24, 1983 by Thomas and three
of his graduate students (D. Moore, K. Gandhi, and D. Taylor).
About ten plants were located at that time ( RDT 83270 ).
The first collection was too early for most of the mater-
ial to be big enough to be noticed. The second trip was
after a yery dry season and again was not under ideal conditions.
This species was searched for throughout the area during the
1983 foray but no other specimens were found. Perhaps if
one could look for it throughout several seasons, one might
find it to be more abundant than it now seems. This species
is usually present in fertile conditions during any warm
month after several days of wet weather. This could be the
extreme northeast edge of the range of this species but it
is more likely that it is more abundant than the two col-
lections indicate. The limitations of time and expenses
have made it impossible for the authors to check further
into this edge of the range. The authors think it is possible
that this species might be found sometime in coastal Maryland,
southern Illinois, and possibly southern Tennessee.
