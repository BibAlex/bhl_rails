154 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
the neglect of grubbing up the stumps and roots in places where
it does not pay to utilise them as fuel, have all contributed to
favour in a great degree the numerical increase of this most
dangerous insect. Other calamities, too, to which the forests have
from time to time been exposed, as, for instance, extensive throwing
of timber by storms and breakage from heavy snowfall, have had
an injurious influence ; for it is often impossible to get rid of the
enormous masses of stumps and root-timber, despite the fact that
they offer the most favourable breeding-places for the reproduction
of this insect.
But in face of such possible danger, it is all the more the duty
of the forester and the sylviculturist to do everything that lies in
their power to hinder and prevent the reproduction of the rostral
beetle. The safest of all means lies, of course, in the careful
grubbing up and disposal of all stumps and roots as fuel, for
where this can be carried out there is little danger of complaints
being heard about its prevalence. Felling of the timber in the
pan that is, felling it by cutting through the main roots with the
axe, and not in such manner with axe and saw as will leave a
stump protruding above the soil is not of itself sufficient, as even
then too many thick roots remain in the ground.
Where only small numbers of these beetles are still noticeable,
the time at which the grubbing up of the stumps and roots may
take place is a matter of comparative indifference ; but when they
already occur in large numbers, the stumps can be utilised as
decoy places, and grubbing out had best be seen to during the
later half of summer, after the bulk of the ova have been deposited,
or, if more convenient, can be arranged for early in the following
spring. Where it can conveniently take place, the utilisation of
the land for agricultural purposes for a year or two is an excellent
means of obviating attacks from this beetle, for it necessitates the
clearance of the stumps ; but unfortunately it is impracticable on
any ex tensive 'scale.
In order to obviate danger to young plantations, it is better to
let the soil lie fallow for one, or still better for two years after a
clear fall of mature timber has been made ; for if the fall be at
once planted up, both breeding-places and feeding-grounds are
conveniently afforded to the beetle on the same area, whilst the
injurious effects are all the more marked if it has not been possible
to grub up the stumps in anything like a complete manne
