56 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
species of Willows, are also suitable for cultivation. As a timber
crop simply and solely for the protection of the soil, and in
particular for the formation of protective belts along the coast of
the Baltic sea, satisfactory results have during the last few years
been attained by the cultivation of the Mountain Pine (Pinus
montana), which is the more especially suited for such an object
on account of the lower branches, that are longer than the upper
ones, not dying off but remaining alive down to the very ground.
Planting is certainly the safest means of effecting the formation
of woodlands on shifting sand, and has now everywhere taken the
place of the former method of sowing which was apt to be uncer-
tain in its results. For very apparent reasons, strong transplants
are preferable to small seedlings, and transplants of Scots Pine,
with balls of earth attached to the roots, preferable to one or two-
year-old naked seedlings or transplants. But as in such sandy
districts plants retaining balls of earth around the roots are
not often obtainable, one is not infrequently compelled to make
use of naked transplants ; these should be made to develop as deep
roots as possible in the nursery, and be planted out somewhat
closely. When Poplars or Willows are utilised for this purpose,
they are put out as poles or strong layers.
All young plantations should be frequently seen to, and blanks
at once carefully filled up, as the plants often die off in very
considerable numbers in dry years ; this matter should receive
proper attention in preference to pushing on the work of recla-
mation further in any hasty or imperfect manner.
