162 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
allowing the female beetles to have the favourable opportunity of
reproduction offered by large vacant areas with loose soil during
years in which large swarms of beetles may be anticipated, or in
other words, by not undertaking extensive cultural operations which
necessitate any extensive soil-preparation ; it is better to adopt the
process of notching-in seedlings into the ground during such
years as far as possible. Where the Scots Pine woods have been
most badly attacked in Northern Germany, a return has been
made to the reproduction of the mature crops under parent
standards; but the results are only partially successful, for
even with light fellings and partial clearances, and often in
fairly well-stocked mature crops, the grubs are frequently to
be found in large numbers.
In forming nurseries, the vicinity of young Oak crops, and of
areas stocked with broad-leaved species generally, should be
avoided, as a flight of beetles almost always comes from these.
The nurseries, whether temporary or permanent, should always
be protected from the entry of grubs by being surrounded by a
trench, whilst the spreading of a frame-work over each bed
may prevent the female from laying her eggs in it. But the
best protection consists in hanging up wooden nesting-boxes for
starlings round about the nursery ; for these birds take very
kindly to such protection, and well repay the cost and trouble
by the effective war they wage against the grubs.
In undertaking annihilative measures against the beetles we
assisted by many of their enemies, such as the hedgehog,
fox, marten, &c., which devour them whilst still in the groui
bats, starlings, crows, rooks, jackdaws, stannel-hawks, sparro\
&c., also destroy them in great numbers whilst swarming and
laying their eggs.
But all these co-operative remedies are practically unavailing
when large swarms occur; hence endeavours should be made to
keep down the numbers of the insects by collecting the beetles from i
trees along the edges of compartments and open spaces, particu-
larly from the lower branches, and from any oak-coppices in
the vicinity. Especially in the early morning, when the beetles
sit loosely on the foliage, they can easily be brought to the
ground by shaking young poles with the hand, or by tapping
or knocking young stems with the padded back of a heavy
axe, or by shaking the branches of larger trees by means of
