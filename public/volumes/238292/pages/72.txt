50 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
the shallower and narrower feeders which lead into the latter, are
regulated by the nature of the soil, and depend mainly on its
greater or less degree of wetness.
The execution of drainage works should be carried out at the
driest time of the year, during late summer or in autumn, work
being begun with the main drain and at the lowest level, and
gradually working upwards towards the higher levels, as other-
wise work would be interfered with by the water descending in
the drains as they were being formed. The earth removed from
the drains and ditches should be thrown out on either side ; for if
merely banked up at the edges, it might easily be washed back
again into the ditches by heavy rain.
When once formed, the ditches must be kept clean and in
good condition as long as necessary, reeds and other aquatic
weeds being cleared away, earth that has been washed in being
dredged out, and any damage to the scarps repaired. It may not
infrequently be observed that areas, which, when unwooded, have
an excessive quantity of moisture, gradually get rid of this
through the crops imbibing larger volumes of water for trans-
piration through the foliage as they grow older, and in such
cases the retention of the drainage ditches has no longer any
object, so that they can be left to choke and fill up.
Open ditches are certainly the cheapest means of drainage for
temporary requirements, but they are easily damaged in
ways by rain, frost, &c., as well as by cattle and by men ; the
are also apt to interfere somewhat with communications, and
especially with the extraction of timber, besides necessitating
frequent outlay for repairs. Instead of such, therefore, covered
drains constructed with stones, fagots, or brushwood, are also
occasionally formed. The ditches dug are, for the most
filled up with fascines or bundles of brushwood on which
layer of moss or turf is laid, and then earth is piled over this ; tl
interstices between the brushwood, which remains undecomposed
for a number of years, form the channels through which the
water percolates, and suffice for a merely moderate and often the
most advantageous degree of drainage.
On account of the greater cost involved, the filling up of tl
drains with stones in place of brushwood takes place 1(
frequently ; it depends for the most part on whether tl
necessary material can be found in the immediate vicinity,
