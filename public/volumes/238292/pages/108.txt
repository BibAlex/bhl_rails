86 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
entirely to superficial injuries on shallow roots, occasioned by the
horny feet of the cattle. When there is any rank, rich growth
of grass in the young hags and falls, the extent of any damage
done to the seedling growth by cattle and sheep is often very
nominal, and is at times more than counterbalanced by the benefit
done in retarding the growth of the grass by grazing off it, and
by crushing and treading it down under foot ; hence, in fact,
cattle and sheep are sometimes driven in, as a cultural measure,
where there is a danger of the young crop suffering through the
rank growth of grass and weeds.
A certain influence is also exerted by the nature of the soil
and situation, for the fresher and the more powerful the soil, the
richer is the growth of grass, and the less likely, consequently,
are the herds to attack the woody-fibrous plants ; the recupera-
tive power of the latter is, at the same time, always greater on
fresh, strong, fertile soil. The damage done on steep slopes by
dislodgement of the soil is often not inconsiderable, whilst, at the
same time, the animals have got a much more favourable oppor-
tunity of feeding on the crowns of the plants growing below
them, than they could possibly have on level or merely gently
sloping ground.
In the method of treatment by selection-fellings here and
there, a system leading to the more or less irregular inter mix tun-
of old trees with young seedling growth over all the area under
woodland, the damage done to tree-growth by grazing is nunv
pronounced, for it is impossible to shut off the hags or falls under-
going natural reproduction, as may easily be done in the case of
high timber forest, where the annual or periodic falls may he
closed against grazing, so as to reduce to a minimum the damage
done to the young crops. And, indeed, the very apparent injury
done by grazing in such irregularly stocked woods has been one
of the reasons for transforming them into growing-stock with a
regular series of annual or periodic crops of equal age, from the
period of their formation up till the time of their maturity.
Coppice- woods not only quickly outgrow the reach of cattle,
owing to the speedy rate of growth of stool-shoots, but, at the
same time, they possess so strong a reproductive power that tin-
damage done is seldom considerable, even when the ha^s are
actually grazed over; in very young coppice-growth, however, some
injury may be done by treading down young shoots, and breaking
