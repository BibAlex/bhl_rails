taking place gradually and imperceptibly, so far as hard and fast
lines of difference are concerned.
The Ova, or eggs, varying greatly in shape, size, and colour, are
sometimes laid singly, sometimes in larger or smaller groups or
nests on the most different portions of trees, and occasionally pro-
tected in some special way, as, for instance, with a covering of
hairy filaments; but in the case of parasitic insects, the eggs aiv
deposited on or in other species. The larva sometimes makes its
appearance from the egg in the course of a few weeks, sometimes
not until months afterwards ; for when ova are deposited during
autumn, they hibernate or pass the winter in that same condition
or stage of development.
For the Larva, several appellations are made use of. Thus the
usually 16-footed larvae of butterflies and moths (only those of
the so-called Spanners Cfeometridce, have 10 feet, whilst a few
mining-larvae Tinddce have none are named caterpillars; the
18 or 22-footed larvae of saw-flies (Tenthredinidce), with a tail-like
extremity, are called tailed caterpillars ; the larvae of most
beetles, partly without feet, partly 6 -footed, are termed larvie
those, however, of the cockchafer species (MelolontJia), gn
whilst the feetless larvae of flies (Diptera), in which the complex
structure of the head is wanting, are known as maggots,
During the larval stage several changes of skin take place.
When full grown, the larva becomes transformed into the pupa
or chrysalis, becoming either a free or sculpt chrysalis, with all
the different portions of the complete insect visibly apparent
externally, as in the case of beetles, or else a masked chrysalis
in the case of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera), in which tin-
various segments and section* are not definitely apparent. The
pupa either lies naked and unprotected on the soil, under Bl-
under the bark, or in its fissures, &c., or else it is woven ini" a
cocoon, often of considerable toughness : in the case of the Dipt<
instead of any cocoon, a sort of bladder or shell is formed by the
last larval skin.
The period of rest during the pupal stage varies greatly, extend-
ing from two to three weeks (as in the case of the very destruci
" Nun," Liparis monacha, for example) up to 6 or 8 months in the
case of hibernating species (e.g., Gastropacha pini), and occasionally
even for years (e.g., Melolontha)\ it is then terminated by tin-
appearance of the Imago or perfect Insect in its complete form
