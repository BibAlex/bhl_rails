38 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
liable to be thrown or broken are grown along with other species
less apt to suffer, as, for example, the growth of Conifers along
with the Beech, or of Spruce along with Silver Fir and Scots Pine.
In particularly exposed localities the growth of species very liable
to danger should be avoided to as great an extent as possible.
Artificial Reproduction, and in the case of the Spruce, clearance
of the annual fall in long, narrow strips, with subsequent artificial
reproduction, in preference to natural regeneration, as the necessary
thinnings and partial clearances both before and after the seed
year would particularly expose the parent standards to danger.
The maintenance of a good protective belt or outer fringe of
hardy, weather-beaten trees, long accustomed to the violence of
storms, until the natural reproduction of the crop sheltered by
it has been completed; or, if necessary, the formation of such
a belt for the protection of young crops of species liable to suffer.
Prudence in regard to the Eetention of Standards, only such being
selected as are of species well capable of resisting the action of
wind, and only stems of sturdy growth, and with well-developed
root-systems. In very exposed localities, or on indifferently pro-
tected areas with light or moist soil, the idea of retaining standards
should be given up, in order to avoid the damage that may subse-
quently ensue to the younger crops, should the standards become
windfall.
Thinnings that are early begun, and repeated whenever ni
sary, exert a beneficial influence by promoting sturdiness of growl
and a good development of the root-system. A careful maintt
ance of dose canopy should be the rule ; all felling operations th{
are likely to interrupt it, and form blanks or holes in it, should
avoided, especially in the case of the evergreen conifers m<
exposed to danger.
Particular influences are also exerted by the proper location
the annual falls, and a judicious succession of the annual crc
which should receive very careful attention at the time of arrang-
ing the Working Plan that is to form the basis of management
1 Denzon, in 1880, recommended for forests on the plain, whose compartments
marked off by regular rides or paths crossing each other at right angles, that
ajx-x of the angle, and not, as hitherto had been the rule, the long side of the c<
I>artment, should be turned towards the west, so that the rides or divisions betwt
the annual compartments should run from north-east to south-west and from nc
west to south-east, in place of from east to west and south to north ; in the former
only two sides of the compartment, those towards the west are endangered, and tl
