DISADVANTAGES ARISING FROM UNFAVOURABLE SOIL AND
SITUATION.
A. EXCESS OF MOISTURE ; WETNESS.
28. Causes of Surplus Moisture in the Soil ; Disadvantages
due to the Same.
Wetness, or excessive moisture in the soil, a condition that
is not infrequently to be met with in woodlands, may be due to
one or other of various causes. It may be caused either in con-
sequence of springs without any proper off-flow channel ; or it may
be due to plastic, clayey, impermeable subsoil hindering and
rendering impossible the percolation towards deeper layers of
the atmospheric precipitations and of the water formed by the
melting of snow on the ground ; or finally it may be the result of
temporary inundations, after the subsidence of which there has
been no suitable means of a portion of the water draining off
again. Stagnation of water in the soil may also be caused by the
undue increase of soil-moisture percolating horizontally from
neighbouring water-channels, or lakes, or ponds in the immediate
vicinity. When there is a high degree of wetness, the soil be-
comes a marsh, log, or swamp.
The vegetation forming the soil- covering offers a ready practical
means of estimating off-hand the amount of superfluous moisture
contained in the soil, and the ruling degree of moisture generally.
The occurrence of Bulrushes (Scirpus) and Eushes (Juncus) already
indicates stagnating moisture, as also the common Wire Bent
or mat grass (Nardus), and the Hair-moss (Polytrichum) ; Sedges
(Carex), Cotton-grass (Eriophorum), and Knot-grass (Polygonum)
show a still higher degree of wetness ; whilst Bog-moss (Sphagnum),
in association with Cranberry and Bog Bilberry (Vaccinium
