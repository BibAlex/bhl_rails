240 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
when there is any steady breeze, the smoke and heat carried out
in front of the fire are generally so strong and inconvenient as to
restrict measures to the sides and flanks in the first instance, after
which gradual efforts must be made to head and stop it.
In this last case, when the breeze is strong and steady, and the
fire has at the same time already gained a foothold and extended
over any considerable area, it is advisable to push on some
distance ahead of the line of flame and clear a strip of several
yards in width, so as to check its progress by removing the
inflammable material requisite for its support. This measure
can of course only prove successful when undertaken sufficiently
far ahead of the fire to let all the operations be completed before
the latter reaches the line cleared and fired ; it necessarily entails
the deliberate sacrifice of a portion of the area in order to save
the crops lying behind. Compartment lines, and old pathways or
cart-tracks for the extraction of timber, form good points at which
to commence such operations, as they can be easily and quickly
cleared, and altogether afford a good basis to work upon. Whilst
this measure is being carried out, the work of extinguishing the
fire along the edges should also of course be proceeded with
simultaneously.
When the ground-fire is strong, and the danger of its over-
leaping such a check is imminent, or even at all probable, it is
also advisable to set fire along the inner edge of this cleared lin<
so as to burn against the wind and meet the fire which it is thi
intended to check. For prudential reasons, however, a regul
cleared .fire-path or ordinary protective line in the forest ought
usually to be selected as the base of operations, so as to obviat
the danger of sparks being blown into the crops lying behim
This operation is especially useful when there is a strong bi
blowing, so as to diminish the risk of sparks being carried it
across the cleared line when the original fire eats its way up
it. Great care is necessary in starting the contrary fire, and the
line should be manned with a sufficient number of persons to see
that, in place of burning against the wind, it does not burn in
the opposite direction and aggravate the damage it was intended
to put an end to. When once, however, this line of fire has been
well started it soon effects its object, for owing to the ascent of
the heated air from the main line of fire the air is drawn towards
it, and thus attracts the air in advance, and with it the contrary
