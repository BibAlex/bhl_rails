138 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
felled stems or windfall trees ; but, failing such, it also attacks
standing timber at a considerable height above the ground,
invariably selecting stems of large girth, and in these the portions
having thick bark. The sunny edges of compartments, and the
warm sides of trees surrounding small blank areas, are therefore
its favourite breeding-places, a fact which should be kept in mind
when felling and placing decoy-stems. From the copulating
chamber, which is somewhat large, a vertical gallery is hollowed
out to a length of up to 6 inches, mostly either proceeding up or
down the stem parallel to its axis, though it less frequently also
occurs that there are two such longitudinal galleries running
closely parallel to each other ; these main galleries have 2 to 5 air-
holes as well as the entrance-hole, and hardly touch the sapwood.
In small indentations made alternately on the right and left
sides, and somewhat close to each other, the female, within a few
weeks, deposits from 30 to 50 eggs, and sometimes many more
(to about 100 it has been asserted), fixing them into position
in the dents with glucose substance. About fourteen days later
the larvae creep out of the shells, and begin to eat their way side-
wards from the main gallery, forming sinuous larval galleries at
right-angles to it at first, which gradually get broader and bite
deeper into the cambial layer till they attain from 2 to 4 inches
in length, each terminating with the pupal chamber, in which the
chrysalis stage is passed. After a pupal rest of 8 days, the
chrysalis develops into the beetle, at first of a bright yellow
colour, but quickly becoming darker in appearance, which sooner
or later, according to the state of the weather, makes its exit
from the stem by a circular hole. The whole of the metamor-
phoses from Ovum to Imago occupies 8 weeks on the average,
but can take about 12 weeks under less favourable circum-
stances.
The first generation of beetles swarms from the middle of June
till July, and at once reproduces itself in a new brood, which is
also fully developed by autumn, either hibernating as beetles
before reproducing themselves, or else under particularly favour-
able circumstances, (as, for instance, if they swarm as early as
August), proceeding at once to reproduce a third generation within
the year. From this it will be seen how enormously this insect
can multiply under favourable circumstances ; but fortunately, in
the rawer mountainous tracts, where it naturally occurs most fi
