DAMAGE CAUSED BY AERIAL CURRENTS. 35
that has been extensively damaged by a storm are very impor-
tant, and resemble in many respects such as are entailed by large
breakage from accumulations of snow (see par. 16) ; but those due
to storms have sometimes assumed enormous proportions, involving
the throwing of scores of millions of cubic feet of timber.
The immediate and direct consequences consist in the interruption
of the leaf-canopy, and the formation of blanks in the crops,
hence leading to loss of increment and deterioration of the soil,
and not seldom necessitating the premature harvesting of the
damaged woodlands, the breakage and splintering of many
stems which are thus rendered useless for technical purposes, and
can only be utilised as fuel, as well as other considerable loss in
timber alone by the splintered portions being of hardly any use
or value at all, damage to areas undergoing natural reproduc-
tion, especially where the first reproductive felling has just been
made, or where gradual clearance of the standards is taking place,
owing to the parent standards being thrown, or to young crops
through the throwing and breakage of stems that are being held
over for another period of rotation, glutting of the market with
timber, with consequent reduction of the prices obtainable, and
complete unsaleableness of the smaller assortments of otherwise
disposable wood from branches, brushwood, and stumps, and
finally a rise in the price of labour, due to the great immediate
demand and to the greater risk and danger involved in working
among the enormous tangled masses of timber piled stem over
stem in the greatest confusion.
As indirect or secondary results or consequences of extensive
damage done by storms may be enumerated the failure of natural
reproductions often necessitating costly cultural operations, owing
| to the rapid appearance of a rank growth of weeds, increased
danger from injurious insects, owing to the increase in the num-
ber of favourable breeding-places afforded by the unusual quantity
of timber often lying for some considerable time in the forest, the
sickly condition of damaged stems, and the stumps which it can-
I not pay to utilise, the interference with the conditions for the
maintenance of continuous, regular, or approximately regular
, annual outturn, with the distribution of the various successive
1 annual crops throughout the stock on the total area, with the due
succession of the prescribed annual falls, and generally with the
I whole arrangements of the Working Plan.
