8 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
earlier, suffers much more frequently from late frost than the
more sensitive Oak, which does not commence its active period
of vegetation until later ; in the case of the Silver Fir the side
shoots may often be seen killed by frost, whilst the vertical
shoot still lies protected in the terminal bud which is the last to
develop. At the precise moment of the development of the bud,
the Larch is the most sensitive species ; but as soon as the needles
are somewhat strengthened, it becomes much more hardy.
So far as the influence of the Soil and Situation is concerned,
coombs or hollows on the hillsides, and depressions in the
crowns of the timber crops, appear to be most exposed to danger,
especially when the soil is moist, as the heavy cold layers of air
produced by the evaporation of the moisture have no means of
being wafted away, owing to the free circulation of air being
impeded : such patches, often contrasting sharply with their
immediate surroundings, either through inferior growth and
development, or through the occurrence of the more hardy
species, are called frost-holes. Woods skirting the edge of low-
lying meadows in valleys, and those in the vicinity of ponds
and moist meadows frequently suffer damage from frost as late
as even the middle of summer, in consequence of the cold pro-
duced by the increased evaporation. Eastern and south-eastern
aspects exposed to the cold, frost-bringing east winds, and southern
exposures, with their tendency to early awakening of active
vegetation, are more liable to danger from frost than the other
aspects.
The Soil-covering, more or less dependent on the nature of soil
and situation, is also of influence, as young plants surrounded by
a dense growth of grass are more exposed to danger from frost
than those on cleaner soil, in consequence of the stronger radiation
of warmth by the grass, whilst a high, lightly shadowing soil-
covering of thorns, juniper, broom, &c., acts as a protection.
Young plants are, of course, always most exposed to the danger ;
young seedlings that have just germinated are usually killed
outright by late frosts, which not infrequently also happens to
one and two-year-old seedlings of the sensitive species of trees
when the frost is hard. With advancing age the liability to
suffer from this danger diminishes, especially when the plants
have attained to over the so-called frost-height or normal level
of the cold layers of air, which is often very distinctly marked on
