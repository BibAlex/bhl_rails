4 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
lations, frost, heat, or the damage the crops are liable to suffer
from insects or weeds. And as the laying down of the principles
of management, the approval of the working plan, and the revision
of the results attained, are the duty of the head of the depart-
ment or of the responsible agent, it may well be said that this
branch of Forestry is one that concerns all the establishment,
and that in this sense all the establishment is classifiable as
protective.
4. Headings under which the consideration of Protection of
Woodlands falls.
It is convenient to classify the dangers threatening woodlands
into three groups, according to the nature of the causes of the
impending damage. Thus, we speak of dangers or damage :
i. From inorganic causes or agencies.
ii. From organic agencies.
iii. From human agency or the actions of men.
In considering these sources of danger more closely, we find that
the dangers or damage may be due to the following more detailed
causes :
i. Inorganic agencies:
1. Low or high temperature frost or heat.
2. Atmospheric precipitations rain, snow, hoar-frost, ice,
hail.
3. Violent aerial currents wind and storms.
4. Lightning.
5. Unfavourable conditions of soil wetness, shifting sand.
6. Diseases of trees, in so far as these are not occasioned
by fungoid parasites.
To these might also be added the destructive results of fires, so
far as they can be caused by lightning or the spontaneous com-
bustion of fermenting vegetable matter. As, however, fires arise
with few exceptions (through lightning) from human negligence,
wantonness, or malice, it appears more expedient to classify them
under section iiL below.
ii. Organic agencies, comprising damage done either by plants
or animals.
iii. Human agencies, or the actions of men either in regard to
interference with the proprietary rights, or with reference to the
purloining of, or damage to, forest growth.
