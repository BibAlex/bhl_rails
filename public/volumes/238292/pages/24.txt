2 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
preventive and remedial measures to be adopted, necessitates some
knowledge of various different branches of the cognate sciences of
Forestry. Thus Botany enlightens us concerning the forest weeds
and fungi; Zoology treats of the injurious forest insects and
their life-history; Sylviculture indicates to us the protective
measures against frost and heat, snow accumulations, and forest
weeds ; Management of Forests points out how the violence of
storms can best be counteracted by careful location and succession
of the annual falls, and how advantageous is the proper marking
of all fixed boundary points ; Utilisation of Forest Produce teaches
us in what way timber crops and minor produce can best be
harvested with least interference with the natural growth,
development, and reproduction of the forest.
In consequence of this overlapping with other branches, it has
sometimes been objected to accord to the Protection of Woods the
rank of a separate branch of Forestry ; but, on the one hand, it
certainly seems desirable to have a complete and comprehensive
statement of all that is necessary for the protection of the forests,
and, on the other hand, although zoology takes cognisance of all
animals that are injurious to forest growth, yet it does not concern
itself with the preventive and remedial measures which are purely
in the domain of Forestry, whilst at the same time many other
matters, such as those relative to drainage, to the binding of sand-
drifts, to protection of boundaries, and to forest fires, find no suit-
able place in any other branch. Under these circumstances it
can hardly be denied that Protection of Woodlands has a right to
be considered one of the four main branches of Forest Science.
2. Protection of Woodlands, and Forest Laws.
As above indicated, Protection of Woodlands teaches us concern-
ing the dangers which threaten forest crops, and the best means of
obviating them so far as lies in the power of the proprietor or the
forester. These means are not, however, always sufficient, and
the individual proprietors would often be powerless to operate
against such dangers unless supported by the State in the interest
of public safety and the common weal : thus, in view of the im-
portance and the value of woodlands for the general well-being,
negligent proprietors are even compelled to adopt such reasonable
protective measures as are permissible within the limitations of
