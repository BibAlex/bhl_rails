PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS AGAINST HUMAN
AGENCIES, OR THE ACTIONS OF MEN.
105. Nearer Consideration of such Dangers.
Daring the long course of centuries the woodlands have
certainly been much more disturbed and interfered with in their
normal growth and development by human agency than by any
other organic or inorganic causes. How many woodland tracts
have been damaged and often totally ruined or cleared entirely
by their owners through excessive utilisation of timber and of dead
foliage for litter, by over-grazing, by neglected or badly carried out
reproductive measures, and by imprudent clearances, quite dis-
regardful of their ultimate consequences ?
The forester is helpless to ward off from the woodlands under
his charge the effects of injudicious operations determined on by
the proprietor, but the principles of Sylviculture, of the Utilisation
of Forest Produce, and of the Management of Forests, teach him
how the productive capacity of the timber-producing tracts can
best be maintained or increased, how the forest produce may be
harvested and disposed of in the most economical and advantageous
manner, and how the fellings and reproduction throughout the
whole growing-stock can be so ordered and arranged as best
to satisfy the requirements of the owner, whilst duly safeguarding
and protecting the productive capacity of the soil. In most
countries in which forests occupy any extensive portion of the
total area, as in France, Germany, India, &c., there are legal
enactments or Forest Laws for the preservation of the woodlands
against mischief and other more serious actions of men ; but in
Britain there is no necessity for any such special machinery, and
actions affecting the proprietary rights in, over, and with regard
