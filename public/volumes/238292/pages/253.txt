PROTECTION AGAINST FOREST OFFENCES, ETC. 231
115. Measures for the Prevention of Forest Offences or
Misdemeanours.
In order to carry out protective measures in an adequate
manner it is essential that there should be a sufficient, and at the
same time efficient, body of men to see that irregularities of
various descriptions are not allowed to take place, although, of
course, it is only in a State Forest Department, or in private
woodlands of such large extent as belong to but a few of the
greater landowners, that anything like a full separate staff of em-
ployes can possibly be maintained in the interests of forestry alone.
But wherever foresters, wood- bailiffs, timber-overseers, wood-
reeves, or whatever they may be called, are employed in the
supervision of woodlands, they should be properly instructed in
the manner in which they are to take action in the various
classes of misdemeanours or more casual offences. Above all
things, inspections should be made without any approach to
regularity in the daily movements ; for if those hankering after an
opportunity of purloining any particular kind of produce think
they can count upon the forester being occupied at any particular
time by duties elsewhere, they are much more likely to decide on
carrying out their half-formed intention than when they are never
sure at what part of the woods the man in charge, or one of his
subordinates, may make his appearance.
