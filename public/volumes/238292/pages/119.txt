DAMAGE CAUSED BY ANIMALS. 97
want of a sufficiency of nourishment and satisfaction of the craving
for fodder ; but with regard to the summer-stripping, it is probably
due to the daintiness of the deer in quest of either the sugar or
the tannic properties contained in the rind, although perhaps it
may be merely a continuation of the method of nourishment
practised during the winter, or arising simply from wantonness,
and occasional stripping, developing into an easily acquired
habit, imitated by the other animals forming the herd.
In his very thorough investigations into this matter, Eeuss comes
to the conclusion that the present modern method of Forestry in
Germany, leading to the formation of densely canopied, equal-aged
crops in deer-parks, throughout which the softwoods and shrubs
become more and more suppressed, tends to an artificial and
altogether unnatural method of rearing large game, for bark-
stripping seldom occurs unless the deer be confined within a ring
fence, that the usual monotonous feeding with hay is the^a
principal cause of their stripping the bark, in order to provide
themselves with the tannic acid necessary to stimulate the secre-
tion of certain requisites (e.g., for the formation of antlers and the
process of digestion), and that from the feeding-trough to the peel-
ing of bark has almost become a natural movement.
The consequences of the damage done, which often extends to the
I majority of the dominating poles throughout the crop, consist in
i the diminished increment of the damaged individual stems, and
! the rotting of the wood at the parts stripped. The rot often con-
tinues far up into the stem, and later on leads to breakage of the
i stems, whilst still young, from accumulations of snow or ice, or
j from violent winds after they have approached nearer to maturity.
At the same time the lower and otherwise more valuable portion
i of the stem is rendered useless for technical purposes, often to the
I height of 15 to 20 feet, and this of course necessitates a consider-
|able loss in the outturn from such woods.
The extent to which damage may take place, and the danger of
incurring it, depend in the first instance on the species of trees
forming the crop. The trees specially liable to be barked are Spruce,
Beech, Silver Fir, Weymouth Pine, and Oak, whilst Larch, Ash,
Elm, Maple, and Sycamore are less exposed to danger, and Scots
Pine, Birch, and Alder least of all. The younger poles with
smoother rind are invariably preferred for stripping, and the
danger ends with the commencement of the formation of thick
