PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS,
INTRODUCTION.
1. Definition, Aim, and Scope of Protection of Woodlands.
UNDEK Protection of Woodlands is understood a knowledge of
all the dangers which in many ways threaten the well-being
of woodland crops, of the best means of warding off such
dangers and to a greater or less extent preventing damage being
done, and, finally, of the best practical measures to be adopted
for remedying or minimising damage that has actually occurred,
and for stopping its further extension.
The Protection of Woodlands is the oldest and most necessary
branch of Forestry. That it is the oldest may be seen from the
ancient forest laws of centuries ago, in which the protection of
the woods 1 against men was the principal, and not infrequently
the only aim, whilst protection against domestic animals also came
later. To these followed decrees relative to the replanting of cleared
areas, and the moderate and rational utilisation of the forest
produce. At the same time, it is the most necessary branch of
forestry ; for what is the use of the most careful sowing, planting,
and tending of timber crops, if men, animals, and inimical forces
of nature are to be allowed to act unhindered in the work of
destruction ? Under favourable circumstances, mere protection of
forests is of itself at times sufficient to maintain a certain degree
of density of crop, as in the case of selection fellings, when due
protection is afforded against cattle, especially against goats.
The nature of the dangers to which woodlands are exposed is
manifold, and their close consideration, together with that of the
1 In Britain such protection of forests, following afforestation, took place at first
solely for the benefit of the chase. Trans.
