DAMAGE CAUSED BY ANIMALS. 125
thinning operation previously, so as to remove all individuals not
absolutely necessary for the wellbeing of the crop, this will
contribute very materially to a saving in labour and in patent
tar, as well as removing a class of stems favourable beyond all
others for the propagation of the insects.
The action of good patent tar is repellent, owing either to its
smell or its taste. The caterpillars either have not the courage to
attempt to cross the rings, when they perish of hunger below them,
or they remain caught in them, owing to their viscosity, or if they
succeed in crossing, they soon die in consequence of their feet and
mandibles being clogged with the gluey composition.
A measure that formerly found extensive application, consisted
in the removal from the woods of the soil-covering of moss (for
cattle-bedding, &c.), when many hibernating caterpillars (e.g.,
Pine moth) were at the same time removed, and many others
were killed by exposure to the cold ; but experience has shown that
it is not very effective. And as it is obviously most prejudicial to
the well-being of the woods, and the productive capacity of the
soil, it has now been given up wherever formerly practised.
The chrysalides can only be collected when situated low down
on the stem in the fissures of the bark, or when attached to shrubs ;
but on the whole their collection is not generally practicable on
any very large scale. In destructive measures against certain
species, as for instance the Pine Owlet-moth (Trachea piniperda),
and the Pine Span-worm (Fidonia piniaria), the driving in of
swine into the woods is a much more effective way of getting rid
of all smooth-skinned chrysalides lying under the moss ; for these
are eagerly devoured by swine, although they will not touch the
hairy species like the Pine moth (Gastropacha pini), owing, most
probably, to the irritant properties of the hairs.
Ova can only be collected when they have been deposited in
large numbers on the lower portion of the stem, as in the case of
the Spruce moth (Liparis monacha), and under any circumstances
many eggs and clusters of eggs are apt to be overlooked, especially
in Pine woods, owing to the deeper fissures in the bark than on
Spruce or Silver Fir stems. The clusters of ova are more readily
noticeable when they have cobweb-like filaments attached, as in the
case of certain species feeding on the broad-leaved kinds of trees, and
Altum recommends the coating over of such clusters of eggs with
patent tar for the purpose of killing them ; this may be done with
