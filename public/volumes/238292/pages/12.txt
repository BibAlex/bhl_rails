Vi PREFACE.
For the ready courtesy with which Professor Fiirst granted me
permission to translate the work, I have here to express my
warmest thanks, and to hope that thereby he may have helped
on the somewhat struggling, though on that account none the
less certain, advance of Forestry in Great Britain towards its
academical recognition as a science worthy of being granted a
home in our Universities, where it may be taught in some
degree as on the Continent.
The work was originally written by Kauschinger in 1873,
but was revised anonymously for its Second Edition by two
eminent Sylviculturists, and again, to a very great extent,
re-cast and re-written for the Third and Fourth Editions by
Dr Fiirst. The utmost care was taken to confine it within
narrow limits, and those desiring more detailed information on
any particular point are therein expressly directed to look for it
in the more exhaustive works of Hess (Der Forstschutz, 2 vols.,
1887 and 1890) and Nordlinger (Lehrbuch des Forstchutzes,
1884).
In the scientific nomenclature of the insects, the older generic
names have, for the sake of simplicity and of a clearer compre-
hensive view, been generally adopted in the text, as, for instance,
Bostrichus, Hylesimis, Ceranibyx, Bombyx, Geometra, &c., whilst
only the more important of the recent names awarded to the
same by entomologists have been added in brackets, e.g., Tomicus,
Hylurgus, Hammaticherus, Gastropacka and Liparis, Fidonia, &c.,
as it is of far greater importance that the Sylviculturist should
at once be able to recognise an insect as belonging to a certain
group than to know merely its latest scientific name, perhaps
without due recognition of its close relationship to some other
injurious insect. In treating of the injurious insects, I have
here and there added a little to the often somewhat meagre
information given, and have also occasionally, in foot-notes,
added a few details about species of moths common in Britain,
but not considered worthy of special notice in the original
text
