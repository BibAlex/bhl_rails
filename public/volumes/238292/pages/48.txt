26 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
sufficiently protected, soon gets covered with all sorts of noxious
weeds, whortleberry, heather, &c., often cause extreme difficulty
in the reproduction of the crop later on.
A loss in timber is caused by the splitting and breaking of many
stems, and a still greater loss arises from the fact that, in con-
sequence of breakage and splitting, many stems and boles otherwise
suitable for the higher technical purposes of timber, are no longer,
or at any rate only partially, thus advantageously utilisable.
The glutting of the market with timber soon causes prices to
sink, more especially as the bulk of the timber thus exposed
for sale is usually of small dimensions, consisting of poles, top-
ends, brushwood, and the like, so that sometimes it is perfectly
unmarketable, and hardly covers the cost of extraction. And at
the same time, in contrast to this, when considerable damage has
been done over extensive areas by accumulations of snow, the
increased demand for workmen, and the greater difficulties than
usual connected with preparing the timber for sale, often lead to
a very considerable increase in the price of labour.
The costs of reproductive measures entailed by the necessity of
re-wooding blanks, of underplanting crops whose density of canopy
has been interfered with, and of re-planting areas where immature
crops have had to be cleared, are all practically classifiable under
the direct consequences.
Of indirect or secondary consequences, the most important is danger
from insects, owing to the favourable conditions for the mere*
of injurious species offered through the innumerable breeding
places formed by the broken wood, the damaged and consequentl
unhealthy stems and poles, and the stumps and roots remaining ii
the ground. Under normal circumstances, a prudent forester
moves such material at a proper time ; but when abnormal conditioi
obtain, this is often not possible, and bark-beetles (Bostrichini}
weevils or proboscid-beetles (Curculionidce), and cambial-beetl*
(Hylesinini) increase rapidly, and occasion fresh calamities.
But in addition to that, extensive damage from snow-accumula-
tions can occasion such deviations from the ordinary course of
management and the prescribed sequence of the annual falls of
timber, and such consequent interferences with the rotation of
fellings and the representation of the various age-classes, as to
necessitate a re-survey of the existing stock of timber of all ages,
and even the formation of an entirely new Working Plan.
