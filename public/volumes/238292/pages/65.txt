CHAPTER IV.
DAMAGE CAUSED BY LIGHTNING.
27. Occurrence and Nature of Damage.
Lightning, as is well known, strikes trees comparatively fre-
quently, either killing them or damaging them to a greater or less
degree, although the damage done to woodlands from this cause
can hardly be considered important ; and even though there are
no practical means at the disposal of the forester to obviate or
mitigate the danger, still the matter is of sufficient interest to
justify some short notice being taken of it.
When a tree is struck by lightning, the effects may be extremely
various. In many cases it merely destroys a strip of bark about
an inch broad, following the direction of the fibres, and hence
assuming a spiral course in trees of a tortuous growth. With some
broad-leaved species the wound thus inflicted cicatrises, and the trees
continue undisturbed in growth, as may often be seen in the case
of Oaks, whilst conifers struck by lightning seem invariably to
die quickly from the effects. In other cases, the bark of the trees
struck by lightning peels off almost entirely, being not infrequently
completely smashed, split up, or thrown far around in little
splinters. The leaping of lightning from one tree to another is
a peculiar phenomenon that may sometimes be noted ; whilst still
more remarkable is the manner in which quite a large number of
apparently uninjured stems gradually die off in the vicinity of a
tree that has been killed by lightning, as may not infrequently
be seen in Pine woods.
Dry stems, or such as are inwardly unsound and rotten, may
occasionally be ignited and burned down by flashes of lightning,
but in the case of sound green trees this has never been proved to
be the actual fact ; under such circumstances, lightning may be
the direct cause of a forest fire, although this is seldom the case
(see par. 117).
