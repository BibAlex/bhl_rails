DAMAGE CAUSED BY ANIMALS. 201
thoroughly studied, but the generation is probably simple and
annual.
These beetles often appear in great numbers in June, and
attack the foliage of Ash principally, but also Ligustrum, Wood-
bine, &c. They devour all the parenchym, leaving the midrib and
veins bare, though even consuming these also when they are in
want of food. Young Ash-plants in nurseries or plantations are
often not inconsiderably damaged in this manner.
The presence of this beetle in large numbers is not only indicated
by the rapid loss of leaves skeletoned in this characteristic
manner, but also betrayed by the unpleasant smell emitted by
it, especially during the early morning, when it is usually at rest
on the leaves, and when it can easily be gathered by shaking the
young poles, or by tapping them with padded mallets or axe-
heads.
The beetles collected can be disposed of to apothecaries for the
preparation of the well-known Cantharides, or blistering fluid or
plaster, so that the costs of extermination are often more than
covered.

(Vide Plate III. fig. 18.)
There is a considerable difference between the sizes of the two
sexes of this species, the wings of the female moth having a span
of 1-6 inches and those of the male only 1-28 inches. The upper
wings are brownish-grey, with two double, darker transverse
bands across them, the colours being plainer and more definite in
the male; the under pair of wings are yellowish- white, with
brownish-green somewhat indistinct transverse bands.
The caterpillar, which has 16 feet, attains a length of 14
inches, and is of a bluish or reddish-grey, with black spots on its
back, and reddish-brown knob-like warts covered with a growth
of very long, brittle, black and white hairs.
The ruddy brown somewhat compressed chrysalis lies in a
