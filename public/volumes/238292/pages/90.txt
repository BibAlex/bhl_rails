the species in larger quantity. So far as the chemical com-
position of the soil is concerned, the conclusions deducible are
much less reliable, as the number of plants among the true
forest weeds, which are constant on certain kinds of soil, that is,
which only occur on soils possessing certain mineral constituents,
is comparatively limited. The number of plants, however,
which show a distinct and decided preference for certain mineral
classes of soil, is already much greater ; whilst most numerous of
all are the indiscriminating, easily satisfied genera and species
whose occurrence and thriving are more intimately connected
with the physical properties of the soil, than determinable by its
chemical composition.
39. Preventive and Exterminative Measures.
The prevention of the occurrence of forest weeds in such large
quantities as to be productive of injurious consequences is best
effected by avoiding, so far as possible, the conditions most favour-
able to their growth and thriving. Careful maintenance of closed
canopy, and of the layer of dead foliage and moss on the soil,
stoppage of the removal of the dead leaves for litter or manure,
which invariably ultimately leads to gradual deficiency of the
coronal foliage of the timber crops, cautious and gradual natural
reproduction, conducted with all the more prudence wherever th(
soil is strong and fresh, and therefore more apt to become ovei
grown with grass and weeds, and finally, early drainage of
that are too damp, and therefore likely to get covered with rani
grass, are the chief means of obviating danger from weeds. Bi
wherever any circumstances may have prevented the hindrance of tl
first appearance of weeds, the Sylvicultural measures at our dis]
to give the young crops the greatest advantages in the competitic
with the weeds that make their appearance one after the otht
and to prevent or minimise as much as possible any damage tl
may be done by the latter, consist mainly in the preference
planting instead of sowing, in the choice of sturdy transplants
place of small seedlings, and in the immediate re-wooding of
from which the mature crop has been cleared.
Not infrequently, however, the weeds or grasses may have already
taken possession of the areas to be planted up, or else they
once make their appearance in threatening nnmbers as soon
