PROTECTION AGAINST DAMAGE BY SMOKE AND OTHER
ATMOSPHERIC IMPURITIES.
122. Occurrence of Damage ly Smoke and Gases.
For a very long time it has not failed to be noted that the
smoke from factories and smelting-works, and under certain
circumstances even from railway-engines when frequently passing
to and fro, proves prejudicial to the well-being and normal
development of woodlands subjected to their influence, producing
changes from the natural colour in the foliage, a sickening and
dying-off of many kinds of plants, and. particularly those of
sylvicultural importance. In the great majority of cases the
cause of the injury lies in the sulphurous acid contained in
the smoke, for only in less frequent cases can it be proved to be
due to the action of hydrochloric acid in a gaseous form as
evolved in the manufacture of soda, and to arsenious or nitrous
acids.
The sulphurous acid is imbibed in its gaseous form through
both the upper and the under sides of leaves and needles, and
then by oxidation is quickly transformed into sulphuric acid.
Props of fluid water passing over the leaves, as during rainfall,
hastens the action of the acid in a considerable degree, without,
however, being concerned in the origin of the damage, that is, in
the absorption of the sulphurous gas. Under the action of the
sulphuric acid formed, the spines or needles become first of all
yellow or red at their points, occasionally with a sharply drawn
distinguishing line between the still sound green portion and the
part affected, which latter gradually extends until the whole
spine changes colour and becomes dead. On the foliage of broad-
leaved species of trees the action of the sulphuric acid, ilmi
is being formed, makes the leaves appear as if they had been
