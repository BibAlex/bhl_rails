174 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
behind strong electric lights, and after endeavours made to isolate the crops
attacked by surrounding them with poles thickly coated with patent tar on the upper
side, had all been found only partially successful, it occurred to a young forest-
officer named Mayer to try the effect of putting rings of the patent tar round all the
steins of a young 12 to 15-year-old Spruce plantation, which was first of all cleared of the
lower branches for the purpose. This experiment was found to answer so well that
it was carried out on a much larger scale in 1891 ; and as the damage done in that
year was still greater than it had previously been in 1889 or 1890, it was again
resorted to in the present year, no less than 75,000 being spent in the Bavarian
State Forests alone on ringing with patent tar all the stems from the thickness of a
finger upwards, in whatever areas it was known that the moth had gained a footing.
Millions of stems may now be seen with these blackish rings at breast-height, which
experience has shown to be much less expensive than, and practically quite as effective
as, ringing at about 15 to 18 feet above the ground. By forming them at the latter
height, it was thought to intercept the tiny caterpillars from all the ova deposited
between breast-height and that elevation, but the happy efficacy of this remedial
measure rests on the fact that practically all the caterpillars spin down on gossamer
threads from the crowns of the trees to the ground before they have developed so
far as to lose this power of spinning, and that when they wish to re-ascend tho
stems, their progress is barred by the viscous band of tar, whose smell, or taste, or
touch they absolutely abhor ; and being unable to pass over them, they die of hunger
in hundreds, and on large boles often in thousands, below the rings.
In 1892 the plague of moths has been completely stayed. Abnormally warm
weather early in spring induced the tiny larvse to come out of the shell earlier than
usual, but the cold snap which followed it prevented the Spruce and Pine from
throwing out young foliage, so that whilst caterpillars already below the tarry rings
could not ascend the stems, those above them could find no food in the shape of
the new flush of needles, and were physically unable to attack the older and harder
needles of last year, and so both sets died of hunger. But in addition to this, fungoid
diseases broke out amongst them, and it seems undoubted that after about three
years of devastation, when they occur absolutely in millions, the caterpillars become
constitutionally debilitated, and are extremely apt to die off even much more suddenly
than they increased and multiplied.
Thousands of acres of coniferous woods, mostly Spruce, have been totally defolial
or so badly injured that millions of cubic feet of timber have had to be felled
thrown on the timber-market at extremely low prices. But it is still too early to i
up the account and state the full extent of the calamity due by this Spruce-moth,
the subsequent destruction among the remaining woods by Pissodes Tiercynia
Hylesinus poligraphus, Callidium luridum, and in a lesser but still considerable
degree, by Anthaxia quadripunctata, Bostrichus chalcographus, micrographus, auto~
graphics, and lineatus, Hylesinus pilosus, palliatus, piniperda, and minor, and
Pissodes pini, is indirectly due solely to the ravages of the Spruce-moth, and ^vill
very considerably swell the total extent of the damage done. Trans.
