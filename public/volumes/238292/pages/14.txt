Vlll PREFACE.
No attempt has been made to produce anything like a strictly
literal translation of the German text. Wherever any deviation
from the actual words of the original has seemed to me to bring
out the meaning of the Author more clearly in English, I have
allowed myself a very free hand, in the hope of thereby attaining
more useful results.
