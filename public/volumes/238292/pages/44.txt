PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
CHAPTEE II.
DAMAGE CAUSED BY ATMOSPHERIC PRECIPITATIONS.
14. Different kinds of Precipitations.
The precipitation of the aqueous vapour contained in the atm<
phere can take place in many ways, as is well known. It may
deposited in a watery form as dew, always beneficial to vegetation,
or, when condensed in the upper aerial layers, as rain, which fall
with more or less violence. When the temperature of the plant
sinks by radiation of warmth below the freezing point, rime is
formed ; and when the cooling down of the upper aerial layers
equally great, snow falls in place of rain, the flakes being smal
and dry if the cold is great, but large and moist if the teni]
ature be only slightly below the freezing point. When the sno>
hanging to the trees freezes after having previously thawed, 01
after having fallen as moist snow, an ice-accumidation is forme
as also occurs when rain suddenly falls after previous severe cold
whilst rain-drops that have become greatly cooled in falling
through the lower-lying cold layers of air crystallise into ice
soon as they come in contact with cold bodies, and cover branch(
twigs, dry foliage, &c., with sometimes quite a thick layer 01
smooth sheet-ice or frozen sleet. Hoar-frost is formed when the
aqueous vapour (mist) of the atmosphere is deposited in the shape
of ice-crystals on bodies cooled below the freezing point, as often
takes place to a large extent on branches and foliage ; and, finally,
the well-known injurious phenomenon of hail is caused by sudden
depressions of temperature in the atmosphere, combined with
electrical disturbances.
The influence of these phenomena on woodland growth is
manifold, and under certain circumstances very injurious.
