PROTECTION OF FORESTS AGAINST INJURIES DUE
TO INORGANIC AGENCIES.
CHAPTEE I.
DAMAGE CAUSED BY Low OR HIGH TEMPERATURE.
A. FROST.
5. Different kinds of Frost, and their Injurious Effects.
Under frost generally is understood any sinking of the tem-
perature below the freezing point ; but in regard to the time at
which it occurs, a distinction is made as to late frost, early frost,
and winter frost, whilst in respect to the peculiar way in which it
is occasioned by winter and late frosts, freezing and lifting of the
soil will be treated of in a paragraph by itself.
Under Late or Spring Frosts are understood those depressions
of temperature below the freezing point, which take place in
portions of plants after the entry into the period of active vege-
tation in spring. They kill the tender young shoots, leaves, and
flowers that may have opened, these becoming first of all drooping
and withered, then assuming a blackish discoloured appearance in
consequence of the decomposition of the chlorophyll, and finally
falling off. Seedlings just germinating are usually completely
killed, whilst stronger plants are interfered with in growth by the
loss of their young shoots, or are finally completely deformed by
repeated recurrence of the damage. The prospect of a seed year
can be obliterated by the destruction of the flowers, and the
regular progress of natural reproduction can thus be not incon-
siderably interfered with. From obvious causes, the increment
on damaged plants and trees is smaller than usual in years when
late frosts have been bad.
