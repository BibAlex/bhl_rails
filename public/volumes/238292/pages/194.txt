172 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
As already remarked, this Spruce moth also attacks broad-
leaved species of trees, Beeches, Birches, and fruit-trees, and even
feeds on the leaves of whortleberry bushes occurring as under-
growth under trees that have already been denuded of their foliage
by the voracious caterpillars ; but the damage done is, thanks to
the greater reserve-supplies of nourishment stored up in the
broad-leaved deciduous species, never of a fatal nature, as is not
unfrequently the case with the conifers. 1 And in Spruce woods
particularly, bark-beetles follow soon after the attacks of this
caterpillar, for the sickly stems afford the most favourable
breeding-places for these other most dangerous insect enemies
(vide note on page 128).
True preventive measures can hardly be said to exist for
hindering attacks of this dangerous moth, but the early discovery
of its presence and the immediate adoption of annihilative mea-
sures may promptly exterminate the brood, and easily obviate
disastrous calamity on an extensive scale. If the woods are as
carefully and constantly inspected as they should be, then the
presence of the characteristic fragments of bitten leaves and needles
scattered about the ground, the gradual thinning of the crown of
foliage, and later on the light-coloured and easily distinguishable
moths seen during the time of swarming in summer, ought to
leave no doubt as to the advisability of taking measures to prevent
their rapid increase in numbers.
Exterminative remedies of various kinds are applied. First of
all, the ova may be collected at any time during August till April,
but this is of course only effective so long as the insects have con-
fined themselves to ovi- deposition near the base of the stem, the
clusters of eggs being scraped off with a knife into a bag held
below them. Although great numbers of ova can thus be
collected, yet at the same time many clusters of eggs get over-
looked, especially oh the thick-barked Scots Pine ; and the larger
the number of moths previously, the more likelihood there is of
the clusters being in great part deposited too high up the stem to
be within reach, so that on the whole the results of this method
are at best only partial and somewhat unsatisfactory.
The crushing of the little schools or colonies of tiny caterpillars,
whilst they are collected together for a few days just after coming
out of the shell, is somewhat more practical and satisfactory; still
1 And more especially so with regard to the Spruce.
