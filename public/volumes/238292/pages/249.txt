PROTECTION AGAINST MISUSE OF RIGHTS OR SERVITUDES. 227
operations that may be carried out by the privileged parties, and
to see that the rights and privileges are exercised in a strictly
legitimate manner without excesses being committed. Thus, for
example, if it be laid down that every year a certain extent of
area shall be open to grazing, pannage, or turbary, it is the duty
of the protective establishment to see that the rights of user are
not exercised in any portions of the woods not declared open for
the satisfaction of such rights during the current year.
It often happens that only certain specified tracts are subject to
such rights, and a careful supervision must be exercised to ensure
the detection, prevention, and if necessary the punishment of
illegal encroachments into other portions of the woodland area.
It is, of course, the duty of the chief officer to superintend the
control and check off the exercise of the various rights of user, for
which purpose he should from time to time take steps to convince
himself that his subordinates are properly acquainted with the
nature and extent of the servitudes.
