THE DISEASES OF TIMBER TREES. 57
CHAPTER VI.
THE DISEASES OF TIMBER TREES.
34. Definition, Causes.
Under diseases of trees are comprised all disturbances of the
organism, in consequence of which the whole plant or any portion
of it dies prematurely. In the former case, premature interruption
of the canopy formed by the crop, and loss of increment will be
the result ; whilst in the latter, the individual stem is frequently
totally, or partially, useless for the more valuable technical
purposes.
Disturbances in the normal development will always precede
or accompany any total or partial death ; but not every such
disturbance in growth or development, as so often happens in
consequence of want of nourishment, light, or moisture, can be
termed a diseased condition.
The predisposition of a tree to disease is any condition, even
if only temporary, which, although not in itself involving
any injurious consequences, and perhaps even quite consistent
with the normal appearance of all plants at certain times, may
ultimately develop into a disease by the addition of any second
external factor. Such predisposition to disease may be occa-
| sioned by either extreme of age, (old age in particular rendering
! many species liable to disease), by early or late flushing of
foliage in spring, by smoothness of the bark (scorching or sun-
burn), by growth in shade or on moist soil, or else through
wounds or injuries which open a door to infection with fungoid
disease, &c.
Diseases of trees may be occasioned as follows :
1. By external injuries.
2. By influences of the soil.
3. By atmospheric influence.
4. By plants, phanerogamous or cryptogamous.
