PREFACE.
A LTHOUGH numerous works on Sylviculture have at various
times been published in this country, some being purely
the outcome of home observations, and others translations, or,
for the most part, compilations from French and German
sources, there has, so far as I am aware, never yet been any
work issued from the press dealing succinctly with that most
important branch of Forest Science or Woodcraft which relates
to the Protection of Woodlands.
After weighing the question, whether or not it would be desir-
able to compile a short manual on this special subject from the
larger and more exhaustive works published in Germany, the home
of Forest Science, I could not but come to the conclusion that,
in view of the present untutored state of Woodcraft as a Science
in Britain, the translation of such a simple, terse, and, at the same
time, strictly scientific and practical little work as Kauschinger's
Lehre vom Waldschutz, in its Fourth Edition (1889), completely
revised and re-arranged by Dr Fiirst, Director of the Bavarian
Forest Institute at Aschaffenburg, would probably be of more
practical benefit to Sylviculturists in Scotland and England than
a work of a more exhaustive and ambitious nature, which, from
the higher price its publication would entail, even if for no other
reason, might perhaps fail in reaching the class of practical
foresters and students of Forestry, for whom this little book is as
much intended as for those engaged in supervising and controlling
Sylvicultural operations, either as owners or agents.
