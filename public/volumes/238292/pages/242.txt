220 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
our later developments of proprietary rights, the insistence on
and retention of which necessarily led to some system of more
exact demarcation of individual rights within the estates that
were gradually growing in value, natural features could no longer
be relied on in the vast majority of cases, and artificial marks,
such as heaps of stones, earthen mounds, stakes, boundary pillars,
hedges, green lanes, ditches, &c., had to be used for the delimita-
tion of landed property. And though all proprietary rights are
now strictly ascertainable in a legal sense, and easily kept in view
by accurate surveys, yet for ordinary purposes the different por-
tions of all landed property are still marked off by walls, ring-
fences, posts with notice-boards, hedge-rows, ditches, and the like.
Those different methods of demarcation vary considerably in
durability. Ditches fall into disrepair, so as gradually to become
almost indistinguishable if not kept in proper order, and even the
stoutest poles of heartwood rot and decay in time, although charred,
and tarred, and otherwise treated with antiseptics. Hedge-rows,
with standard trees here and there, or avenues of timber-trees,
have not the stable element of durability and permanence that is
desirable, so that in almost all instances the best means of affixing
marks of a practically permanent description consist in the use
of stone, either in the formation of walls surrounding the estate,
or merely as boundary marks at all points of importance.
When stones are used for boundary marks at all angles, it is
better to give them a certain amount of dressing than to put
them in the ground in a comparatively rough and unhewn con-
dition, and, of course, wherever obtainable, some practically im-
perishable igneous kind of stone should invariably be selected,
like granite, basalt, or greenstone, for sandstones are liable to
waste away, and stratified rocks of clayey composition soon
become damaged by frost.
The shape that these boundary stones should take, and the
height to which they should project out of the ground, are matters
resting, of course, with the individual wishes of the landowner.
Very good marks are furnished by stones standing about three feet
out of the ground, the portion above the soil being dressed square,
and showing by graven lines on its flat head, drawn in the direction
of the nearest stones on each side, the angle formed by the boundary
lines to that point, whilst the heavier portion under ground
remains rough and unhewn. That such boundary stones can,
