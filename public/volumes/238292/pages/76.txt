54 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
comes, so that, with the tops pointing to the ground, it covers the
soil somewhat in the same way as slates lie on a roof.
The woven fences or hurdles, which have also the object of
breaking the violence of the wind and preventing the raising of
the sand, are of special use in operations conducted over extensive
areas very much exposed to the wind. They are erected facing
the direction of the prevailing wind, that is to say, they run from
north to south and face westwards, where westerly winds prevail,
and are bent into a half-moon shape at the ends in order still to
form a protection even when the winds are deflected to north or
south ; they subdivide the whole area into a series of strips, whose
breadth, or the space between the parallel lines of fencing, is
dependent mainly on the local circumstances of each case, but
varies from 100 feet on sloping, broken ground, or more exposed
localities, to 200 feet apart on level tracts.
The erection of the fences takes place by driving piles or poles
of Scots Pine, about 4 to 6 inches in diameter, and about 5 feet
in length, into the ground at distances of about 2|- to 3 J feet apart,
according to the nature of the material available for filling in the
woven work, the posts being driven in to such a depth as only to
leave about 40 inches out of the ground. Between these upright
posts green Pine branches, or occasionally broom, or reeds, or
sedges, are woven in horizontally, but not too closely, only to such
an extent that drifting sand may sift through to the other side
when blown about by the wind, and thus prevent the hurdles
being thrown by the pressure of sand heaping itself up against
them ; the object of the hurdles is not so much to intercept
the sand, as to prevent its becoming drift through the action of
the wind. In some cases, Poplar and Willow poles are used as
the uprights, in order that, if there be any subsoil-moisture, they
may take root, and thus be saved from rotting ; whilst in other
places, in order to reduce the requisite number of dear poles, the
hurdles are formed with uprights up to 10 feet apart, lashed
together by means of horizontal battens between which the Pine'
twigs, brushwood, &c., are woven vertically; this kind of fencing
has found the most extensive application in many localities.
By breaking the violence of the wind, these lines of fencing give
the sand a chance of remaining at rest ; whilst by a simultaneous
covering of that part of the intermediate strips, furthest removed
from the lee and shelter of the hurdles in front, with sods of turf,
