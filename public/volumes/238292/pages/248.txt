226 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
of species of forest trees and methods of treatment to be accorded
to them, and not infrequently compel him to adopt a system of
management, or mismanagement, opposed to all rational ideas of
sylviculture. And in endeavouring to supply the various
demands made by those having hereditary rights of various
descriptions, it is well-nigh impossible to satisfy everyone, so that
ill-feeling is often generated between the forest officials and the
parties having rights of user. It is not in India alone that such
dissatisfaction occasionally finds its ultimate expression in in-

of Forest Rights.
The measures for safeguarding woodlands against the extinc

increase in the number of those entitled to exercise the servitude
or in consequence of the diminution in the productive capacity
the soil, or suggestions relative to the extinctions of existii
servitudes, do not properly fall under the province of the bram
treating of the Protection of Woodlands, but are rather mattei
falling under the heading of legal and national- economic studies.
But, on the other hand, it certainly comes within the propel
limits of Protection to insist on a proper control of all the various
