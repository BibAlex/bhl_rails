proximating as closely as possible to natural conditions, led to
very interesting results throwing light on the above-mentioned
phenomena. He not only proved that the beetle is endowed
with a very long vital period (extending up to two years), but
also that the same individual beetles are endowed with the
power of re-copulation and repeated ovi-deposition, facts which
explain in the simplest manner the simultaneous appearance of
recently-developed and of older beetles, as well as of ova, larvae,
and chrysalides.
According to Altum's observations, made throughout many
years in the vicinity of Eberswalde, 1 the main time of swarming
falls during the warm months of spring, from April till the
beginning of June, when the beetles, attracted by the resinous
scent, crawl and fly towards the recently cleared falls of conifer-
ous crops for the purpose of depositing their ova in the stumps
and roots after they have entered in copuld ; reproduction is
continued throughout the summer as long as there are suitable
breeding-places available for receiving the ova. The eggs are
deposited on roots of 0*4 inches or above in diameter that lie on
the surface of or below the soil, and when the larvae make their ap-
pearance they at first bore only in the cambium, but in develop-
ing also attack the sapwood, forming long sinuous larval galleries,
trending downwards, and sometimes over three feet in total length.
The larvae are yellowish-white, with a large brown head, curved or
bent ventrally by contraction on the lower side, and sometimes
attain a length of about 0'7 of an inch. By autumn they are
fully grown, and then hollow out a pupal chamber for themselves
in the sapwood, which they seal up with the bore-dust formed,
and in which they rest as larvae till the June of the following
year ; there they become transformed into chrysalides in continua-
tion of their previous rest in the same chamber, and after a pupal
rest of about three weeks the imago makes its appearance, the
whole of the metamorphoses occupying about fifteen months,
reckoned from the time of ovi-deposition, a period which corre-
sponds with the results of Von Oppen's observations.
But after the beetles, appearing in July, have only partly
reproduced themselves, and have only partially deposited their
ova, they continue alive till the chief time of swarming comes

Prussia, (Munden and Neustadt- Eberswalde), is situated, Trans.
