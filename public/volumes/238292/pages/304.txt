HORSES
IN ACCIDENT AND DISEASE
NOTES AND SKETCHES
BY J. ROALFE COX, F.RC.V.S.
" To aid the veterinary student and horse amateur in distinguishing between different maladi
and mishaps, Mr. Cox, an able veterinary surgeon of long experience, has published, in which
verbal description is made altogether subordinate to the artistic delineation of twenty -eight <
of particular diseases and accidents frequently met with. The figures, if somewhat roughly, an-
yet strikingly portrayed, and in addition to being fairly well drawn, convey at a glance a capital
cries of object lessons in clinical veterinary medicine and surgery which cannot fail to be in-
Htrnctive to those for whom they were produced." Lance*.
