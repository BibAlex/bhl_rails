246 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
smoke into sulphuric acid for economical purposes were found to
have many technical difficulties to contend with, whilst only one-
quarter to one-third of the injurious gas could be withdrawn from
the air ; tall chimneys constructed with the intention of conduct-
ing the impurities into higher layers of air were practically found
to yield no improved results, and occasionally only widened the
area over which the injurious effects were noticeable.
Hence in many places it became the duty of sylviculturists to
give some consideration to the matter, so as to minimise the bad
effects as far as possible, and in order to prevent the total destruc-
tion of the woodlands already more or less damaged. Where areas
had already been cleared by the action of the smoke or gaseous
impurities, reproductive measures have usually been found to be
practically useless efforts, but wherever the injuries have not
proceeded quite so far, endeavours should be made to grow the
hardier species of trees so as to form protective belts ; these
should then never be cleared away, but should only be utilised to
a minor extent by the selection of a mature stem here and there.
Where the various other physical conditions of soil and situation
permit of it, the formation of Oak-coppice is perhaps the best
method of utilising the ground, for Oak and Coppice have each in
their own way proved themselves specially hardy in regard to
injuries caused by atmospheric impurities.
