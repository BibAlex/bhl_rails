PROTECTION AGAINST FOREST FIRES. 241
line of fire, which thus makes headway against the direction of
the breeze.
Every ground-fire that breaks out in a coppice-wood finally
develops into a crown-fire if it be of large extent, for whenever it
eats its way into thickets and pole-forests it runs up into the
crowns, and then the danger is much greater, whilst extinctive
measures are far more difficult and troublesome, especially during
high wind, when the smoke, flames, and heat are driven on
ahead. The conflagration may then assume such proportions that
extinctive measures are no longer practically adoptable ; such fires
may rage till they are stopped by some natural occurrence or
adventitious circumstance happening to check them, as, for
instance, a broad stretch of unplanted clearance, or a belt of
broad-leaved trees, or the reaching of the extreme limits of the
woods.
Broad fire-protection paths, planted up with non-coniferous
species of trees bearing a good crown of leafy foliage, are the
best means of preventing the spread of conflagrations, and are,
owing to the interruption of the coniferous canopy, the only sure
basis upon which extinctive measures can be soundly adopted.
This interruption of the canopy afforded by narrow interior lines
can be materially assisted by rapidly clearing away a belt of trees
along the further side, and working thus to join one of the main
fire lines. But in this work, as well as in quickly removing any
inflammable matter from the ground in the case of ground-fires,
care must of course be taken to begin operations so far ahead of
the fire as to ensure their completion before the fire has had time
to come up to the lines. Poles and trees, which it may have been
found advisable to fell, should be lopped of their branches, and
these should be removed so far into the further side of the woods
as to render it improbable that they will catch fire from the
sparks.
In crown-fires, too, which have already caught firm hold on
thickets and young pole-forest to any considerable extent, the leaf-
canopy should be interrupted in as broad a belt as possible by
firing the woods along the edge of one of the fire-protection lines
or interior paths. Great prudence is of course necessary in doing
so, in order to prevent the fire spreading into the crops lying
behind the line ; but when these are of older growth less danger
is in this respect to be apprehended, and the chief attention will
