218 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
to woodlands can quite well be controlled by the ordinary laws of
the country. So far, however, as human interference, unauthorised
by the owner, is concerned, the Protection of Forests deals with
the best methods of obviating the dangers which may accrue
to woodlands from actions affecting the ownership, or the rights
of user, the thriving of the timber crops, or the productive
capacity of the soil.
The actions of men, against which our woodlands will ordinarily
require to be safeguarded, may be classified as follows :
1. Protection of forest boundaries.
2. Protection against misuse of rights or servitudes.
3. Protection against forest offences or misdemeanours.
4. Protection against forest fires (which are nearly always
due to human agency).
5. Protection against smoke and atmospheric impurities.
The best measures and methods for harvesting the natural
products of forests, including, of course, the intermediate yield and
the minor produce, as well as the outturn or final yield in timber
or bark, so as not to prejudice the well-being and continuous pro-
ductive capacity of the soil and the growing-stock, belongs pro-
perly to that branch of Forestry which treats of the Utilisation
of Forest Produce, and will therefore not be considered here.
