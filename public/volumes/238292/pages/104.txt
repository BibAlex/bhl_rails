82 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
grass in young plantations, and where the wallowing of swine in
search of pannage contributes to the annihilation of destructive
insects.
The struggle against such animals is often very ineffective, and
experience has shown that the smaller these are, the more difficult
is their extermination, as the means which can be successfully
adopted against the larger animals are inadequate for adoption
against insects, swarming often in millions.
For the purpose of considering their sylvicultural importance
it will be sufficient to subdivide the injurious animals into three
groups, as follows :
A. Mammals (Mammalia).
B. Birds (Aves).
C. Insects (Insecta).
A. MAMMALS (Mammalia).
43. Classification and Enumeration of Injurious Mammals.
The Mammals that are in the habit of doing a certain amount
of injury to our woodlands, but which may extend to very great
damage indeed, may be subdivided into three classes, viz. :
a. The Domestic Animals: Horses, Cattle, Sheep, Goats, and
Swine, which are turned out into the woods to graze on
the grass and weeds, and the mast and fruits of the
trees.
b. The Animals of the Chase : Eed-deer, Eallow-deer, Koe-deer,
Wild-Boar, Hares and Eabbits.
c. The smaller Eodentia living in woodlands, Mice, Voles, and
Squirrels.
This classification has an additional advantage, in so far as
human action in combating these enemies varies essentially in the
case of each of the three groups. Thus damage from domestic
animals can be entirely obviated either by closing the woods to
them, or by only permitting their grazing under proper supervision,
and under certain prudential conditions ; injury by animals of the
chase can easily be minimised at any time by reducing the head
of game to the number desirable ; combating the attacks of the
animals belonging to the third group, the Mice and Voles in
