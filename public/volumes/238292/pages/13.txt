PKEFACE. Vll
In the final section, which treats of forest offences and mis-
demeanours, on the other hand, I have taken the liberty of
omitting certain matters relative only to German conditions of
forestry, and which could be of no practical use in the manage-
ment of woods in Britain.
I have intentionally omitted the citations of authorities often
occurring in foot-notes in the original, as those to whom alone
they could be of use do not require the assistance of any trans-
lation to open for them the treasure-house of German literature
with regard to Woodcraft.
It is true that with our comparatively mild insular climate,
free from either the intense cold or the great heat of the con-
tinental winters and summers, our Woodlands are not nearly so
much threatened with external dangers as those in many parts
of the Continent ; but, for all that, a thorough knowledge of the
leading points in the Protection of Forests must be of great
advantage from a purely financial point of view, as well as
regards the technical value of the timber produced.
That our Woodlands have not hitherto suffered to any calami-
tous extent, except intentionally from reckless clearance, and
from fires, I ascribe mainly to the fact of their being in great
part mixed forests ; and the formation, retention, and reproduction
of such in preference to pure forests, as recently recommended
by Sir Herbert Maxwell, Bart., in his article on " Woodlands "
in the Nineteenth Century for July 1891, will continue to be the
best natural protection against many of the inorganic and organic
dangers by which the cultivation of forest growth on an extensive
scale is threatened. Pure forests, particularly those formed of
Scots Pine and Spruce, have throughout Germany led to enormous
calamities (from insects especially) ; hence wherever soil and situa-
tion permit of it, consistent efforts are being made to bring back
the forests to their original form of mixed woods, which long
experience now shows to be in general that best suited for
obtaining the safest and most remunerative permanent returns
or sustained yield from the soil they occupy.
