PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
So far as regards the liability of the various species to be struck
by lightning, none is totally exempt from the danger, although
practically some are more and others less frequently damaged.
Those most frequently struck are the Italian Poplar and the Oak,
as both often stand in a more or less isolated position, towering
above their surroundings, and therefore offering the readiest point
of attack to the electric fluid; Spruce and Pine are also fre-
quently struck, whilst this is much less often the case with the
Beech, which is in some places erroneously considered to be proof
against lightning. According to Hellmann's observations, if
the liability of the Beech to be struck by lightning be assessed at
1, that for conifers is 15, for Oak 54, and for other broad-leaved
species 40.
