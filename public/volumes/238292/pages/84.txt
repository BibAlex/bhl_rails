62 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
Professor R. Hartig recommends, as a preventive measure and
special precaution against fungoid infection, the formation of Pine
nurseries in woods of broad-leaved species, or, at any rate, as far
away as possible from any cultural area infected with the leaf-
shedding disease. Particular care should also, he says, be taken to
avoid locating the seed-beds to the westward of infected areas, as
it is for the most part the rain-storms coming from that direction
which carry the spores to the young crops, and thereby cause
infection and spread of the disease. Hartig further recommends
the location of the nurseries at the edge of the forest, so that the
west winds may sweep over fields before reaching the former, the
formation of nurseries of a moderate size only, and their enclosure
with closely fitting boarding to a height of 6 or 7 feet on the wood-
ward side, so as to intercept the passage of the spores which are
wafted along in the layer of air close to the ground, and finally,
a light covering of foliage from broad-leaved species (leaves, not
needles) during the winter, in order to catch any spores that may
have been carried to the beds.
Frosts have also been blamed as the cause of this disease, and
not only the early frosts occurring in autumn, but also hard
winter frost, followed by warm sunshine (according to Alers and
Nordlinger). The covering up of the seed-beds, or the lifting out
of plants early in autumn and storing them up in covered ditches,
or collecting them in beds and covering them up with a thin
layer of leaves, have been by them recommended as protective
measures, without having always the desired effect.
Experience has shown that young plantations suffer less than
dense thickets formed by sowing, and that even in nursery seed-
beds, leaf-shedding is less destructive when the plants are further
apart, than when very close together ; two-year-old Pine seedlings
standing crowded in seed-beds almost invariably become infected
with this disease.
Whilst the reasons for leaf-shedding may quite well be found
in one or other of these causes, the disease is probably very often
due to a combination of them.
