CHAPTER IV.
PROTECTION AGAINST FOREST FIRES.
116. Damage done ly Fire ; Different Kinds of Forest Fires.
Forest fires are unfortunately by no means of uncommon
occurrence, but constitute in many localities an almost annually
recurring danger, threatening to injure the woodland growth to a
very considerable degree. With the exception of the comparatively
few cases caused by lightning, the causes of forest fires are
either directly or indirectly to be found in human action, and not
infrequently have their origin whilst other forest offences are
being committed. From this point of view it might have seemed
advisable to treat of them under paragraph 114, but the importance
of the whole special subject seemed to make it worthy of
treatment per se under a separate heading.
The damage, which may be caused to woodlands by fires,
consists chiefly and immediately in the destruction or premature
felling of timber crops often covering extensive areas, especially of
young seedling growth and plantations ; whilst among the indirect
consequences of such disturbances of the growing-stock must also
be reckoned the loss in the productive capacity of the soil, in
being exposed to the exhausting action of sun and wind and of
rank growth of weeds and of coarse grasses, the commencement
of sand-drifts on poor sandy soils, the sudden increase in the
number and the damaging power of many injurious kinds of
insect enemies, which find only too favourable breeding-places in
the foliage, stems, stools and roots of trees and poles or younger
growth that have been brought to a sickly condition of growth in
consequence of being scorched by fire, and finally the greater
trouble and expense which the re-wooding of such tracts entails.
Forest fires may occur in many different forms, but they are
usually distinguishable either as ground-fires passing over the
surface of the soil and feeding on the dead foliage and scattered
