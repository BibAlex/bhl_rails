DAMAGE CAUSED BY ANIMALS. 135
betrayed by the bore-dust collecting at the entrance-hole, and by
the entrance-holes themselves, and the air-holes communicating
every now and again with the main gallery, which are apparent
without difficulty when the bark is not too rough and scaly. On
standing timber their presence is indicated by the exudation of
white drops of resin, as well as by the bore-dust, which, falling
clown from above, chances to get caught in the rough scales of
bark, and on cobwebs near the foot of the tree. When exit-holes
are numerous and irregularly distributed over the stem, this
plainly shows that the beetles have already begun to swarm, and
that annihilative and exterminative remedies are too late for
application in reference to these.
As already remarked, most bark-beetles exhibit a decided pre-
ference for sickly crops of backward growth, and timber in which
the natural flow of resin has become stagnant ; hence by frequent
thinning and clearing of the woods from such material, by re-
moving all windfall stems and broken trees, and such as have
been prejudicially influenced in growth by wind, snow, ice, or
any other natural cause, by clearing the falls as soon as possible
of recently felled timber, by grubbing up the stumps of such trees,
and utilising their roots and branches, or if that cannot be done
by at any rate barking the stems felled, the best measures are
adopted for preventing the reproduction of these insect enemies
on any large scale. When the breeding-places naturally more
convenient to them are wanting, the beetles also attack sound
stems, and for the most part perish in consequence of the resinous
outflow that follows ; but when thousands of such small punctures
or wounds have been inflicted, the tree grows sickly (ivttts),
and then offers a normally suitable breeding-place for the remain-
ing beetles, as may only too often be seen when attacks of bark-
beetles take place to any calamitous extent. All such sylvi-
cultural operations as are recommendable against injuries of every
sort, against storms, ice and snow accumulations, stripping of the
bark by deer, c., are also distinctly favourable to the prevention
of serious attacks from bark-beetles, the chief protection against
which, as against injurious insects of all kinds, must undoubtedly
be looked for in the formation and reproduction of mixed woods
in place of pure forests ; for in the former, not only are the con-
ditions less favourable for the reproduction of insects, but there is
at the same time a greater abundance of insectivorous birds.
