PROTECTION OF FORESTS AGAINST INJURIES DUE TO
ORGANIC AGENCIES.
CHAPTER I.
DAMAGE CAUSED BY PLANTS.
36. Different kinds of Damage arising from the Same.
Vegetation or plants may be injurious to woodlands in two
ways, either by covering the soil densely as noxious forest weeds
overtopping and interfering with the growth of young timber crops,
or as parasites and fungi growing on or in trees, and endangering
their well-being and not infrequently their existence. The draw-
backs and injuries arising from noxious growth will accordingly
be considered under these two headings.
A. Noxious FOREST WEEDS.
37. Definition ; Disadvantages, limited Advantages.
Under Forest weeds are comprised all such vegetation or growth,
commonly occurring in large quantities in woodlands, as tends to
prevent the natural reproduction or the artificial cultivation of the
various species of forest trees, or as interferes with their normal
growth and development.
The disadvantages which may accrue to woodlands from such
forest weeds vary according to the nature of the latter, and to the
circumstances under which they are naturally developed.
Natural reproduction is often not infrequently for the most
part rendered impossible or out of the question when forest
weeds cover the soil densely ; and essential difficulties in the
