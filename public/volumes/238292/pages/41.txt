DAMAGE CAUSED BY LOW OR HIGH TEMPERATURE. 19
circulation of air (aeration) is always much greater than in heavy,
tenacious soil, thereby directly affecting the precipitations of the
moisture that is always present in the atmosphere.
On areas where sowing has been carried out, the moisture
necessary for germination can best be provided by deepening the
bands on which the seed is sown, and forming a ridge on the
south side with the material removed, or by protecting seed-beds
with a covering of moss, branches, straw, or protective frames ;
young plants, especially the more sensitive young seedlings, may
best be protected by means of branches stuck in the ground,
by frames, or by layers of moss spread between the rows.
The direct increase of moisture by watering or irrigation is
seldom practicable on any large scale.
Watering can, of course, only be carried out in temporary or
permanent nurseries, the seed-beds being watered both before and
after the germination of the seed ; it is, however, less frequently
applied when the seedlings or transplants are somewhat older.
It is always a more or less costly measure, especially when water is
not obtainable in the nursery itself, and except in urgent cases,
as, for example, long-continued drought in regard to such species
as Elm or Alder, which are very sensitive and occasionally may be
urgently in need of moisture, it does not take place so long as it
is possible to do without it.
Where circumstances are favourable the irrigation of nurseries
has certainly its advantages, and is carried out here and there in
the same manner as in horticulture ; but in general it is not appli-
cable, partly owing to the cost, partly owing to the usual want of
the necessary supply of water.
The irrigation of dry hillsides has recently, whilst so much
attention has been paid to the maintenance of water-supplies
in woodlands, been recommended wherever circumstances permit
of it, and has actually received a certain amount of practical atten-
tion here and there, use being made of the surplus moisture
obtained by drainage of higher lying, damp plateaux, and of water
collected in the ditches along the sides of roads, which, in place of
being conducted as formerly by the shortest way to the nearest water-
course, is carried sidewards along the slopes into horizontal ditches,
whence it is allowed to percolate into the soil. According to Ney,
the damming-up of smaller brooklets, and the leading-off of the
water sidewards, is also a perfectly practicable measure.
