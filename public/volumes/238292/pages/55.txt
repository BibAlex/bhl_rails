DAMAGE CAUSED BY ATMOSPHERIC PRECIPITATIONS. 33
Heavy hoar-frost, causing the formation of ice, does all the more
damage when immediately followed by a fall of snow, which then
finds an easier foothold on the ice-coated twigs and branches,
whilst the consequences of a repetition of snow'fall after the
previous formation of ice, through the thawing and then the
freezing of snow lying on the branches, or of a snowstorm after all
branches, twigs, needles, and dry leaves have been coated with
smooth sheet-ice, are also so much more injurious, that damage
on a most extensive scale may often be the result. Practicable
preventive measures against such natural calamities are only
adoptable in the most limited degree, and consist mainly in avoid-
ing the cultivation of the brittle Scots Pine in misty tracts, in
the retention of a good belt or fringe along all edges exposed to
danger, and also in some cases, to a certain extent, in strong
thinnings of the crops. The courses to be adopted, after damage
has taken place, are the same as in the case of damage done by
snow.
Hail-storms sometimes do very considerable damage in beating
down and injuring the plants in young crops and plantations, and
occasionally injure older crops to such an extent by injuring the
bark, stripping off the foliage, twigs, and fruits, as to necessitate
their immediate clearance. Here again, Scots Pine is the chief
sufferer, being more sensitive to all such sorts of injuries, whilst
Spruce and Silver Fir are better protected by reason of their
denser foliage and closer branch -development. In Oak coppice
hail brings the disagreeable consequence that at all the damaged
and then cicatrised places the bark does not strip or peel easily,
whilst the withes of osiers from willow-beds that have suffered
from hail break off at the injured parts when beingutilised.
Preventive measures against damage by hail are naturally not
at our disposal, but forests themselves seem to exert a certain
amount of influence on the formation of hail by modifying
extremes and equalising the distribution of atmospheric electricity
during violent storms, so that by forming and maintaining a
sufficient number of properly distributed woodlands some prac-
tical means do remain at our disposal for protection against and
mitigation of the damage wrought by hail-storms.
