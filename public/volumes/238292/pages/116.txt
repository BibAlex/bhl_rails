94 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
down the head of game to reasonable limits by shooting off the
periodic increment, and partly of a sylvicultural nature so far as
regards the due protection of such trees, or species of trees, as are
likely to be exposed to danger.
Among the Preventive measures, which fall to the duty of the
gamekeeper, are to be reckoned the reduction of any excessive heads
of game by shooting them down, the provision of a sufficient
amount of nourishment for them, and adequate supplies of fodder
during the winter months, of hay, acorns, potatoes, turnips,
Indian corn, and horse-chestnuts for red-deer, and by the felling
of softwoods, especially Aspen and Silver Fir, for roe-deer, so that
they can browse on the buds and the clusters of mistletoe that
are often growing on the latter ; whilst the formation of meadows
and open spaces, the retention of a sprinkling of softwoods in
young crops, and the planting out of chestnuts and horse-chestnuts,
Mountain Ash, and other mast-bearing trees, should also not be
lost sight of.
The Sylvicultural measures of utility in this respect include the
avoidance of sowing out acorns and beech-nuts in autumn, espe-
cially along strips or bands of prepared soil, if there be any con-
siderable head of red-deer or wild pigs, as they both, but particularly
the latter, know very well how to find out the seed, and are almost
certain to devour it completely during the winter months. Where
blanks are to be filled up among young growth, quickly growing
species should be selected, and sturdy transplants made use of;
in some places, as on the Harz Mountains, for example, Spruce is
planted out in wisps of seedlings for the protection of plantations,
in the hope that one or other of the seedlings forming the wif
may escape being bitten. The introduction of subordinate speci
may also take place in small patches instead of merely singly
individually, when there is any likelihood of their being nibble
(Silver Fir) or barked (Larch) by the deer.
Among the direct Protective measures may be enumerated
enclosure or fencing in of all plantations, and areas being repi
duced, until they have outgrown the danger of being browsed on,
a measure which cannot be avoided in deer-parks, or less
frequently the defilement of such areas by means of strongly
smelling substances (crude pretroleum, assafoatida, &c.), into which
linen cloths are dipped and then applied as convenient. Of late
years, and particularly with regard to young woods of conifei
