DISADVANTAGES FROM UNFAVOURABLE SOIL, ETC. 49
at the mouth of the ditch, in order to hinder the ingress of
the water whilst it attains a higher level than that in the
ditch.
Accurate levelling should take place before any extensive
drainage work is undertaken, and is also necessary even in smaller
cases when the difference in level is slight ; but otherwise, for
unimportant drainage works with a considerable difference
between the levels, the ditches may be marked off with the
naked eye, or with the use of the most simple instruments.
The leading off of the water from a large area generally
takes place by means of small feeders, which conduct the water
that collects in them into side drains, and these again lead it into
the main drain.
The main drain is best formed along the line connecting the
lowest points, and thence conducted at once in the direction of
the strongest gradient towards the pond or water-course into
which it is to debouch. If the difference in level is so great
that any scouring out of the ditch or damage to its walls may be
apprehended, owing to the velocity in the flow of the water being
drained off, the danger can be obviated either by a terrace-like
arrangement of the bottom of the ditch, in which case some sort of
paving is requisite, or, if possible, by prolonging the course of the
drain by sinuosities. Its width and depth depend on the quantity
of water to be drained off, the depth of ditches and drains being
reduced merely to what is absolutely necessary, not only to lessen
the expense, but also on account of the usual desirability of drain-
ing the upper layers of the soil only ; for anything like a thorough
drainage of the soil is very apt to exert an injurious influence on
the vegetation. The width of the ditches and drains depends on
their depth and their scarp, which can be steeper in proportion
to the tenacity of the soil ; they must be the more sloping, in pro-
portion as the soil is loose, and apt to get washed away or to
fall in.
The side-ditches may debouch into the main drain either at right
angles or at an acute angle, the latter arrangement being prefer-
able when they have any considerable gradient, and are likely
to conduct large quantities of water into the main drain ; for in
that case, if debouching at right angles, the water would be apt to
scour out or undermine the opposite side of the main drain.
