PROTECTION AGAINST FOREST FIRES. 243
trees dying off here and there, it will often be necessary to take
steps towards their clearance; this is more especially the case
with regard to conifers, owing to the danger which then becomes
imminent from insect enemies. Whenever any considerable fire
has occurred in coniferous crops, the attention of the foresters
and woodmen will be specially required for the purpose of noting
anything like an increase in the number of insects injurious to
forest growth, and more especially of the species inclined to breed
in or near the roots and the lower portions of the stems.
From a sylvicultural point of view, it will be advisable to
replant or sow the areas denuded of their crops, in order to
obviate the continuation of the loss of increment on the one
hand, and to prevent the soil from becoming covered with a rank
growth of grass and weeds, and hence losing its productive capacity,
or from becoming exhausted by exposure to sun and wind.
