28 PROTECTION OF WOODLANDS.
snow-break and snow-pressure, when snow falling early in the
season finds them with foliage still attached to the crown.
Among conifers, the brittle Scots Pine suffers more from snow-
break, whilst the tough, thickly-foliaged Spruce suffers more from
snow-pressure during the earlier stages of development. Among
the broad-leaved species, Alder and Acacia suffer occasionally from
snow-break, on account of their brittle wood, whilst young crops
of Oak and Beech are occasionally damaged by snow-pressure,
owing to their retaining their dead foliage often long into autumn.
Snow-break mostly takes places high up near the top end, as
may be noted in the frequency of double leading-shoots and
bayonet-like growth of Spruce in tracts exposed to danger from
snow ; but it can also occur in the lower portions of the stem,
especially if there be any weak point from former injury, left
behind in consequence of tapping for resin, or stripping of bark
by red-deer in the case of Spruce, or of cankerous fungoid growth
on the Silver Fir. The danger is increased by unequal pressure
owing to irregularity of the branch development, as on hillsides
and at the edges of the forest, whilst in snowfall during windy
weather the side exposed to the wind is always most heavily laden.
So far as the age of the crop is concerned, thickets suffer from
snow-pressure only, but the more so the denser they are ; hence
thick sowings and natural reproductions suffer more than planta-
tions, and unthinned woods more than such as have been thinned.
Older crops from the pole-forest stage of growth onwards are
damaged only by snow-break ; the danger is diminished as the
crop grows older, and the proportion becomes more favourable
between the length of stem and its diameter, the danger of break-
age being commensurable therewith.
In conclusion, it may also be mentioned that extensive damage
from the accumulation of snow only occurs in high timber forest,
coppice being almost entirely exempt from danger, and that in copse
or coppice under standards, only the youngest class of slender
standards gets bent down to the ground, and becomes unsuited for
the purposes intended, if the pressure be continued for any length of
time. Those who advocate the superiority of crops in which there
is no succession of separate annual falls, but all the age-classes
occur promiscuously over the whole area, and the annual fall takes
place by selection of the mature timber throughout the whole
crop, claim that such are much less exposed to danger from snow
