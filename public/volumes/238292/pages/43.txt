DAMAGE CAUSED BY LOW OR HIGH TEMPERATURE. 21
sun-burn can often be noted even on large trimmed transplants,
and usually results in their dying off.
Preventive measures consist in the avoidance, so far as possible,
of sudden exposure of the edges of woodlands, and of the retention
of all branch development there; timely formation of a protective
belt by planting up with Spruce can also prove efficacious. Beech
trees that have hitherto been growing in the close canopy of
high forest, but are retained as standards for the production of
large timber, almost invariably after a short time show the occur-
rence of sun-burn, so that the retention of such individual
standards is not advisable. Sun-burnt stems along the edge of
woods should, however, be retained as long as possible, as they
remain for a considerable time in active vegetation, whilst, if they
be removed, the stems immediately behind them would then be
exposed to precisely the same danger.
