356 Researches on the rpvrlatlc Acid
posited; and the residual gas contained about 44 of mu-
riatic acid gas, and the remainder was inflammable.
MM. Gay Lussac and Thenard have proved by a copious
collection of instances, that in the usual cases where oxy-
gen is procured from oxvmuriatic acid, water is always pre-
sent, and muriatic acid gas is formed: now, as it is shown
that oxvmuriatic acid gas is converted into muriatic acid
gas by combining with hydrogen, it is scarcely possible -to
avoid, the conclusion, that the oxygen is derived from the
decomposition of water, and, consequently, that the idea
of the existence of water in muriatic, acid gas is hypothe-
tical, depending upon an assumption which has not yet
been proved â€” the existence of oxygen in oxymuriatic acid
gas.
MM, Gay Lussac and Thenard indeed have stated an ex-
periment, which they consider as proving that muriatic acid
Vas contains one quarter of its weight of combined water.
They passed this gas over litharge, and obtained so much
water; but it is obvious that in this case they formed the
same compound as that produced by the action of oxymu-
riatic acid on lead; and in this process the muriatic acid
must lose its hydrogen, and the lead its, oxygen ; which of
course would form water : these able chemists, indeed,
from the conclusion of their memoir, seem aware that such
an explanation my be given, for they say that the oxymu-
riatic acid may he considered as a simple body.
I have repeated those experiments which led me first to
suspect the existence of combined water in muriatic acid,
with considerable care; I find that, when mercury is made
to act upon one in volume of muriatic acid gas, by Voltaic
electricity, all the acid disappears, calomel is formed, and
about *5 of hydrogen evolved.
With potassium, in experiments made over very dry mer-
cury, the quantity of hydrogen is always from nine to
eleven, the volume of the muriatic acid gas used being 20.
And in some experiments made very carefully by my
brother Mr. John Davy, on the decomposition of muriatic
acid gas, by heated tin and zinc, hydrogen equal to about
half its volume was disengaged, and metallic muriates, the
same as those produced by the combustion of tin and zinc
in oxymuriatic gas,- resulted.
It is evident from this series of observations, that Schecle's
view (though obscured by terms derived from a vague and
unfounded general theory) of the nature of the oxymuriatic
and muriatic acids may be considered as an expression of
i'actsj whilst the view adopted by the French school of
chemistry,
