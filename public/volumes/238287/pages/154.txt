XXIII. An Estimation of the Loss of Weight which take*
place in cooking Animal Food.
At is well known that, in whatever way the flesh of ani-
mals is prepared for food, a considerable diminution takes
place in its weight. We do not recollect, however, to have
seen any where a statement of the loss which meat sustains
in the various culinary processes, although it is pretly ob-
vious that a series of experiments on this subject would not
be without their use in domestic ceconomy.
We shall here give the result of a series of experiments
which were actually made on this subject in a public esta-
blishment, premising that, as they were not undertaken
from mere curiosity, but, on the contrary, to serve a pur-
pose of practical utility, absolute accuracy was not attended
to. Considering, however, the large quantities of provisions
which were actually examined, it is presumed that the re-
sults may be safely depended upon for any practical pur-
pose. It would no doubt have been desirable to have
known not only the whole diminution of weight, but also
the parts which were separated from the meat in the form
of aqueous vapour, jelly, fat, Sec, but the determination of
these did not fall within the scope of the inquiry.
