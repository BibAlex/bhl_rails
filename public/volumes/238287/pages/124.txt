112 Analysis of Several Varieties of
foreign salts, and of different varieties- of British salt with
caeh other, will best be made by an examination of the
following table, which comprehends the results of the
analysis of equal weights of each variety,

I. The total amount of impurities, and the quantity of
real muriate of soda, contained in each variety of common
salt, may be learned by inspecting the two last columns of
the table. From these it appears, that the foreign bay salt
is purer, generally speaking, than salt whieh is prepared by
the rapid evaporation of sea water j but that it is contami-
nated with about three times the amount of impurities
discoverable in an equal weight of the Cheshire large-
grained salt, and with more than twice that of those that
are found in iht staved and common salt of the same district.
II. The insoluble matter in the foreign salt, after the
action of boiling water, appears to be chiefly argillaceous
earth coloured by oxide of iron, and is probably derived in
part from the pits in which the sea water is submitted to
evaporation. We may, perhaps, assign the same origin to
the very minute portion of muriate of lime, which is not
found in the salt prepared by evaporating sea water in me-
tallic vessels, nor even in the mother liquor, or uncrystal-
lizable residue. In sea salt prepared by rapid evaporation,
the insoluble portion is a mixture of carbonate of lime
with carbonate of magnesia, and a fine siliceous sand ; and
in the salt prepared from Cheshire brine, it is almost en-
tirely carbonate of lime. The insoluble part of the less
pure pieces of rock salt is chiefly a marly earth, with some
sulphate of lime. The quantity of this impurity, as it is
stated in the table, is considerably below the average, which
m my experiments has varied from JO to 45 parts in 1000.
