It is necessary to remark, that in the preceding table, as
wel) as in Table I, several of the nitrates and muriates were
slightly reddened, though not in a degree to be compared
with the oxy-sulphate of iron. I have not noticed this in
the table,, because I am not certain whether this effect was
not owing to a minute portion of oxide of iron which might
have been introduced into those solutions by the acids em-
ployed to make them, as both the nitric and muriatic acids
of commerce generally contain some; an excess of nitric
acid, even if pure, might also cause this effect, as Table I.
may convince us. The solutions with which this effect
occurred to me were those or' bismuth, silver, mercury,
lead, cobalt, gold, and platina.
The liquid B is not altered by exposure to the air.
Its effect on oxv-sulphate of iron is the same, whether
this sulphate is neutral, or contains an excess of acid, or is
supersaturated with carbonate of ammonia.
Sulphuric acid destroys the colour produced on oxy-sul-
phate of iron, provided the three liquids are in a concen-
trated state. If there is. much water present, no change
ensues.
Having obtained the tingeing principle B, separate from
