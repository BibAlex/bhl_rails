This is Mr. J. Marsh's approved method of tuning
a douzeave. Theory of Harmonics, page 13.
The system nearest to this of any which I remem-
ber to have met with, is that of a division of the oc-
tave into 67 equal parts, (see M. Sauveur's table above
referred to), where — 1 '764552 is the flat temperament
of the fifth , which here is — 1*65742; and the same
differs considerably from the other system recom-
mended by Mr. Marsh page 18, which, perhaps after
the example of Dr. Smith, he has borrowed from
M. Henfling without acknowledgement. See my 10th
scholium.

latter part of cor. 3, f when the bases and beats (of
two tempered consonances) are the same, the tempera-
ments have ultimately* the inverse ratio of the major
terms" of the perfect ratios of these consonances.
Whence
Scholium 9. If a douzcave be required, wherein the Jiftk
(■§-) and the major third [$) to the same base shall beat
equally quick, the former flat and the latter sharp ; we

* The ultimate ratios are in tkese cases, very near to the exact ratios :
thus in scholium 9, — -c, or 2-2930132, results from the ultimate ratios ;
the true temperament being '2-S93G932, as derived from the length of string
I of the Vth, in the equation 4/* — P — f ; the difference being lels than
th of a X, an interval altogether imperceptible in practice.
