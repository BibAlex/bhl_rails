Second, The facility with which metallic substances
are revived, in cases in which hydrogen is present. I
placed two platina wires, positively and negatively electri-
fied from 500 double plates of six inches, in fused litharge ;
there wa3 an effervescence at the positive side, and a black
matter separated at the negative side, but no lead was pro-
duced ; though when litharge moistened with water was
employed, or a solution of lead, the metal rapidly formed :
the difference of conducting power may be supposed to
produce some difference of effect, yet the experiment is
favourable to the idea, that the presence of hydrogen is
essential to the production of the metal.
Third, Oxygen and hydrogen are bodies that in all cases
seem to neutralize each other, and therefore in the products
of combustion it might be expected that the natural ener-
gies of the bases would be most distinctly displayed, which
is the case; and in oxymuriatic acid, the acid energy seems
to be blunted by oxygen, and is restored by the addition of
hydrogen.
In the action of potassium and sodium upon ammonia,
though the quantity of hydrogen evolved in my experi-
ment* is not exactly the same as that produced by their
action upon water; yet it is probable that this is caused by
the imperfection of the process*; and supposing potassium
and sodium to produce the same quantity of hydrogen from
ammonia and water, the circumstance, at first view, may be
conceived favourable to the notion that they contain hy-
drogen, which under common circumstances of combina-
tion will be repellent to matter of the same kind : but
this is a superficial consideration of the subject, and the
conclusion cannot be admitted ; for on the idea that in
compounds containing gaseous matter, and perhaps com-
pounds in general, the elements are combined in uniform
proportions; then whenever bodies known to contain hy-
drogen are decomposed by a metal, the quantities of
hydrogen ought to be the same, or multiples of each other.
Thus, in the decomposition of ammonia by potassium and
sodium, two of hydrogen and one of nitrogen remain in
* There seems to be always the same proportion between the quantity of
ammonia which disappears., and the quantity of hydrogen evolved ; i. e.
whenever the metals of the alkalies act upon ammonia, supposing this body
to be composed of thrcs hydrogen, and one of nitrogen, in volume, two of
hydrogen and one of nitrogen remain in combination, and one of hydrogen
u set free. And it may be adduced as a strong argument in favour of the
theory of definite proportions, that the quantity of the metals of the alkalies
and nitrogen, in the fusible' results, are in the same proportions as those In
