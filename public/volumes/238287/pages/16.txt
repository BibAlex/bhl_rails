4 Review of the first Volume of M. J. A. De Luc's
Whether the present rivers and streams of water > have exÂ«
cavated the valleys through which they flow P a question,
which some months ago exercised the pens of two of your
correspondents, I recollect. M. De Luc seems to consi-
der it as fully proved, by the numerous facts which he
adduces in the volume before me, that rivers and brooks
have no tendency to deepen their channels, but, on the
contrary, are in every instance, with greater or less rapidity,
filling up the bottoms of the valleys with the matters
which they sweep away from the fett of the flailing cliffs
and steep banks that they undermine, in the more rapid
parts of their courses : and that the whole of trje matters
so removed by the currents of rivers, are dropped before
they reach the depths of the ocean, and arc even met by
and mingled with large quantities of pure sand, thrown up
by the tides, from such deep parts of the ocean. The
growth and operation of peat, in filling up some vales, is
exemplified by instances at pages 131, 137, 146, 24 7, 334,
344, 8cc; and in lessening, if not at length entirely filling
up and obliterating, lakes, and natural pools of water in
other instances, af pages 138, 141, 144, 145, 146, 14 7, 17 I,
1<85, 187, 190, 191, 233, 275, 281, 344, 347, &c.
The 12th, 1 6th, and 17th heads, relate to the question
Whether the holders or blocks of granite and other stones,
have emigrated on the surface of the earth P The instances
are very numerous which M. De Luc describes, through
his whole route from Berlin to Husum, of blocks of granite
and other primordial stones some of stupendous size, and of
various species, found on the tops of graveily eminences,
in the face and at the feet of gravelly cliffs by the sea side,
and on some plains, at pages 123, 127, 129,135, 137,
156, 160, 172, 173, 178, 180, 181, 194, 195, 205, 213,
220,223,224,2-26, 228, 234, 237, 238, 248, 251, 249,
255, 256, 257, 265, 272, 273, 274, 277, 278, 2/9, 285,
291,293, 301,302, 30*, 313, 323, '329, 333, 334, 344,
367, 373, 381, 384, 366, 387, 388, 8cc. These instances
are considered by our author as concurring in proving, the
impossibility of such blocks being transported along the
present or any former surface of the earth, to the places
where they are now found, and as establishing or gene-
ralizing the supposition made by Mr. Wraxall and M. Dr
Saussure in particular instances elsewhere, thai such blocks
u seemed as if they had fallen from I he sky."
I confess, however, sir, that I was somewhat disap-
pointed in finding no attempt in all these details, at pointy
jug out the exac? places of the crater- ftke orifices, whence
