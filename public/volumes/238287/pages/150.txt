13S Observations on the Purity of Standard Gold.

\Vc know that charcoal, when put into close vessels of
metal or glass, is not altered, although it becomes red.
Theory dictates this, and several experiments confirm it.
But the observation of the fact related by the judicious,
Heljpt also proves, that in this case the charcoal below the
melted silver is decomposed, and continually furnishes
elastic fluid j since this excellent chemist found that silver
kept over a similar lire, without charcoal being placed be-
low it, undulated at the surface, going from trie centre to
the edges, and vice versa ; but that in fact it does not bub-
ble wiih so much noise : from whence then does the elastic
fluid originate in this case?
Priestley, the founder of the modern pneumatic che-
mistry, demonstrates in the plainest manner, what has
been since confirmed by several other experiments, that
earthen vessels heated until they admit light to pa^s
through them, are filters, or rather sieves, which allow even
the external air to enter ; that caloric and light penetrate
by the bottom of the crucible, and with them air, at-
tracted chemically by the charcoal which is inside : its
oxygen coming in contact with the charcoal, which is in a
state of incandescence, inflames a portion of it, is combined
with itself and with the caloric, forming carbonic acid, an
elastic fluid, which, by t he uninterrupted action of the fire,
augments and acquires a sufficient elasticity to overcome
the pressure of a column of seven inches of liquid silver,
which is above, and passes through it agitating it violently.
The small residue of lead, which is united with and dif-
fused over the mass, being put by a continual agitation in
contact with the carbonic acid gas, and with the atmo-
sphere (the latter and perhaps the former are decomposed
by a greater affinity under certain circumstances), is oxi-
dated, and by the diminution of specific gravity is con-
strained to occupy the upper surface.
In fact, H el lot saw a kind of yellowish oil rise from the
inside of the silver which floated on the top of the crucible :
ibis oil was a pure oxide of lead melted and formed by the
contact of the atmospheric air, which is continually re-
newed. The refiners collect this melted oxide by absorbing
it with glass or with sour earth \ this earth being most
easily removed from off* the silver which it covers, and the
metal then remains limpid and pure.
On comparing this method with the process of Aaathar-
chjdcs, reported here so imperfectly, we may stibpy&e that
