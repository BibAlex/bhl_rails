the process in page 158, of the Harmonics. As is

By multiplying these general Corollaries, I should, per-
haps, exceed your limits. I must therefore content mvself
for the present with the following, as particular applications
of the theorems and corollaries above, viz.

should be perfect, we have by theorem 1, \ =0;

* By an examination of plate V in your 28th volume, and of a more ex-
tensive table of Intervals, it appears, that the number of 2s, always exceeds
the number ofm's in ratios between those of 12*5 : 1 and 10*: 1 (those of
Sand g). But the major comma and its aliquot parts, most frequently
occurring; in temperaments, I have adopted its ratio of 11 1 1, and thus find
f = -H062 + *Oi:56m ; from which equation, the latter ones in cor. 10, 1 1
aud 12 are obtained. tem-
