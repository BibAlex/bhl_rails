Temperaments of different musical Systems* 45
temperament of the major sixths ; which last tem-
peraments prove the same as they must do, to fulfil
the conditions of cor. 8.
Though the fifth wolf is here so large, the Illds and
Vlths wolves are each 2 only.
This system approaches very near to that of Mer-
cator, wherein the octave is divided into 53 equal
parts, and where — -0350942 is the flat temperament
of the fifth. See M. Sauveur's general table of tem-
pered systems, Mem. de l'Acad. 1711, lomo. p. 416.
Scholium 2. If a douzeave be required, in which the ma-
jor thirds should be perfect, we have in theorem 3
'lis- 4r s". , r 11 w— At
= o, or lls = 4r, whence — = — ; also
s s 4 u
= 0, or u — At and — = — j whence it appears, that
the fifth is to be flattened —2 + -ra, or — c: and,

by substituting the above values in the wolf, the same
appears to be 212 -f 2m, as in cor. 3; and by the same
in theorem 6, we get —2 -f ~r ra ' or "V c * tne sna n?
temperament of the major sixth ; the same with that
of the fifth ; see cor. 8.
This is the Mean Tone system of Salinas. Zarlino,
Aretinus, &c. Dr. Smith's Harmonics, p. 36,41,&c.
wherein the adjaceat flat and sharp notes are distant
212 -f 2m, or an enharmonic Diesis, as appears by
r t
substituting; the above values of — and — in cor. Q.

It is also nearly the same with a division of the
octave into 112 equal parts, (see M. Sauveur's table
above quoted), wherein —2*82902 is the flat tempera-
ment of the fifth; — c above, being — 2«7519662.
Scholium 3. If a douzeave be required, in which the major
sixths should be perfect, we have in theorem 6,
r 11 . u—Zt
