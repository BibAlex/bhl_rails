452 On Refraction,
each degree, there are given the logarithms of the refraction
in seconds and their differences : and in two auxiliary tables
are given the logarithms of the factors for correcting it for
the variations of height in the barometer and thermometer.
To make these corrections depending upon the temperature
always affirmative as far as the table extends, he has added
respectively to the logarithms of the two last tables their
greatest negative logarithm taken positively, and subtracted
from it the logarithms of the first table.
To this succeeds a Table of mean refractions for true di-
stances from the zenith for every degree down to 80 , and
for every 10' thence to Ql°, with their differences, adapted
for 0" 76 metre of the barometer, and 12°\3 of the centigrade
thermometer*, with two auxiliary tables for reducing it to
any other state of the atmosphere. Directions are also
given for using them, together with the formulae from
which they were computed, reduced to a more simple
form. %
In noticing the latest improvement made in this subject,
for which we are indebted to one of our own countrymen,
it is but fair to return him those acknowledgements to
which he is so justly entitled. When gentlemen of for-
tune give up the gay amusements of the world, and turn
aside from the pleasures of fashionable life, to cultivate
science in retirement, they deserve our warmest thanks : and
when we add to this the consideration that the science
they cultivate is not only one of the most interesting and
sublime, but of the utmost importance to a commercial na-
tion like Great Britain, our thanks certainly must be changed
into something more like gratitude.
There are, indeed, very few who can afford to purchase
instruments of sufficient accuracy to make improvements
in a science so far advanced; and still fewer of those that
so amply possess the means of life, who would bestow that
time and attention which are requisite in acquiring the ne-
cessary knowledge forlhis purpose, and turning it to useful
account.
Such is the present state of the navy of England, and
her maritime concerns, that the improvement of astronomy
is a subject which calls seriously for attention; more espe-
cially, as we have but one public institution for that pur-
pose. The commerce of France is nothing in comparison
of ours, yet the greatest encouragement is given in that
country to those who promote every science connected
