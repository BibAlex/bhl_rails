1 18 Analysis of several Varieties of Salt,
the mean of which is 2033. Sir Isaac Newton states it at
2143, and Hasscnfratz at 2200*. All that was necessary
for my purpose was an approximation to the truth ; and
the introduction of a small error could be of no importance,
provided it were the same in every case, since the compari-
son would siill hold good.
The specific gravity of rock salt, there can he little diffi-
culty in determining with precision. A piece of this salt f,
1 of such perfect transparency that I had reserved it as a
cabinet specimen, weighed in the air 513 grains, and lost,
when weighed in alcohol, 194 grains. The alcohol, at the
temperature of 56° Fahrenheit, had the specific gravity of
820, and hence that of the salt may be estimated at 2170.
Another specimen 'considerably less pure, and more ap-
proaching to a fibrous fracture, had the specific gravity of
2125 only.
For ascertaining the specific weights of artificial varieties
of salts, T used a verv simple contrivance. It consisted of
a glass globe about 34- diameter,' having a stem or neck 10
inches long. Sixteen cubic inches of water (each 252|
grains at 60° Fahrenheit,) filled the whole of the globe, and
about half an inch of the lower part of the neck ; and from
the line where the water stood in the instrument, it was
accurately graduated upwards into hundredth narts of a
cubical inch. Into this vessel I poured exactly sixteen
cubic inches of a perfectly saturated solution of common
salt ; and then added 400 grains of the salt under examina-
tion, washing down the particles that adhered to the neck
by a portion of the liquid, which had been previously taken
out of the globe for the purpose. As much as possible of
the air which adhered to the salt was dislodged by agita-
tion, and the increase of bulk was then observed.
Care was taken that the salts were all of equal temperature
and dryness, and thai no change of temperature happened
during the experiment.
