The refraction deduced from Bradley's very neat and
simple formula was in a few years adopted by nearly all
the astronomers of eminence throughout Europe, The ex-
treme facility with which it might he computed, and the
corrections applied, whether from the, formula itself or from
tables ready calculated for that purpose, was a powerful re-
commendation in its favour ; but its near agreement with
observations soon established it.
In 1805, the very ingenious and profound M. de la Place
in his Mecavique Celeste* favoured the world with a chap-
ter on this subject, wherein he has displayed as much saga-
cious penetration as deep mathematical learning and ability.
He begins with considering the trajectory of a ray of light
traversing the atmosphere; and by supposing all its layers
spheric, and of variable density, according to some function
of their height, he deduces a differential formula for the
refraction whose integral he then finds ; but, he observes,
this equation supposes that the refractive forces of the layers
of the atmosphere are directly proportional to their density,
which is the result of Hawksbee's experiments. Never-
theless, it is possible that this assumption may not be
strictly correct, and it would be useful if more experiments
were made on the subject. He then find! that the hypo-
thesis of an uniform temperature is erroneous, as well as
that of the density decreasing in arithmetic progression,
when the height increases in a similar progression ; and he
says, " the constitution of the atmosphere being com-
prised between the two limits of a density decreasing in
arithmetic progression, and of one decreasing in geometric
