On Pendulums,
83
Steel rod expands downwards the quicksilver expands up-
wards, and vice versa* The rate of the clock will show
whether the pendulum be over or under corrected ; conse-
quently by taking a little quicksilver out of the bob, or
adding a little, the compensation may be adjusted to the
utmost degree of exactness, and with very little trouble.
It may be supposed that a pendulum cannot be adjusted
for heat and cold by the going of the clock, but the rate of
my clock shows that this supposition is not well founded ;
for when a wooden pendulum was attached to it, its rate
of going was affected merely by dryness and moisture;
but with a mercurial pendulum its rate was affected only by
heat and cold, the pendulum being a small matter under
corrected; but this variation in its rate during twelve
months was. very little more than one second per day, al-
though the temperature of the outward air did not vary
less, by Fahrenheit's scale, than 70 degrees.
The following register of the going of this clock was
computed from the sun's transits over the meridian, ob-
served with a 3{ feet transit telescope.

the daily rate of the transit clock at the Royal Observatory
