38 Proposal for an Iron Tunnel, &c.
vast weight and great length, the power of 67 screws at
each joining would be inadequate to hold the whole per-
fectly together; and that in case of accident the whole
must be infallibly lost, as it Would then be impossible to
remove it from the spot on which it wonld immediately
sink, or even to separate the different parts of it. But as
the tunnel formed in the manner proposed will be sub-
1 to no particular force whatsoever at it* launching,
but be altogether equally borne up by the rising tide ; as
the weights necessary to sink it may he all so gradually
applied as to ensure its regular descent, to which the
form of the whole when joined as above, viz. convex at
the top and rising at the ends, together with the greater
thickness of the metal at the bottom, are circumstances
particularly favourable; and as from the nature of the
bottom it is sure to rest on a soft and uniform bed of sand,
on which it cannot meet with any object to occasion any
partial bearing, â€” I conceive the danger of accident is very-
remote, and the strength of the entire sufficiently secured :
besides, trials may be made in a sale situation.
The chief difficulty appears to me to be the excavation
of the bed of the river to the depth required. The best
mode of effecting this, or whether it would not be better
to choose another situation in which the existing depth
might be found sufficient, I leave to more able and ex-
perienced engineers to determine; stating merely, that as
the materials of which the tunnel is to be composed can
be procured for about ^44,000; allowing fifty per cent,
additional for all other charges incurred in its execution,
I do not conceive the expense would exceed the sum of
^66,000.
I beg leave further to add, that if it should be desired to
enlarge this tunnel so as to afford a foot-path in addition
to the space allowed for two carnages to pass, [ conceive
it may safely be done by giving it six more feet in width,
making altogether 24 feet between the interior flanches ;
and in order to afford it still greater strength, I would in
this case omit the interior lateral flanches, and in the room
thereof, applv plates of cast-iron of three or four in< hes
thick, the full height of the sides, to extend from the mid-
dle of one frame to that of the next, to be fastened bv a
number of the same kind of screws to the sides of the two
adjoining frames, with sheet-lead between and completely
covering the joint inside. This would give the tunnel
great additional strength without much increasing its
weight, besides that it would leave nearly a foot more of
free
