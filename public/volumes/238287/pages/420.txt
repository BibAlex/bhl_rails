tion, and an equilibrium of attraction, may give to a com-
pound, containing several constituents, that refractory cha-
racter, which is generally attributed to unity of constitution,
or to the homogeneous nature of its parts?
Besides the compound of the phosphoric sublimate and
ammonia, and the other analogous compounds which have
been referred to, it is probable that other compounds of like
nature may be formed of the oxides, alkalies, and earths,
with the oxymuriatic combinations, or of the oxymuriatic
compounds with each other; and should this be the case,
the more refined analogies of chemical philosophy will be
extended by these new, and, as it would seem at first view,
contradictory facts. For if, as 1 have siid, oxymuriatic
acid gas be referred to the same class of bodies as oxygen
gas, then, as oxygen, is not an acid, but forms acids by
combining with certain inflammable bodies, so oxymuriatic
acid, by uniting to similar substances, may be conceived to
form either acids, which is the case when it combines with
hydrogen, or compounds like acids or oxides, capable of
forming neutral combinations, as in the instances of the
oxymuriales of phosphorus and tin.
Like oxygen, oxymuriatic acid is attracted by the positive
surface in Voltaic combinations ; and on the hypothesis of
the connexion of chemical attraction with electrical powers,
â€¢all its energies of combination correspond with those of a
body supposed to be negative in a high degree.
And in most of its compounds, except those containing
the alkaline metals, which may be conceived in the highest
degree positive, and the metals with which it forms inso-
luble compounds, it seems still to retain its negative char
racter.
I shall occupy the time of the Society for a few minutes
longer only, for the purpose of detailing a few observations
connected with the Bakerian lectures, delivered in 'the two
last years; particularly those parts of them relating to sul-
phur and phosphorus, which new and more minute inquiries
have enabled me to correct or extend.
J have already mentioned that there are considerable dif-
ferences in the results of experiments, made on the action
of potassium, on sulphur and phosphorus, and their com-
binations with hydrogen, according to different circumstances
of the process. 1 shall now refer to such of these circum-
stances as I have been able fully to investigate.
The able researches of Dr. Thomson have shown that
sulphur, in its usual state, contains small quantities of acid
matter; and though, in my first experiments, I conceived
