188 On prime and ultimate Ratios.
T say, that the measures of such ratios never can attain the
limits which we have assigned to them : they may, how-
ever, continually approximate towards them ; and when the
measures of the ratios differ from those limits by less than
any assignable difference, they may be said to be equal.
This being allowed, it is evident that in making use of
those ratios, after having supposed that they have attained
to such ultimate states, or limits, we continually approxi-
mate towards true results ; and when the results thus ob-
tained, differ from the true results by a quantity indefinitely
small, they may be said to be indefinitely near the truth,
and in practice the indefinitely small error may be neg-
lected, as being of no sensible magnitude.
This is all that Newton meant in his first lemma in the
Principia, where he says that Ci quantities, and the ratios
of quantities, which in any finite time converge continually
to equality, and before the end of that time approach nearer
the one to the other than by any given difference, become
ultimately equal."
It was the calling, those results true which are only ap-
proximations indefinitely near the truth, that gave the au-
thor of the Analyst so much advantage in exposing the
errors in the metaphysics of the fluxional calculus ; and it
was very inconsiderate in Philalethes (supposed to be Dr.
Jurin) to argue that the error occasioned by neglecting a
certain very small quantity did not affect the result of any
operation : â€” that did not in the least tend to overthrow the
arguments adduced by the author gf the Analyst, since it
was the error in principle that he struck at, and not the
quantity of error that the making use of a false principle
might produce.
The conclusions obtained by the method of fluxions are
not absolutely true, nor did Newton ever consider them as
such ; they are approximations, which produce no sensible
errors; and had his host of defenders proceeded no further
than this, all the arguments that could have been brought
forward against this method must have vanished.
But instead of giving up what was evidently untenable,
all the varied arguments which imagination aided by science
could suggest, were brought forward in order to get rid of
the difficulties which Berkley had pointed out, but without
effect; for truth is at all times consistent with itself, and
what is once wrong can never be proved to be right.
Newton was desirous of determining the areas of curvi-
linear figures : this was at all times a great desideratum,
and hadT exercised the talents of philosophers in all ages.
