This is the system of Mr. John ITolden, since me-
tamorphosed into an irregular douzeave in the article
Monochord, Enc. Brit. 3d edit. vol. xii. p. 240, and
into a still different one, by the Rev. Mr. Hawkes. (See
your xxvith volume, p. 171, and xxxih volume, p. 5.)
It also approaches near to M. Sauveur's system of
43 equal parts in the octave, (see his general table
above referred to) wherein —^ 11 772 is the fiat tem-
perament of the fifth ; --c above, being —2*2015732.
One other case of this kind, viz. where the major
thirds are tempered flat as much as the major sixths
are tempered sharp, will be found to arise from dif-
ferent considerations in scholium 11.
Scholium 6. If a douzeave be required, in which the tem-
perament and wolf of the fifth shall he equal, we have
from theorem 1, — r = 1 \r— 125, or 12r = 125, whence
r 1 . ; *
— ±= — : also —t = 11/ — iu or 12/ = ?/, whence —
si 7 u
= — -, and 2 + -~ m, or — c, is the flat tempera-
\ & J i> li
ment of the fifth, in this case: and which substituted
in theorem 3, either for wolf or temperament, gives
2 7
72 4- -^-m, or ■ -c, the sharp temperament of the
4. 3
major third; also, in theorem 6, gives 82 -\- ~~tn 9
8
or - c, the sharp temperament of the major sixth.
This is the Isotonic or Ecjual Temperament Svstem of
Mersennus, &c. called bv Mr. Marsh and others,! hough
improperly, the Equal Harmony System (see scholium
10). See vol. xxix. p. 347 : see also Dr. Smith's Har-
monics^. lSSand 1(37. In the latter page, however, ihe
temperaments of theVth,VIth and i I Id are mistakenly
said to be •— , — and 1Q , instead of --, -- and —
of a comma, lis they are above, very nearly.
Scholium 7. If a douzeave be required, in which the several
wolves shall differ from their respective temtieromnifs,
