being nearly full, must be well corked, set in a cool place,
and suffered to stand undisturbed for three or four months,
or until all the water shall have subsided, with the mucilage
on the top of it, and the oil, perfectly transparent, swim-
ming upon the'top of the mucilage. When time has thus
completed the operation, the pure oil must be poured off
into very small phials, and kept in a cool place, well corked,
to preserve it from the air.

LXVIII. A further Set of Fifteen Corollaries, to the Musical
Theorems in Page 39, by means of which, the Tempera-
ments of any one of the Concords being given, all the other
Temperaments ana all the Wolves can be calculated with
the greatest facility . By Mr. John Farey.
To Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, X he six musical Theorems which you did me the
favour to print in your 147th Number having given much
satisfaction to several of my musical acquaintances, I am
induced to send you 15 other Corollaries in addition to the
12 inserted at page 44: they are naturally divisible into
three classes, viz.
1st. When the temperament of the ffth is given.
Corollary 13. The temperament of the Hid is = 1 1 2-f-m
— 4 x temperament of the Vth.

By theorem 3, 2 + m is the tern-
s u
4r At
perament of the Hid, and 2 + — m is 4 times
the temperament of V, by theorem 1 : the sum of these
is 1 1 2 -f m, whence the truth of the corollary is
manifest : as indeed it is, by merely abbrevating and
ordering theorem 3.
Corollary 14. 1 12 -f m •— 3 x temperament of V = tem-
perament of VI.
