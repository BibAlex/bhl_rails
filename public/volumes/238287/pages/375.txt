Of the Bogs in Ireland. 362
u Most of the bogs which lie to the eastward of the
Shannon, and which occupy a considerable portion of the
King's county and county of Kildare, are generally known
by the name of the Bog of Allen : it must not however be
supposed that this name is applied to any one great morass;
on the contrary, the bogs to which it is applied are per-
fectly distinct from each other, often separated by high
ridges of dry country and inclining towards different rivers,
as their natural directions for drainage, so intersected by
dry and cultivated land, that it may be affirmed generally
there is no spot of these bogs (to the eastward of the Shan-
non) so much as two Irish miles distant from the upland
and cultivated districts.
" With this first and general view of the subject, we had
no hesitation in selecting at once the whole of the eastern
portion of the great district above referred to, as the object
of our first inquiries, forming in itself one whole, whose
parts had more or less connexion with each other, lying in
the centre of Ireland, in the immediate vicinity of some of
the richest and best cultivated counties : intersected also by
the two great lines of navigation the Grand and the Royal
Canals, arid presenting in common apprehension very con-
siderable obstacles to improvement ; the overcoming of
which would in itself demonstrate the practicability of the
improvement of the bogs of Ireland in most other cases.
" We were further induced to form this selection on the
general principles of beginning at the end of the great divi-
sion above referred to, which lies nearest to the capital, and
proceeding gradually to its termination at the Western
Ocean; not however considering ourselves precluded from
making occasional exceptions, where particular circum-
stances might appear to require it.
"The proportion which the bogs in this district bear to
the entire of the bogs of Ireland, appeared to us a further
inducement ; and we are the more disposed to mention this,
as we find that by some \\e have been thought to have em-
barked in the first instance on too great a scale : on this we
shall merely observe, that having two years allotted to us
for the duration of our commission, we undertook at once
rather less than one third of our task, in the supposition
that it would require about eight months for its execution.
(( Having determined to give in charge the whole of this
district, it became the next object of our consideration, on
what principle we should subdivide it into the smaller di-
stricts, referred to in the first article of our instructions,
for the purpose of being assigned to separate engineers.
