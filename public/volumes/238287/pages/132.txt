120 Description of a Metallic Thermometer.
contrived by me, for the purpose of exhibiting the dif-
ference in temperature, or degrees of heat, which takes place
between the mercurial thermometer, the scale of which
terminates upwards, at 600째, and that of baked clay, or
Wedgwood's thermometer, the scale of which commences
at 1077째 of Fahrenheit, or red-heat, thus forming an inter-
mediate or connecting thermometer between the two above
mentioned.
A metallic composition is formed, not liable to alteration
in its quality or quantity by repeated exposure to heat, the
melting point of which is at a little below 600째 of Fahren-
heit, and its boiling point at 1200째. A case resembling
in form the glass case for the ordinary thermometer, but
somewhat larger, contains the metallic composition, and
the scale consists in a slender graduated rod, equal in
height at the commencement of the scale, that is when
the metallic composition is just liquid to the top of the
tube; the graduated rod terminating at the bottom in a
ihin, circular, fiat plate, which rests or floats as it were
upon the liquid metal; and in proportion as the latter ex r
pands and rises in the tube bv heat, the graduated rod is
buoyed up, or raised above the top of the tube, passing
through a perforated cover to the maximum, or boiling
point*.
The same principle, I might observe, admits of being
extended, for the purpose or ascertaining the variation in
temperature up to the most intense heat, perhaps, that can
be required.
It is unnecessary to state here, that the influence of the
incumbent atmosphere upon, the surface of the liquid me-
tal within the open tube is too inconsiderable, even at the
commencement of the scale, to deserve notice, and at a
higher temperature diminishes to nothing; especially if
the whole of the liquid contained in the thermometer, as
ought to be the case in the use of every thermometer , be
completely immersed or subjected to the temperature, the
degree of which it is intended to indicate.
A method similar to the above, I should think, might
be applicable to the purpose of showing in a ready way the
degree of expansion in metals bv heat ; but the elongation
of a cylinder of any metal, by increase of temperature, is
* The thermometer case and graduated rod arc at present formed of
pipe-makers' clay previously prepared by having been exposed to a suffi-
cient degree of heat.
The scale of this new thermometer is an exact continuation of the scale
in the mercurial thermometer; the lower degree of the former correspond-
ing with, or indicating like temperatures with, the upper degrees of the
mercurial thermometer. much
