Description of a Manometer. 461
by tbe liquid contained in the apparatus, may be determined
by precipitating this acid by lime water, or by water of
barytes, either from the whole or from a part of the liquid :
after that, we introduce the precipitate into a flask, adapt the
tube of a funnel to it, through which we pour a quantity of
dilute sulphuric acid ; and by the loss of weight which takes
place, we ascertain the quantity of carbonic acid which was
dissolved in the liquid, and which is disengaged from the
carbonate. — We may, by the processes which I have indi-
cated, ascertain in a volume of air equal to that of a kilo-
gramme of water, and contained in a manometer which has
this dimension, the change which would be produced by
the volume of one gramme of water ; the production of a
quantity of carbonic acid which does not exceed a centi-
gramme in weight; and a variation in the proportions of the
oxygen and azote which does not exceed a centieme : this
is a precision which would seem to be sufficient for all the
determinations which we would wish to establish.
We have besides the advantage of being able to repeat
and compare the tests at different times, without in-
terrupting the experiment, and to vary several of its cir-
cumstances: 1 have constructed manometers of different
dimensions, in order to apply them to different objects^
Hitherto I have made but a small number of observations
with this instrument, and I have not pursued them with
the care which they require; but my chief object in this
publication is to induce those to employ it who are occupied
with experiments of this nature, and who have more leisure
and perseverance than I have. I shall describe some early
attempts.
M.Theodore de Saussure, to whom we are indebted for
some learned and laborious researches upon vegetation, has
shown, that in most of the cases where we suppose thai the
oxygen gas was absorbed by a vegetable or animal substance,
there is simply formed a combination of the, carbon of
these substances with the oxygen of the atmosphere; that
the volume of the gas did not diminish, except on account
of the absorption of the carbonic acid by water; and that
at the same time water was produced by the combination
of the oxygen and hydrogen which existed in the sub-
stance ; so that, although the residue had been deprived of a
part of its carbon by the action of the oxygen £>as, it is
nevertheless found more carbonized afterwards, because it
has been stripped of a greater proportion of hydrogen and
oxygen than of carbon*.
