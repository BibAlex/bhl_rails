Description of a Manometer. 46*3
duced by a colouring substance of a different species, which
was cam peachy wood.
The decoction of campeachy generally obtained has a
blue colour, because we prepare it in copper vessels: jt is
of a fine red when glass or silver vessels are used.
This very clear decoction was cooled in a bottle with a
ground stopper, in order that it might not be altered by the
contact of the air, and placed in the manometer, the ther-
mometer being at 18,5, the barometer O m .7593: four days
afterwards the liquor was turbid, and the temperature being
the same, the interior barometer fell () m .03. This lowering
continued for two months, and in this time the liquor beeame
very turbid and of a reddish fawn colour: a trifling sedi-
ment was formed, and some crusts.
At the end of the experiment the thermometer was 21 ,25,
the total lowering of the barometer O m .05(), the air of the
manometer wheif referred to its primitive pressure contained
in 100 parts
Carbonic acid , . . 3 oi
Oxygen 6'55
Azote . 89*54
There was at. the end of the operation an increase of tem-
perature of 3° 25, which requires the following correction
in the volume of the gas at the primitive pressure of
,n .7593.
According to the determinations which M. Gay-Lussac
communicates, the quantity by which a volume of air is di-
lated by 1°, is expressed by the height of the barometer
which represents the tension of this air divided by 266,66,
and becomes on setting out from the degree above zero equal
to the quotient of the tension by this divisor, augmented
by the number of degrees from which we begin to count
the dilatation. In the present case, the height of the baro-
meter at the commencement of the operation = 0'".7593,
the temperature 18°, the column of mercury corresponding
to a dilatation of 1° will therefore be
£ ■»#»» = 0^.00266,
26660+18
and that which is to take off for the dilatation is 3°. 25 =
0,00864. * . .
As to the vapour which ought to be formed on bringing
the numbers of the table of Dalton to the degrees of the
centigrade thermometer, and to the divisions or the metre,
we find that the tension of the vapour being 21°,25,
= O m .018J7 —
and at 18° = cr .01536. The
