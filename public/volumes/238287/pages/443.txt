Obliquity of the Ecliptic, . 431,
fVeret's calculations want a slight correction. By recti-
fying them, and allowing for the refraction and the parallax
of the sun supposed to be 8",7> J find 79° 22' 39,6 for
the altitude of the superior edge of the sun's disk at the
summer solstice, aud of 31° 35' 1",8 for thatof the said cA^a
in the winter solstice* By subtracting the apparent semi-
diameter of the sun at the two solstices, which I find to be
15' 47">7 and 16' 14'$3 respectively, the corresponding al-
titudes to the centre will be 79° 6' 5i",9, and 31° 18' 47",3,
which gives 23° 54' 2", 2 for the obliquity of the ecliptic,
and 34 J 47' 10" for the polar altitude; which, being nearly
a mean between the three observations of the missionaries,
proves the accuracy of Tcheou-Kong's determinations.
Freret by certain and ingenious calculations had in the
same dissertation fixed theepochaofTcheou K^i^s regency
between the year 1098 and HOl, before our aera. 1 shall
observe that in this respect he agrees perfectly with Father
Gaubil. I shall then suppose that these observations were
made in the year 1 100 before our aera. I have given in the
3d vol. of my Mec. Cel. b. vi. ch. 12, a formula by which
the obliquity of the ecliptic may be determined for a very
distant period : and t expressing a number of years elapsed
since 1750, the value of this obliquity in decimal degrees
will be
26°,0706— 3676',6l— cos(^3",0446) — 10330,4 sin (tgg\ 1 227)
whereby t — — - 2850, which gives in decimal degrees the
corresponding obliquity of the ecliptic = 26 \5 "6il, or in
ordinary degrees =25° 51' 53' ; which must be increased
about 5', because the obliquity of the ecliptic in 1750 ex-
ceeded to that amount the quantity used in the preceding
formula: thus 1100 years before our sera, the obliquity of
the ecliptic was 23° 51' 58', — a result which only differs
2' 4" from that given by die observed lengths of the gno-
mon shadow in the two solstices. A more perfect coinci-
dence cannot be wished for, if allowance be made for the
uncertainty attending this sort of observation, owing parti-
cularly to the penumbra which renders the shadow ill-de-
fined.
If, together with Father Gaubil, the observation alone of
the summer solstice was taken into account, and the polar
altitude at Loyang was supposed with him to be 34° 43' 15",
by subtracting its complement 55° 16' 45" from the alti-
tude 79 3 6' 52" of the sun's centre, determined by the length
of the shadow in the summer solstice, the obliquity of
the ecliptic would be 23 2 50' f. The result of my for-
mula is very nearly a mean between that and the obliquity
given
