thermometer 45° of Fahrenheit without, or 4 9° within, which
he considers as the mean state of the atmosphere*. With
respect to the latter, he finds the multiplier for all degrees
below 49° within, to be -0024 ; and above! 40° within,
•0023 f: but for those above or below 45° without, he finds
it -0021. Instead, however, of the number 3, which Dr.
Bradley had adopted for his coefficient of r, Mr. Groom-
bridge finds that 3*3625 agrees better with observations ;
consequently his numbers and coefficients will give us the
following four equations.
1st. For the thermometer within, and below 49°, putting
d = 49 — A.
Refr". = 58"-lI9'iX/,(Z — 3«3625r) x — —. x (1 -}- -002k/).
2dly. For the thermometer within and above 49", put
d = /i — 49.
Refr". = 5S"-1192x£,(Z — 3'3625r)x— -g X (1— 0023J),
3dly. For the thermometer without and below 45°, put
d = 45 —h.
Refr". = 58"'1192 X/,(Z — 3-3625r) x -■ X (1 -f-'002ld),
4thly. For the thermometer without and above 45°, put
d = h —45.
Refr". = 5S"-1192X£,(Z — 3*3625r)x— -^ X (1 -•0'021 d).
Or, in logarithms :
1st. Thermometer within and below 49°, put d = 49° —h° f
then :

* Mr. Kirwan states that the mean temperature of any place is equal to
84 — Sis' 2 , latitude. According to (his the mean temperature of Blackheath
would be 5^°8, but its exposed situation may possibly be the cause of this
•mall difference — Estimate of the Temperature of different Climates, or Dal-
ton's Meteorological. Observations, pa;-;e 160.
f Mr. Palton found likewise that the expansion of air from 55° to 1S3§,
or for the first 78.;", was 167 parts, whilst th6 expansion irom ISS^* to 212°,
or for the next 78£°, was only 1 58 parts, or nine less i hjU> 1 lie former. So that
it appears there is a difference between the expansion of air for the high de-.
grees and that for the low ones. — Manchester Memoirs, vol. v.; or Thom-
