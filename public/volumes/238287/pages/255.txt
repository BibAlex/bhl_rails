On the Land Winds of Coromandel, &c, 243
It will, however, be best to make observations as often as
possible both on the one and the other, as it has been as-
certained, both by Mr. Cavendish and the late Dr. Hunter,
that the temperature of the waters at any given place is a
most accurate measure of its mean heat ; a determination
of which is not only an object of considerable curiosity in
itself, but of very great consequence in an agricultural point
of view.
The annexed form for registering the observations scarcely
requires an explanation. The first column is for number-
ing the observations, which extremely facilitates the re-
ference to them. The succeeding columns are fully ex-
plained by their titles. The last, called Results, is added,
in order that those persons who choose it may place in one
view the observations, and the altitudes deduced from them.
Printed sheets in this form, ready for use, may be had of
Mr. Jones. The back of each page is left blank, for the
convenience of inserting any other notes or observations.

XLVII. On the Land Winds of Corom.andel, and their
Causes. By William Roxburgh, M.D.*
JL he land winds on the coast of Coromandel are those
hot winds which blow at a particular season of the year,
and hour of the day, from the western hills, commonly
called the Ghauts, towards the Bay of Bengal. In the
more inland countries, as above the Ghauts, "they are not
