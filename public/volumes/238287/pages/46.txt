34 Proposal for an Iron Tunnel
The magnesia was precipitated by caustic polash : h
weighed, after desiccation, 16 grains.
u°. The oxides of iron and manganese were dissolved in
an excess of muriatic acid, and pouring, by little and little,
saturated carbonate of potash into the dissolution until red
floccules were visible, and then leaving it to repose 24
hours, all the carbonate of iron precipitated, whilst that of
the manganese remained in the liquor.
The carbonate of iron, after calcination, gave 24 grains
of oxide: and "that of manganese, deposited by ebullition,
by the same operation, only 1J-* — Which makes in all: —
Silex 41
Sulphur 24-
Chromic acid 2£
Alumine 1
Magnesia 16
Lime 3
Oxide of iron . . 30
Oxide of manganese ... . 1£

Analysis of the metallic iron isolated by the magnetic
needle* 1°. 100 parts of this stone gave 28 of metallic iron,
which is very brittle, owing to the nickel it contains. 2°.
40 grains of this iron were dissolved in nitro-muriatic acid,
and by means of ammonia in excess the oxide of iron
was separated, which weighed 45 grains. The dissolution
of nickel in this alkali was evaporated to siccity to expell
all the ammonia. The oxide of nickel was redissolved
by muriatic acid, and precipitated by the prussiate of
potash, which gave one grain of the prussiate of nickel.
We may infer, from these physical characters, and results
of chemical analysis, that this stone is like all other me-
teoric stones hitherto known.
V. Proposal for constructing, and putting in its Place,
an Iron Tunnel under the River Thames. By Colonel
Lennox.
To Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, 1 herewith send you a plan for a tunnel under the
Thames, which I hope you will not deem unworthy of a
place in your valuable Magazine.
