35S Researches on the muriatic Acid
tion so rapid, as that of oxymuriatic acid upon metals and
inflammable bodies.
It may be said, that a strong argument in favour of the
hypothesis, that oxymuriatic acid consists of an acid basis
united to oxygen, exists in the general analogy of the com-
pounds of oxymuriatic acid, and metals, to the common
neutral salts : but this analogy, when strictly investigated,
will be found to be very indistinct ; and even allowing it, it
may be applied with as much force to support an opposite
doctrine, namely, that the neutral salts are compounds of
bases with water, and the metals of bases with hydrogen ;
and that, in the case of the action of oxymuriatic acid and
metals, the metal furnishes hydrogen to form muriatic acid,
and a basis to produce the neutral combination.
That the quantity of hydrogen evolved during the decom-
position of muriatic acid gas by metals, is the same that
would be produced during the decomposition of water by the
Same bodies, appears, at first view, an evidence in favour of
the existence of water in muriatic acid gas; but as there is
only one known combination of hydrogen with oxymuriatic
acid, one quantity must always be separated. Hydrogen is
disengaged from its oxymuriatic combination, by a metal,
in the same manner as one metal is disengaged by another
from similar combinations; and of all inflammable bodies
that form compounds^of this kind, except perhaps phos-
phorus and sulphur, hydrogen is that which seems to ad-
here to oxymuriatic acid with the lesat force.
I have caused strong explosions from an electrical jar to
pass through oxymuriatic gas, by means of points of pla-
tina, for several hours in succession; but it seemed not to
undergo the slightest change.
I electrized the oxymuriates of phosphorus and sulphur
for some hours, by the power of the Voltaic apparatus of
1000 double plates : no gas separated, but a minute quan-
tity of hydrogen, which I am inclined to attribute to the
presence of moisture in the apparatus employed ; for I once
obtained hydrogen from Libavius's liquor by a similar ope-
ration : but I have ascertained that this was owing to the
decomposition of water adhering to the mercury ; and in
some late experiments made with 2000 double plates, in
which the discharge was from platina wires, and in which
the mercury used for confining the liquor was carefully
boiled, there was no production of any permanent elastic
matter.
As there are no experimental evidences of the existence
