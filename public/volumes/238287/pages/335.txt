Description of a Camp Telegraph. 323
B. Is the signal of a point or period, and is to be made
at the close of a number, as 275, by placing one signal-man.
three paces to the right, and the other three paces to the
left, of the centre-point.
C. Is the signal of error, and is to be made when your
correspondent has mistaken your last signal : â€” Suppose you
had made the signal No. 2, which is 20 paces to the right,
and your correspondent answers with 20 paces to the left,
which is the signal No. 7. Then make the signal of error,
by placing one signal-man three paces to the left, and the
other 10 paces to the right of the centre-point; and when
your correspondent has repeated this signal, thereby con-
vincing you he is sensible of his error, repeat the signal that
had been mistaken, and, if rightly answered, proceed as
before.
D. Is the repeating signal, and is to be made if the
last communication is not understood. It is' made by
placing one signal-man three paces, and the other 20 paces,
to the left.
