264 Method of constructing
inches above the ground ; upon this brickwork the planks
are placed, and bolted together. Two boards, like that
shown at G, are placed between the planks at the ends, to
form the ends of the mould; these boards are placed between
the two bolts a a, which are seen close together at the end
of the moulds, and are held fast by that means; the earth
is now to be rammed in between the moulds by the rammer
with an iron head X. When the mould is filled with earth
and well rammed down, the keys are to he taken out of the
bolts, and the bolts drawn out ; the planks are then removed,
and put together again, a length further upon the wall, the
bolts at the end being put through the holes left in the wall,
only one of the end boards is now put in, and the ramming
proceeds as before : in this manner straight walls may be
built of any length; and when the lower course is finished,
then the mould may be taken to pieces, and put together
again upon that course, the lower bolts of the frame being
put through the bolt holes which the upper bolts made in
the wall at the first operation, to insure that the upper part
of the wall is in the same place, and exactly over the lower.
When a wall is to be built thinner than usual, a block of
wood must be placed under the head of each bolt, so as to
diminish the space between the planks.
When the angle walls of buildings are to be made, the
apparatus is put together, as shown in the plate; four of the
planks are put together to form a right-angled mould, one
end of each of the planks F and H is furnished with double
bolts, the other ends have'each twoeyebolts fixed into them,
as shown separately at bd; then a bolt n connects the two
moulds, so as to form a hinge ; the planks are kept together,
so as to be perpendicular to each other, by a long iron rod
K, hooked into eyeboits fixed in the planks. The outside
planks of the mould are joined together in a different man-
ner, see fig. 5, that of one frame being longer -than that of
the other, and has two pair of holes through its end O, to
receive the bolts / /,' which are fastened to the ends of the
other shorter plank, and the keys are put through the ends
of the bolts, to secure the planks together; a piece of wood
P is occasionally placed between the end of the short plank
and the side of the other, to increase the space between the
planks, to make a thicker wall, the two bolts at the end of
the plank being received into the notches in the piece of
wood, and these bolts are then put through the holes ZZ
of the lon<r plank. Jn building the angle wall, it is neces-
sary that the vertical joint formed between each mould
ehould not be over one another, but arranged in the same
manner
