in thickness, and which almost universally covers the sur-
face of the gravel, by obstructing the course of the waters
in a country having naturally but little fall, may, by creating
a general stagnation in them, and thereby forming extensive
shallow lakes, have caused the growth of the Sphagnum
paluslre*, and other aquatic mosses and plants, of which
the mass of our bogs is composed.
" This island, though separated from the southern range
of hills by a low boggy valley, may on a general view be
considered as a continuation of that range.
te Perhaps a short geological description of this ridge,
'which, on account of its height and steepness, forms the
most prominent and interesting feature in the county,)
though apparently foreign to the general object of this re-
port, may (by preventing ignorant people from search-
ing for limestone and other manures where they do not
exist) be considered as an useful and necessary appendage.
u Near Ballyteague Castle, in the northern edge of the
Island of Allen, stratified limestone makes its appearance
at the surface, dipping 20 degrees east of south, at an angle
of 5 degrees from the horizon. The stone is principally
used for building, as on account of its containing a large
proportion (according to my analysis 15 per cent.) of silex,
it requires much fuel to burn it into lime.
" The next rock visible crops out about two miles to the
â€¢outhward of Ballyteague, at the base of the Hill of Allen
near the village called the Leap of Allen, the intermediate
country being covered by hills of limestone gravel ; it is a
species of conglomerate, composed of rounded quartz peb-
bles, varying in size from minute sand to six inches in dia-
meter, connected together by a red iron-shot, argillaceous
cement ; then beds of a deep brick red slate ; clav much
interspersed with mica is found interstratified with the
conglomerate : the dip is 30 degrees east of south at an
angle of 7 degrees from the horizon. Southward of this
quarry, rises the Hill of Allen, a very steep conical hill
about 300 feet high (reckoning from its base) ; it is com-
posed of an irregular unstratified mass of fine-grained green-
stone, the crystal of hornblende and feldspar being very
minute ; transparent calcareous spar is frequently observable
in the mass, rarely large crystals of feldspar are found in-
terspersed ; the rock on approaching the summit of the hill
becomes more crystalline, detached masses of beautiful por-
phyretic greenstone thickly studded with large crystals of
