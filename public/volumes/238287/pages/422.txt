action of water about one cubical inch and -j-g- of hydrogen is
made to act upon about half a grain of sulphur, some sulphur
sublimes during the combination, which always takes place
with heat and light, and from t 't t0 tV °* a cubical inch of
sulphuretted hydrogen is evolved. The compound acted
on by muriatic acid, saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen,
affords from -j 9 - to -f-^ of a cubical inch of pure sulphuretted
hydrogen.
When more sulphur is used so as to be from twice to
ten times the weight of the potassium, the quantity of sul-
phuretted hydrogen evolved by the action of the acid, is
from T 7 - to T 9 y-; but if heat be applied to the combination,
so as to drive- off the superfluous sulphur, the quantity of
gas collected is very little inferior to that produced from the
combination in which a small proportion of sulphur is used;
and I am inclined to believe, from the phenomena pre-
sented in a great number of experiments, that sulphur and
potassium, when heated together under common circum-
stances, combine only in one proportion, in which the metal
is to the sulphur nearly as three to one in weight; and in
which the quantities are such that the compound burns into
neutral sulphate of potash.
When a grain of potassium is made to act upon about
J'l cubical mches of sulphuretted hydrogen, all the hydro-
gen is set free, and a sulphuret of potassium containing one-
fourth of sulphur is formed, exactly the same as that produced
by the immediate combination of sulphur and the metal.
When sulphuretted hydrogen is employed in larger quan-
tities, there is an absorption of this gas, and a volume is
taken up about equal to the quantity of hydrogen disen-
gaged, and a compound of sulphuretted hydrogen and sul-
phuret of potash is formed, which gives sulphuretted hy-
drogen by the action of an acid, nearly double in quantity
to that given by the sulphuret of potassium.
From a number of experiments I am inclined to believe
that potassium and phosphorus, in whatever quantities they
are heated together, combine only in one proportion, a grain
of potassium requiring about f of a grain of phosphorus to
form a phosphuret; which when acted upon by muriatic
acid, produces from -*f to ±% of a cubical inch of phosphu-
ret ted hydrogen.
Haifa gram of potassium decomposes nearly three cubical
inches of plmsphuretted hydrogen, and sets free rather more
than four cubical inches of hydrogen ; and the phosphuret
formed seems to be of the same kind as that produced by
direct combination of the metal with phosphorus.
