For the construction of this battery, and of other instru-
ments applicable to new researches, a fund of upwards of
^lOOO has been raised by subscription, from members of
the Royal Institution. As yet, the whole combination has
not been put into action ; but reasoning from the effects
of that part of it which has been used, some important
phsenomena may be expected from so great an accumula-
tion of electrical power.

The directors of the institution have great pleasure in
observing the progressive increase of vaccine inoculation,
and the influence of experience in satisfying the public of
its efficacy. Most of the above 12,065 patients being con-
