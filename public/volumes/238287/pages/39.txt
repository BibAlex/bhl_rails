against the mode of explaining the phenomena by suppos-
ing nitrogen decomposed in the operation ; but they cannot
be considered as decisive on this complicated and obscure
•question, and the opposite view may be easily defended.
Though I have already laid before the Society a (lumber
of experiments upon the decomposition of ammonia, yet I
shall not hesitate to detail some further operations which
have been conducted according to new views of the subject.
I concluded from the loss of weight taking place in the
electrical analysis of ammonia, that water or oxygen was
probably separated in this operation; but I was aware that
objections might be made to this mode of accounting for
the phenomenon.
The experiment of producing an amalgam from ammo-
nia, which regenerated volatile alkali, apparently by oxida-
tion, confirmed the notion of the existence of oxygen in
•this substance; at the same time it led to the suspicion, that
of the two gases separated by electricity, one, or perhaps
both, might contain metallic matter united to oxygen : and
the results of the distillation, of the fusible substance,
from potassium and ammonia, notwithstanding the ob-
jections I have made, can perhaps be explained on such a
supposition.
Thave made a number of experiments upon the decom-
position of considerable quantities of ammonia, both by
Voltaic and common electricity; and T have used an ap-
paratus (of which a figure is attached to this paper) in
which nothing was present but the gas, the metals for
conveying the electricity, and glass. The ammonia was
introduced by a stopcock which was cleared of common
air, into a globe that was exhausted, after bcins; filled two
or three times with ammonia : the gas that was used was
absolutely pure, the decomposition was performed without
any possibility of change in the volume of the elastic mat-
ter, and the apparatus was such, that the gas could be ex-
posed to a freezing mixture, and the whole weighed before
and after the experiment.
The object in keeping the volume the same during the
decomposition, was to produce the condensation of any
aqueous vapour, which if formed in small quantity in the
operation, (on the theory of the mechanical diffusion of
vapour in gases,) might in the common case of decompo-
sition, under the usual pressure, be in quantity nearly twice
as much in the hydrogen and nitrogen, as in the ammonia.
In all instances it was found, that there was no loss of
weight of the apparatus, nor was there any deposition of
