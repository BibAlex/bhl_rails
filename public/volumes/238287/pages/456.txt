appear, according to the report which Mr. Griffith, jnn.
has made on the subject; wherein, p. 15 and 16, the tract
of land called the Island of Allen is thus described : â€”
<c The surface of the Isle of Allen rises very quickly
from the bog on all sides, particularly to the north-west,
where it is composed (at least to a considerable depth) of
limestone gravel, forming very abrupt hills, in those places
where the face of the hills has been opened for the pur-
pose of raising stone and gravel, the mass is con-posed of
rounded limestone, varying in size from two feet in dia-
meter to less than one inch ; the largest are not so much
rounded as the small, frequently their sharp angles are
merely rubbed off; they are usually penetrated by contem-
poraneous veins of Lydian stone, varying in colour from
black to light grey; the colour of the limestone is usually
light smoke grey, rarely blueish black ; when it is, the
fracture is large conchoidal ; that of the grey is uneven,
approaching to earthy.
" The Lydian stone, when unattached to the limestone,
has usually a tendency to a rhomboidal form, sometimes
cubical, the edges are more or less rounded, the longitu-
dinal fracture is even, the cross fracture is conchoidal.
" From the strong resemblance that subsists between the
rolled limestone and its accompanying substances, and the
upper beds of the limetone strata, which extend from the
county of Tipperary, through Kilkenny, (where the lower
beds are used for marble,) Carlow, Queen's County, King's
County, Kildare, Meath, Westmeath, Dublin, &c. &c.
there can be no doubt that the least accumulation of lime-
stone gravel, which nearly covers the whole province of
Leinster (forming steep ridges of hills frequently above 300
feet high, and sometimes approaching the summits of lofty
primitive mountains) did originally form the upper beds of
the ljmetone strata, which when now found in situ are sel-
dom firm, on account of their alternating with thin beds of
slate, clav, usually much decomposed, and their being tra-
versed by numerous fissures and veins of calcareous spar and
Lydian stone.
" It is much moredifficult to trace the course of the cur-
rents which first removed the limestone from its native bed,
and afterwards having rolled the detached masses backwards
and forwards, deposited them on the sides of hills, whose
base had withstood the action of the waters, or by cross
currents and eddies formed independent hills and minor
ridges, the deposition of which, together with a subsequent
deposition o.f a bed of clay, varying from one to six feet
