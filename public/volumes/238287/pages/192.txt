1 80 Analysis of several Variet les of Salt.
if the brine be fully charged with salt, it effects no solution
of the muriate of soda, carried down along with the gyp-
sum; and then the first species of pan-scale results.
5. The salt oil, or mother liquor from sea water, a spe-
cimen of which I received from Dr. Thomson^ had the
specific gravity of 1277- It was abundantly precipitated
by muriate of barytes ; by pure ammonia, but not by the
carbonate ; and was not changed by oxalate of potash,
either immediately or after an interval of some hours. One
thousand parts of the dry salt consisted of
Muriate of magnesia 874
Sulphate of magnesia 70
Muriate of soda 56
1000.
6. The salt Irine, or liquor which drains from the Scotch
salt, had the specific gravity of only 1 188. It was affected
by the same tests as the salt oil, but less remarkably. The
dry residue contained
Muriate of magnesia 205
Sulphate of magnesia 135
Muriate of soda 1 . 660
1000.
7. The mother liquor, or lit tern pan Lymington, pre-
sented, on analysis, an unaccountable variation from the
similar fluid sent from Scotland, and gave a much larger
proportion of sulphate of magnesia. A considerable quan-
tity of this salt had, moreover, crystallized in the bottle
which contained the liquid. Its specific gravity was 1280.
One thousand parts of the dry salt contained of
Muriate of magnesia 640
Sulphate of magnesia 260
Muriate of soda 1 00
1000
8. The pan-scale from Lymington contained
Muriate of magnesia 29
Desiccated sulphate of magnesia 18
Carbonates of lime and magnesia* ... 127
Sulphate of lime 216
Muriate of soda 610
1000.
* The proportion of these carbonates I was by an accident prevented
from determining.
