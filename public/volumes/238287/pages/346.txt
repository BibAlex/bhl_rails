334 Charges of greatest Efficacy for Artillery at Sea.
of a very brittle nature, such as stone or brick, then that
charge is to be used which will give the greatest velocity to
the shot to produce the maximum effect. But in many cases
of bombardment this charge is by no means to be preferred;
for though the effect produced each individual time be
freater, yet in any considerable time the whole effect would
e less than that from a smaller charge oftener fired, on ac-
count of the extreme heat it would give to the engine after
a few discharges; and in consequence of which greater time
would be required for cooling the gun and preparing it for
further service.
Example II.
Required the charge for a 24-pounder shot to burst open
the gates of a city with the greatest ease possible, they be-
ing o/'elm one foot thick.

must be made to denote the several numbers of some ex-
periment made in the penetration of this substance. Taking,
therefore, the experiment of Dr, Mutton contained in the
5th problem of his elegant Exercises on Forces, we have

Retaining the experiment of Dr. Hutton as a standard for
all cases where the substance to be penetrated is of elm, we
shall have by reduction ^-^ ='06 7 6 x — £- - :
the charge for any piece the diameter of whose shot is D,

It is not unworthy of remark, that the gates of a besieged
place, or any like things, might be effectually broken open
by the gun itself, charged only with powder; by placing it
close to the gates with its muzzle from them; the mo-
mentum of recoil being generally sufficient to force such
objects completely.
