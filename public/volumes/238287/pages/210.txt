The effects of the sulphuric acid and of the muriate
barytes clearly proved the existence of sulphite of potash
in the liquid, while that of the oxy-sulphate of iron indi-
cated the presence of some other principle to which the
liquid was indebted for its peculiar characters ; the separa-
tion of this principle in a' pure state became therefore a
necessary preliminary operation to its examination : after
a few trials I succeeded in effecting this separation. The
following is the process I employed.
The liquid was evaporated by a gentle heat to dryness ;
upon the saline residuum alcohol was poured till it ceased
to extract any thing : by this means the whole of the sul-
phite and sulphate of potash was left behind, and the alco-
hol when filtered held in solution that part only which had
the red tingeing property with solutions of iron. The alco-
hol was now got rid of by distillation, and the salt it left
in the retort was redissolved in water. This solution (B)
gave the following results with the different metallic so-
lutions.
