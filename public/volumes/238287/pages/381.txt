ble, but not so perfect as in No. 2: used as turf, but burns
badly, on account of« the openness of its texture, and its
containing no empyreumatic oil.

" Mass compact; fibres of moss rarely discernible*;
numerous twigs, and small branches of birch, alder, and
fir-trees, are observable amongst the peat in this part of
the turf bank. Upon near inspection it was found, that
all the branches and twigs were quite hollow; the wood
being decayed had disappeared, leaving the bark perfect.
This division of the turf bank, when used as turf, burns
pleasantly, but quickly.
