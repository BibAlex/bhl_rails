filled with distilled water; a disengagement of sulphuretted
hydrogen, of ammonia, and of caloric immediately took
place. The materials were boiled slowly together for three
hours, occasionally replacing the water which evaporated.
The whole was thm thrown on a filter; what remained on
the filter was black, and consisted of sulphuret of iron and
un decomposed prussiate of iron. The liquid that passed
through, I found on trial to consist of triple prussiate of
potash, and hydroguretted sulphuret of potash. In order to
complete the decomposition of the latter, I boiled the liquid
again, for the same time as before, with another half ounce
of prussian blue, and when cold filtered it. The filtered
liquid (A) was now nearly colourless, and free from hydro-
guretted sulphuret. On pouring a little of it into a solu-
tion of oxy-sulphate of iron, I was very much surprised to
find that" solution changed to a deep blood-red colour,
without any precipitate ensuing, instead of forming with
iÂ£ a precipitate of blue prussiate of iron. So unex-
pected a phenomenon determined me to undertake an ex-
amination of this liquid ; with this view I subjected it to
the action of the chemical agents mentioned in the follow-
ing table.
