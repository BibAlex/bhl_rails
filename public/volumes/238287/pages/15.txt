I. A Review of the First Volume of M. J. A. De Luc's
Geological Travels in the North of Europe : with Re-
ma? ks on some of the Geological Points which ara there-
in discussed. By a Correspondent,
To Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, As a reader of your Magazine, I have been much
gratified of late, by the extracts, remarks, and observations
which have been given by you, or communicated by your
correspondents, on subjects connected with Geology, or
Geognosy, as it seems now the fashion with many to call
it; and having just finished the perusal of a very useful
as well as entertaining work, the first volume of M. J. A.
De Luc's Geological Travels in the North of Europe, very
lately published, I beg to communicate a short account of
the same. The travels which are detailed in the present
volume, were, it seems, undertaken, for collecting an ex-
tended body of facts in refutation of certain tenets of the
late Dr. Hutton, and other geological writers, and ii> con-
firmation of the doctrines advanced by the author in his
" Elementary Treatise on Geology," lately published. The
route of our author commenced on the 23d of July 1804,
at Berlin ; he proceeded by way of Zehdenick, Furstenberg,
Strelitz, Malehin, Lague, Rostock, Wismar, Travemiinde,
Lubeck, Eutin, Kiel, and Sleswigh, to Husum ; from
whence, on the 26th of August, he embarked for Harwich,
to pursue a similar course of investigations in England, the
details of which are to form the subject of his second
volume, the publication of which will not I sincerely hope
be long delayed.
The objects of M. Dc Luc's travels here detailed, are
first stated in 27 propositions or heads : the first eleven, and
the 13th, 14th, and 13th of which, relate to the question,
