form of the gray pyrophoric sublimate, which T have found
is always produced when potassium is electrized and con-
verted into vapour in ammonia.
The phosphuiet of lime in its common state is a con-
ductor of' electricity; and when it was made the medium
of communication between the wires of the great battery,
it burnt with a most intense light. It was ignited to
whiteness in nitrogen gas ; a little phosphuretted hydrogen
was given oft from it, but t*he nitrogen was not altered;
the apparatus was similar to that used for the potassium.
As almost all compounds known to contain hydrogen
are readily decomposed by oxvmuriatic acid gas, a mixture
of nitrogen rind oxvmuriatic acid gas was passed through
a porcelain tube heated to whiteness ; the products were
received in a pneumatic apparatus over water, there was a
small loss of nitrogen ; but the greatest part came over
densely clouded ; and as nitromuriatie acid was found dis-
solved in the water, no conclusions concerning the decom-
position of nitrogen can be drawn from the process.
The general tenant of these inquiries cannot be consi-
dered as strengthening in any considerable degree, the
suspicion which T formed of the decomposition of nitro-
gen, by the distillation oi the olive-colonrcd substance from
potassium and ammonia, in tubes of iron. *
In reasoning closely upon the phaenomena in this opera-
tion, it appears to me indeed possible to account for the
loss of nitrogen, without assuming that it has been con-
verted into new matter. Though the iron tubes which J,
used were carefullv cleaned ; yet still it was not unlikely
that a small quantity of oxide might adhere to the welded
parts; the oxygen of which, in the beginning of the pro-
cess of distillation, might form water with hvdrogen, given
off from the fusible substance ; which being condensed in
the upper part of the tube, would be again brought into
action towards the close of the operation, occasioning the
formation, and possibly the absorption of some ammonia,
and consequently a loss of nitrogen, and the production of
an increased proportion of hydrogen. 1 have made one
experiment, with the hopes of deciding this question, in
an iron tube used immediately after the whole internal
surface had been cleaned by the borer; six grains of potas-
sium were used in a tray of iron, nearly thirteen cubical
inches of ammonia were absorbed, and about six of hydro-
gen produced. Thirteen cubical inches of gas were evolved
ia the first operation ; which consisted of nearly one cubi-
cal
