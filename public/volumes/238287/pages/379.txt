ing in the degree of blackness and compactness propor-
tionate to its depth : near the bottom of the bog it forms a
black mass, which when dry has a strong resemblance to
pitch or bituminous coal, and having a conchoidal fracture
10 every direction, with a black shining lustre, and sus-
ceptible of receiving a considerable polish.
" WÂ« have requested Mr. Griffith to make a chemical
analysis of these different strata, which he has done in the
laboraury of the Dublin Society, and an account of which,
with the section above alluded to, forms the Appendix to
his Report. Immediately below this lower stratum, there is
generally found a thin stratum of yellow or blue clay, va-
rying in thickness from one to six feet ; in some places the
peat rests on a thinner stratum of yellowish white marl,
containing on an average about 60 per cent, of calcareous
matter ; this stratum of clay in this district universally rests
on a solid mass of clay and limestone gravel mixed together,
and extending to an unknown depth.
" We should further consider the peat moss as partaking
in its general nature of the property of sponge completely
saturated with water, and giving rise to different streams
and rivers for the discharge of the surplus waters which it
receives from rain or snow : these streams in this district
almost universally have worn their channels through the
substance of the bog down to the clay or limestone gravel
underneath, dividing the bog into distinct masses, and pre-
senting in themselves the most proper situations for the
main drains, and which, with the assistance of art, may be
rendered effectual for that purpose.
" Such is the internal structure of the bogs in this
district.
" Viewing them externally, they present surfaces by no
means level, but with planes of inclination amply sufficient
for their drainage : the highest summit of any part of the
bogs in this district, is 298 feet above the level of the sea,
taken at an ordinary spring-tide in the Bay of Dublin ;
while the lowest point any where on their surface is 84
feet lower than the highest, and therefore 214 feet above
the level of the sea.
" It requires a mere inspection of the map and sections,
to be convinced that there is no part of these bogs from
which the water may not be discharged into rivers in their
immediate vicinity, and with falls adequate to their drain-
age ; and we observe, that in the instance of the liog of
Timahoe, a part of its water is discharged into the sea at
Drogheda, and another part below Waterford/'
