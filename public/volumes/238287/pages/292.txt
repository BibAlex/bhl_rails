280 Application of Barometer for indicating the Weather.
Example I,
Inches.Tenth Hund.
Lower station 29,0,0
Upper station 28,0,0
Difference 1,0,0.
Temperature of air 60° = 926 feet to 1 inch
of variat".
For 29 inches at lower station, add 30 feet from
Table II,
956
Increased ratio, 3 to each 100, Table III = 28
Estimated height . . 984 feet.
Example 2.
Lower station , 30,0,1
Upper station , 29,5,3
Difference 0,4,8.
Ft.Tcnth.
Temperature of air 60° = 92,6 to each 10th
(Lower station 30 inches, no correction) of an inch
Multiply 92,6 feet by 48 tenths . . . . = 444,5, variation.
Add for increasing ratio l£ per 100 .= 6,
Estimated height . . 450,5,
Height by geometrical measure 451,2,
Example 3.
Inches.Tenrn Hund.
Lower station 29,9,7
Upper station f 26,2,8
Difference 3,6,9
Mean temperature of air 54° = 914 feet to each
For 29,9 at lower station add (Table II.) 3 inch of
■ variation.

the highest mountain in the world, a barometer would stand nearly as
low as 14 inches, its summit being 20,280 feet above the level of the sea.
The greatest height to be relied on, to which any person has ascended with
a balloon, is that at which the barometer stands at about 24 inches, which
is equal to 6,027 feet; though some are said to have reached 1G 3 000 feet.
