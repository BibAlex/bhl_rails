boundaries of the bogs with any tolerable accuracy. They
then report as follows : â€”
u From inspection of this map we were enabled to con-
sider the greater part of these bogs as forming one connected
whole, and to come to the general conclusion, that a por-
tion of Ireland, of little more than one fourth of its entire
superficial extent, and included between a line drawn from
Wicklow head to Galway, and another drawn from Howth
liead to Sligo, comprises within it about six-sevenths of
the bogs in the island, exclusive of mere mountain bogs,
and bogs of less extent than 500 acres, in its form resem-
bling a broad belt drawn across the centre of Ireland, wiih
its narrowest end nearest to the capital, and gradually ex-
tending in breadth as it approaches to the Western Ocean.
This great division of the island extending from east to west
is traversed by the Shannon from north to south, and is
thus divided into two parts : of these the division to the
westward of the river contains more than double the extent
of the bogs which are to be found in the division to the
eastward ; so that, if we suppose the whole of the bogs of
Ireland (exclusive of mere mountain bog and of bogs un-
der 500 acres) to be divided into twenty parts, we shall find
about seventeen of them comprised within the great division
we have now described, twelve to the westward and five to
the eastward of the Shannon, and of the remaining three
parts, about two are to the south and one to the north of
this division : of the positive amount of their contents we
have as yet no data that can enable us to speak with any
precision; but we are led to believe, from various commu-
nications with our engineers, that the bogs in the eastern
division of the great district above described amount to
about 260,000 English acres, which on the proportion al-
readv mentioned would give rather more than one million
of English acres as the total contents of the bogs of Ire-
land, excluding however from consideration mere moun-
tain bogs, and also all bogs of less extent than 500 acres,
of each of which description the amount is very considera-
ble : of the extent of the latter some idea may be formed
from a fact which we have learned from Mr. Larkin, that
in the single county of Cavan, which he has surveyed, there
are above ninety bogs, no one of which exceeds 500 Irish
acres, but which taken collectively contain above 11,000
Irish, which is equivalent to above 1 7,600 English acres,
besides many smaller bogs varying in size from five to
twenty acres.
