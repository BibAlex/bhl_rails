On Refraction.
It was not till after the year 1672, that a
tolerably near table of refraction made its ap-
pearance, when the elder Cassini took the
subject into consideration*. What led to
this was the voyage of Richer to Cayenne in
that year, upon the utility of which some
very excellent remarks were made by Cassini,
showing how far observations made in a situ-
ation so near the equator tended to confirm
or disprove certain theories derived from
observations made in Europef. Several very
useful deductions were drawn from a com-
parison of those made both at Paris and Cay-
enne; among others the refraction was set-
tled upon more accurate elements than here-
tofore |, and a new Table computed, for the
first time, of its quantity for all degrees, up
to the zenith ; an abridgement of which is
given in the margin.
From the relation of his grandson, it ap-
pears, however, that Cassini had at one time
computed three tables of refraction for all
altitudes : one for winter, another for summer,
and a third for spring and autumn : but several
doubts having been suggested to him re-
specting this arrangement, although in ap-
pearance conformable to nature, and princi-
pally the observations of Richer at Cayenne,
where the refraction was found little dif-
ferent from that at Paris, he changed his
opinion ; and, judging that since the great
difference of heat of the torrid zone, from
that of the temperate, which we inhabit,
does not cause sensible differences in the re-
fraction ; therefore, the greatest heat or cold
of our climate could not change it much ;
and he then fixed upon one table, which was
that used by the astronomers of the Royal
Observatory of Paris, up to the vear 1745 §.
It was alwavs thought, before the time
that the refraction did not extend its
