Lemma II.
The whole spaces or depths to which spheres impinging
on different resisting substances penetrate; are as the squares
of the initial velocities, the diameters and specific gravities
of the spheres directly, and the absolute strengths of the re-

Problem :
To find a general formula which shall express the quan-
tity of charge for any given piece of ordnance to produce the
greatest destruction possible to an enemy's ship at sea; it
being supposed of oak substance of given thickness, and at 4
distance not affecting the initial vtlocity of the shot.
