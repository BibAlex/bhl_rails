Charges of greatest Efficacy for Artillery at Sea. 333
In this Table the first column contains the nature, of the
ordnance, and the numbers in the other columns are their
respective charges of gunpowder in pounds, when the thick-
ness of the object to be destroyed is as specified at the top
of the columns. If the thickness be given in inches, and
parts of inches, tike such parts of the difference between
the charge for the given number of inches and the next
greater; and add them to the charge first found for the
given number of inches for the charge required.
The value of the decimal part of each will be had by
multiplying it by 16, the number of ounces in a pound, and
pointing off in the product from the right hand towards the
left, as many places for decimals as are contained in the
given decimal, and retaining the number on the left of the
point for the ounces, increasing it by |, 4-, -f-, or 1, when
the first figure of the decimal is 2, 5, 7 or 8 respectively.
This hint is merely given for those practitioners who may
not be very conversant in decimals.
Scholium.
This question is not only of the utmost importance and
practically useful in naval engagements, but in several in-
stances also of military operations; as the bursting open
gates of besieged cities with promptitude and effect, and
breaking up all fortifications composed of wooden materials;
especially those of a splintering nature, to which the above
charges apply most correctly. In the case of a naval
action where the object to be penetrated is of oak sub-
stance, the ball by having a small motion when it quits
the ship's side tears and splinters it excessively, breaking
away large pieces before it, which are not so easily supplied
in the reparation : whereas on the other hand, if the shot
had any considerable velocity when it quilted the side, the
effect produced would be merely a hole, which would be
stopped instantly by the mechanic employed for that pur-
pose; and indeed in a great measure by the springiness of
the wood itself; for I have seen in his majesty's dock-yard
at Woolwich, captured vessels, having a number of shot-
holes in them, almost entirely closed by the wood's own
efforts; and that required nothing more than a small wooden
peg or a piece of cork to stop them up perfectly: all the
damage, therefore, the shot can do under such circumstances
of swift celerity is merely killing those men who may chance
to stand in the way of their motion.
If any object to be destroyed be so thick that it cannot
be completely pierced by- any common engine; or if it be
