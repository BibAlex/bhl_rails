432 Memoir oil the Diminution of the
given by the observed lengths of the shadow at the two
solstices. This coincidence is a remarkable confirmation
of the value of the masses of Venus and Mars, which M.
Delambre has determined by the comparison of a very great
number of observations of the sun by means of the formu-
las, and of the perturbations of the earth's motion I have
given in the 3d vol. of Mac. Cel.
Tcheou-Kong, by his observations, had determined the
moment of the winter solstice, but they have not been
transmitted to us. We only know that he fixed this solstice
at 2° Chinese from V, a constellation which begins at s of
Aquarius, (vol. xxvi. of Edifying Letters, p. 124.) We
shall also fix the epochas of this determination at 1000 years
before our sera. Tcheou-Kong and the Chinese astronomers
at that tkftft referred the constellation to the equator; be-
sides 2° Chinese = 1° 58' 17": subtracting this from 270°,
the difference 268° l' 43" was the right ascension of s of
Aquarius at the epocha of 1 100 years before our aera.
In the beginning of 1750, the longitude of s of Aquarius
was 308° 14' 10"; its latitude was north 8° 6' 20'.
Comparing Bradley and Mayer's catalogues with Piazzy's,
this star does not appear to have any sensible motion of
its own, and its annual precession is 50", 1.
I find by the formulas of c. xii. of book vi. of Mec. Cel,
for the epocha of 1100 years before our sera,
rj/ - J 40" 2' 43"
V = 23° 32' 49",
jt being the precession of the equinoxes from that epocha
till 1750. This precession being referred to the equinox of
1 750, is the obliquity of ihe equator on this ecliptic at
the same epocha. Thus at this epocha the longitude of £
of Aquarius, computed from the intersection of the equator
with the. ecliptic of 1750, was in the year 3 100 before our
aera 268° J l' 27"; whence I conclude its right ascension,
relatively to the same intersection, to be equal to 268° 9' 2".
I aiterwards find, by the formulas of the quoted chapter,
• o" = 3.5' 44"; 9 = — 1° 33' 25" :
<p" being the ecliptic's inclination from that time, above
that of the ecliptic of 1750, and 9 being the longitude of
its node upon that said ecliptic, computed from the fixed
equinox of 1750. Whence I conclude that the right as-
cension of the true equinox with the preeeding; that is to
sav, the equator's intersection with the fixed ecliptic of 1750,
was in the year 1 100 before our sera equal to —-42' 12";
the right ascension of s, relative to the true equinox, was
therefore then 26S a 51' 14", greater by 49' 31'' than Tcheou-
Kong's
