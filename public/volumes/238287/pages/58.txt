46 Temperaments of different musical Systems.
substituting the same in the wolf we get 322 -f- 3m ;
as in corollary 6; likewise in theorem 3, we have
—2 -f — m, or — c, the sharp temperament of the
3 3 3
major third also, as is consistent with cor. 8. The
II Id and Vih wolves are here each 28£2 + 2*m. (See
Harmonics, p. 42.)
This system approaches very near to a division of
the octave into 19 equal parts, where — 3*(>Q472 is
the flat temperament of the fifth, (Dr. Smith, Har-
1 3 47
monies, p. 158, makes it — -— c --c = — -~j-c
or — 3-6955Y); — - c above, is — 3-6602S82. See
o
M. Sauveur's table.
The cases of equality of temperaments between the
III and VI, and between the V and VI having occur-

Scholium 4. If a douzeave be required, in which the
major fifth shall be as much tempered flat' as the
major six th is sharp ; from theorems 1 and 6 we have

4- — jBj.or— c, is here the temperament of the
2 2
fifth : and by substituting this value in theorem 6, we
have 2 -J- — m, or -— c, for the temperament of
222
the major sixth also. The V and VI wolves are here
each 48^2 + 4^m.
Scholium 5. If a douzeave be required, in which the major
fifth shall be as much tempered flat as the major third
is tempered flat; from theorems 1 and 3, we have
