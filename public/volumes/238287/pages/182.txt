1 70 On Timing an Equal Temperament.
Here f*A beats 137, and DF* beats 160 times.
12. " From the last F* tune c* a flat fifth, and try it
with A and F* until you have Ac* a good third, and c* F*
a good fourth."
The fifth F*c* beats 8|, and the major third Ac*
120; of course the fourth C* F* beats 17, the same
with its complemental fitth above it.
13. "From C* tune g* a fiat fifth, and try it with E
and B until you have Eg* a good third, and g*B another
good third."
The fifth C*g* beats 12 times; also Eg* beats 180,
and g*B beats 308.
14. " From G* tune g* below it, a perfect octave, and
try it with E and B."
g*B beats 154, the half of the above, and EG* 180
as above, and the repetition, and the whole of this
step is unnecessary,
<c As you now proceed by tuning the fifths downwards,
the lower "note is to be sharpened, which is the same thing
in effect as flattening the upper note, when tuning up-
wards."
15. "From C above middle C, tune f rather sharper
than a perfect fifth, and try it with A and C, until you
have f A a good third, and Cf a good fourth."
Here the fifth f C beats 16 times, and so does the
fourth Cf, and the trial of it is useless and fallacious,
for proving whether f C is sharpened the proper quan-
tity for an equal temperament of the scale. But f A
beats 190, and this furnishes a check of some use.
16. " From F tune a* a sharp fifth, and try it with D,
until vou have a*D a good third, without sensibly injuring
the fifth."
The fifth a*F beats 10ยง times, and the third a*D
beats 127 times.
17. "From A* tune a* above it, a perfect octave, and
try it with D and F."
Here A*D beats 127 times as above, and a*F 10J
times, the same as the last, which shows this to be a
useless step.
18. From the last tuned A* tune d* a sharp fifth, and
try it with G and A* (below) until you have A*d* a good
fourth, and d*G a good third."
