No change. '
No change.
The gold precipitated metallic.
Copious white precipitates.
No change.
Copious grayish white precipitate.
Very slight precipitate white,
{Solution turns blood-red. No
precipitate.
No precipitate.
No change,
f Solution becomes red, but hardly
any precipitate formed, unless
heated, in which case a copious
white precipitate ensues. The
^ red colour disappears, a rapid
action takes place between the
two liquids, and some of the
nitric acid of the solution is de-
composed,
f A slight precipitate, probably of
\ muriate of lead.
Solution becomes slightly turbid.
No precipitates.
I cannot conclude this part of* my memoir without giv-
ing a more simple and expeditious process for preparing
prussite of potash, than that which I at first discovered.
It is the following :
Pour a solution of prussiate of mercury into hydrogu-
retted sulphuret of potash, till the mutual decomposition
of the two liquids is completed ; prussite of potash is in-
stantly formed, and may be separated by filtration from the
solid combination of the sulphur and mercury.
