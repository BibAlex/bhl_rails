In order to prevent mistakes in the use of Corollary 9,
page 43, it may be proper to remark, that the expression
there given, is for the diesis between *C and bD, *F and
bG, and *G and bA, besides those enumerated; but not be-
tween *E and bF or bC and *C, where the halftones fall,
which have a different value, for which I will give a theorem
on some future occasion.
Also page45, line 5, after "2 only," add,— see the other
equalities of wolves in Scholia 3 and 4.

In Scholium 6, after — c, — c, and --c, add, in each case,
-—very nearly.
At the end of Scholium 11, page 52, add, — The sharp
andjlat are here, by Cor. 10, each equal to 362 + f -f 3m,
as in Mr. Marsh's Theory of Harmonics, p. 16.
I am, sir,
Your obedient humble servant,
