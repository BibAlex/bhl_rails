It was conjectured by many of the early writers, that the
refraction was' subject to variations depending upon the
weather: but it then amounted to little more than a con-
jecture, on account of the indifferent manner in which
astronomic instruments were divided. Picard found by
meridian altitudes of the sun in 166*9, that it was greater
in winter than in summer. He found also that it was less
by day than by night. In the observations given at the
end of his journey to Uraniburg*, to settle the latitude of
that place, and its difference of longitude from Paris, for
the purpose of comparing the observations of Tycho Brahe
with those made at the Royal Observatory of Paris, he
found the horizontal refraction for the first limb of the sun
that made its appearance above the horizon there 33' 2",
and for the second 32' 37". So that in the small interval of
time that the sun took to rise, the refraction was diminished
25 seconds by the warmth arising from the sun's presence.
A quadrant being also directed by him from the top of
Mount Valerian towards the summit of the church of Notre
Dame at Paris, he found the depression 20' ; but the sun
had scarcely risen, when it was increased to 22 / ; exhala^
tions being raised by the sun's presence, and the medium
between Paris and Mount Valerian become more equal ;
whereas, before the sun rose, the air of Paris was more dense
than that of' Mount Valerian f.
The density of the atmosphere being the immediate cause
of the refraction, it was very natural to suppose that it must
decrease as this density became less; whether by causes
which diminished its weight, or by the expansion produced
by heat : and, indeed, astronomers were not long after this,
