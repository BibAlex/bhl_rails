328 Charges of greatest Efficacy for Artillery at Sea.
which is not strictly true; since that resistance depends
partly on the quantity of the surface resisted, which con-
tinually varus until the ball has penetrated to the depth of
This; when it continues uniform till it arrives at the
fu h r surface of the object; where the resistance a^ain
co nuitncea ts variation. These deviations from uniformity
are about sufficient to set against that of the law of variation
of the charges before mentioned; the velocities from them
filing somewhat :>hort of the law there prescribed after a
certain charge.
Example I.
An enemy's ship is in sight ; required the charge for the
42 pounder guns to destroy her as quickly and completely
as possible when the ships have approached near to each
other: the side of the enemy* s vessel (a seventy four) being
1*. foot thick of' oak timber.
The diameter of a 42-pounder of cast-iron being ='557
foot; we get '045 x - Â£-- - = 6'8S306lbs,
