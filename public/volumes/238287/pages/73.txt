Attraction on Clouds and Vapours, 61
On the 16th, I was in sight of Madeira, and crossed the
tropic of Cancer on the £4th, in longitude 24° 30' west
of Greenwich; the ship's course being S. S.W. The for-
mer part is consequently on the verge of the trades ; as the
latter is of the torrid zone. At this season of the year
the winds are variable, but generally strong.

Ilavannah is situated but a few miles south of the tropic
of Cancer, and^the land about it moderately high. It is
sheltered by the hills of the Cavannah from all winds be-
tween N.E. and E.S.E., and these are by far the most
prevalent. In the evening, however, it often shifts to the
north, or even a point or two to the westward. At this
season of the year the weather is intensely hot, with f re*
quent and violent storms of rain and thunder, which usually
take place between the houis of two and six in the after-
noon.
