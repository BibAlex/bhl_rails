54 Report on the Memoirs presented to the
it is of a vegeto- animal nature, cither from the smell which
it exhales when placed on hot coals, or hy the prussiale
of ammonia which upon distillation furnishes the acetate
of potash prepared with distilled vinegar: a product
which does not give the same salt prepared with radical
vinegar : w hence the author concludes that the radical prin-
ciple which colours the acetate of potash is no'hing but a
part of the ferment of common vinegar, carried into the
distillation and more or less altered bv this operation.
Independently of this colouring principle, inherent in
the constitution of common vinegar, the author of the
memoir mentions another still more capable of making
the acetate of potash look brown: this is the empvreumatic
oil with which the vinegar is charged when the distillation
is carried too far. He further says, that this salt may also
be coloured by the oxides of iron and of manganese con-
tained in the alkali, or by the metallic utensils used in its
preparation : but this colour being merely accidental, we
may avoid it entirely by using a pure potash and vessels of
tin or porcelain. We must therefore adhere to the fer-
ment and the empyreumatic oil. The following directions
'are given for avoiding these two colouring principles: the
ferment may be separated from the acetate of potash the
more easily the less of it there is in the distilled vinegar,
and the latter will contain so much the less in its turn ; as
in common vinegar, the proportion of the ferment will be
smaller with respect to that of the arid, on account of the
quantity of ferment brought over in distillation being al-
ways more or less in proportion with that which exists in
common vinegar. It follows therefore that it is necessary,
above all, to employ common vinegar, which is at once the
most acid and the least charged with ferment; and this re-
quisite may be attained by choosing a clear vinegar, be-?
sides being very strong and completely fermented. After
the choice of the vinegar, the process of distillation may
also have some influence on the quantity of the ferment
contained in distilled vinegar: for, since this principle is less
volatile than the acetic acid, the less of it will pass over in
distillation, the more slowly this process is conducted; and
in this respect we may admit a slight ebullition as being
the fittest degree of heat.
If the preceding rules have been well attended to, the
distilled vinegar will contain so small a quantity of fer-
ment that it will be capable of furnishing immediately an
acetate of potash almost entirely colourless ; but if, not-
withstanding every precaution, the whiteness of the salt
still
