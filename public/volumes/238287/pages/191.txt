British and Foreign Salt. 179
Carbonate of lime and oxide of iron ........ 2
Muriate of lime, and muriate of magnesia, inl
nearly equal proportions J
Sulphate of lime 19
Muriate of soda 974
1000.
2. The mother liquor, or brine that remains after sepa-
rating all the common salt, which it is thought worth while
to extract, had the specific gravity of 1208. The dry salt
contained,
Muriate of magnesia . . * 35
lime . . 32
Sulphate of lime 6
Muriate of soda .............. 927
1000.
3. The clearings of the brine, which are raked out of the
pan when the salt first begins to granulate, contained in
1000 parts,
Muriate of soda 800
Carbonate of lime 41
Sulphate of lime 159
1000.
4. Of the substance called by the workmen pan-scale,
two specimens were analysed, the one containing a large
proportion of muriate of soda, the other very little. The
first variety consisted of
Muriate of soda 950
Carbonate of lime 10
Sulphate of lime 40
1000.
The second variety was composed of
Muriate of soda 100
Carbonate of lime 110
Sulphate of lime 790
1000.
Circumstances, however, are constantly occurring to
vary the proportion of ingredients, both in the clearings
and in the pan- scale. If, for example, the brine be short
of the point of saturation with common salt, it acts, when
admitted into the pan, upon the muriate of soda which the
pan-scale contains, and we obtain the second variety. But
