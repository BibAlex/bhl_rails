230 Fatal Case of Inguinal Hernia*
and which may perhaps lead to some great and useful dis-
coveries.
We know that aloes taken internally act as a very active
tonic, and are powerfully antiseptic when applied externally.
Surgeons daily use aloes in tincture, as a detergent for old
ulcers, caries, and gangrenes, which proceed rapidly. Would
it have this antiseptic property if taken internally ? We

but it has certainly never been known before, that it ceases

have had occasion to verify.

The abdomen continued painful on pressure, the pain be-
ing referred principally to the umbilicus and region of the
stomach, with a sensation of heat. Fomentations and the
warm bath were emploved without any relief. The bowels
remained in a constipated state : no stool could be procured
either by medicines taken by the mouth, or by cathartic
glysters, several of which were injected.
The hiccough became very troublesome j every thing
taken bv the mouth was rejected by the stomach ; feculent
