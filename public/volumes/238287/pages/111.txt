metropolis, and the uninterrupted success that has attended
the practice, at once a proof of the zeal, industry and at-
tention of the medical officers \ for which I beg leave to
make my most grateful acknowledgements.
" And now, sir, a few remarks on the very extraordinary
communication you have make to me respecting Lady
C -. It has been one of the usual devices of the ene-
mies of vaccination, almost from the time of my first mak-
ing it known, to represent me as having lost my confidence
of its prophylactic powers, or, at least, that I was wavering
on the subject. Can T, who, with the aid of my nephews,
have vaccinated a number of persons little short of 30,000,
without one single instance of accident or of failure, that
ever reached my ears, for a moment entertain such an ab-
surd idea? Or could I have ever thought of inoculating
for the small-pox, while I hold that practice in abhorrence,
and condemn it both publicly and privately ? Believe me,
the whole story you relate to me is an entire fiction, with-
out the faintest shadow of foundation. Never from the
commencement of my experiments to the present hour,
have I used a particle of variolous matter, except for the
purpose of putting some of those to a test on whom I
made my first trials. For some years past, I have relied
wholly on the vaccine lymph, for testing those on whom
any material irregularity appeared in the progress of the
pustule.

While the directors, with such weight of evidence in its
favour, feel themselves warranted in continuing to recom-
mend vaccination as a preventive of small-pox, they cannot
but regret that in a few cases it has been difficult to deter-
mine whether a patient has had the disease constitutionally
or locally. They however confidently hope that by pur-
suing Mr. Bryce's test, and by increased attention to the
progress of the disease, practitioners will be enabled to sur-
mount the only objection to a practice which tends to pre-
serve more than 30,000 lives annually, in the British Isles>
Mr. Bryce proposes that a 3econd inoculation be per-
formed about the sixth day after the first : the vesicle pro-
duced by this second inoculation is accelerated in its pro-
gress, so as to arrive at maturity, and again fade, at nearly
the same time as the affection arising from the first inocu-
lation. Mr, B. considers the acceleration of the second
