366 Of the Bogs in Ireland.
" There are many, we believe, who consider the bogs of
Ireland to be low and marshy tracts of country not very dis-
similar in their composition from the fens of Lincolnshire:
others, aware that the substance of which they are formed
greatly differs from that of the fen districts, attribute ne-
vertheless the origin of both to pretty nearly the same
causes ; while an opinion, more prevalent, and perhaps not
less erroneous than either of the foregoing, attributes their
formation to fallen forests, which are supposed at some
former period to have covered these districts, and to have
been destroyed either by the effects of time, or by hostile
armies in the early wars of Ireland.
" The facts stated in Mr. Griffith's report are obviously
inconsistent with any of these suppositions; the bogs which
he has surveyed being every where in elevated situations,
and the trees which have hitherto been so constantly found
buried in the edges of these bogs, where alone it is probable
they have generally been sought for, are very rarely to be
found in the interior parts at least of this district.
" Without entering in this report into any inquiry as to
the origin of peat bogs, we are however anxious to give to
such persons as have not had an opportunity of examining
them, some idea of the general appearances which they
actually present.
" It appears from Mr. Griffith, that each of the four bogs
included in the subject of his report, is a mass of the pe-
culiar substance called peat, of the average thickness of
25 feet, no where less than twelve, nor found to exceed 42;
this substance varying materially in its appearances and
properties, in proportion to the depth at which it lies :
on the upper surface, covered with moss of various species,
and, to the depth of about ten feet, composed of a mass of
the fibres of similar vegetables in different stages of decom-
position proportioned to their depth from the surface, ge-
nerally however too open in their texture to be applied to
the purposes of fuel : below this generally lies a light black-
ish brown turf, containing the fibres of moss still visible,
though not perfect, and extending to a further depth of
perhaps ten feet under this. In the instance exhibited in
the section at the close of Mr. Griffith's report, are found
small branches and twigs of alder and birch, but we do not
understand him as being of opinion that such is by any
means generally the case : at a greater depth the fibres of
vegetable matter cease to be visible, the colour of the turf
becomes blacker, and the substance much more compact,
its properties as fuel more valuable, and gradually increas-
