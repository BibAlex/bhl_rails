But as it appears more simple to avoid the two numbers
49 and 45,, and reckon the state of the thermometer from
zero, we may reduce the whole of these equations to that
temperature, and then find other multipliers for the number
of degrees above that point ; which is easily done as fol-
lows .- Put R as the refraction at any given temperature;
r = the degrees of that temperature, § = the refraction at
Zero, n = the multiplier for the state R, and v = that for
zero : then we have
R 4- Rrrc = R (1 + rn) = §; whence R = ~— ; but
on the contrary, p — grv == R = f (1 -- *>}j consequently,
c(l — rv) — — - — , from which we get v = — : then,
^ v ; l+rn 9 c r/*+l *
by substituting Mr. Groombridge's multipliers for w, we get
the new multipliers for reducing the refraction from zero
to any other temperature. By this we also obtain the ad-
vantage of having only three equations instead of four;
which, putting h as height of thermometer above zero, will
now be as follows:
