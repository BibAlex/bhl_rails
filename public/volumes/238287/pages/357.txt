on the subject ; and, perhaps, bring others to light of as
great or greater importance*.
The refraction of the north being so considerable, is very
useful to the inhabitants, who are deprived of the sun's
light during many months ; as it makes the sun rise much
earlier, and set much later to them, than it otherwise would.
About the year 1725, Mr. Flamsteed, the English Astro-
nomer Royal, published his tablet computed from his own
observations : and this was the one commonly used in En-
gland for many years afterwards.
Sir Isaac Newton also constructed one J from theory,
which was first published by Dr. Halley in the Philosophical
Transactions, No. 368, for 1 721 . He made the horizontal re-
fraction 33' 45"; whereas Mr. Flamstecd's was only 33' 0".
But although the refraction might be determined within
a few seconds at all altitudes by observation ; yet, the
law of its increase from the zenith to the horizon was a
subject that occupied the principal mathematicians and
astronomers for more than a centurv§. Newton having
discovered the general principles of attraction, found that
the refraction was a consequence of this law of nature ; and
that it arose from the attraction of the atmosphere on the
particles of light. On this principle the curve which a ray
of light describes might be determined ; since it is succes-
sively attracted by different layers of the atmosphere, in-
creasing in density as they approach the earth, and, conse-
quently, bending the ray more and more from the right line
which it described in the vacuum previous to its reaching
the atmosphere. There are many authors who have en-
deavoured to find from theory the curve described by this
ray in its course, by the assumption of various hypotheses :
but perfection and our attempts to arrive at it, as is well
observed by the elder Cassini in discoursing on this sub-
ject, are like the progress of certain curves and their asym-
ptotes. The principal of these writers on the subject arc,

§ In 1714, Cassini published in Mem. de l'Acad. for that year, some me-
thods of finding the refraction by observation, and of determining its quan-
tity by theory. He has also given a table of it for the first .i0° of altitude,
computed, first, according to a rectilinear, and, secondly, according to a cir-
cular hypothesis which he there assumes.
