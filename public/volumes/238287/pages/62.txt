This is the syftem for defective scales which Dr. Smith
describes, and recommends, p.icres 219, 215, 1S9> 211,
and 212: and of which Mr. Atwood has (but without
acknowledgement) given the lengths of strings in his
" Rectilinear Motion, &c."
A system, wherein the octave is divided into 74
equal parts, to be found in M. Sauveur's table, and
where the temperament is V — 2*38382, differs but
very little from V — 2-39301 52 m this system.

This is the famous System of Equal Harmony in

And differs but little from M. Ilenfling's system,
(Mem.de l'Acad. 1711, 16mo, p. 40S), wherein the
octave is divided into 5o equal parts, as Dr. Smith
shows in his Harmonic?, p, 157, and states its fifth to
