In these equations, although very simple, there is
some little arithmetic trouble in computing the first and
last part of each expression. As to the first, it will be
easiest done by a table of the product of 3-36-25 into each
of the nine digits: by means of which the product of this
number into any other will readily be obtained, by only
adding that of its several digits, into 3-3625. Or it may
be done by multiplying r by — ■ ; or, by the following ex-
3x0 1
pression 3*3625 r = — - r — ftn **> which will only re-
quire contracted multiplication and division.
The last may easily be effected by a very ingenious and
simple method pointed out by M.Cagnoli*. Thus it is
well known that cos. 1 = rad. 2 — sin. 3 ; therefore putting
x = 1 — lm f and comparing it with the latter of these
two expressions, \\e have
c\ A = r 1 — s 1 , A as 1 — hn ad x:
consequently s, A = s/ hn and the square of the cosine
corresponding will be equal to x. Whence we have this
rule. To the logarithm of h add the logarithm of ?/, and
divide the sum by 2. Seek this number in the Table of
Logarithmic Sines, and take out the logarithmic cosine cor-
