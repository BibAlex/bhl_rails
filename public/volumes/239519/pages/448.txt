" M. Gras writes history as well a sfiction. In this and in his love of the people,
the true patriots, M. Gras is perhaps best likened to those admirable fictional his-
torians, Erckmann-Chatrian. He is a far greater artist ; he works in a field they left
mostly untouched, but the analogy holds good. In these three France has a group of
historical novelists of whom she may well be proud, and among them Felix Gras
stands first, because the human interest of his stories is deeper, truer, more universal,
and his grasp of the possibilities of plot, of the handling of intrigue, danger and
escape, of devotion and of gratitude is masterly to the end. Among historical novel-
ists Felix Gras has won high rank." — New York Mail and Express.
