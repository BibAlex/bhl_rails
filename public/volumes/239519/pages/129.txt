'caught on' to the surreptitious use of gas ranges are either the fortunate
possessors of 'slow' meters or are deluding themselves as to the amount
of gas which they actually consume.
Fig. 4 is a photograph of the common dry meter, with the front,
back, top and left side removed. It is called a 'dry' meter to dis-
tinguish it from those meters, having little vogue in this country,
which employ a liquid in place of a valve motion. The apparatus
shown consists of a case divided into three compartments by a horizon-
tal partition one fourth of the way down from the top, and by a
vertical partition centrally placed and extending upward from the
bottom of the casing to the horizontal partition. The upper com-
partment contains the registering mechanism and a small valve cham-
ber, the latter corresponding to the steam chest of an engine. In each
of the lower compartments is a metal disk attached to the central
partition by well-oiled flexible leathers, each disk, leather and the
partition forming a bellows. As in a locomotive, the meter really
consists of two separate mechanisms, set to operate out of phase and
avoid dead centers.
Considering one mechanism only, recourse may be had to a dia-
grammatic representation of the action (Fig. 5). Gas entering the
inlet passes into the valve chamber. Here an ordinary D-slide-valve
closes two of the openings, leaving a third through which the gas may
flow into the bellows or inner compartment. The bellows expands,
gradually filling the outer compartment, and forcing the gas out under
the valve into the outlet pipe, as indicated by the arrows. When
the bellows is fully distended the valve shifts into the position shown
in Fig. 6, admitting the inflowing gas to the outer compartment and
collapsing the bellows, whose contents are forced into the outlet pipe
by the paths traced by the arrows.
Thus, it will be observed, the meter is a volume measurer pure and
