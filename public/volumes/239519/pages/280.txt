at C. The number of tubes depends upon the capacity of the boiler.
As the tubes are very thick, they can, without any danger of bursting,
be heated to so high a temperature that the water injected into them
is at once turned into steam.
In Fig. 12 it will be seen that the engine is located under the body
of the carriage between the two axles, and that motion is imparted
to the hind wheels by means of chains and sprocket wheels. The
boiler is located at the back of the vehicle, the lower part projecting
some distance below the rear axle. A small smoke stack at the rear
of the body allows the gases of combustion to escape. Between the
front wheels, a compact condenser is located, and into this the steam
from the engine is exhausted. The condenser serves two purposes:

it recovers a portion of the water that would otherwise escape into the
air, and thus increases the distance the carriage can run without a new-
supply, and at the same time it lessens the noise produced by the ex-
haust, and also the volume of steam escaping into the atmosphere,
which in cold or rainy weather becomes plainly visible.
Although we have been rather slow in this country in taking up the
automobile, inventors and manufacturers are now working at a pace
that will soon make up for lost time. We already have a number of
designs of steam carriages whose operation is highly creditable. Tig.
14 illustrates one of these. The design of the engine, boiler and other
mechanism can be well understood from Tig. 15, in which a portion
of the body is removed to expose the internal parts.
