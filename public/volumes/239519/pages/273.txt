THE EVOLUTION AND PBESENT STATUS OF THE
AUTOMOBILE.
By WILLIAM BAXTER, Jr.
IN this closing year of a century which is marked by unparalleled
advances in science and its applications to the industrial arts, we
are very much inclined to take it for granted that none of the inven-
tions that are regarded by us as indicative of the highest order of
progressive tendency, could by any possibility have been thought of
by our forefathers; and as the automobile is looked upon as an ultra-
progressive idea, no one who has not investigated the subject would
believe for a moment that its conception could antedate the present
generation, much less the present century. The records, however.

show that the subject engrossed the attention of inventive minds many
hundreds of years ago. In fact, as far back as the beginning of the
thirteenth century a Franciscan monk named Roger Bacon prophesied
that the day would come when boats and carriages would be propelled
by machinery.
The first authentic record of a self-propelled carriage dates back
to the middle of the sixteenth century. The inventor was Johann
Haustach, of Nuremburg. The device is described as a chariot pro-
pelled by the force of springs, and it is said that it attained a speed
of two thousand paces per hour, about one mile and a quarter. Springs
have been tried by many inventors since that time, but always without
success from the simple fact that the amount of energy that can be
stored in a spring is practically insignificant.
In 1763 a Frenchman by the name of Cugnot devised a vehicle that
was propelled by steam, and a few years after the date of his first
experiment, constructed for the French Government a gun carriage
which is shown in Fiff. 1. As will be seen, the design was of the
