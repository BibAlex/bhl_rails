CHAPTERS ON THE STARS. 639
the so-called 'new stars', which, at various periods in history, have
blazed out in the heavens, and then in a few weeks or months have
again faded away. It is a remarkable fact that no star of the latter
class has ever been known to blaze out more than once. This fact
distinguishes new stars from other irregularly variable ones.
Periodic stars are those which go through a regular cycle of changes
in a definite interval of time, so that, after a certain number of days,
sometimes of hours, the star returns to the same brightness. But even
in the case of periodic stars, it is found that the period is more or less
variable, and, in special cases, the amount of the variation is such that
it cannot always be said whether we should call a star periodic or
irregular.
The periodic stars show wide differences, both in the length of the
period and in the character of the changes they undergo. In most
cases they rapidly increase in brightness during a few days or weeks,
and then slowly fade away, to go through the same changes again at
the end of the period. In other cases they blaze up or fade out, from
time to time, like the revolving light of a lighthouse. Some stars are
distinguished more especially by their maximum, or period of greatest
brightness, while others are more sharply marked by minima, or periods
of least brightness. In some cases there are two unequal minima in
the course of a period.
Chandler's third catalogue of variable stars gives the periods of 280
of these objects, which seem to have been fairly well made out. A
classification of these periods, as to their length, will be interesting.

It will be seen from this that, leaving out the cases of very short
period, the greater number of the periods fall between 300 and 400
days. From this value the number falls off in both directions. Only
three periods exceed 500 days, and of these the longest is 610 days.
We infer from this that there is something in the constitution of these
stars, or in the causes on which their variation depends, which limits
the period. This limitation establishes a well-marked distinction be-
