advantage derived from applying the power to the front wheels, namely,
the ability to turn round in a small space.
Another design for driving the front wheels which allows them to
swing round independent pivots, is shown in Fig. 14, which is a coupe
made by Krieger in France. The power is supplied by two motors, one
being mounted on each swivel point. The construction can be under-
stood by considering that in the lower part of Fig. 13 the motor would
be secured to a suitable support at the end of the frame L, being held
in such a position that the shaft would replace pivot D and a pinion
mounted thereon would gear into wheel E. What the advantage of
this construction may be, the writer is not able to point out; it certainly

shows, however, that there are many ways in which the object sought
may be acomplished.
American manufacturers of electric vehicles, at least the great ma-
jority of them, resort to spur-gearing to transmit the motion of the
motor to the driving wheels, but with the French designers the chain
and sprocket appears to be in great favor. Fig. 15 shows a Jenatzy
vehicle (French), in which the chain is used. This construction would
not be received with favor by Americans, who as a rule desire to have
the mechanical part of the apparatus hidden from view as much as
possible. In the Jenatzy vehicle two chain gears are used, one on each
side of the body, and from the engineering point of view this is the
most desirable arrangement, as with it the driving wheels are inde-
pendently operated and a compensating gear need not be placed upon
