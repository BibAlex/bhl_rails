a broad strip of metal bent into a circle.* Intricate as these wave sur-
faces are, they have all been verified by geometrical constructions, as I
shall presently show.
Another very interesting case of reflection is that occurring inside
an elliptical mirror. When light diverges from one of the two foci
of such a mirror, all the rays are brought accurately to the other focus.
If rays of light come to a focus from all directions, it is evident that
the wave surface must be a sphere, which, instead of expanding, is
collapsing. This is very beautifully shown in the photographs. The
sound wave starts in one focus and the reflected wave, of spherical form
also, shrinks to a point at the other focus. (See fig. 5.)
In the next series the wave starts outside of the field of the lens,

and enters a hemispherical mirror. We know that a concave mirror
has the power of bringing light to a focus at a point situated half-way
between the surface of the mirror and its center of curvature. If the
light comes from a very distant point, and the mirror is parabolic in
form, the rays are brought accurately to a focus; which means that the
reflected wave is a converging sphere, â€” a condition the opposite of that
in which spherical waves start in the focus of such a mirror. If,
however, the mirror is spherical, only a portion of the light comes to
a focus. On examining the pictures we see that the reflected wave
has a form resembling a volcanic cone with a bowl-shaped crater.
* Cylindrical mirrors have been used instead of spherical, for obvious reasons. A sectional
view of the reflected wave is the same in this case as when produced by a spherical surface.
