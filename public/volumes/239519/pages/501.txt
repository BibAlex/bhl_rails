THE TRUST PROBLEM
By Prof. JEREMIAH WHIPPLE JENKS, Pb. D.
This book describes, first, the nature of competition and shows what its waste's
are ; the special favors that have resulted in or have fostered combination are
considered, and monopolies clearly defined. Then follow chapters describing the
methods of promoting, capitalizing, organizing, and managing trusts, and these are
followed by others showing the effect of trusts upon prices and upon wages. The
political and social effects of trusts are then discussed, and, finally, schemes of
legislation are proposed as remedies for the existing evils. With this compendium
are included proposed solutions of the problem as suggested by Gov. Roosevelt,
Comptroller Coler, Mr. Bryan, Mr. William Wirt Howe, and others. This work
is comprehensive, concise, impartial and trustworthy.
