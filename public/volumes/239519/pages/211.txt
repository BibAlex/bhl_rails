That it will be impracticable to give here all of the disc of the moon
in the large photographs, will be evident when it is considered that the
lunar circumference on each plate is about 4 feet; but it will be inferred
from the examples that the prominences and polar streamers as well as
their features, appear in imposing magnitude and detail.
Many of what it is hoped will be the most interesting photographs
still await development, but Mr. Smillie's thorough preparation is prom-
ising adequate results.

ured the heat of the corona, and in spite of previous efforts, this is prob-
ably the first time that it has been really shown to exist. For five
minutes before second contact, the bolometer was successfully exposed
to the region of the sky close to the narrowing crescent of the sun
where the corona was shortly to appear. A diaphragm was interposed
in the beam having an aperture of only 0.4 sq. cm. Deflections,
rapidly diminishing from 80 to 6 mm. were obtained, the last being
about 40 seconds before totality. Then the diaphragm was opened to
290 sq. cm. and a negative deflection of 13 mm. was observed after
totality, where these positive deflections had just been found, showing
that the corona was actually cooler than the background which had
been used at the room temperature. Next the black surface of the
