only about 60 stars whose parallaxes can be said to be determined; and
one-half of these are too near the apex, or have too small a parallax, to
permit of any conclusion being drawn from them.
A second method is based on the spectroscopic measures of the mo-
tion of stars in the line of sight, or the line from the earth to the star.
A star at rest in the direction of the solar apex would be apparently
moving toward us with a velocity equal to that of the solar motion.
Assuming the center of mass of all the stars observed to be at rest, we
should get the solar motion from the mean of all.
Thus far, however, there are only about 50 stars whose motions in
the line of sight have been used for the determination, so that the data
are yet more meagre than in the case of the proper motions. From
them, however, using a statistical method Kapteyn has derived results
which seem to show that the actual velocity of the solar system through
space is about 16 kilometres, or 10 statute miles, per second.
