PHOTOGRAPHY OF SOUND WAVES.
3d
See the third and fourth pictures of the series. The bowl of the
crater shrinks to a point half-way between the surface of the mirror
and its center of curvature, and represents that portion of the light
which comes to a focus, while the sides of the cone run in under the
collapsing bowl, and eventually cross. (No. 6 of the series.) From now
on the portion which has come to a focus diverges, uniting with the
sides of the cone, the whole passing out of the mirror in the form of
a horseshoe.
We will now consider a case of refraction, and show the slower

velocity of the sound wave in carbonic acid. A narrow glass tank,
covered with an exceedingly thin film of collodion, was filled with the
heavy gas and placed under the brass balls. When the sound wave
strikes the collodion surface, it breaks up into two components, one re-
flected back into the air, the other transmitted down through the car-
bonic acid. An examination of the series shows that the reflected
wave in air has moved farther from the collodion film than the trans-
mitted wave, which, as a matter of fact, has been flattened out into
