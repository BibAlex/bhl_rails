THIS work furnishes an elementary course in the Calculus
which is simple and yet not loose. The progress of the
subject in the nineteenth century is constantly borne in mind ;
the method of limits is used throughout, and great stress is laid
upon clear and careful discussion of the fundamental principles
and methods. The new and characteristic definitions of the
Calculus are introduced by the preliminary consideration of spe-
cial and simple problems, which lead the student to see the need
for setting up the new definitions and studying their properties
and consequences. These introductory problems are not select-
ed from the domain of mathematics alone, but from that of the
natural sciences as well, and indeed throughout the entire work
the applications of the Calculus to the treatment of natural
phenomena are given much prominence, both because of their
intrinsic importance and because of the great added interest
which their introduction lends to the subject.
