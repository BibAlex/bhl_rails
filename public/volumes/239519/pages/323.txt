axle is that the carriage can be turned round in a very small space, and
on that account the construction is well adapted to cabs.
Several arrangements have been devised by means of which the
power can be applied to the front wheels, while these may at the same
time swing round independent centers. One of these constructions is
illustrated in Fig. 13, the first drawing presenting the appearance when
seen from above, the second being a view from the front. In the first
diagram the motor is shown at A, and by means of pinion B and gear
C, motion is transmitted to the axle, which is shown more clearly in
the right-hand figure. On the ends of the axle are bevel gears FF,

and these mesh into other bevel gears which revolve round the vertical
studs D. Through this train of gearing the bevel wheels E are driven,
and these are attached to the hubs of the carriage wheels. From the
first diagram of Fig. 13 it can be seen at once that the gears EE can
swing round D in either direction without in any way interfering with
the transmission of motion from gears FF. The levers HH are secured
to the sleeves GG which swing round the studs DD, hence, by connect-
ing these with the rod J and moving the latter to one side or the other
by means of the steering handle, the wheels are turned in any direction
desired.
While this construction renders the carriage as easy to steer as those
in which the motors are connected with the rear axle, it sacrifices the
