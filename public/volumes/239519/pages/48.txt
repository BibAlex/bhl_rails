appear white in the caves, and their gliding motion has an uncanny
effect. All alcoholic specimens are white.
The pigment cells can not be made to show themselves, even
by a prolonged stay in the light. The old, if kept in the light, will
not become darker, and a young one reared in the light until ten
months old not only showed no increase in the pigmentation but
lost the pigment it had at birth, taking on the exact pigmentless
coloration of the adult. Pigment cells are late in appearing in
Amblyopsis. When the young are two months old pigment is
abundant. This pigmented condition is evidently a hereditarily

transmitted condition. It disappears with age. Primarily this dis-
appearance was probably individual. But, 'as in the flounder, the
depigmentation has also become hereditarily transmitted, for even
those individuals reared in the light lose the color. Numerous
facts and experiments show that while pigment may be, and is,
developed in total darkness, the amount of color in an individual
animal depends, other things equal, directly on the amount of light
to which it is habitually exposed.
The lower and upper surfaces of the flounder, the one protected
and the other exposed to the light, give the most striking example,
and the argument is clinched here by the fact, noted by Cunning-
ham, that a flounder whose lower side is for long periods exposed
