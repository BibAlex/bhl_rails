THE LIFE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN
By IDA M. TARBELL
Drawn ft
Original Sourc
" We have here Abraham
Lincoln the Man described,
and not Abraham Lincoln
the President. A perusal
of the volume leaves a very
satisfactory feeling. It
makes our hearts warm
more than ever toward
that homely figure and the
homely speech. The man
Lincoln seems to loom up
more prominently than ever
from the midst of his con-
temporaries as the great
central figure of his gener-
ation." — New York Times.
and containing many Spt
hitherto unpublished.
Letters, and Telegrams
With 32 full-page illustrations.
"Of the rich mine of
material presented in Miss
Tarbell's 'Life,' the most
illuminating is that pertain-
ing to the war, to Lincoln's
relations with his generals
and men, his relations with
incompetency, his quiet ac-
quiescence under the storm
of criticism of his policy.
Hundreds of des-
patches are here printed for
the first time, many of them
marking the turn of the
moment's crisis, some of
them pungently characteristic."

LIFE OF
HENRY DRUMMOND
By Dr. GEORGE ADAM SMITH
" Mr. Smith's appreciation is extremely
cordial and well borne out by the facts
which are in evidence. We lay down the
book with the feeling that nothing that
Drummond ever wrote is so morally in-
spiring as his character." — The Nation.

By HAMLIN GARLAND
" Besides the diligent scholarship of the
investigator, Mr. Garland shows himself
possessed of the higher and rarer qualities
of the biographer. . . . This life shows
