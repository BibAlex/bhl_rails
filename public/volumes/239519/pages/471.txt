TWENTY-NINTH YEAR ^
THE
Populae Science
Monthly
Edited by Professor J. flcKBEN CATTELL
of Columbia University
With the Co-operation of Leading American Men of Science.
TT is fortunate for American science that America's leading scientific
periodical should continue to be published under favorable auspices.
Since its establishment by Messrs. D. Appleton & Company and the
late Dr. E. L. Youmans in 1872, this journal has been so important a
factor in the distribution of scientific knowledge that it seems almost
useless to call attention to the great names which have been associ-
ated with it during the past twenty-eight years â€” to such names as
those of Darwin, Huxley, Spencer, and many others, to whose works
many Americans were first introduced through its pages.
In the future, as in the past, THE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY
will afford an accurate and authoritative record of the progress of con-
temporary science, and besides being indispensable to the professional
investigator, it will seek to secure that popular interest and support
which are of essential importance to the cause of scientific progress.
THE NEW EDITOR
Dr. JAMES McKEEN CATTELL, Professor of Psychology in Columbia
University, and Editor of Science, occupies a well-known posi-
tion of distinction among American men of science. Dr. Cattell is
thoroughly familiar with the needs of the general public, and will
have these in view as well as those of special scientific knowledge.
He will be assisted in the editorship by Dr. E. L. Thorndike, of Colum-
bia University.
