MALARIA AND THE MALARIAL PARASITE. 317
us to understand the pathology and etiology of malaria. Secondly, they
help us in diagnosis. Thirdly, our knowledge of the parasite is in-
valuable in directing treatment. Lastly, a knowledge of the life-history
of the malarial parasite is of extreme value for the prevention of
malarial disease, for could we by mechanical or other arrangements
prevent the mosquito attacking the human body, we could prevent
the malarial parasites from entering the human body; or if we could
abolish the mosquito by drainage or other means from a country, then
we might be sure that we would abolish the malaria of that country also.
Attempts are being made to solve these practical problems. At the
present moment such attempts are being actively made in Eome by
Professor Celli and elsewhere by others. I have no doubt that in the
course of a few years we shall get some very valuable results in this
direction and that, thanks to this new-born knowledge about the
malarial parasites, better times are rapidly approaching for malarial
countries.
