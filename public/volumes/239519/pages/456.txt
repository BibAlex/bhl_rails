BIRD STUDIES WITH A CAMERA.
WITH INTRODUCTORY CHAPTERS ON THE OUTFIT AND
METHODS OF THE BIRD PHOTOGRAPHER,
By FRANK M. CHAPMAN,
Assistant Curator of Vertebrate Zoology in the American Museum of Natural History ; Author
of " Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America," and " Bird-Life." Illustrated
with over 100 Photographs from Nature by the Author.
J2mo. Cloth.
BIRD students and photographers will find that this book possesses for them a unique interest and
value. It contains fascinating accounts of the habits of some of our common birds, and descriptions
of the largest bird colonies existing in Eastern North America ; while its author's phenomenal success in
photographing birds in Nature not only lends to fie illustrations the charm of realism, but makes the book
a record of surprising achievements with the camera. Several of these illustrations have been described by
experts as "the most remarkable photographs of wild life we have ever seen." The book is practical as
well as descriptive, and in the opening chapters the questions of camera, lens, plates, blinds, decoys, and
other pertinent matters are fully discussed, making the work an admirable guide for the camera hunter,
who can not but be stimulated by its author's enthusiasm and convincing demonstration of the methods he
recommends. It is of course unnecessary to speak of the author's high standing as an ornithologist, his
" Handbook of Birds" and " Bird-Life" having taken a leading place among books upon birds.
