U Pegasi is a star which proved as perplexing as Tan Cygni. It was
first supposed to be of the Algol type, with a period of about two days.
Then it was found that a number of minima occurred during this
period, and that the actual interval between them was only a few hours.
The great difficulty in the case arises from the minuteness of the
variation, which is but little more than half a magnitude between the
extremes. The observations of Wendell, at the Harvard Observatory,
with the polarizing photometer, enabled Pickering to reach a con-

Fig. 3. Light Curve or U Pegasi, of the Beta LyrÂ« Type, from Observa-
tions by Wendell at the Harvard Observatory. Magnitude at
Maximum, 9.32; at Principal Minimum, 9.90; at Secondary Minimum,
9.76. Period, 9 hours.
elusion which, though it may still be open to some doubt, seems to be
the most likely yet attainable. The star is of the Beta Lyras type; its
complete period is 8 hours 59 minutes 41 seconds, or 19 seconds less
than nine hours; during this period it passes through two equal maxima,
each of magnitude 9.3, and two unequal minima 9.76 and 9.9, alter-
nately.
The difference of these minima, Om. 14, is less than the errors which
really ordinarily affect measures of a star's magnitude with the best
photometers. Some skepticism has, therefore, been felt as to the
reality of the difference which, if it does not exist, would reduce the
periodic time below four and one-half hours, the shortest yet known.
