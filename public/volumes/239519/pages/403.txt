front. The black dots, with pennons, indicate the general position of
the vedettes at this point, though, of course, they are continually ad-
vancing. The commander has noted on his map a foot path, beginning
at *D', leading over the rugged hills. By taking this path a consider-
able distance could be saved; but it is quite impracticable for the
wagons, and the troops, therefore, continue along the high road. The
valley is gently undulating, with a gradual slope from the low hills
towards the stream.
The projecting hills near the head of the column form an especially
dangerous point. What easier than for an enemy to plant batteries here
on either side of the road. A sudden, heavy fire would throw a neg-
ligent force at once into disorder; a situation to be taken instant ad-
vantage of by a vigorous adversary; a charge of horse concealed behind
the hill at c O', and nothing might be left except flight, with great loss
of life, and surrender with loss â€” if not of honor, at least of reputation
as a safe leader.
Happily, we shall avoid both alternatives. Our scouts have ex-
plored most thoroughly every possible vantage ground. They have
not been content with any mere glances; their instructions are to take
nothing for granted. That field, marked 'G', looks innocent enough,
but the tall, thick rye or corn may cover a skilfully placed battery. The
plot marked 'M' may be simply a vineyard; but it does no harm to in-
quire. The inhabitants of the country are friendly, and, therefore, the
chances are not favorable to this sort of surprise; but in war it is often
not the likely, but the unexpected that happens; the commander who
knows his business guards against the remote possibility.
