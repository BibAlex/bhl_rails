PHOTOGRAPHY OF SOUND WAVES.

make the method intelligible. The sound photographed in each case is
the crack of an electric spark, which is illuminated and photographed by
the light of a second spark, occurring a brief instant later. In front of a
large lens (a telescope objective, for example) two brass balls are mounted,
between which the 'sound spark." as I shall call it, passes. The instant
the spark jumps across the gap, a spherical wave of condensed air starts
out, which, when it reaches our ear, gives the sensation of a snap. The
object is to photograph this wave before it gets beyond the limits of the
lens. The camera is mounted in front of the lens and focussed on the

brass balls, which appear in line in the picture so that the sound qjark is
always hidden by the front one. The spark, on jumping between the
balls, charges a Leyden jar, which instantly discharges itself between
two wires placed behind the lens, producing the illuminating spark.
This second spark can be made to lag behind the first just long enough
to catch the sound wave when it is but a few inches in diameter, not-
withstanding the fact that the spherical wave is expanding at the
rate of eleven hundred feet a second. The photographs show in every
case the circle of the lens filled tip with the light of the illuminating
