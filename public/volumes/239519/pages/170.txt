CHAPTERS ON THE STARS. 239
the imaginary star just mentioned, the number expressing its magnitude
being — 1.4.
This suggests what we may regard as one of the capital questions in
celestial photometry. There being no limit to the extent of the scale,
what would be the stellar magnitude of the sun as we see it when ex-
pressed this way on the photometric scale? Such a number is readily
derivable when we know the ratio between the light of the sun and
that of a star of known magnitude. Many attempts have been made
by observers to obtain this ratio; but the problem is one of great
difficulty, and the results have been extremely discordant. Amongst
them there are three which seem less liable to error than others; those
of Wollaston, Bond and Zollner. Their results for the stellar magni-
tude of the sun are as follow:
Wollaston —26.6
Bond —25.8
Zollner —26.6
Of these, Zollner's seems to be the best, and may, therefore, in
taking the mean, be entitled to double weight. The result will then be:
Stellar magnitude of sun — 26.4
From this number may be readily computed the ratio of sunlight
to that of a star of any given magnitude. We thus find:
The sun gives us:
10,000,000,000, the light of Sirius.
91,000,000,000, the light of a star of magnitude 1.
9,100,000,000,000, the light of one of magnitude 6.
The square roots of these numbers show the number of times we
should increase the actual distance of the sun in order that it might
shine as a star of the corresponding magnitude. These numbers and
the corresponding parallax are as follows:

These parallaxes are those that the sun would have if placed at such
a distance as to shine with the brightness indicated in the first column.
They are generally larger than those of stars of the corresponding mag-
nitudes, from which we conclude that the sun is smaller than the
brighter of the stars.
