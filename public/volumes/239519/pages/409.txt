patriotic and peaceful people, men are inclined, even though brave as
courage itself, to get nervous or nerveless in the immediate presence of
danger. This is the reason, rather than for any especial erudition in-
volved in war's art, that we need trained soldiers — men trained to think
mechanically and to act automatically amid the uproar of battle.
We have carefully, if briefly, considered the requirements of the
first maxim of strategy — caution — the need of it, and the practical
methods of securing it; and also of the second maxim — defensive re-
lations — their necessity, and how to secure them. It now remains to
consider the meaning of that phrase, 'turning a position', or 'flanking*
an enemy, as to which of late we read so much in the daily press. The
map (marked 8) gives an idea of a section of country where two armed
bodies meet under conditions that permit one flank to be completely
guarded from attack; these are the left flank of the force 'A', and the
right flank of 'B'. Both rest upon a lake or broad river. A steep
precipice or deep morass, as at 'H', would serve as well. Suppose our
force has advanced from the direction 'C, the enemy down the road
from 'E' to 'G'. Soon they form opposed lines facing each other, the
reserve somewhat to the rear and sheltered by some inequality of ground,
the 'thin blue line', almost, but not quite, touching elbows, stretched
along the crest of the ridge in front, taking advantage of every chance
to protect themselves — trees, stone walls, ditches; kneeling, crawling,
lying face down, eyes along the rifle barrel, finger on trigger, keen and
murderous, but prudent, and parsimonious of life. The solid forma-
tions, such as went out of vogue with old-time weapons, would melt
away before machine guns and Krag-Jorgensens like frost before an
