The actual construction of the engine is better shown in Fig. 1G, in
which A A are the cylinders, B is the steam chest and G G are the
valve rods. The piston rods connect with the crossheads C. The
connecting rods D transmit motion from the latter to the cranks E,
and thus rotate the shaft S. The link motions, by means of which the
direction of rotation is reversed, are at 1 1, and are operated by the
lever G, which is mounted upon the shaft F F. This shaft is directly
connected with the starting lever. The boiler feed pump is located
at M. The motion of the engine is transmitted to the rear axle of the
carriage by means of a chain that runs over the sprocket wheel L
located between the eccentrics K Iv. In Fig.- 15, this wheel is located
at D, and the chain F connects it with the axle sprocket E.

Fig. 17 shows another American steam carriage. In this vehicle
the running gear is a complete truck, upon which the carriage body is
supported. The appearance of the truck with the body removed is
shown in Fig. 18. The boiler is of the tubular type and the double cyl-
inder engine is secured to its side. In this particular the construction
differs from that of the previously described carriage, for in that the
engine is attached to the cross-framing of the body of the vehicle.
Although the general appearance of the mechanism of these two car-
riages is very similar, there are many differences in the details of their
construction. In both, vertical tubular boilers are used, and the steam
is generated by the use of gasoline, which is burned in the vaporized
state in specially constructed burners. The engine in both cases is of
