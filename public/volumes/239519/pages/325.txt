the axle. The American designer, however, would in most eases be
controlled more by the artistic appearance and would use a single chain
which would be placed under the body of the carriage, and thus as much
out of sight as possible.
Fig. 16 shows an English design of electric dog cart. The mechan-
ism consists of a single motor which is connected with the axle by means
of spur gearing, this being so arranged that several different speeds can
be obtained for the vehicle with the same velocity for the motor. To
obtain variable speeds by means of gearing it is necessary to introduce
a considerable amount of complication, and in thi< country the opinion
of mosl designers appeals to be that the gain effected thereby is not
sufficient t<> compensate for the increased complication, and differential
speed gearing is not often used.
A comparison of Figs 14 and 16 with 6 and 9 will clearly show that
in so far as artistic effeci is concerned, our manufacturers of electric
vehicles have little to learn from Europeans, although the industry here'
is much younger than abroad. As to the operative merits, all that can
be said is tbat the American carriages run so well and possess such en-
durance that it is probable that they are not second U> any in these
respects.
