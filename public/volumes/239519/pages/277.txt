thing from nothing. The body of the carriage was used as a reservoir
for the compressed air, and within the wheels were placed a number
of pumps, the short bars projecting from the peripheries being the ends

of the plungers. The expectation was that as the wheels revolved,
the plungers would be depressed, and thus air would be pumped into
the reservoirs and this air would operate the engine that propelled the
vehicle; hence the apparatus would supply its own power, and realize
perpetual motion. If this attempt to controvert the laws of nature had
not been relied upon, better results might have been obtained.
The highly ornamental coach shown in Fig. 9 was invented by Dr.
Church about 1832. In addition to being ornamental, it was of mas-
sive construction and large capacity, being able to accommodate fifty
passengers. Its operation is said to have been very satisfactory, a
high rate of speed being attained and all grades on ordinary roads
being easily mounted. The inventor swamped himself in endeavoring
to compete with railroads.

Perhaps the most perfect of all the early automobiles was the one
devised by Scott Russell, the celebrated designer of the Great Eastern.
This carriage is shown in Fig. 10. It was operated successfully, and
was able to mount the steepest hills and to attain a high rate of speed,.
