the making of lyddite. It is slightly ex-
plosive when heated, is injurious when
it comes in contact with an abrasion
of the skin, and has been shown by
physiological experiments to be a highly
improper substance to mix with food.
A goose market is held regularly in
October at Warsaw, Poland, to which
about three million geese are brought,
most of them to be exported to Ger-
many. Often coming from remote prov-
inces, many of these geese have to travel
over long distances, upon roads which
would wear out their feet if they were
not " shod." For this purpose they are
driven first through tar poured upon
the ground, and then through sand.
After the operation has been repeated
several times the feet of the geese be-
come covered with a hard crust that
effectively protects them.

An International Congress of Medi-
cal Electrology and Radiology has been

gress system of the Paris Exposition,

A CUKious fall of " black snow,"
which was observed at Molding, Aus-
tria, at the beginning of the year, was
found to consist largely of the insects
known as "glacier fleas," which were
supposed to have come along with a
violent snowstorm from some of the Al-
pine glaciers.
How to write 1900 in Roman numer-
als is a question of the day that will
have to be settled. Three ways are sug-
gested by Mr. J. Fletcher Little in the
London Times, either of which is cor-
rect according to the Roman system.
They are MDCCCC, MDCD, and MCM.
But when we reach the year 1988, if we
use the first of these methods we shall
have to write the formidable-looking
formula MDCCCCLXXXVIII, whereas
if we use the third and shortest method,
it will only be MCMLXXXVIIIâ€” and
that is long enough. The third method,
therefore, which may be interpreted as
meaning one thousand plus another
thousand lacking a hundred, seems to
be the simplest.
Dr. St. George Mivart, Professor
of Biology in University College, Ken-
sington, died suddenly in London, April
1st, aged seventy-two years. He was
author of numerous scientific works, of
treatises critical of Darwinism and the
theory of evolution, and of demonstra-
tions of the harmony of Roman Cath-
olic dogma with proved scientific facts.
His name has been made prominent of
late by his recantation of his previously
expressed views of the consistency of
dogma with science, and the corre-
spondence with Cardinal Vaughan
which grew out of it.
