sleeve has its ends formed so as to engage with the gears mounted upon
shaft G, and by means of a lever, which is not shown, but which works
in groove a, the clutch either s or ss can be thrown into engagement
with its corresponding gear. If s is thrown into gear, as shown in the
drawing, the wheel F will turn H and the pinion I will rotate the gear
J which is mounted upon the axle of the carriage. If the clutch ss is
thrown into engagement, the gear G will turn K and this wheel will
turn I; but, as can be clearly seen, the direction in which I will revolve

will be opposite to its motion when driven through F and H, there-
fore, if when F drives the carriage runs forward, when G drives it will
run backward, and when E is moved to the central position, so that
neither s nor ss engages with their respective gears, the vehicle will
stand still, but the motor will continue to revolve.
This diagrammatic arrangement is more simple than the gearing ac-
tually used and is not as complete in action as many of the devices, as it
only provides means whereby the direction of rotation of the axle may
