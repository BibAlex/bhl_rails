EVOLUTION OF THE AUTOMOBILE.

supplied to the burner, and this supply in turn is regulated by the
pressure of the steam, so that the action is entirely automatic. The
cylinder H is a reservoir of compressed air, connected with tank I, so
that the gasoline is under pressure, and therefore is forced through
the pipe to the burner under the boiler. Between the burner and the
tank there is a valve controlled by the steam pressure, being opened
when the pressure is low and closed when it is high. When the pressure
reaches a certain point the valve is closed entirely, so that even if the
carriage is running very slowly, it is not possible to run the pressure
above the fixed limit. The exhaust passes from the engine cylinders

into a muffler, from which it escapes into the pipe K. This pipe
projects downward into an opening through the center of the water
tank, and the draught produced thereby draws the gases of combustion
through from the top of the boiler to the under side of the carriage
body, where they escape into the atmosphere.
Directly in front of the exhaust muffler is seen the water gauge,
which is in such a position as to be outside of the carriage body, as
shown in Fig. 14. A mirror is placed at the front of the vehicle, and
by looking into this the water gauge can be seen. Fig. 14 also shows
clearly the position of the operating levers at the side of the carriage.
