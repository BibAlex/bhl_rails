a wheel drops into a hole in the pavement, but the leverage of B being
very short, this tendency is so small as to be hardly noticeable.
Fig. 10 illustrates the general principle upon which the front axle
is designed, but the construction of the swivel joints P is far more
elaborate, as can be seen from Fig. 11, which illustrates the actual de-
sign employed in the vehicles just described. Looking at Fig 9, it will

convex side upward. In Fig. 11 B is the end of the upper curved rod

easting A, which holds the part I) upon which the wheel is carried,
D being the part B at the left side of Fig. 10. The end E which is
broken off in the drawing extends through the hub of the wheel and is
provided with ball bearings so as to run without friction. The upper
end F, of D, is arranged so as to be held by a ball bearing, as shown,
against the end of ./. By means of an adjusting screw T at the lower
