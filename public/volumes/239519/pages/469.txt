M OLLER'S OIL
... IS DIFFERENT
from other cod-liver oils, as it is never
sold in bulk. It is bottled when manufac-
tured, thus passing direct to the consumer
without the possibility of adulteration.
EACH BOTTLE OF

bears on the* label, in perforated letters,
the date ot manufacture, so that the pur-
chaser may always insist on having oil of
the latest season's production, and know
that he is getting it.

only in flat oval bottles, and bears our
name as sole agents.
