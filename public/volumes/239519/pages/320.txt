tinually swings from side to side, and occasionally with a considerable
amount of violence. It will be evident from this fact that if the front
axle of an automobile were the same as that of a horse vehicle, the driver
would have an unpleasant task, to say the least, in holding the steer-
ing lever in position, and should one of the wheels drop into a rut, the
handle would be jerked violently out of his hand and the vehicle would
sheer off to one side, possibly with serious results. To avoid this diffi-
culty the front wheels of horseless carriages are arranged so as to swing
round on a center close to the hub, if not actually within it. The

view from above. On the left-hand side of Fig. 10, A is the axle proper,
and BB are the portions upon which the wheels are placed. The cen-
tral part A is held rigidly to the body of the vehicle or to the truck
which carries it, and the ends BB are swung round the studs PP in
a manner more clearly indicated on the right-hand side. Here
the levers CC are shown, and these extend from ihe side of BB. The
right-angle lever E is connected with the steering lever by means of
rod F, hence, when G is moved, rod D moves, and thus levers CC are
rotated round the studs PP, and in that way the supporting studs BB
