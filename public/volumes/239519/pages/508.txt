The Life of
Abraham Lincoln
by Ida M. Tarbell
•• One need only to look back over the
biographies of Washington, of the kings of
England, of Frederick the Great, of any hero
of any people, to see how rare a thing in past
generations was the desire to present a man
exactly as he was, not as his friends or his
enemies wished him to appear. The reader
of history to-day desires above all things to
see a realistic, truthful portrayal of the real
man, whether saint or sinner, or (as generally
happens) a mixture of both. Miss Tarbell
has given us this. There has been no other
life of Lincoln which, without attempt at
idealization, still gives so vivid an impression
of the true greatness of the man."
