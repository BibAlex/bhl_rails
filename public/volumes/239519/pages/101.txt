The mother Mulatto was next mated with a highly bred gray Arab
horse, Benazrek. The offspring agrees in all respects with ordinary
foals; it had, however, a certain number of indistinct stripes, which
could only be detected in certain lights. The stripes were not nearly so
clear as in a foal bred by Mr. Darwin from a cross-bred bay mare and a
thoroughbred, and they disappeared entirely in about five months.
Becently Mulatto has produced a third foal to Loch Corrie, a sire be-
longing to the Isle of Bum group of West Highland ponies, and closely
resembling his mate. This foal was about as much striped as its imme-
diate predecessor. In both cases the pattern of the stripe differed
not only from that of Matopo, the previous sire, but from that of the
hybrid Bomulus. These two foals seem to lend some support to teleg-

ony; but the evidence which might be drawn from the second of them
is destroyed by the fact that the sire Loch Corrie has produced foals
from two West Highland mares, one brown and one black, and each
of these foals has as many and as well marked stripes as the foal of
Mulatto.
2. Four attempts were made to cross the zebra with Shetland ponies;
only one succeeded. The hybrid was a smaller edition of Bomulus. The
dam Nora had been bred from before, and had produced, by a black
Shetland pony, a foal of a dun color which was markedly striped. After
the birth of the hybrid she was put to a bay Welsh pony; the resulting
foal had only the faintest indication of stripes, which soon disappeared.
It is a remarkable fact that Nora's foals were more striped before she
had been mated with the zebra than afterward.
