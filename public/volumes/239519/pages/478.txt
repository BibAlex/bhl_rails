Life of Napoleon Bonaparte
By IDA M. TARBELL
This is a profusely illustrated work, prepared with the aim of omitting no im-
portant Napoleonic picture. In the case of great paintings indispensable to a com-
plete pictorial life of Napoleon, of which etchings or engravings were not obtainable,
photographs were specially prepared ; and in consequence the work is singularly
complete on its pictorial side. Moreover, it contains one of the most readable short
biographies of Napoleon anywhere in existence.
