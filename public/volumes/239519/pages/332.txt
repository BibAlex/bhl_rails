THE HUMAN BODY AS AN ENGINE. 499
may be 100 degrees or more, and we do not know of any such difference
of temperature in the body. Indeed, we know, on the contrary, that the
temperature of the body is remarkably uniform, as already stated. It
is possible, however, that there are molecular differences of large
amount. In other words, if we could make an ultra-microscopic sur-
vey of temperature in a muscle during contraction, there might be
found places of high temperature where combustion was occurring, and
all the requirements of a heat engine of molecular dimensions fulfilled.
But this is a matter of speculation. The process may yet be found to be
electrical, or something else quite different from that of a steam engine.
We thus find between the animal body and a locomotive engine a
striking parallel. In many particulars the chemical and physical pro-
cesses going on in the latter are found also in the former. In both, the
fundamental law of the conservation of energy is strictly observed.
Nevertheless, the animal body considered simply as a machine is far
more complex in its structure and operation than the engine, and far
more of mystery envelops its working. Much remains for the chemist
and physicist and physiologist to reveal, and no more fascinating field
of research exists.
