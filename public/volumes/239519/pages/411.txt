from a narrow circuit, it should be made to embrace the widest area of
country and the utmost latitude of information — the condition of the
enemy as to armament, resources, position of forces, possible disaffection
among the people — everything. In war no item comes amiss. The
wealthier country will here have a manifest advantage; it can afford
to hire spies, and can even (as England did during the Revolution) pur-

country will — if good generalship prevails — take the shape of occupy-
ing and strengthening the natural strategic positions. These are noth-

dots represent strategic positions along the frontier. They are points
susceptible of thorough fortification which control the several passes
in the mountain range between the two nations; also heads of valleys,
where several meet, and from which attacks could be made at will in a
number of directions. This entire frontier, which may be hundreds of
miles broad, is mountainous, capable of being fortified at countless
points, and having natural 'defensive relations' needing only the art of
warcraft to render them almost impregnable. Modern murderous arms

possible that the country 'B', warned in due season of the purposes of
her powerful rival, may have plotted out each rod of ground among
those mountain passes, and that artillery service, once a matter of gun-
nery, has now become a matter of mathematics.
We now come to the fourth maxim of war; it is that of efficient
