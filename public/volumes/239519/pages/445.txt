well as that of Briinnow and Ball, in applying the equatorial telescope
to the same purposes, the parallax of nearly 100 stars has been
measured with some approach to precision.
A rival method to that of the heliometer has been discovered in
the photographic telescope. The plan of this instrument, and its appli-
cation to such purposes as this, are extremely simple. We point a
telescope at a star and set the clock-work going, so that the telescope
shall remain pointed as exactly as possible in the direction of the star.
We place a sensitized plate in the focus and leave it long enough to
form an image both of the particular star in view and of all the stars
around it. The plate being developed, we have a permanent record
of the relative positions of the stars which can be measured with a
suitable instrument at the observer's leisure. The advantage of the
method consists in the great number of stars which may be examined
for parallax, and in the rapidity with which the work can be done.
The earliest photographs which have been utilized in this way are
those made by Eutherfurd in New York during the years 1860 to 1875.
The plates taken by him have been measured and discussed principally
by Eees and Jacoby, of Columbia University. Before their work was
done, however, Pritchard, of Oxford, applied the method and published
results in the case of a number of stars.
One of the pressing wants of astronomy at the present time is a
parallactic survey of the heavens for the purpose of discovering all the
stars whose parallax exceeds some definable limit, say 0"1. Such a
survey is possible by photography, and by that only. A commence-
ment, which may serve as an example of one way of conducting the
survey, has been made by Kapteyn on photographic negatives taken by
Donner at Helsingf ors.
These plates cover a square in the Milky Way about two degrees
on the side, extending from 35° 50' in declination to 36° 50', and from
20h. lm. in R. A. to 20h. 10m. 24s. Three plates were used, on each
of which the image of each star is formed twelve times. Three of the
twelve impressions were made at the epoch of maximum parallactic
displacement, six at the minimum six months later, and three at the
following maximum. The parallaxes found on the plates can only be
relative to the general mean of all the other stars, and must therefore
be negative as often as positive. The following positive parallaxes,
amounting to 0"1, came out with some consistency from the measures:
