dismissing accidental stragglers from the discussion. In elucidating the
great question of geographical distribution, one must confine himself to
either the birds that breed therein, or to those species which regularly

Mr. Collet has, therefore, been wise in dividing his notes into four

have resulted from combining birds of regions so widely extended in
longitude and latitude.
The notes show conclusively what might have been anticipated, that

Arctic Ocean to the north of Franz Josef Land and Spitzbergen, is
strictly limited.
Including the species observed during the entire voyage, there are
only thirty-three recorded. Only twenty-one species pertain to the Arc-
