opsidse, while none of the numerous other species of fishes about
the caves met with the same accident.
2. The second explanation is that of Herbert Spencer: * " The
existence of these blind cave animals can be accounted for only
by supposing their remote ancestors began making excursions into
the caves, and, finding it profitable, extended them, generation
after generation, farther in, undergoing the required adaptations
little by little."
This second view has been modified by H. Garman in so far as
he supposes the adaptations to do without eyes and consequent
degeneration of eyes to occur anywhere where a species has no use

for eyes, enumerating burrowing animals and parasitic animals,
concluding that " the origin of the cave species (nonaquatic espe-
cially) of Kentucky were probably already adjusted to a life in
the earth before the caves were formed." In this modified sense,
Spencer's view is directly applicable to the Amblyopsidse. Hamann
goes so far as to suppose that darkness itself is not the primary
cause of degeneration, but unknown factors in the animal itself.
The three things to be considered in this connection are (a)
the habit of the cave form, (6) the modifications to enable the form
to do without the use of light, and (c) the structure of the eye as
a result of a and b.
a. The prime requisite for a candidate to underground exist-
ence is a negative reaction to light. We found that even the
epigsean Chologaster is negatively heliotropic.
b. It must also be evident that a fish depending on its sight
