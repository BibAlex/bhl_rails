THE STRUCTURE OF BLIND FISHES.

and two explanations are prominent among those suggesting its
solution :
1. The explanation of Lankester seems either a pleasantry or
the most unwarranted speculation. He says: "Supposing a num-
ber of some species of Arthropod or fish to be swept into a cavern
or to be carried from less to greater depths in the sea, those indi-
viduals with perfect eyes would follow the glimmer of light, and
eventually escape to the outer air or the shallower depths, leaving
behind those with imperfect eyes to breed in the dark place. A
natural selection would thus be effected. In every succeeding gen-
eration this would be the case, and even those with weak but still
seeing eyes would in the course of time escape, until only a pure
race of eyeless or blind animals would be left in the cavern or
deep sea."
This process does not, of course, account for the degeneration
of the eye beyond blindness. But, aside from this objection, the
humor of his " glimmer of light " impresses itself very forcibly
on one after spending a day in following the devious windings of a
living cave, not to mention his tendency in cave animals, which
are negatively heliatropic, to follow it. There are other objec-

tions. Fishes arc annually swept into the caves, but they are not
able to establish themselves in them. To do this they must have
peculiar habits, special methods of feeding and mating before a
successful colonization of caverns can become successful. Fur-
ther, if the origin of the cave fauna is due to accident, the acci-
dent must have happened to four species out of six of the Amblv-
