THE FUGITIVES by morley Roberts
A tale of love in war, written in the author's usual graphic style. Two sisters
living in England have strange love affairs. The lover of one is a British captain
captured at Magersfontein and sent to Pretoria. The lover of the other sister goes
to Pretoria, manages to get the captain out of jail, and they escape to Durban, where
the captain dies, but his fickle sweetheart has already married another. It is full of
incident and the action moves rapidly. The background of course is the Boer War.
