basis of modern views of life's needs,
it is partly because they are more easily
introduced and retained as electives and
partly because there is no agreement as
to which studies will be the best to pre-
scribe.
The idea that reformers desire to
have a course containing studies good
for children and studies not good for
them and to trust the scholars' likes
and dislikes to guide them to the for-
mer, is absurd. Whether they are right
in assuming that what is best for one
boy may not be best for another, that
his teachers and parents can help him
to pick out a course of study better for
him than any inflexible course prescribed
for all can be, is a question of impor-
tance, but one which Professor Mun-
sterberg does not try to answer. In-
stead, he tells us about his gratitude
to his parents and teachers for never let-
ting him neglect his steady toil at pre-
scribed Greek for the pursuits which he
himself elected out of school, such as
electrical engineering, botany, novel-
writing, reading Arabic, writing books
on the prehistoric anthropology of West
Prussia, etc., etc. Now, this confession
about his early life absolves us from
paying any further attention to his ex-
perience as a lesson to our high-school
youths. The youth Miinsterberg and
the average high-school student do not
belong in the same class. For he was
evidently an eminent boy as he is an
eminent man. We must admit, how-
ever, that the rigorous discipline af-
forded by the prescribed Latin and
Greek is evidenced in the present stern
moral sense of the professor, who is will-
ing to abandon his chosen and favorite
pursuit, laboratory experimentation,
and at the call of duty give himself to
the hated but necessary tasks of writing
philosophical disquisitions, political dis-
cussions and articles on school reform.
