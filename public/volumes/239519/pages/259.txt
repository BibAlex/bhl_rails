the southern, Gould's 'Uranometria Argentina.' A zone from the equator
to 30° south declination is common to both; for this zone I use Gould.
The number of each class in the entire sky, north and south of the
celestial equator, is as follows:
Northern Southern
Hemisphere. Hemisphere.
Pickering. Gould. Total.
1+ 9 14 23
2.0 17 15 32
2.5 17 24 41
3.0 37 41 78
3.5 61 74 135
4.0 114 126 240
4.5 228 234 462
5.0 450 426 876
5.5 787 681 1,468
6.0 789 1,189 1,978
Sum. 2,509 2,824 5,333
It would seem from this that the number of lucid stars in the south-
ern celestial hemisphere is 315 greater than in the northern. But this
arises wholly from a seemingly greater number of stars of magnitude 6.
In the zone 0° to 30° S., Pickering has 214 stars of this class fewer than
Gould. Hence it is not likely that there is any really greater richness
of the southern sky.
The total number of lucid stars is thus found to be 5,333. But it is
not likely that stars of magnitudes 6.1 and 6.2 should be included in this
class, though this is done in the above table. From a careful study and
comparison of the same data from Pickering and Gould, Sehiaparelli
enumerated the stars to magnitude 6.0. He found:
North pole to 30° S 3,113 stars.
30° S. to south pole 1,190 "
Total lucid stars 4,303
For most purposes a classification by entire magnitudes is more in-
structive than one by half magnitudes. From the third magnitude
downward we may assume that 40 per cent, of the stars of each half
magnitude belong to the magnitude next above, and 60 per cent, to that
next below. We thus find that of
