THE PENYCUIK EXPERIMENTS. 133
3. Five Icelandic ponies were mated with Matopo, of whom one
produced, in 1897, a dark-colored hybrid. The dam, Tundra, was a
yellow and white skewbald which had previously produced a light bay
foal to a stallion of its own breed. Her third foal (1898) was fathered by
a bay Shetland pony, and in coloration closely resembled its dam.
There was no hint of infection in this case. This year Professor Ewart
has bred from this mare, by Matopo, a zebra-hybrid of a creamy-fawn
color, and so primitive in its markings that he believes it to stand in
much the same relation to horses, zebras, and asses as the blue-rock
does to the various breeds of pigeons (see illustration).

4. Two Irish mares, both bays, produced hybrids by Matopo, and
subsequently bore pure-bred foals. One of the latter was by a thorough-
bred horse, the other by a hackney pony. The foals were without
stripes, and showed no kind of indication that their mother had ever
been mated with a zebra.
5. Although Professor Ewart experimented with seven English
thoroughbred mares and an Arab, he only succeeded in one case. The
mare produced twin hybrids, one of which unfortunately died imme-
diately after birth. This summer the same mare has produced a foal
to a thoroughbred chestnut; "neither in make, color, nor action'' does it
in any way resemble a zebra or a zebra-hybrid.
