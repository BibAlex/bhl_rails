EVOLUTION OF THE AUTOMOBILE. 411
but as coal was used for fuel and the engines were of large capacity,
it is probable that the smoke, exhaust steam and noise of the machinery
were decidedly objectionable features. A line of these coaches was
put in commission in Glasgow in 1846, each one having a seating
capacity of twenty-six, six inside and twenty on the top. After several
months of successful operation, the line was withdrawn on account of
the opposition of the authorities and of the general public.
These few examples of the early attempts to solve the problem
of mechanical propulsion of vehicles are sufficient to show that the
automobile is not entirely a creation of the progressive mind of the
latter part of the nineteenth century, but thai it engrossed the atten-

tion of inventors more than one hundred and thirty years ago. The
success attained by the workers in this field at different periods was
directly in proportion to the degree to which the form of power used
had been perfected at the time. The first inventors attained but
slight success, owing to the fact that, in their time, the steam engine
was in a crude form, but as the construction of the latter improved,
so did that of the vehicles operated by it.
Before the days of steam, the power of wind mills was utilized to
propel vehicles, and with such success that in the sixteenth and seven-
teenth centuries wind-propelled wagons or 'Charvolants,' as they were
-called, were very numerous upon the flat plains of the Netherlands.
