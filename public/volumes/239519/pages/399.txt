gear is used. The plan of the truck, showing the general arrangement
of the mechanism, is presented in Fig. 9, and the details of the variable-
speed gear are shown in Fig. 10. The motor is located at A, and through
a friction clutch B, and the variable speed gear C, it rotates the shaft 77,
which runs lengthwise of the vehicle. Motion is imparted to the hind
axle by means of bevel gears contained within the casing D. The large

bevel gear on the axle is of the differential type, so as to drive the wheels
H R at the proper velocities.
When a high speed is desired, the variable speed gear, Fig. 10, is set
so that shaft M drives N direct, the clutch at E being moved so as to
interlock. N is the end of shaft //, so that with this connection the
bevel pinion, which meshes into the axle gear at D, revolves at the same
velocity as the motor shaft. By moving the handle V, Fig. 9, to the
