moon was allowed to radiate upon the bolometer, and the still larger
negative deflection of 18 mm. was observed.
The important result was that the corona gave a positive indication
of heat as compared with the moon.
This heat, though certain, was, however, too slight to be sub-divided
by the dispersion of the prism with the means at hand.
The negatives taken to depict the outer corona show from three
to four solar diameters extension for the longest streamers. The equa-
torial 'wings,' as they recede from the sun, are finally lost in an illu-
minated sky, without any indication of having actually come to an end.
No attempt to carefully examine the plates taken for intra-mercurial

planets has yet been possible. It is, however, as has been remarked,
doubtful if the very faintest objects will be found, in consideration of
the considerable sky illumination during totality. However, Pleione
in the Pleiades (a star of the 6.3 magnitude), is plainly seen on one
of the plates, and some smaller ones are discernible.
On the whole, the expedition may be considered as promising to be
very satisfactory in its results, and that it was so is largely owing not
only to the efficient care of Mr. Abbot, but to the many gentlemen
who have assisted me with the loan of valuable apparatus, with counsel,
with voluntary service and with painstaking observation, to one and all
of whom I desire to express my obligations.
