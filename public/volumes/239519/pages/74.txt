THOUGHTS FOB THE TIMES.
aOOD use was made of a Wash-
ington celebration at Oberlin
College, Ohio, by the chief speaker
of the occasion, the Rev. A. A.
Berle, to utter words that are pe-
culiarly needed at the present time.
His subject was Popular American
Fallacies, and among these he noted
the following: That Anglo-Saxon-
dom is identical with the kingdom
of God; that national glory and
power can supply the place of na-
tional character; that new occasions
always teach new duties; and that
political alliances may do away with
the necessity for " a dual alliance,"
as he expressed it, " between the
people and God."
These particular fallacies, in
our opinion, were happily chosen.
There is a great deal of silly talk
current about the incomparable glo-
ries and unimaginable destinies of
the Anglo-Saxon race; and it never
seems to occur to those who indulge
in such talk that a profound sense
of one's greatness is very far from
being a sure sign of greatness. The
greatest characters are the simplest
and least boastful. Their greatness
is so native to them that they are
scarcely conscious of it; and they
leave it to others to sing their
praises. It is presuming altogether
too intimate an acquaintance with
the designs of Providence to claim
that any race in particular is
charged, above all others, with car-
rying those designs into effect.
Who knows what reservoirs of
moral and intellectual force may re-
side in nations and tribes whose
world-action has been very obscure
as yet? Dr. Arnold, of Rugby,
thought that much of high value
for civilization lay dormant in the
negro race, and it is too soon to
say he was mistaken. Then, who
knows what the Slavonic race may
bring forth? Who can calculate the
future of the vast human hive
known as China? And, after all,
what has any nation got to do except
to behave itself, be it great or small,
famous or of no great repute ? How
is it in the community? Do we ad-
mire great men who swagger, who
boast of their wealth, their strength, ,
their courage, or their virtue? A
little quiet consideration will per-
suade any man that there is one law
for all nations alike — the law of jus-
tice and humanity — and that the
greatest nation, according to any
true conception of greatness, is the
one which exemplifies that law most
perfectly in its domestic and for-
eign policy. The surest sign of
greatness in a nation, we venture to
say, is that it should hate war — not
dread it, but hate it.
It is a singular thing that any
but the most light-headed portion
of the community should fall into
the second fallacy which the speaker
mentioned — that national glory and
power can take the place of national
character. A nation requires a true
heart, an honest self-consciousness,
just as much as an individual, and
time will avenge national misdo-
ings just as surely as it will those
of individuals. No numbers, nor any
amount of huzzaing or factitious
enthusiasm, can make a vicious pol-
icy safe. You may win victories
with chariots and horsemen, but to
enjoy the fruits of peace there must
be a dominant love of justice, and
that is what war does not tend to
promote. It is also very true, as
the speaker said, that there are not
many new duties to be learned in
this age of the world. Tbere is
enough of moral truth taught in old
LofC.
