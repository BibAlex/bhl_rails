MODERN MONGOLS. 623
still the hardiest soldiers of Europe, the most unconquerable by hard-
ships, wounds and hunger. The burden-carriers of Constantinople are
still the stoutest men of our latter-day world. We might as well im-
peach the degeneracy of the Circassian highlanders, who resisted the
power of the Russian monarchy for sixty-five years, and in their last
stronghold stood at bay with drawn hunting knives — after blunting
their sabres and exhausting a stock of ammunition purchased by the
sacrifice of their herds and harvests. For these heroic mountaineers,
too, were Mongols, kinsmen of the martial Turkomans and chivalrous
Magyars. The Turanian race — a synonym of the Pan-Mongolians —
comprises as many different types as the Aryans and Semites taken
together.
In 1863 some twenty clans of the vanquished highlanders left the
Caucasus en masse to settle in the mountains of the Turkish province
of Adrianople. They will share the fate of their protectors, and may
soon be obliged to follow their flight across the Hellespont.
But the final expulsion of the West Mongols will, after all, mean
only that the Caucasians have recovered lost ground, and freed at least
Europe from an intrusive tribe of their most persistent and most for-
midable rivals.
