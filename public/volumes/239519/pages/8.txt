THE COMING TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.
By FRANK II. BIGELOW,
PROFESSOR OF METEOROLOGY, UNITED STATES WEATHER BUREAU.
r I ^HE circumstance which renders the coming total eclipse of
-L the sun, on May 28, 1900, of special significance to thousands
of people who might otherwise entirely overlook the occasion is
the fact that the path of the moon's shadow over the surface of
the earth, or the track of the eclipse, is in such a convenient local-
ity — namely, in our Southern States — as to render the places of
visibility easily accessible. Instead of being obliged to go to the
ends of the earth, at a heavy expenditure of time and money, all
the while running the risk of not seeing the eclipsed sun on account
of prevailing cloudiness, we are fortunate this time to have the
show at home in our own country. While many foreigners will
be induced to come to the United States to make observations, it
is certain that more people will be in a position to see this eclipse
with a minimum amount of trouble than has ever happened before
in the history of eclipses, at least since the telescope was invented
and careful records of the phenomenon preserved.
The track of May 28th enters the United States in southeastern
Louisiana; passes over New Orleans, La., centrally; over Mobile,
Ala., which is on its southern edge; over Montgomery, Ala., on
the northern edge; over Columbus, Ga. ; south of Atlanta, Ga.,
which lies about twenty-five miles to the north of it; near Macon,
Milledgeville, and Augusta, Ga., Columbia, S. C, Charlotte, N. C. ;
over Raleigh, N. C, which is ten miles north of the central lino;
and over Norfolk, Va., fifteen miles north of the center. The track
is about fifty miles wide in all parts, and the duration of the eclipse
