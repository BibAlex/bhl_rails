the vertical double cylinder type, and motion is transmitted to the hind
axle by means of sprocket wheels and a chain; but here the similarity
ends; the minor details, which it is not necessary to refer to in this con-
nection, are with few exceptions very different.
A careful examination of Figs. 11, 14 and 17 will show that from
an artistic point of view these examples of steam carriages are satis-
factory. In regard to their operation it can be said that they have
sufficient power to run up the steepest grades encountered on ordinary
roads at a fair rate of speed, while on level ground their velocity is
more than enough to satisfy the average rider. The danger of ex-
plosion is so remote that it need not be considered. The Serpollet
boiler is practically mexplosive, while those used in the American
vehicles are so constructed that they can withstand a pressure far
greater than any they can be subjected to in practice. It might be
expected that the motion of the machinery would produce an unpleasant
vibration, but on account of the lightness of the moving parts and
careful balancing, this effect is much reduced. The use of gasoline
as fuel, in connection with automatic burners, eliminates the smoke
and ashes incident to the use of coal, and in addition reduces the labor
of handling the vehicle, as no attention need be given to the mechanism
other than to see that the water in the boiler is maintained at the
proper level. In the case of the Serpollet carriages, not even this point
need be looked after, as the feed of the boiler is perfectly automatic.
