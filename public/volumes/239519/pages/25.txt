a revenue in excess of interest and sinking fund for the bonds issued;
yet if we should acquire $100,000,000 of additional water front
now owned by private parties the borrowing capacity of the muni-
cipality would be reduced $10,000,000, and the income would suffer
the amount of taxes on the land acquired. There should be
adopted a constitutional amendment that would separate debts in-
curred for revenue-yielding investments, such as docks and water-
works, from those created for general public improvements. The
former should not be a charge against the borrowing capacity of
the city.
The budget of the city for 1900 is $90,778,972.48, which
will be reduced $9,000,000 by the general fund, leaving some
$82,000,000 to be raised by taxation. The magnitude of this out-
lay for current expenses may be better understood by comparison
with the expenditures of other large cities. The approximate
current expenses of London last year were $73,000,000; of Paris,
$75,000,000; of Berlin, $23,347,600; of Boston, $35,454,588; of
Chicago, $32,034,008; of Philadelphia, $27,075,014.
In 1899 the State tax paid by the city of New York amounted
to $6,275,659, or nearly seventy per cent of the whole; interest on
bonds absorbed $11,275,822, leaving $75,813,644 as the actual cost
of the current expenses of local government. The gross budget
represented a per-capita tax of $24.62 on 3,500,000 inhabitants,
of which $19.56 was for local expenses. Of this enormous expen-
diture more than $35,000,000 is paid out in salaries and wages
to 37,000 officers and employees. The Police Department cost
$12,000,000 a year, of which $10,700,000 is for salaries. New
York has 6,400 policemen. Philadelphia has 2,600, and the annual
cost of the department in that city is $3,100,000 a year â€” much
lower in proportion than that of the metropolis.
The salaries and wages paid to all regular department em-
ployees, including policemen, firemen, street cleaners, and dock
builders, are higher than those paid in any other city in the world,
and almost without exception the rate has been fixed by act of the
State Legislature, and not by the local authorities. In the matter
of fixing the pay of officers and employees the city of New York
has never known any degree of home rule.
The magnitude of the city in wealth and population has always
operated against economy in local government. There has existed,
apparently, an overwhelming popular sentiment in the city, as well
as throughout the State, that such a great municipality should pay
the maximum price for everything it might require. If this sen-
timent had been satisfied by the payment of high salaries and
wages it might have been excusable from some points of view; but
