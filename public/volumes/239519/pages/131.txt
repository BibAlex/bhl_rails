When one remembers that these one hundred and eighty-seven
meters are presumably the worst of their kind, having been put in
evidence by a naturally suspicious public, it is but fair to assume that
the figures overrate rather than underestimate the errors of the average
gas meter. Quoting from The Progressive Age, a journal devoted
largely to the interests of the gas industry: "The meters made to-day
will remain a long while in service before they begin to register incor-
rectly, and when we consider the dampness, extremes of temperature
and hard usage they receive as they are transferred from cellar to attic,
from among the dust, cobwebs and litter of a basement closet to the
corner shelf of some coal cellar, to be the playground of rats, spiders
and cockroaches, to be drenched in summer by sweating or leaky water
pipes and wear a venerable beard of icicles in winter — to be, in fact,
the worst-used machine about a gas plant — we can not fail but express
surprise that it registers at all correctly.' 7
