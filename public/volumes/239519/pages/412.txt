SOME PRINCIPLES OF WARFARE. 617
supply. An army, as the saying is, moves on its belly. An invading
force must ordinarily provide for all its needs from some safe place in
the rear, called a 'base of operations'; it must also provide that the
line of transit of its provisions and ammunition to the front shall not be
liable to interference. Assuming that at 'F' is a strongly fortified city,
the railway line or the adjacent rivers would furnish 'A' with a practical
base; his line of advance would be in the direction 'FG', called the 'line
of operations'; 'G', a fortified pass, the proximate, and 'J', the capital
of 'B', the ultimate objective point of the campaign. But it will be
noted with what facility a determined enemy could fall upon 'AY com-
munications from the point 'H', which would also be the case were the
advance made from 'K' towards 'L'.
Of course, in the end, the larger resources will prevail; but it may be
that 'A', baffled and exasperated by a stubborn resistance, and finding
that 'B' is being supplied through the neutral and insignificant country
'D', may finally conclude, "in the interests of a higher civilization," to
violate their territory, seize the port 'M', and thus, by a far-reaching
and bold flank movement, gain entrance into 'BY country. Such de-
vices are not unknown in the history of war. Such a course 'would be
a distinct violation of the 'law of nations'; but there would be apologies
and ample indemnity to 'D', with which, doubtless, she would be satis-
fied.
In imagining such a campaign no account has been taken of the at-
titude of the country 'C, or of that of any foreign nation. In war these
things must be reckoned with. Neutral nations are always liable, how-
ever disposed to maintain neutrality, to be touched at some sensitive
point by one or the other of the contending parties.
