machinery was such as would soon give out, even if well designed, on
account of its exposed position.
Between 1805 and 1830, quite a number of steam vehicles were
invented and put into practical operation. Fig. 4 shows a very elabo-

rate coach of this period, which was invented by W. H. James, and
constructed with the assistance of Sir James Anderson, Bart. The
machinery used in this design consisted of two powerful steam engines,
one being connected with each one of the hind wheels in a manner
similar to that employed in locomotives at the present time. The
wheels were not fast upon the axle, hence they could revolve at different
velocities in rounding curves. In this respect this invention embodied
one of the features commonly used by automobiles of the latest design.
