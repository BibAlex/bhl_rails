It is thus evident that there is a considerable body of opinion, both
practical and. theoretical, for and against telegony; and that a re-
investigation of the subject is urgently needed. Such a reinvestigation
has been begun by Professor Ewart at Penycuik. Since the clearest
and most definite evidence of this throwing back to a previous sire is
derived from the crossing of different species of the Equidae, it was
desirable to repeat the experiment of Lord Morton. This is now
unfortunately impossible, because the quagga is extinct. The zebra is,
however, still with us, and the mating of a zebra stallion with every
variety of horse, pony, and ass, and subsequently putting the dam to
pure-bred -sires, has been the more important part of the numerous
experiments carried on in the Midlothian village some ten miles south-
west of Edinburgh.
Before considering in detail the result of the experiments 'it will
be necessary to say a few words on the question of the various species
of zebra; and since, like Weismann, Professor Ewart explains certain of
the phenomena attributed- to telegony by reversion, it will be as well
to inquire how far reversion is known among the Equidae, and what
evidence we have that the ancestor of the horse was striped.
Matopo, the zebra stallion from which Professor Ewart had up
to last midsummer bred eleven zebra-hybrids from mares of various
breeds and sizes, belongs to the widely distributed group of Burchell*s
zebras. Many subspecies or varieties are included in this group, which,
as regards the pattern of the stripes, passes â€” in certain varieties found
