in 174:7 as a drawing school, was organized in 1760 for the training
of engineers. In the States of Germany, a number of similar schools
were organized early in the present century. In America, the Bens-

founded in 1821, and was the only school devoted to applied science
until the forties, when Joseph Sheffield and Abbot Lawrence established
the schools which bear their names, in connection, respectively, with

resources of the nation; but its termination set free an abundant
store of energy, henceforward to seek its chief application in the
development of trade, commerce, manufacturing and industrial pur-
suits of every kind. From this time he success of schools of tech-
nology was assured. They were needed to supply young men for the
development of the arts; but, on the other hand, as in all things not
purely material, they were to create a demand for such men by first
