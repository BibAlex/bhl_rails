CHAPTEES ON THE STABS,

I. Introductory.
IT would be difficult to name any subject of investigation, the prog-
ress of which during our time has been more remarkable than that
in the field of stellar astronomy. Several features of this progress are
especially noteworthy. One of these is the mere extension of research.
A natural result of the northern hemisphere being the home of civ-
ilized peoples was that, thirty years ago, the study of the southern
heavens had been comparatively neglected. It is true that the curiosity
of the inquiring astronomers of the past would not be satisfied without
their knowing something of what was to be seen south of the equator.
Various enterprises and establishments had therefore contributed to
our knowledge of the region in question. As far back as 1667, during
a voyage to St. Helena, Halley catalogued the brighter stars in the
region near the South Pole. About 1750 Lacaille, of France, estab-
lished an observing station at the Cape of Good Hope, and made a cata-
logue of several thousand stars which has remained a handy book for
the astronomer up to the present time. In 1834-38 Sir John Herschel
made a special voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, armed with the best
telescopes which the genius of bis father had shown him how to con-
struct, for the purpose of doing for the southern heavens as much as
possible of what his father had done for the northern. The work
of this expedition forms one of the most important and interesting
•chapters in the history of astronomic science. Not only is Herschel's
magnificent volume a classic of astronomy, but the observations which it
•contains are still as carefully and profitably studied as any that have
