62e. GEOSPIZA FULIGINOSA DIFFICILIS (Sharpe).

Range. Abingdon Island.
This form is very close- to G.f. acutirostris of Tower, from which
it differs in the slightly larger bill. Some of our specimens, however,
are quite indistinguishable from specimens of G.f. acutirostris and
we have, hence, united this form with the fuliginosa group. This
gives two subspecies of G. fuliginosa to Abingdon, but G. f.
difficilis is quite distinct from G.f. minor. This latter species, also,
as before stated, inhabits only the lower parts of the island, ranging
from sea level up to about eight hundred feet. G. f. difficilis, on the
other hand, appears to be restricted to the higher parts of the island,
where it is common. It was the only form seen above fifteen hundred
feet, and it was here most abundant, while below five hundred feet
it was not met with at all.
This is one of the few forms that occur on Abingdon but not on
Bindloe. Perhaps the lesser height of the latter island, which does not
reach an altitude greater than eight hundred feet, accounts for the
restriction of this species to Abingdon.
We must now make a break in the series which leads on uninterrupt-
edly from the form last described through G. debilirostris and G.
septentrionalisto the forms comprising the next and highest subgenus,
Cactornis. We do this in order to go back again to G. fuliginosa
parvula and insert another series which begins with G. fortis and
