We have two specimens of a Porzana, an adult male and an adult
female, taken in January in a mangrove swamp on the east shore of
Narboro, which differ in no way from the description of P. sharpei
by Rothschild and Hartert. These two specimens are the only rails
that we saw, although much time was spent looking for others.
