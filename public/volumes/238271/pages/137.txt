BIRDS
365
Tower birds ; from which we assume that they are independently
derived. Actually they should probably be regarded as species; ac-
cording to A. O. U. rules of nomenclature as varieties.
We have one adult male and three adult females of this subspecies,
taken on Abingdon in June.
7 9 c. NESOMIMUS PERSONATUS BINDLOEI (Ridgway).
Nesomimus bindloei RIDGWAY, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xvn, p. 358, 1894
(Bindloe Island) ; Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xix, p. 492, 1896.
Nesomimus melanotis bindloei ROTHSCHILD AND HARTERT, Novit. Zool., vi,
p. 146, 1899.
Range. Bindloe.
In the color of the back this form is intermediate between N. p.
personatus of Abingdon and N. p. bauri of Tower. The central areas
of the feathers of the head and back have the same blackish tone, but
the pale edgings are wider than on the Abingdon specimens though not
so wide as on those from Tower. The intensity of the nuchal collar is
likewise intermediate between those of the other two forms. None of
the specimens has any trace of a maxillary stripe, but this mark is
absent on one of the Tower specimens.
The collection contains three adult males and three adult females
from Bindloe taken in June.
