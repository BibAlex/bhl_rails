Range. Bindloe.
This species is very similar to G. s. abingdoni but the bill is con-
siderably thicker, being the heaviest of all the varieties of G. scandens.
The basal depth is equal to the length of the gonys.
Only immature birds are in the collection but these differ so con-
spicuously from specimens of G. s. abingdoni of the same age that
it is very probable that adults will be found to differ correspondingly.
Some of the thickest billed specimens have bills almost as large as
some of the smaller billed specimens of G. c. propinqua from Tower.
The measurements of the bill of one young specimen of G. c. pro-
pinqua of the same age as the Bindloe specimens are as follows : cul-
men 19, width of bill at base 10, greatest depth at base 12. This, it
will be seen by comparison with the table of measurements of G. s.
rothschildi, is extremely close to the bill proportions of some speci-
mens of this species.

1 Rothschild and Hartert (Novit. Zool., ix, p. 398) retain the Bindloe form
under G. s. abingdoni. Their measurements of the bill depth for Abingdon spec-
imens, however, vary from 10 to 10.5, and for Bindloe specimens from n to 12.
