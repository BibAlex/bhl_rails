This species is a local form of the nearly cosmopolitan Asio accip-
itrinus (Pall.). It differs from the latter species in having a some-
what larger bill and conspicuously larger feet ; the middle toe meas-
uring about thirty two millimeters in length, while in A. accipitrinus
it is about twenty seven millimeters. A. galapagoensis differs also in
being generally darker and in having the brown streaks of the lower
parts wider and persistent upon the posterior part of the abdomen, on
the flanks, legs and under tail coverts.
This owl is more common on the Galapagos Archipelago than the
only other species found there, Strix punctatissima. On some of
the islands it is fairly abundant, especially on Duncan and Barrington.
Throughout a part of its range this species must live entirely on birds
and insects, for on Tower, Culpepper and Hood there are apparently
no rodents. On Barrington and Duncan, where it is most numerous,
mice and rats are abundant.
A set of four incubated eggs was taken on Barrington Island May
29. The nest consisted merely of a slight depression scraped in the
scanty soil where it was found, to which no lining had been added.
The eggs are white and subspherical in shape, measuring 42.5 x 34-5 ;
42.5 x 34; 43 x 34-55 4 1 x 34-
