Only one specimen of the American egret has been obtained at the
Galapagos ; it was taken by the Harris expedition and determined by
Rothschild and Hartert to be the same as South American birds.
Baur and Adams reported finding on Albemarle " a rookery of white
herons." We saw one individual on a small island in the center of a
lake in the bottom of the large tufa crater just south of Tagus Cove,
Albemarle.
