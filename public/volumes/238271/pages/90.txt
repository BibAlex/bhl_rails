SNODGRASS AND HELLER
leads up to the largest billed forms of Geospiza, viz., G. strenua and
G. magnirostris, but which in plumage are more generalized than the
members of the Cactornis group. It was only for the conventionality
of placing all the varieties of a species in continuous succession that
we did not insert the G. fortis magnirostris series immediately after
G. fuliginosa parvula.

63. THE GEOSPIZA FORTIS SERIES.
Under this series we include forms that have by Ridgway and
Rothschild been kept separate in two groups, G. fortis and G.
dubia. We have specimens from the southern end of Albemarle at
Iguana Cove that absolutely bridge over the differences between the
previously known forms of these two supposed species. These Iguana
Cove specimens we have described as a new subspecies, G. fortis
platyrhyncha. This grouping of all the forms heretofore separated
into the species fortis and dubia leads us into the necessity of recog-
nizing two subspecies of the same species on the same island wherever
the two forms occur. There are four cases of this sort : G. f. fortis
and G. f. dubia occur together on both Chatham and Duncan ; G. f.
fortis and G. f. bauri occur on James ; G. f. fortis and G. f.
simillima occur on Charles. G.f. simillima Rothschild and Hartert
is a variety of very doubtful standing, but the other three cases are
apparently well substantiated. On these islands when two subspecies
of G. fortis occur together in this manner, the two forms are always
entirely distinct, and intergrade as subspecies only through individuals
on some other island. On Albemarle where two subspecies occur
they are geographically separated and intergrade on the intermediate
territory just as do subspecies inhabiting contiguous areas on the
mainland. It may of course be questioned whether groups of indivi-
duals living on different islands and showing some average difference as
