nine millimeters in length, and the culmen in the males is in all cases
greater than eighteen millimeters. In the specimens of males from
the other islands the wing does not exceed one hundred and thirty
four millimeters and the culmen is in all cases less than eighteen milli-
meters. No differences of color are appreciable between the two
subspecies. The difference between the males of the two forms is
such that they might almost be given the rank of species. The
females are more nearly alike, being in each case smaller than the
males.
The subspecies was very common on Culpepper and Wenman. We
have seven specimens taken in December.
