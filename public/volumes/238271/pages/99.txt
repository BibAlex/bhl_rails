brownish plumage. Four have black feathers on the back with an ad-
mixture of brownish feathers, i. <?., the individual feathers are either
purely black or brown. They are all moulting. Hence, it appears
that here, at least, in June a moult occurs in which the brownish-
black plumage is lost and the black acquired. We have one male in
Stage V with the bill black, another with the bill black above and
pale below, one in Stage III with the bill entirely pale. All of these
are moulting. Two males in Stage IV, having the bills mostly pale
but partly dusky above, are not moulting.
GEOSPIZA FORTIS PLATYRHYNCHA
Heller and Snodgrass.
Geospiza fortis platyrhyncha HELLER AND SNODGRASS, The Condor, Vol.
in, No. 3, May-June, p. 75, 1901 (Iguana Cove, Albemarle Island).
Geospiza platyrhyncha RIDGWAY, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 50, Pt. I, p. 673,
1901.
Range. Iguana Cove, Albemarle.
This form is similar in size and proportions to G. fortis dubia,
but the bill averages considerably wider at the base, being twelve
millimeters or more in width. The variety intergrades through forms
at the southeastern part of Albemarle and at Elizabeth Bay with G.
fortis fortis at Tagus Cove.
It was not common at Iguana Cove either in January, March or
June. We have three adult males taken in January and March in
black plumage having very large thick bills with curved culmens, and
two females, one adult taken in March, the other taken in December.
The latter has the bill yellowish below and was moulting. The
ovaries were enlarged, however, as if the bird was breeding.
Type. Adult male, No. 5150 Leland Stanford Junior University
Museum; Iguana Cove, Albemarle, Galapagos, June 7, 1899.
