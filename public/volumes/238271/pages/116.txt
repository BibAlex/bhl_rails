moulting. The bills are very pale, being either dusky brown all
around, or having the upper mandible dusky and the lower pale
brownish or even pinkish-yellow; one purely black specimen has also
the sides of the upper mandible yellowish. The male from Culpep-
per taken in December has the bill blackish-brown except the sides
of the base of the lower mandible which are yellowish-brown. Im-
mature males resemble those of G. c. conirostris but the feathers of
the back are widely margined with grayish-buff ; they also lack, in
most cases, conspicuous buffy edgings to the greater and middle wing
coverts, although one specimen has them well developed. We have
no female specimens that appear to be mature, but, from the light
color of the bill in the adult male, one would expect to find a still
paler bill in the female.
The bill of one specimen has a distinct groove on each side of the
upper mandible, running from the nostril, in a curve parallel with the
culmen, to the tomium. Another has a less distinct groove in a simi-
lar position on the left side of the upper mandible.
The following measurements show that the Culpepper specimen
does not differ from the Tower specimen. They show also the inter-
gradation between this form and the one on Hood, and the small dif-
ference between this species and G. scandens rothschildi.
