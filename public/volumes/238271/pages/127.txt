Certhidea cinerascens cinerascens ROTHSCHILD AND HARTERT, Novit. Zool.,
vi, p. 151, 1899.
Range. Hood Island.
Almost no olivaceous shade anywhere. Upper parts, including the
wings and the tail, brown, sometimes with an almost inperceptible
shade of olive on the rump and upper tail coverts. Feathers of the head
and back with grayish shafts. Wing feathers all edged with grayish.
Below dull, dirty grayish, tinged with buff on the throat and middle
of the breast, slightly washed with brownish along the sides and on
the flanks. Auriculars light brown. Superciliary stripe gray. Bill
of adults entirely black.
This variety, together with the next, form a well marked species
distinguished from C. olivacea by the pallid grayish color.
We have fourteen adult males and three immature males of this form
taken on Hood and the neighboring small Gardner Island in May.
We did not obtain a female. The birds were very abundant about
Gardner Bay on Hood. The young associated with one another
in small flocks, much resembling thus in habits and appearance
the Bush Tits {Psaltriparus} of California. Although the breeding
season was over, the adults were still singing a great deal. Their or-
dinary notes consisted of monosyllabic twits. The adult males were
generally found solitary, not associating with the flocks of young.
One song that they sang resembled tweet" tYtt-tweet' . . tweet . . .
tweet, the second and third syllables being short and but briefly sepa-
rated from the one before. The first and fourth syllables were ac-
cented, while the fifth and sixth were separated by successively longer
intervals. Another song resembled tweet' fi-twee-u.
