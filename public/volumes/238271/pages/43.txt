based on them. Hence we must agree with Rothschild and Hartert
in placing the individuals from Charles, Indefatigable, Duncan,
James, Albemarle and Narboro together in one species, including thus
under P. nanus nanus three of Ridgway's species. The specimens
from Abingdon and Bindloe may perhaps be regarded as a separate
subspecies.
This species is nowhere very common, but occurs almost every-
where. The mangrove swamps of Albemarle and Narboro are a
favorite haunt of this bird, but we found it pretty generally distributed
from sea level to the tops of the highest mountains.

Range. Abingdon and Bindloe.
This form may very doubtfully be retained as different from the
last. Our specimens were all taken in June, while those of P. nanus
nanus were taken from January to May. The Abingdon and Bindloe
adult males, of which we have only three, differ from those of P. n.
nanus in having a distinct orange shade to the vermilion of the under
parts, the color being rather conspicuously different from that of the
average males of P. n. nanus, but from some of the latter it is scarcely
distinguishable. This color is called by Ridgway " flame scarlet or
orange chrome," but we can scarcely recognize any such difference
as this.
