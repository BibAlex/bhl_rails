and Narboro specimens, and specimens may be selected from each set
having almost no distinguishing mark whatever between them. This is
very evidently a case of convergent evolution, for the general tone of
coloration of the upper parts of the Albemarle-Narboro birds is brown,
resembling that of the James and Indefatigable specimens, while that
of the Bindloe specimens is dusky, resembling that of the Abingdon,
Tower and Culpepper specimens.
The collection contains five adult males and six adult females taken
at Tagus Cove, Albemarle, during January and March ; two adult
males and one adult female taken at Iguana Cove, Albemarle, the last
of December; six adult males and five adult females taken at Eliza-
beth Bay, Albemarle, in February ; and seven adult males and eight
adult females from the east and north sides of Narboro Island in Jan-
uary, March and April. Besides these we have numerous immature
birds.
