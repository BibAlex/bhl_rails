This species has been regarded by Rothschild and Hartert as a sub-
species of JV. melanotis. It cannot, however, be made a variety of
this form because all the specimens possess well developed black
maxillary stripes, a character not recorded on any specimen from
James or Albemarle. The same character relates the form to N.
adamsi of Chatham but it is separable from this species by the color
of the back and by the slightly longer bill.
N. bauri differs from N. adamsi as follows : color of central parts
of feathers of head blackish rather than brown, edges of some feathers
grayish rather than brownish ; central areas of feathers of back dusky
brown instead of reddish-brown ; wing and tail feathers decidedly more
blackish and the pale edgings of the same wider and whiter ; lores,
suborbital and auricular regions black instead of brownish-dusky ;
sides of lower part of breast distinctly clouded with buff but not form-
ing an entire band across the breast ; no spots on the breast in any
adult specimens.
In the collection are seven adult specimens from Tower, taken
June, 1899.

This form intergrades through the next N. personatus bindloei
with N. personatus bauri of Tower. It is probable, however, that
