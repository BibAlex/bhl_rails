Range. Albemarle and Narboro.
We have a large series of Nesomimus from Tagus Cove, Elizabeth
Bay and Iguana Cove on Albemarle and from the north and east sides
of Narboro, and we cannot discover any character separating the speci-
mens from the two islands into two varieties. Rothschild and Hartert
have described the Narboro birds as a subspecies of " N. parvulus"
This variety is most closely related to N. m. melanotis of James,
from which it is distinguishable by the general smaller size, specially
smaller bill and darker coloration of the upper parts. All the char-
acters, however, completely intergrade, so that the form cannot be re-
tained as a separate species.
It is evident that the line of development from the Chatham form
has been through the Indefatigable form to the James and from the
latter to the Albemarle-Narboro form, for all of these are linearly re-
lated to one another in the order given. The general tendency has
been toward a darkening of the color of the upper parts. The Chat-
ham specimens have the lightest shade to the feathers of the top of the
head and the back, and those of Albemarle and Narboro the darkest.
