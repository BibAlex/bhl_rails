This species is intermediate in size between G. psittacula and G.
affinis, but with a differently shaped bill. The bill is not so deep and
considerably more elongate.
We Jiave three adult specimens of this species from Abingdon and
Bindloe-. Immature birds common on Abingdon, but adults rare,
only two having been seen. Only a few seen on Bindloe.

58. GEOSPIZA INCERTA (Ridgway).
Camarhynchus incertus RIDGWAY, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xvm, p. 294, 1895
(James Island) and xix, p. 560, 1896 ; Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 50, Pt. I,
p. 482, 1901.
Geospiza incerta ROTHSCHILD AND HARTERT, Novit. Zool., vi, p. 168, 1900
(James and Duncan Islands).
Range. James and Duncan.
This species was not seen by us. According to Rothschild and
Hartert it is a very doubtful form and is probably not different from
G. affinis.
59. GEOSPIZA AFFINIS (Ridgway).
Camarhynchus affinis RIDGWAY, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xvn, p. 365, 1894,
and xix, p. 554, 1896 ; Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 50, Pt. I, p. 481, 1901.
Goespiza affinis ROTHSCHILD AND HARTERT, Novit. Zool., vi, p. 168, 1899.
Range. Albemarle.
This species is very similar in the shape of the bill to G. psittacula
psittacula. All of our specimens are considerably smaller than the
specimens of G. p. psittacula, but the two would probably be found
to intergrade if a large series could be compared.
We have five specimens from Iguana Cove, Albemarle, two of
which are adult males; the others have immature plumage, but have
black bills and are of adult size. This species is not common at
Iguana Cove and appears to be very rare about Tagus Cove, where
only a single immature specimen was secured during several weeks of
collecting.
In June these birds were heard at Iguana Cove singing a song which
may be represented by twlr*e-twe'e~t'wee-'ee-~e.
