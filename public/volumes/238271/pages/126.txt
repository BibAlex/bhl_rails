We have nine specimens from Tower Island taken in June and four
from Culpepper taken in December. We can discover no difference
whatever between the two sets of specimens either in color or in pro-
portion. The series as a whole can be distinguished from the six
Abingdon-Bindloe specimens of C. o. fusca by the slightly darker,
more brownish and less olivaceous upper parts. The distinction, how-
ever, is very slight. Hence, we combine C. o. mentalis (Ridgway)
and C. o. drouonei (Rothschild) into one variety.

Range. Wenman Island.
This form does not differ in color from C. olivacea mentalis of
Tower and Culpepper. According to Rothschild it should be lighter
below than C. olivacea droivnei (Rothschild) of Culpepper, but our
specimens from these two islands show absolutely no difference and,
as before stated, do not differ in color from the Tower specimen.
The bill of the two Wenman specimens, however, is shorter than the
bill of C. olivacea mentalis, and apparently the subspecies may be
retained on this character. Males have a distinct rufous tinge on the
throat, a pale superciliary stripe and an entirely black bill.
We have only two specimens, taken in December on Wenman.
