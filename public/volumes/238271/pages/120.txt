Genus Hirundo Linn.
Hirundo LINNAEUS, Syst, Nat. ed. 10, i, p. 191, 1758.
Range. Cosmopolitan.
72. HIRUNDO ERYTHROGASTER Bodd.
Hirundo erythrogaster BODD., Tabl. PL End., p. 45, 1873.
Hirundo rustica erythrogastra ROTHSCHILD AND HARTERT, Novit. Zool., vi,
p. 152, 1899.
Range. Breeding in North America, migrating into Central and
South America. Galapagos Archipelago : Charles, Chatham and
Hood.
We did not obtain any specimens of this species, but in May we
saw several individuals flying about over Hood. The time of the
year would lead one to suppose that they are resident in the archipelago.
Family MNIOTILTID^E.
Genus Certhidea Gould.
Certhidea GOULD, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., p. 7, 1837 (Galapagos Islands).
Range. Galapagos Archipelago.
This genus is of doubtful affinities. It was described by Gould as
belonging to the Fringillidae, but was placed in the Ccerebidae by
Sclater and Salvin. Lucas (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xvn, p. 309,
1894) concluded from a study of the anatomy of the genus that it has
a " very near relation with Dendroica " and that it " surely belongs
among the Mniotiltidae."
