throat, inclosing a buffy space between them. Sides of neck buffy.
Lower parts buffy whitish, tinged with brownish across the breast,
with a few brown spots on the sides of the breast, and darker brown
spots along the sides of the abdomen and on the flanks. Under tail
coverts whitish, under wing coverts whitish with dark brown centers.
Under surface of primaries, secondaries and rectrices paler than above,
the primaries and secondaries fading into buffy gray on their inner
margins.
Female. Like the male.
Immature. Similar to the adults, but whiter below and thickly
spotted across the breast ; under tail coverts buffy ; wing coverts and
tertials widely bordered with bright buff and white ; terminal spots on
rectrices larger, paler and much more conspicuous.
We found the species abundant in May about Gardner Bay on Hood
and on the adjoining Gardner Island. The Gardner Island on which
N. trifasciatus was taken by the Harris expedition is another island of
the same name lying near Charles. Our collection contains five adult
males, five adult females and several immature birds of both sexes.
