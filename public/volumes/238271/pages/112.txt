On Barrington we found the species even more abundant than on
Seymour. Males in black plumage here predominated. The species
is rare on Albemarle, we found it only at Iguana Cove where but three
immature specimens were secured. We have also three immature
specimens from Chatham, but we did not find the form on Duncan.

Birds of* this species from Abingdon and Bindloe can be distin-
guished from each other by the larger size of the Bindloe bill. G. s.
abingdoni is very close to G. s. fatigata, differing from it in the
slightly deeper bill, being in this respect intermediate between it and
G. s. rothschildi of Bindloe Island.

From both Abingdon and Bindloe we have only immature spec-
imens in the collection. Nearly all are in plumages corresponding
with Stages III and IV, but have rufous bands on the wing coverts
and bills either entirely yellow or mostly yellow with some dusky
above. These specimens are the blackest of all the varieties of G.
scandens in immature stages. They are almost as dusky as the adult
females and young of G. conirostris.
