than a foot in length. Fish also form a part of their food. The
young are fed by the parents with disgorged food until they have
attained nearly adult size. A large, immature bird may often be seen
pursuing an adult through the surf with loud cries and savage thrusts
of the beak, until the latter comes to terms, thrusts its beak into the
open mouth of the young and disgorges into it a mass of partially
digested food.
In January, at Black Bight, Albemarle, a small rookery was found,
consisting of four occupied nests. The nests were placed on a flat,
smooth sheet of lava at the edge of a small lagoon. They were made
of brown algae heaped up into cone-shaped masses about a foot high,
hollowed out at the top to receive the eggs. A nest measured had the
following dimensions: External diameter, seventy-five centimeters;
internal diameter, forty centimeters ; depth of the cavity, ten centi-
meters. The birds here were all in pairs, the females sitting on the
nests, the males standing quietly nearby. The females stubbornly de-
fended their nests when disturbed, making savage thrusts with their
bills and hissing loudly. Two of the nests contained each three well in-
cubated eggs. One of the others contained two eggs and one young,
the other one egg and two young. The nestlings were black and
naked. The eggs are elongate-oval or narrowly elliptical in shape
and have a light bluish-green color. This color is usually, however,
hidden by a white chalky deposit. The eggs of the two sets measure as
follows: 71x42.5, 67x42.5, 67x43, and 68x41, 68x45, 59 X4 1 -
