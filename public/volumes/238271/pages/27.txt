Common almost everywhere in the archipelago, especially so in the
mangrove swamps of Albemarle and Narboro. They are very tame
and allow one to approach them closely before they fly. When they
take flight, whether frightened or not, they nearly always utter in slow
succession elongated squawks. When about to alight they shorten
the notes and utter them more rapidly. In February we secured a set
of three eggs at Elizabeth Bay, Albemarle. The nest consisted of a
loosely constructed platform of dead twigs, placed in a tree of a man-
grove swamp, about eight feet above the water. The eggs are plain
light green, measuring 41 x 33, 41 X 32.5, and 42 x 33. They are
widest at the middle and symmetrically narrowed at each end.

We obtained one set of three eggs in May on Indefatigable. The nest
