Tower, Abingdon, Bindloe and Culpepper ; the second those races in-

79. THE NESOMIMUS PERSONATUS SERIES.
Rothschild and Hartert have grouped all the forms of Nesomimus ex-
cept N. trifasciatus, N. macdonaldi and N. adamsi under one species
N. melanotis. We think, however, that two groups instead of one
can be distinguished, of which one, N. personatus^ inhabits the more
northern islands of the archipelago Tower, Abingdon, Bindloe and
Culpepper ; while the other, N. melanotis, inhabits the central islands
Barrington, Indefatigable, Jervis, James, Albemarle and Narboro,
and also Wenman, lying to the north.
The differences between N. personatus and N. melanotis are slight,
but the former is characterized by a blackish tone to the central areas
of the feathers rather than a brownish. In some cases the general
shade of the upper parts in N, personatus may be even lighter than
in N. melanotis, but the light color is due to the marginal areas of the
feathers, the central parts in such cases being blackish.
N. personatus is represented by a different subspecies on each
island where it occurs. Of these the one on Abingdon was described
first and hence must give its name to the group. The Tower sub-
species, however, resembles the Chatham species, N. adamsi, more than
does any of the others, so with it we begin the species.
