Larus fuliginosus GOULD, Zool. Voy. Beagle, in, Birds, p. 141, 1841 (Gala-
pagos). RIDGWAY, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xix, 1896, p. 635. ROTHS-
CHILD AND HARTERT, Novit. Zool., vi, p. 189, 1899.
Range. Galapagos Archipelago: Chatham, Hood, Charles,
Harrington, Indefatigable, James, Albemarle, Narboro, Abingdon,
Bindloe and Tower. Common about nearly all the islands except
Wenman and Culpepper where it appears to be absent. We have four
specimens taken at Tagus Cove, Albemarle, in January.
They are extremely noisy birds. When one is about to alight to
feed, whether alone or with others, it begins to utter harsh, elongated
sounds repeated in quick succession and long continued. Often, when
uttering the notes, the bird stands with the foreward part of the body
depressed. Often also, they utter a sound composed of a monotonous
series of closely repeated guttural notes resembling ah ah ah ah ahiihah.
There is never any apparent reason why they should utter these sounds.
