This form is scarcely distinguishable in color from JV. personatus
bauri of Tower. The specimens average slightly darker in color of
the back than do the Tower specimens and the maxillary stripe is
somewhat more strongly developed. The bill, however, is consider-
ably shorter, averaging in our Culpepper specimens, 26 and in the
Tower specimens 27.5 millimeters in length. The measurements,
however, in the two cases overlap, so that we can separate the Cul-
pepper form only subspecifically from the Tower race.
Rothschild and Hartert make the Culpepper form a variety of N.
melanotis. It differs, however, specifically from true varieties of N.
melanotis in the blackish color of the back and the presence of the
dark maxillary stripes.
The collection contains three adult males and two adult females
taken on Culpepper in December.

From the preceding descriptions it will be seen that the mocking-
birds inhabiting the most northern islands of the archipelago, with the
exception of Wenman, viz. Tower, Culpepper, Abingdon and Bindloe,
are interrelated to one another in such a manner that they form four
varieties of one species. They are all characterized by a melanistic
tone to the feathers of the head and generally of the back, being thus
distinguishable from those forms inhabiting the central and southern
islands of the archipelago, which have a brownish tone pervading the
upper parts. These northern forms must be named as varieties of the
Abingdon race JV. personatus^ because this was the first one described ;
but their relationship is probably severally with the Tower race, N.
personatus hulli, since this one most resembles the Chatham race to
which the melanistic forms are probably related on account of the
retention by most of them of the dark maxillary stripes, but from
