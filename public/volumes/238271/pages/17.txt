BIRDS
245
On Wenman this Sula was very abundant and the nesting season here,
from the thirteenth to the twenty first of December, was somewhat more
advanced than we found it on Culpepper Island. The birds were nest-
ing in considerable numbers on the small, flat topped island lying to
the north of the main island. There is no soil on this island and the
females deposited their eggs on the flat surface of the rocks. We did
not see any nesting on the ledges of the low cliffs forming the sides of
the island. No nest is constructed, and generally only one egg is laid
by each female. On Culpepper we saw some nests containing two.
They snap their beaks viciously at the foot or leg of the intruding
person, and a nesting bird cannot be forced to leave her egg. Even
those that are not nesting can scarcely be made to fly. The birds are
extremely noisy. When approached they utter loud, harsh, squawk-
ing sounds, which become louder and more rapid the more they are
disturbed. They utter also a sort of whistling sound made appar-
ently in the lower part of the throat while the mouth is held wide
open. This whistle is generally preceded by a blowing sound.
Birds with eggs make no sounds different from those made by others.
One bird when annoyed by poking it with a stick uttered only the
loud squawking, while another, disturbed in the same manner, uttered
only the whistling notes and could not be induced to make any other
sound. Generally, however, the same bird made both of the sounds,
changing at short intervals from one to the other. The squawking
sound is the one most commonly uttered.

A bird just out of the egg and not yet having its eyes open, was ob-
served lying squirming on the ground, uttering in slow succession
low chuckling notes. There was no apparent reason why it should be
making these sounds.
Two sets of two eggs each were taken on Culpepper. In color they
