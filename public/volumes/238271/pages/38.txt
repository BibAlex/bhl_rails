Family STRIGIDJE.
Genus Strix Linnaeus.
Strix LINN^US, Syst. Nat, ed. x, i, p. 92, 1758.
Range. Almost cosmopolitan. Galapagos Archipelago.
46. STRIX PUNCTATISSIMA Gray.
Strix punctatissima GRAY, Zool. Voy. Beagle, in, Birds, p. 34, 1841 (James
Island). RIDGWAY, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xix, p. 583, 1896. ROTHS-
CHILD AND HARTERT, Novit. Zool., vi, p. 175, 1899.
Range. James, Indefatigable, South Seymour, Abingdon and
Albemarle. (Records of this species from the mainland are doubtful.)
Two immature specimens are in the collection. They are only
slightly fulvous below, being chiefly grayish, spotted with dark
brownish. The wing in each is less than two hundred and thirty
millimeters. One of the specimens is from near Tagus Cove, Albe-
marle, where it was secured in a cavity on the side of a steep walled
canyon ; the other was taken from a cavity between some rocks on
Seymour Island.
Several old nesting burrows were seen on canyon sides near Tagus
Cove, Albemarle, and in one an old unhatched egg was found. This
egg is whitish and in shape is slightly more spherical than the eggs of
Strix pratincola Bonap. It measures 41 X 31. The entrances to the
burrows were strewn with the skulls and other remains of rats (J/#.y),
the rodents apparently forming the greater part of the food of the owls.
Family BUBONID^E.
Genus Asio Brisson.
Asio BRISSON, Ornithologist, i, p. 28, 1760.

mopolitan. Galapagos Archipelago.
