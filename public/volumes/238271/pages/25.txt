Zool., vi, p. 183, 1899.
Range. Galapagos Archipelago.
We simply follow Rothschild and Hartert in giving this form as a
subspecies of P. baJiamensis, having no material of the latter species
with which to make comparisons.
This is a common species throughout the archipelago wherever
suitable places occur. It is especially abundant on Albemarle, James,
Charles and Chatham.

We obtained this species on the shore of the southern half of Albe-
marle, a short distance west of Elizabeth Bay. Only seven indi-
viduals were seen. They were wading about quietly in the small
reedy marshes back of the mangrove swamps along the shore. They
were very tame and reluctantly swam to the opposite side of the small
ponds when approached. Only one was seen to fly and it alighted
again a few yards from where it started. Another was made to run
along on the surface of the water flapping its wings. The only sound
they uttered was a hoarse guttural note somewhat between a squawk
and a grunt, resembling a little the note of the great blue heron. Mr.
G. M. Green of San Francisco reports having found the flamingoes
