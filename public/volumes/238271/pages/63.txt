Range. Charles Island.
We did not procure any specimens of this form. It was described
from Charles by Ridgway in 1890, but in 1896 included by him under
G. psittacula. In 1899 Rothschild and Hartert doubtfully based the
subspecies G. psittacula townsendi on four specimens from Charles.

Range. Charles, Chatham, Indefatigable, Jervis, James, Duncan,
Albemarle, Narboro, Abingdon and Bindloe.
This is the most abundant and widely spread species of the subge-
nus Camarhynchus, and, as do the other species of the same group,
it inhabits the moister and more wooded regions of the Archipelago.
We found it common on the higher parts of Narboro, at Iguana Cove
on Albemarle and on James. It is also common at the eastern end of
south Albemarle.
In size and proportions of the bill Geospiza crassirostris stands
apart from the other species of Camarhynchus, being much larger and
having a much thicker and wider bill, it having been made by Ridg-
way, on account of this last character, the type of a separate subge-
nus, Platyspiza. In coloration it resembles the smaller species, but
the males are more olivaceous and not so extensively blackish anteriorly
and the females are more streaked below.
On the south side of Narboro, at an elevation of about two thousand
feet, this species was found nesting in April. A nest containing four
incubated eggs was taken April 5 in the branches of an acacia bush
three feet above the ground.
This nest is ovate in shape, the lower end being the larger, covered
above, and has the entrance in one side above the middle. It is com-
posed of small, dry, flexible, tendril-like twigs of some vine, woven
all through which are mat-like masses of a yellowish (when dead)
lichen. The height of the nest is 150 millimeters, and the width at
