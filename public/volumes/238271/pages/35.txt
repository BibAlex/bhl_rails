BIRDS
This is a common bird on most of the islands of the archipelago,
rare only on Charles and Albemarle. This may be due to the number
of dogs and cats on these two islands, since the species nests on the
ground. The birds seem to be more or less migratory, Tor~during
January and March we saw only one or two doves about Tagus Cove
on Albemarle, while in June they were not infrequent here and at this
time we often saw small flocks at Turtle Point just north of Tagus
Cove.
One nest was found in April on James Island. It consisted of a
few straws and leaves lining a cavity in the surface of a rough lava
bed. The nest contained one egg ; the female was collected and an-
other egg was found in the oviduct nearly ready to be laid. The first
one is dull white, oval, and measures 27.5 x 22.5. On Barrington the
doves were found nesting during the latter part of May. The nests
were all on the ground between blocks of lava, and contained each
two eggs like the one from James.
