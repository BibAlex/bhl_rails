Rothschild and Hartert assign the Nesomimus of Wenman to the
same variety as the James form, N. melanotis melanotis. Our speci-
mens, however, are identical in every way with the Barrington Island
specimens.
It is rather curious that the Nesomimus of this island so far to the
north should be related to forms of the central islands rather than to
those of the neighboring islands, Culpepper and Abingdon.
We have five adult males from Barrington taken in May, and two
adult males and two adult females from Wenman taken in December.

Range. James (and Jervis ?).
This form is very close to the Indefatigable race, but is separable
from it as a variety by the darker tone of coloration on the head and
back, and by the longer bill the culmen of our specimens from
James averaging 24.6 while that of the Indefatigable and Seymour
specimens averages only 22.6.
The collection contains four adult males, four adult females, and
numerous immature specimens taken on James in April.
