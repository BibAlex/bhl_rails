and the skin back of the base of the lower mandible are purplish-
black.
We found this species nesting on Culpepper and Wenman in De-
cember, on Hood in May and on Tower in June; but it- was seen
nowhere else in the archipelago. Hence it is coincident in its range
at the Galapagos with Sula variegata.
At Wenman Island we found it abundant in December on the small
islet off the north side of the main island. Nests were numerous and
were always placed in the low bushes that cover most of the island.
The birds were never observed to alight anywhere else than in these
bushes when they came to the island. The most common sound they
uttered consisted of a short series of hoarse, guttural notes.
On Tower, also, they always nested in the bushes. Here the nests
were placed four or five feet above the ground and consisted of twigs
somewhat woven together into a circular form with a shallow depres-
sion above. Sometimes a few dry leaves were placed in the bottom of
the cavity. The incubating bird holds the single egg between her
feet. None of the nests at this time on Tower Island contained
young birds.
This habit of nesting in trees or bushes distinguishes this species
from all the other Sulas of the eastern Pacific, and the species occurs
on all the tropical islands of this region except Clipperton, where
vegetation is is wholly lacking.

On Culpepper, Wenman and Tower, birds in the white plumage
were very scarce compared with the number of those in the immature
brownish plumage. The majority of nests containing eggs or young
birds we found occupied by one of these fully grown but brownish
birds. These individuals were certainly immature, but must have
