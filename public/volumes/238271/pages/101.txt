The bill of this form is shaped much like that of Geospiza strenua,
being the longest of all the G. fortis bills except G. f. bauri, and
has a strongly curved culmen.
All of the specimens of G. fortis that we obtained on Chatham be-
long to this variety, although G. f. fortis is recorded from Chatham
by Rothschild and Hartert. We have four adult males, one adult
female and two immature males taken in May. The immature males
are in Stage IV ; each is moulting slightly.

This form is described by Rothschild and Hartert from one adult
male and four immature birds as differing from G. f. fortis of Albe-
marle (comparisons probably made with specimens from Villa Mil at
the southeast part of Albemarle) in having the wing from two to three
millimeters longer. If this is a valid species really different from G.
f. fortis on Charles, we have one immature male that is probably
referable to it. This specimen measures as follows : length 130; wing
75 ; tail 49; culmen 20; gonys 10; basal width ojf bill 11, basal depth
of bill 15.5 ; maxilla from nostril 13 ; tarsus 22. It was taken in May
and is moulting.
