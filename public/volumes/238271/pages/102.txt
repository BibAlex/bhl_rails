330 SNODGRASS AND HELLER
Range. James Island.
This variety is known only from three specimens taken on James
Island by Baur and Adams. We have not seen specimens of it.
According to Rothschild and Hartert, who examined Baur and
Adams' specimens, it is subspecifically related to G.fortis dubia, dif-
fering from the latter only in having a larger beak. It, then, possesses
the largest bill of the G. fortis series, approaching nearest to G.
strenua.

Range. Culpepper Island.
We did not procure any specimens of this form. The measure-
ments of the beak given by Rothschild and Hartert are included within
the dimensions of the bill of G. strenua. The adult male differs,
however, from that of G. conirostris, G. strenua and G. magnirostis,
according to the describers, in having the " feathers of the breast, ab-
domen and back slightly edged with olive " and in having the rump
conspicuously olive. " Bill compressed and rounded, as in G. coni-
rostris, but, unlike the other species of Geospiza, abruptly narrowed
three millimeters from the tip and elongated sharply to the point."

Our collection contains one adult male and one adult female from
Narboro, taken in January and March ; five adult males and one
adult female taken on James in April ; and nine adult males and three
adult females taken on Abingdon, Bindloe and Tower in June. Be-
sides the adults there are numerous young specimens from James,
Abingdon, Bindloe and Tower.
The adult males are exactly the same in plumage as adult males of
G.fuliginosa and G.fortis. The specimens are all moulting ex-
cept those taken on James in April. They were taken on Narboro
