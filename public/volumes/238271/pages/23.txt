Pelecanus fuscus californicus ROTHSCHILD AND HARTERT, Novit. Zoof, vi,
p. 176, 1899 (Galapagos).
Range. Pacific Coast of America from Washington to Peru.
Galapagos Archipelago : Charles, Hood, Chatham, Barrington, Sey-
mour, Indefatigable, James, Albemarle, Narboro, Abingdon, Bindloe
and Tower.
Generally most abundant on the leeward side of islands, specially
numerous about Tagus Cove, Albemarle, and on the east shore of Nar-
boro, seeming to prefer places affording a considerable expanse of
smooth water. Old rookeries were found on Narboro, the nests being
situated in small bushes near the coast. Rothschild reports a nest of
three eggs taken among the mangroves of Indefatigable in September
by the Harris expedition.

We have four adult females, all in the postnuptial plumage, and they
are indistinguishable from the California specimens. The gular pouch
of a female taken at Elizabeth Bay, Albemarle, in February, was col-
ored in life as follows : Ground color very pale brown ; numerous
much darker lines of purplish-brown arising at the sides of the base of
the pouch and running forward parallel with the ramus of the mandible
on each side, meeting in the median line in pairs forming acute angles ;
posteriorly along the edges of the pouch the lines indistinct and the
purplish color rather diffuse; veins with a greenish-blue color ; bill,
upper mandible horn-greenish, basally with indistinct yellowish streaks,
toward the tip this color median only, sides of mandible becoming
scarlet, claw lemon-yellow, with dusky shade at base; lower man-
dible greenish and yellowish at base, in front of this mottled with yel-
