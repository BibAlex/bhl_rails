ovate, not much narrowed at the smaller end. The ground color is
dull whitish; the surface is finely speckled with cinnamon color,
sometimes sparsely spotted about the larger end with small brown
blotches, but generally with a dark cap at the larger end of closely
speckled brown, extending for a varying distance toward the smaller
end of the egg, but always disappearing at one third of the distance,
often narrowly confined at the end. They measure 111x74; 112x74,
108x72; 113x71; 112x74; 10x569; 113x72.

We quote the name of this form as a subspecies of Puffinus obscurus
from Rothschild and Hartert, having no material with which to make
comparisons.
The bird is common about the Galapagos Islands, but it does not
appear to breed at many places. At Wenman it was common in
December, and was found on the main island in a cave near the south
end of the east shore. In the cave the birds were rather timid and
sought the darker parts of it when approached. When disturbed
while sitting on the floor and on ledges of the walls, they made no re-
sistance but simply got out of the way of the intruder by retreating
farther back into the cave or beneath loose rocks. They could not be
driven out. One bird was found here sitting on an egg which she
could not be made to leave, although she only passively resisted its
being taken by remaining motionless upon it. The egg was deposited
upon the bare ground near the wall of the cave. It is plain white,
somewhat elongate-ovate, and measures 52 x 35.
We have three adult male and three adult female specimens taken
in December and January.
