dom included in the nest material. There is no special lining. Some
nests have a somewhat finer material on the floor than elsewhere, but
the floor is generally more compactly and more solidly formed than
the other parts. Three of the nests from Tagus Cove contained eggs
two sets of four each and one set of three. The eggs of set No. i
have the usual pale greenish-white ground color of all the Geospiza
eggs, spotted and heavily blotched about the larger end with brownish,
vinaceous and rusty-brown, and sparingly spotted with brownish over
the rest of the surface. Measurements: 19.5 x 14.5; 19.5 X 14,
19.5 X 14.5 ; 19 X 14.5. Set No. 2 has the same ground color as the
first, but is finely and nearly uniformly spotted with vinaceous so
thickly as nearly to obscure the ground color; one of the specimens,
however, is spotted only about the large end. Measurements : 19 X 14 ;
19.5 X 14 ; 18 X 13.5 518x13.5. Set No. 3, of three eggs, is like the
firs tin coloration. Measurements of two specimens: 18.5 X 14.5;
18.5 X 14. These Geospiza eggs greatly resemble the eggs of Spizilla
pustlla but are much larger. Some light-colored eggs of Junco
hyemalis thurberi are very much like them in coloration.
Several nests and two sets of three eggs were collected at Iguana
Cove in the latter part of December. The eggs are like those from
Tagus Cove in size and are similar in coloration. One set has a paler
ground color and is considerably more spotted with rusty-brown. The
nests do not differ from those taken at Tagus Cove.
One set of three eggs was taken at Elizabeth Bay, Albemarle, in
February. The eggs of this set are somewhat larger and more ovoid
