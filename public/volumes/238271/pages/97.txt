ever did the bird make any variation. Another male bird of the same
species was observed flying about in the neighborhood of a tree in
which was a large Geospiza nest with eggs uttering continually
these same notes. No female, however, was ever to be seen about or
in the nest and the eggs were always cold so she had probably been
killed, yet the male remained in the neighborhood singing as if the
female were still on the nest.
During March a bird at Tagus Cove was heard singing tee'up-
twee'u.
At Iguana Cove in December one bird was observed singing a song
resembling twee'-ur'r'r, twee'-ur'r'r. This was uttered generally
twice in succession, often only once, sometimes three times. (The
representatives of the species at Iguana Cove belong to the subspecies
G. f. platyrhyncha . )
On James Island about James Bay the relative numbers of Geospiza
fuliginosa parvula and G. fortis fortis were just the reverse of what
they were at Tagus Cove, Albemarle. Here on James the G. fortis
was the commonest species of Geospiza. Their song very much re-
sembled the common song of the individuals at Tagus Cove, sound-
ing somewhat like teu'-we, teu'-iue.
On Charles Island one song of Geospiza fortis fortis almost ex-
actly resembled the song of G. fuliginosa parvula of Tagus Cove.
The accent was always on the first syllable and may be represented
thus : teur'-ivee, teur'-tvee no difference was noticed that could be
described tyy alphabetical sounds. The same birds, however, sang
numerous different songs.
Two nests collected at Tagus Cove in March were placed in bushes,
and are of the same shape as the nests of G. fuliginosa described.
Both were composed almost wholly of grasses, but were very
