262 SNODGRASS AND HELLER
Common on the shores of most of the islands, and appears to be
found at the archipelago throughout the year. The birds are very wild,
however, and evidently not resident there. Taken by Baur and Adams
in June and July, by the Harris expedition from September to Novem-
ber, and by us in January and March.

These birds are not specially abundant anywhere but one sees them
at nearly every place on the shores of the islands. We found them
specially frequent in the small pools just back of the shore on the west
side of the southern Seymour Island. They were always very tame.
