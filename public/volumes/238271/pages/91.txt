groups, but yet intergrading in their variations, should not be regarded
as true species, since these intergradations are evidently due to over-
laps in individual variation and not to interbreeding, on account of
their isolation on the different islands. This is a point that we do not
attempt to discuss, and simply follow the conventional canons of the
A. O. U. nomenclature.
Geospiza fortis as a species, including all \hefortis varieties, has
its bill variation confined within the following limits in mature birds :
Length of culmen, 15 to 20; depth of bill at base, n to 16; width of
bill at base, 8 to 12. In both length of the culmen and width of the
bill at the base it intergrades with G. fuliginosa, but there is a con-
stant difference in the depth of the bill, the greatest basal depth in G.
fuliginosa being 9 . 5 .
Subspecies at the lower end of the G. fortis series have the bill
shaped exactly like that of G. fuliginosa parvula; those at the upper
end have bills of a proportionally greater depth and with a rounded cul-
men.

This form presents the least departure from Geospiza fuliginosa
fuliginosa. In shape and size of the bill it is intermediate between
G. f. fuliginosa and G. f. dubia of the upper end of the G. fortis
series. Adults of G. fortis fortis and G. fuliginosa are always dis-
tinguishable by the larger bill of the former, but young birds of G.
fortis have bills almost exactly duplicating those of adults of G. fuli-
ginosa. We have examined young specimens which in fact could not
be definitely assigned to either species.
Ridgway has described specimens from Albemarle as Geospiza
albemarlei. His specimens probably came from either Tagus Cove
