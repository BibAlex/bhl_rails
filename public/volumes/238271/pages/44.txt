Pyrocephalus minimus RIDGWAY, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xn, p. 113, 1890,
in text (Chatham Island).
Range. Chatham Island.
This species differs from P. nanus in having a shorter wing, the
wing not exceeding fifty nine millimeters in length and averaging about
fifty seven millimeters, while in P. nanus the wing varies from sixty
one to sixty six millimeters averaging about sixty three. We have
four adult males : two of them are decidedly orange-red below, much
more so than in P. nanus abingdoni; one of the others has less of an
orange shade, while the fourth is indistinguishable in color from ordi-
nary males of P. nanus.
We found this species fairly common on Chatham in May, where we
took four adult males and two adult females. They were perhaps more
plentiful in the upper cultivated parts of the island than elsewhere.
