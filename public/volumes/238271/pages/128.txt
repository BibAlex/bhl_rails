Certhidea cinerascens bifasciata ROTHSCHILD AND HARTERT, Novit. Zool.,
vi, p. 151, 1899.
Range. Barrington.
This form is similar to the last but is paler above and below, almost
whitish below with a faint tinge of buff, and with a distinct olive tone
above. The tips of the middle and greater wing coverts are specially
pale in some specimens forming two fairly well marked bands on the
wing.
This form was very numerous on Barrington in May. The young
birds, as did those on Hood, remained banded together in small flocks,
flying about in troops from one bush to another, continually uttering
short c/itp-like notes.
We have two adult males and two adult females taken on Barring-
ton in May.
