62d. GEOSPIZA FULIGINOSA ACUTIROSTRIS
(Ridgway).
Geospiza acutirostris RIDGWAY, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xvn, p. 363, 1894,
and xix, p. 531, 1896 ; Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 50, Pt. i, p. 506, 1901.
ROTHSCHILD AND HARTERT, Novit. Zool., vi, p. 162, 1899.
Range. Tower Island.
Very similar to G. f. fuliginosa, but bill more acute, with straighter
outlines; the culmen averaging fourteen and one half millimeters and
the basal depth eight and one half millimeters. Our birds, which
were taken in June, all have pinkish-horn-colored bills, but are appa-
rently adult.
This is the most common Geospiza on Tower, where it occurs
abundantly near the coast, frequenting the cactus (Opuntza)
thickets.
