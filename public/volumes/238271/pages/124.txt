73<r. CERTHIDEA OLIVACEA RIDGWAYI Rothschild and
Hartert.
Certhidea olivacea ridgwayi ROTHSCHILD AND HARTERT, Novit. Zool.,
vi, p. 149, 1899 (Charles Island).
Certhidea ridgwayi RIDGWAY, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 50, Pt. n, p. 765,
1902.
Range. Charles.
We did not procure any specimens of this species. It is rare on
Charles and has been taken only by the Harris expedition. According
to Rothschild and Hartert it " differs much from C. olivacea olivacea
and C. olivacea luteola in the much lighter under surface, which
wants the olive tinge."
73</. CERTHIDEA OLIVACEA FUSCA (Sclater and Salvin).
Certhidea fusca SCLATER AND SALVIN, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., p. 323, 1870
(Abingdon and Bindloe Islands). RIDGWAY, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus.,
xix, p. 502, 1896; Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 50, Pt. n, p. 766, 1902.
Certhidea olivacea fusca ROTHSCHILD AND HARTERT, Novit. Zool., vi, p. 151,
1899.
Range. Abingdon and Bindloe.
Slightly darker above and less olivaceous than C. olivacea olivacea
or C. o. luteola, distinguished from these forms by the conspicuous
buffy brown wash along the sides and on the flanks. Throat of the
male tinged with rufous, and superciliary line of same color present.
We have five specimens of this form, including one male with the bill
entirely black, taken in June.
The buffy brown color of the sides of the body and the flanks
characterizes all the specimens from Abingdon, Bindloe, Tower,
Wenman and Culpepper ; thus uniting C. olivacea fusca, mentalis
and becki as a group inhabiting the northern islands of the archipelago
and separating them from C. olivacea olivacea of the central islands.
The brownish-buff color, however, grades into the less pronounced
olivaceous-buff of the same parts in C. olivacea olivacea and C. o.
