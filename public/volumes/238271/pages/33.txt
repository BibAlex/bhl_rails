Archipelago.
This bird has been taken at the Galapagos Islands during both
summer and winter. Rothschild and Hartert report it taken by the
Harris expedition from July 29 to December 3. We have two speci-
mens taken in January, one at Turtle Point near Tagus Cove, Albe-
marle, and the other on the east shore of Narboro. The birds were
very wild and hard to approach qualities that distinguish all the
visitant birds of the archipelago from the resident birds.
