equivalent) may ultimately be separated into a number of inde-
pendent groups. Much parallel evolution of seed plants must have
occurred during the Paleozoic, resulting in a number of groups
of plants with fernlike foliage on which were borne seeds and
pollen-bearing structures. The old class "Gymnospermae" has
been shown to be an artificial assemblage (Arnold, 1948) with
naked seeds being the only important feature in common.
Similarly, we feel that before long the pteridosperms as they are
now known cannot be held together as a natural entity solely by
the character of seeds borne on fernlike foliage.
