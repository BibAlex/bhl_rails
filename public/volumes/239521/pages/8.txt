Abstract
Compressed fossilized foliage most comparable to that of Eremop-
teris zamioides (Bertrand) Kidston occurs in shale associated
with coal in the Allegheny Group in northern Pennsylvania.
In association with this foliage are abundant samaropsid seeds
and small, apparently microsporangiate organs. Although close
proximity of disconnected plant parts as fossils is not evidence in
itself that these plant parts were originally connected, it is tempting
to believe that these leaves, seeds, and microsporangia were parts
of the same species. Furthermore, there have been a number of
previous reports associating samaropsid seeds with Eremopteris.
Additional frondlike structures with the same basic construction
as the vegetative eremopterid leaves have been found; these offer
information concerning the possible mode of attachment of the
fertile organs.
