WOOD-USING INDUSTRIES OF MONTANA. used in the state are purchased at an average price trunks. Eighty-five and five-tenths per cent of
all of the cottonwood reported is employed for
veneers and excelsior, while 11.9 per cent of it is
used for cabinet work. A greater variety of woods
is used for fixtures than for any other manufac-
tured wooden commodity. None of the industries
reported employ less than two species.
Summary of Average Prices
Table XIV gives a summary of the average
prices paid for each kind of wood by the various
times used for cores to be covered with veneers
of higher grade woods.
Woods for patterns must work easily with hand
tools and must retain their form after manufac-
ture. The white pine of Idaho and Montana is a
superior wood for this purpose and is employed
in quantities throughout the Western United
States. Its principal competing species are west-
ern red cedar and redwood. Wood {or tne manu-
facture of excelsior must be light in weight and
tough. Veneers for baskets or berry boxes must
be strong, tough, light and odorless. Cottonwood
is the best species available in the Northwest for
excelsior, berry boxes and baskets.

Eight specific wood-consuming industries are
reported within the state, while three industries

classified as miscellaneous.
The manufacture of sash and doors is second
only in importance to the production of boxes,

the wood annually consumed. The excellent qual-

and western white pine. The local demand for
such doors is extensive because of the natural
settlement of the state, and quantities also find
distribution throughout the United States.

Summary of Woods Used by Manufacturing Plants
Table XI shows the quality and cost of each
species employed by Montana wood-using indus-
tries exclusive of planing mills; also the propor-
tion grown in the state and the proportion im-
ported. The total quantity, 6.065.000 board feet,
indicates the present development of wood-using
r. -H -lories in the state. Of this quantity, 64.45 per
cent was grown in the state and 32.55 per cent
imported. Eastern hardwoods and Douglas fir
from the Pacific Coast comprise practically all the
woods imported.
The total cost of all woods used by secondary
industries was $157,257, with an average cost of
$25.93 per thousand feet. Cherry and walnut im-
ported from the East and used for fixtures, are
the most expensive woods used in the state, and
cost $130 per thousand feet, delivered at the fac-
tory. The cheapest wood employed by the in-
dustries of Montana is western larch, with an
average cost of $11.14 per thousand feet delivered.
Practically all of the western larch is used for
boxes and crates.
Western yellow pine, all of which was grown
within the state, furnished 55.1 per cent of all
the wood used by secondary industries, while
Douglas fir, 94.04 per cent of which was imported,
furnished 22.1 per cent of the wood used. Only
5.96 per cent of the Douglas fir reported for the
state was locally grown.
Black cottonwood is the only local hardwood
employed by Montana industries. This species
furnished 3.48 per cent of the wood consumed by
the industries.
Sixteen distinct species of wood were reported
for Montana and nine of these were supplied en-
tirely from without the state.
The small diversity of wood-working plants and
the low grade of articles produced is indicated
by the minor consumption of hardwoods, which
supply only 5.91 per cent of the total annual con-
sumption of wood as reported in Table XI. While
western white pine and western larch are cut in
quantities by Montana sawmills, these two im-
portant native species yielded only 7.71 per cent
of the total consumption by secondary industries.
Western red cedar furnished only 0.41 per cent
of all of the wood used in the wood manufacturing
industries of Montana. Seventy-six per cent of
the western red cedar was imported, chiefly from
Western Washington and Idaho. The cedar grown
locally is employed principally for poles, piling
and posts.
factories.
The wood used for wagon stock has the highest
average price, which is $94.71 per thousand feet.
This industry is supplied entirely by Eastern hard-
woods, which must bear a heavy freight rate be-
fore delivery, and are, furthermore, high priced
in the region of their production. Woods used
for furniture repair rank second in their average
price at the factory. The total cost of all wood
used annually by the secondary industries' of
Montana is $157,257.

Kinds of Wood Used by Different Industries.
Table XIII shows the percentage apportionment
of the kinds of wood used by the various indus-
tries of the state. Douglas fir and western white
pine each supply five different industries, but are
employed in like industries in only two instances,
while pattern-makers paid $40 per thousand feet
for the same species.
In general, the box industry paid the minimum
price for its raw material, while the material em-
ployed in the repair of wagons brought the highest
average price. Woods obtained from outside the
state were generally the most expensive employed,
both on account of freight charges and their rela-
tive scarcity.
The National Forests of Montana
The area of the state of Montana is given as
93,806,080 acres, 93,296,640 acres of land and 509,-
440 acres of water surface. Twenty and five-tenths
per cent, or 19,205,100 acres of Montana's gross
area, is included in the National Forests. Of this
area approximately 3,000,000 acres are in private
ownership, leaving a net of 16,192,503 acres of Na-
tional Forest land. These forests are confined
chiefly to the more mountainous western and
southwestern sections of the state, and contain
little or no agricultural land.
The following species occur in large quantities
on the National Forests: Western yellow pine,
western white pine, western larch, lodgepole pine,
Engelmann spruce and Douglas fir. The esti-
mated stand for all species of timber on the Na-
tional Forest areas of Montana is approximately
39,500,000,000 feet, board measure.
Timber on the National Forests is for sale
where it is mature or dead, and can be cut without
injury to streamflow. Contracts for short or long
term periods are granted, depending upon the
quantity of timber sold and the cost of improve-
ments necessary to get it to market. All timber
over $100 in value is advertised for thirty days

Consumption by Industries.
The manufacture of boxes in Montana takes 44.5
per cent of all of the wood reported as used by
the secondary wood-consuming industries of the
state. The box industry is fostered by the suoply
of excellent box woods, such as western yellow
pine and western white pine and the local ot
birch, yellow poplar, elm, cherry and walnut are
each employed in one industry only. Eastern
basswood and hickory each supply two industries;
58.8 per cent of the basswood is used for trunks,
while 85.8 per cent of the hickory is employed for
wagon repairs.
Cottonwood, the only native hardwood used by
for competitive bids. Smaller amounts than
$100 worth can be sold directly by the forest of-
ficers on the ground. Certain restrictions in cut-
ting are required in order to insure protection
from fire and to young growth, and to provide
for reproduction. These restrictions are estab-
lished practical methods and have been applied
successfully in a large number of cases. Timber
is scaled, and paid for on that basis. Advance
deposits sufficient to cover approximately three
months' cut is the general plan of payments re-
quired, although this may be modified to meet
special requirements in particular cases. Infor-
ation concerning the bodies of timber available
for cutting may be obtained from the District
Forester at Missoula, Montana, or from the local
Forest Supervisor.
In 1910, 36,754,000 feet of timber were cut on
the National Forests in Montana, while the saw-
mills of the state reported a cut of 319,089,000 feet.
The greater part of the timber cut on the National
Forests is sawed into lumber. A large amount,
however, is used as mining timbers in the mining
regions around Butte, Anaconda, Great Falls and
Red Lodge. The following list shows the classes
of material cut in 1910:
Saw timber, thousand feet, B. M 36,754
Poles, number 135,694
Posts, number 191,721
Cordwood, cords 24,005
