The eleven woods which contribute the material
shown in Table II aggregate more than half a bil-
lion feet, but nearly three^fourths of it is longleaf
pine, and most of the other is shortleaf and loblolly.
The hardwoods aggregate little more than a million
feet, or about one-five- hundredth part of the whole.
The softwoods are so preponderant in this industry
that the hardwoods are scarcely worth mentioning.
The significance of the fact is apparent when it Is
borne in mind that this is the principal wood- using
industry in Mississippi, from the veiwpoint of quan*
tity demanded. The principal items which make up
this industry are flooring, ceiling, siding, and such
finish as is turned out by planing mills which dress
stock for the general trade. Such planers are usual-
ly run in connection with sawmills, and they plane
the lumber -which the sawmills cut, both mills being
generally under the same management. This serves
to distinguish these planing mills from a class
which do general mill work and make other kinds
of products, such as sash, frames, and doors. Manu-
facturers of that class are shown in Table VI.
Longleaf Pine.
The largest item among those constituting plan-
ing mill products is flooring, and longleaf pine is
the chief contributor. The wood is admirably fitted
for the manufacture of that commodity. It is hard,
insuring long wear; strong, which is a guarantee
against failure through breakage; stiff, which ena-
bles it to hold its place under trying circumstances;
it resists decay under conditions where many other
woods speedily disintegrate; and it presents an at-
tractive appearance because of its positive color and
the clearly marked grain. Flooring of two patterns
are turned out from the longleaf pine. The common
kind is worked without a purpose of conforming to
any particular run of the grain some of it flat,
some quarter-sawed, and some edge grain. There is
a select kind, however, known as edge flooring. The
sawing is done in a way to 'bring the edges of the
grain upward for a wearing surface. Flooring of
that kind is generally narrow and extra thick, some-
times two inches, and is more expensive, but it is
better, stronger, wears longer, is less liable to splin-
ter, and most persons consider it more attractive. It
is often used to floor stores, halls, schools and ware-
houses. No softwood is superior to longleaf pine for
that kind of flooring. Ceiling and iding are made
of longleaf pane to a large extent; 'but shortleaf and
loblolly are preferred by some. These pines being
of more rapid growth than longleaf, the grain shows
more variety in figure, and its general tone is a lit-
tle lighter. The wood is softer than longleaf and
lends itself a little more readily to the carpenter's
tools.
'Six and three-quarter million feet of pond pine are
listed in Table II. Manufacturers who reported this
wood generally called it pitch pine, which appears
to be the commonly accepted local name for it. The
wood whose official name is recognized by the U. S.
Forest Service as pitch pine is a different tree (Pinus
rigida) and is not found in Mississippi, and it is not
believed that any of it was reported during the pro-
gress of this investigation.
Cypress.
Cypress makes a rather poor showing in this In-
dustry. For some reason, the people of Mississippi
do not seem to be making much flooring, ceiling and'
siding of this wood. It is good for flooring, though
not as hard as longleaf pine; suitable for ceiling,
though it lacks the distinct grain which loblolly and
shortleaf pine exhibit; but for outside work, par-
ticularly as siding or weather boarding, it is doubt-
ful if it has any superior among the woods of this
country. Well-selected cypress lasts so long when
used in the form of weather iboarding that enthusi-
asts have called It the "everlasting wood." It would
perhaps be unwarranted to claim for it longer ser-
vice in exposed situations than may be had from Cal-
ifornia redwood, western red cedar, southern red
cedar, and eastern white cedar, but it is well up in
the front rank of that remarkable list of woods. For
that reason it is noteworthy that the people of Mis-
sissippi use so little of it, out of the abundance
which their state affords. It has been said that a
prophet is not without honor save in his own. coun-
try. All the wood-using industries of Mississippi
combined use less than a million and a half feet of
cypress yearly. They use that much longleaf pine
daily. White oak contributes four times as much
as cypress to planing mill products, and about five
times as much to the wood-using industries of the
whole state.
Yellow Poplar.
Yellow poplar supplied a small amount of lumber
to the industry, and all of it was state grown. The
yellow poplar here is near the southern limit of its
range, the tree reaching its best development in Ten-
nessee, Kentucky, North Carolina and West Virginia.
There is reason to believe that this splendid wood
was once more abundant in Mississippi than it now
is. Its large, shapely trunk was calculated to at-
tract attention in the early periods of settlement,
and it would be one of the first trees to fall to
meet the settlers' demand for lumber. William Dar-
by wrote that Baton Rouge was a rather important
local market for yellow poplar a century ago; but
that was before the days of railroads, and timber
was not then taken far to market unless it could be
floated. Lack of navigable streams then closed mar-
kets against a considerable part of the interior of
Mississippi. Some white oak and a smaller amount
of red oak was reported in this industry. It has
been remarked that there exists considerable differ-
ence of opinion in Mississippi as to what red oak
is. Some have always called the Texas oak red oak,
while others give that name to the yellow oak when
it grows on rich, well-drained soil where it develops
a large trunk and choice wood.
All of the black walnut reported by manufactur-
ers in the state is found in this industry, and the
amount could all be procured from two or three
medium-sized trees. Its cost per thousand feet is
higher than that of any other wood in this industry.

BOXES AND CRATES.
The second largest industry in Mississippi is box-
making. It is not unusual for a state's largest or
second largest wood-using industry to be the man-
ufacture of boxes and crates. Containers in which
to ship commercial commodities constitute a heavy,
but necessary tax upon the other industries of a re-
gion. Fortunately, the wood of which the contain-
ers are made is generally of cheap grades. Much
that goes to the box factories could find no sale
elsewhere, and if it were not serviceable there it
would go into the waste heap. It happens, however,
that the principal wood demanded by Mississippi
box-makers is cottonwood, and not of cheap grade,
as the average price (Table III) indicates. Boxes
of very many kinds are produced, but when the mak-
ers pay an average price of $17.32 per thousand for
box material, it is evidence that boxes above the
average are being turned out. Cottonwood is known
as a clean wood. That is, it has no offensive odor,
and imparts no stain to articles shipped in boxes
made of it. That fits if tor provisions, particularly
for meats, butter, lard, fruits and confectionery. So
well is cottonwood liked for boxes in which to ship
cured meats, that willow is sometimes sold as cot-
tonwood, thought it is not easy to deceive persons
acquainted with both woods, for willow has not the
clean color of cottonwood. Some manufacturers pre-
fer boxes of cottonwood, though no provisions or
other commodities that can be damaged by stain are
to 'be shipped in them. The attractive appearance
of a crate sometimes helps to sell the articles packed
within. For instance, makers of screen doors, wash
boards, and brooms, buy nice white lumber for crates
which will show off their wares to good advantage
while in transit or on exhibition. Soap-makers have
been known to pay extra for white wood because the
letters stenciled on the top or sides show to so much
better advantage. The nearly sixteen million feet of
cottonwood bought by Mississippi box-makers yearly
doubtless receives innumerable stencilings or letter-
ings with paint brushes before the boxes have run
their courses and have gone to the final scrap pile
of kindling wood.
Cottonwood is one of the native timbers of Mis-
sissippi which may be expected to hold its place
when cypress, pine, tupelo and red gum have be-
come scarce. Cottonwood will pay for planting, when
the time for tree planting comes to Mississippi. It
grows rapidly; large amounts will thrive on small
tracts; it is satisfied with waste land, provided it is
neither too wet nor too poor. It is one of the easiest
trees to plant and make grow. It is not improbable
that there is as much cottonwood in the state now
as there ever was, though large trees may not be as
abundant as formerly. Small ones are coming on
everywhere. They are quick to seize on vacant
places left when farm land is abandoned or when
lumbermen cut the forests. A writer who traveled
through Mississippi nearly a hundred years ago said
there was little cottonwood in the state. He either
did not see all there was, or much has since come
on.
Next after cottonwood, red gum holds chief place
among box and crate makers in the state. Fruit,
berry and vegetable crates demand large amounts of
wood, frequently made into rotary-cut veneer. Early
gardens and truck patches in the state contribute
largely to northern markets, and some sort of wood-
en container is needed for practically everything of
that kind that grows. Red gum and the pines are
the largest contributors to the supply of truck-gar-
den crates and 'berry baskets and cups. The 'box
material furnished by longleaf, shortleaf and lob-
lolly pine seems to be fairly well apportioned to the
relative abundance of these species, since makers
seldom express a preference, but take what is most
convenient or cheapest. The average costs for the
three pines show only a difference of nine cents per
thousand feet, and for practical purposes they may
be regarded as of equal cost.
One-fourth of all the yellow poplar reported in
the state went into boxes and crates, and it was
highest in price of the mine woods shown in Table
III. It was used for the best grades of boxes, on
which stenciling, painting and printing were to be
done. Magnolia was the cheapest wood in the in-
dustry.
