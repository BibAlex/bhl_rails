cement barrels. Strength has much to do with the
suitability of a wood for a specific purpose. Red
gum, cottonwood, elm and most of the oaks are
strong enough for all ordinary purposes. Cotton-
wood is excellent material for flour barrels, and yel-
low poplar for tobacco hogsheads, though less of
it is so used than formerly. The following figures
show Tennessee's output of slack cooperage in
1910 and the woods, with the amount of each:
Staves.
Oak 16,632,000
Cottonwood 12,366,000
Red gum 11,925,000
Kim 3,736,000
Ash ...'. 2,247,000
Maple 703,000
Beech 500,000
All others 1,621,000
Total 49,730,000
Heading is counted by sets, and the number in
Tennessee in 1910 was 2,572,000 of all woods, and
of hoops 18,041,000.
In the manufacture of hoops in Tennessee elm is
by all odds the most important wood. The hoops
are sawed from logs. A great change in hoop
making has occurred in the last fifty years. The
hoop-pole business, as it once existed, seems to
be no more in Tennessee. The hoops were once
made from, little saplings, from one to two inches
in diameter. Such a sapling made one hoop, or if
it would split nicely it was good for two. These
were cut by thousands, and most of them were
shaved and notched at odd times hy farmers who
traded them for merchandise or sold them for what
cash they would bring. It was a remarkably waste-
ful 'business. No one who cut the saplings then
seemed to consider that every one was a little tree
which, if left alone, would become a large tree. The
straightest and best were taken, and they were
the ones to grow into the best trees. Fortunately
that business is a thing of the past in Tennessee,
and they now make hoops of large trees.
In 1910 Tennessee stood eighth among the states
in the output of .veneer, its total being 27,665,000
feet, log scale. Veneer is lumber cut very thin.
So thin are some of the sheets that more than one
hundred are required to make one inch in thick-
ness. Most of the veneer is not nearly as thin. It
is of three kinds, classified according to the method
of manufacture in rotary cut, sawed and sliced.
More than nine-tenths of all veneer produced in
this country is rotary cut. Expensive hardwoods
are usually sawed or sliced. Spanish cedar, a mod-
erately cheap foreign softwood, used by cigar box
makers, is often sliced very thin. Rotary cut ve-
neer is reduced from the round log, by revolving it
against a strong knife which pares off a thin layer
round and round until only a small core remains
of the log. Thin saws convert seasoned lumber
into veneer, or a log may be forced over the edge
of a powerful knife and the sliced article results.
The forests of Tennessee contributed liberally to
the country's supply of tanning materials, though
some was used in that state which came from else-
where. In 1910 the reported quantity of hemlock
bark was 1.193 tons, worth $9,505; oak, 23,843 tons,
worth $200,396.
Uses of Wood.
Manufacturers and others in Tennessee reported
the following uses for the various woods listed in
Table 1. It should not be understood that these are
all the uses that have been found for wood. They
include only those reported during the progress
of the investigation in the state.
