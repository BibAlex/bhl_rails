ference. It may also be finished to resemble oak.
cherry, birch, maple and black walnut; and it is as
durable and as handsome. The use of the substitute,
which is plentiful and cheap, saves the small sup-
ply of woods scarce and costly. No one who is able
and willing to buy the genuine is prevented from
doing so; yet, if substitutes did not conserve the
supply, the scarce woods would soon disappear, and
no one could buy them. Substitution is in this case,
therefore, a measure of conservation, for It puts
plentiful woods into use and prolongs the small sup-
ply of costly woods; and it also brings fine articles
within reach of the many and saves money for both
the manufacturer and the buyer. In most cases
the chief difference between a plain plentiful wood
and a figured costly and scarce one, is 'beauty. In
the costly wood, nature did the figuring, tout man
has learned the art of staining, shading, and grain-
ing some of the plain woods until he has equaled
the best that nature has done in that line, and this
has led to a wider use for some of the woods which
we have in abundance, and is contributing much to
the solution of one of our most vexatious waste
problems. It never has been difficult to curtail the
waste of costly woods, for men will save when there
is money in it; tout the hard problem has been and
is to save the cheap and plentiful. If buyers cannot
be found for them in their natural condition, it is
economy to change and beautify them by science and
art until they can enter the markets which formerly
belonged exclusively to costly cabinet woods. Cre-
ate a demand for a wood and its waste problem will
disappear.
Forest Conditions.
The plow generally follows the lumberman in Ala-
bama; that is, when the merchantable timber has
been removed from a tract the land is cleared for
agricultural purposes. This rule has many excep-
tions, however, and more in the hardwood region
than where pine is the prevailing timber. When
land is cleared for farms, it is out of consideration
as a future source of lumber supply. In past time
much farm land was exhausted by tillage, was aban-
doned, and some sort of forest growth took pos-
session. That is not likely to occur in the future.
Farmers are learning better than to wear their land
out and abandon it. The timber of the future will
come from lands not suitable for agriculture, rough
tracts, swamps and poor soil. Land of that kind will
grow timber nearly as well as any other. It may be
expected that the owners of such land will see to it
that the best-paying kinds of timber will have pref-
erence over poor kinds. Fast-growing, well-shaped
species will be encouraged, and small, ragged kinds
will not be. By following that method the yield per
acre will be much increased. Up to the present time
little attention has been given to matters of for-
estry in Alabama. The old stands- have been cut,
and if young trees can gain a foothold they have
been permitted to do so; but not much has 'been
done to assist the best species. A gradual change
in this matter may be expected. One of the first
and most needed steps will consist in 'better fire
control so that vigorous seedlings will not be de-
stroyed, and scruto growth enabled to take their
place. All kinds of pine in Alaibama grow from
seeds only, not from sprouts; and if seedlings are
destroyed and large trees have been removed, there
can be no renewal of the pine forest and hardwoods
too often of a poor quality -will gradually take
possession of the ground.
The establishment of woodlots has not yet taken
much hold in Alabama. The woodlot is a piece of
ground set apart on the farm for growing trees.
Sometimes the trees are planted, but usually a nat-
ural stand is protected and allowed to grow. Such
lots are an important source of lumber supply in
some of the older states where the forests have been
largely cut. It may be expected that Alabama farm-
ers will soon give their attention to this matter and
will see that the rough corners of their farms are
set to work growing timber. Bach must decide for
himself what kinds will do best on his lands. In
most cases loblolly pine will do well. It grows rap-
idly, and thrives in dense stands. Several of the
oaks will pay. The willow oak is probably the fast-
est grower on land that suits it. Cottonwood In-
creases in size rapidly and makes good lumber. On
thin, rocky land, red cedar is probably the best tree
to grow for fence posts; but on fertile land catalpa,
osage orange (called mock orange) and locust might
pay better.
