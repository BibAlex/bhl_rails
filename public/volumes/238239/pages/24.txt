THE SOUTHERN LUMBERMAN
rles it through the sawmill, and leaves it as rough
lumber. The Forest Service report begins with
the rough lumber, carries it through planing ma-
chines, and leaves it in the form of flooring, which
is a finished product, ready for use. Much lumber
goes directly from the mill yard into use without
any further manufacture. This report has nothing
to do with lumber used in that way; and it is
apparent that in states with large outputs of rough
lumber the total cut is much above the total quan-
tity further manufactured. For example:
No. ft. rough Mnfd. prod-
lumber produced ucts. No. of
State for year 1909 feet 1910-1911
Kentucky 860.712,000 409,633.800
Louisiana 3,551.918,000 *1, 354, 954, 000
Mississippi 2,572,669,000 618.270,030
Missouri 660,159,000 442.272,993

planed.
States with little timber and large manufactures
may work much more into finished products than
their sawmill cut. What the state can not furnish
in the way of rough lumber the factories draw from
the outside. Illinois is such a state. Its lumber
cut in 1909 was 170,181,000 feet; its factory output
1,781,536,120,000 feet, or more than ten times as
much.
The manufacturers in Tennessee are favorably
situated in regard to markets. Railroads are am-
ple, and distances to the best markets are mod-
erate. Some of the largest shippers figure that ten
or more states, extending from Texas to Virginia,
lie so convenient as to make them peculiarly suited
to trade with Tennessee; and, of course, a much
wider territory lies only a little further away.
The output of sawmills in Tennessee according
to the Federal census was:
894,968,000 feet in 1907
790,642,000 feet in 1908
1,223,849,000 feet in 1909
1,016,475,000 feet in 1910
must be. Some woods possess qualities fitting
them for many purposes, though they have not yet
been much used. The size of a tree is not a sure
guide by which to judge its place as a commercial
wood. Occasionally, species which are scarcely
more than shrubs, as the mountain laurel or the
nannyberry, are quite useful for certain purposes,
while others though of good size, as the planer
tree, are seldom reported in use for any purpose.
Manufacturers in Tennessee reported 46 woods in
use. The number is disappointing, but its small-
ness is apparent rather than real. Doubtless twice
that many are in use. The custom prevails in Ten-
nessee as in many other parts of this country of
giving a single name to many closely-related spe-
cies. The hickories are an example. Half a dozen
hickories grow in Tennessee, and all are in use,
yet the common name hickory is applied to all be-
cause it is not easy to distinguish one from an-
other in the lumber yard or the shop, though the
woodsmen generally know the species apart. The
forests of Tennessee contain the following species
of hickory:
Pecan Hicoria pecan.
Bitternut Hicoria minima.
Nutmeg hickory Hicoria myristicaeformis.
Water hickory Hicoria aquatica.
Shagbark hickory Hicoria ovata.
Shellbark Hicoria lasiniosa.
Mockernut Hicoria alba.
Pignut Hicoria glabra.
Paleleaf Hicoria villosa.
The list of oaks native to Tennessee is double
that of the hickories. Two or more pines not men-
tioned in the reported species are doubtless in
use. At least a score of minor species that is,
woods not usually considered in sawmill output
grow in Tennessee in amounts sufficient to give
them value, and not one is listed in reports by
manufacturers, though there can be little ques-
tion that all are in use. They are either not re-
ported at all, or they are grouped under other
names. If all of them were duly considered they
would not add greatly to the total quantity, but
they would probably double the number of species
reported.

Commercial Woods of Tennessee.
The state's vertical range of more than 6,000 feet
from the flood plains of the Mississippi River in
the west to the highest mountains of the east ia
responsible for the extraordinary number of tree
species in Tennessee. Those of the swamps and
lowlands, such as the cypress, tupelo, and ever-
green magnolia, are found in the flat regions of
the west. The oaks, maples, beech, birches, and
some of the pines grow in the elevated valleys and
among the hills in the central and eastern regions;
and white pine, table mountain pine, the hemlocks,
several oaks, and other hardwoods are found among
the mountains. Some, as the hickories and yellow
poplar, grow in practically all parts of the state.
The total number of commercial woods indigi-
nous to the region can not be definitely stated for
the reason that there is no exact definition or
agreement as to what a commercial wood is. To fall
in that class, it must be in use, but there may be
difference of opinion as to how general that use

Tennessee is thus shown to have nearly one-
third of all the species of trees in the United
States. It would be difficult to find a similar area
in this country possessing an equal number, though
the total quantity of timber in some other regions
of equal size is much greater.
The Pines.
Though six pines are native to Tennessee, only
four were reported in use in the States, and one of
these, longleaf pine, came wholly from without.
Table 1 lists the pines in use and shows the annual
amounts demanded and how much grew in the
state and how much came from elsewhere. The
detailed statistics of woods in use. which are shown
in that table, are not repeated in this discussion,
but certain facts or conclusions not included in
the table are presented here.
SHORTLEAF PINE This grows in Central and
Western Tennessee, but is rare or totally wanting
in the mountains of the east. In the region where
it grows it is not equally dispersed, but is found in
some localities and is wanting in others. No large
areas in Tennessee are heavily timbered with this
species, as some parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Louis-
iana, and Mississippi are, or were once. It repro-
duces vigorously, however, and where other tim-
bers have been removed and space is given it the
shortleaf pine spreads rapidly and holds its place
well. No loblolly pine was reported by manufac-
turers, but it grows in the southern part of the
state, and there is little doubt that a considerable
amount is in use. It has been perhaps reported as
longleaf or shortleaf. The wood is more like the
latter than the former.
WHITE PINE This valuable timber is found in
the mountains of Eastern Tennessee and in rather
large amounts. In 1910 the sawmills of that re-
gion cut more than 39,0<10,000 feet of it. The white
pine is hardly ever mistaken for any other. It is
an imposing forest tree, with an individuality so
marked that it may be recognized by its form alone
at distances so great that the usual botanical char-
acteristics cannot be distinguished. Nor is any lum-
berman disposed to call it by any name but its own.
It never sails under false colors as some other
woods occasionally do. though other woods fre-
quently take the white pine's name and thus gain
easy access to markets which would be hard to
break into under their own names. This white pine
is the same species as that which so long supplied
markets in New England, Pennsylvania and the
Lake States. It is officially called white pine, and
no other goes by that name. In Tennessee the
white pine approaches the Southern limit of its
range. It is a Northern tree, but it has followed
the cool mountain ranges southward from New
York, across Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Vir-
ginia, to the highlands of Tennessee and Western
North Carolina. As is the case with most species
as they approach the limits of their range, the white
pine of the Southern mountains is not quite equal
to the best of New England and the Lake States.
The wood is generally considered a little harder
and the knots darker in color in the South. Neither
does it grow as large as in the North, nor does it
reproduce as vigorously. In spite of this, however,
it is a valuable timber, though the manufacturers
in Tennessee seem to have used less than six
per cent of the state's sawmill cut of this species.
The records do not show what became of the bal-
ance, though it is likely that most of it went to
manufacturers in other states. The average cost
of that bought in Tennessee was low, $16.27. The
mill yard value in 1909, according to the census
report, was $18.21. Over 40 per cent of the white
pine reported by manufacturers in Tennessee was
bought by boxmakers who use low grades. That
helps to explain why the price of this wood at the
factory was lower than the average value at the
sawmill Tennesseans do not use the best grades
of their white pine.
TABLE MOUNTAIN PINE This scarce and lit-
tle known tree reaches its best development in the
mountains of Eastern Tennessee, though its range
extends northward in certain restricted localities,
through West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsyl-
vania. So restricted was- its range once believed
to be that its discoverer, the younger Michaux, a
French botanist, wrote more than a hundred years
ago that he believed the only place where this tree
existed was on a certain flat-topped mountain in
North Carolina; hence he called it table-mountain
pine. It is now known that he greatly under-
estimated the extent of its range. On some of the
mountains of Eastern Tennessee it is the most
abundant pine. The amount put to use in Tennes-
see is moderate, but it is interesting because no
other state, as far as shown by reports to the
Forest Service, has made any use of the wood ex-
cept that a little has been burned for charcoal in
Pennsylvania.
PITCH PINE (PINUS RIGIDA) No manufac-
turer in the state reported the use of this pine,
though there is no doubt that many have been using
it for a number of purposes, but have listed it
under some other name, or failed to include it. It
is generally called black pine in Eastern Tennessee,
particularly in the regions of white pine, the pur-
pose being to distinguish between the two species
