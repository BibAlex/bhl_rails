Engelmann spruce, a wood of the northwestern
part of the United States, appears nowhere else in
this report, and no satisfactory reason has been
given for the use of this wood among and in compe-
tition with the abundant and cheap soft woods of
the South. It is good material, and is widely used
for doors, sash, and frames, but its appearance in
rather large quantity in Louisiana was scarcely to
be expected.
The difference in price between' Texan oak and
the northern red oak, where both are employed in
the same classes of work, is well shown in this in-
dustry. The red oak costs three and a half times
as much as the Texan or spotted oak.
The yellow poplar demanded by this industry was
cut in Kentucky, sweet birch in Wisconsin, cherry
in Pennsylvania, black walnut in Arkansas, red oak
in Kentucky, Engelmann spruce in Washington, and
the mahogany of which two kinds were used was
brought from Central America and Africa.
Louisiana sells Its interior finish, doors, sash, etc.,
in nearly all states in the union. The product com-
petes in the North and Northeast with spruce, oak,
basswood, yellow poplar, and white pine; in the
far West it competes, but to a less extent, with red-
wood, western red cedar, Douglas fir, and the white
and yellow pines of the Pacific coast and the Rocky
Mountains; and in the middle region, from Mexico
to Canada, it shares the trade with the similar
products of both East and West. A wide foreign
market is supplied also. It has not 'been the pur-
pose of this investigation to trace the shipments to
their ultimate destinations, but it may -be stated
that they go to practically every civilized country in
the world, but chiefly to the West Indies, and the
eastern countries of Central and South America, in-
cluding Mexico.
A small quantity of the lumber shown in the fore-
going table was made into grain doors which were
sold to railroads. Similarity of name is the sole
reason why this commodity was included in the
table. The doors are not for houses or offices, nor
does the "grain" refer in any way to painting, fin-
ish, or texture or figure of the wood. The doors
are of cheap lumber, roughly nailed together, and
are used as inside doors of cars in which grain is
shipped. Their purpose is to prevent the contents
of the car from wasting when the outside doors are
opened.
The commodities included in Table 6 are gener-
ally made of the best or second best grades of lum-
ber, though in some instances lower grades were re-
ported. The sizes and forms in which this lumber
reaches the factories are many; but perhaps three-
fourths of it is one-inch stock, and the remainder
ranges in thickness up to three inches, or more in
some kinds of stair work, posts, and columns. Near-
ly all reaches the factory as rough, unplaned lum-
ber, and in a few instances it comes as logs and is
converted into lumber on the premises.
It was found generally in Louisiana that manu-
facturers of interior finish and related products
work their waste into other commodities and sell
them wherever a convenient market can be found;
but the lack of diversified industries, as such exist
in some of the northern states, renders it impracti-
cable in many instances to utilize odds, ends, and
left-overs. In such cases a good deal of wood goes
to the furnace in the mill yard, or feeds the fire
under the boilers. Sometimes edgings are made
into molding, lath, or spindles; short boards are
converted into boxes, wedges, mutts, etc., short
squares into table legs, balusters, or chair stock;
while cypress pieces are frequently sent to factories
which make washing machines, tubs, buckets, and
keelers.

Except cypress, practically all the furniture made
in Louisiana is of hardwood. Cypress is one of the
few soft woods which is well suited to both outside
and interior furniture construction, and that fact
accounts for its large use as furniture material.
The cut of this wood in the state exceeds nearly
threefold the combined cut of all the hardwoods,
but nearly two and a half times as much hardwood
as cypress is demanded 'by the manufacturers of
furniture. Seventeen woods are used, but six of
them come wholly from outside the state. Many
grow in commercial quantities in the state but are
not listed in the statistics of lumber bought for fur-
niture. Three oaks are reported, but there are sev-
eral others, while hickory and tupelo, both abun-
dant, are not reported by any manufacturer of furni-
ture. Three maples grow in the state, yet none of
the wood reaches the furniture makers. The small
quanitity of sugar maple reported was grown in
Wisconsin. Beech is abundant in many of the for-
ests of northern Louisiana, and is good material for
certain parts of furniture, yet none is used. Two
species of elm are found, both excellent chair ma-
terial and suitable for the interior of most kinds
of furniture, yet elm is not found in the furniture
statistics of the state. More than a dozen other
good furniture woods grow in the state, but appar-
ently are not used.
The red gum reported came from Louisiana and
Mississippi; yellow poplar from Tennessee and Mis-
sissippi; red cedar from Tennessee; white oak from
Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Tennessee, and the ma-
hogany from Cuba.
Red gum enters into all parts of furniture, both
exterior and interior. Yellow poplar serves chiefly
for shelves, table tops, and wardrobes. Magnolia
is substituted for yellow poplar with general satis-
faction, and is specially commended for furniture
doors. It keeps its shape well during weather
changes. The discolored heartwood of some of the
logs is sawed into crating lumber for use in furni-
ture factories. Red cedar is occasionally demanded
for drawer bottoms when furniture is made to order.
Its odor is reputed to drive moths away, and though
it is an expensive wood, the demand for it continues
from generation to generation. It has been used
(luring three hundred years in this country to keep
injurious insects away from clothing and furs.
Although the furniture factories of Louisiana fall
much short of supplying the home demand, they
export to Central and South America, the West In-
dies, and a little to Europe. The low cost of raw
material, the low freight rates by water, and the
high prices received in foreign countries, make the
export of furniture profitable in Louisiana. At the
same time, the indications are that some of the
good home markets are neglected. It is said that
red gum furniture, made in northern cities, is sold
in considerable quantity in New Orleans and other
towns of the state. Not infrequently it passes for
Circassian walnut, and so closely resembles it that
the difference is hard to detect in fact, it is
claimed that the chief difference is that the red gum
is handsomer.
The furniture factories of the state do not re-
port much saving of waste through the making of
by-products. Some of the short pieces of oak are
sold for heading material in cooper shops; red gum
short lengths are made into boxes; and cypress
odds and ends are converted into tubs, fence lath
and tomato sticks.
A comparison of Louisiana with certain other
states in the manufacture of furniture will show
how small a beginning it has made in this industry
The difference brought out by the comparison is
emphasized if the forest resources of Louisiana
are compared with those of some of the states-
which are far ahead of it in furniture manufacture
It is not possible to say exactly what the timbei
resources of the different states amount to in feel
or dollars, but it is known that Louisiana has enor
mous supplies of both hard and soft woods. Acre
for acre of forest area, Louisiana will compart
favorably with any other state, both in quantity and
quality of timber. The table which follows com
pares the furniture industry in Louisiana with cer
tain other states, also the timbered areas, and shows
how much furniture wood each of the states uses
yearly per 100 acres of forest land.

The foregoing table would be misleading if inter-
preted to mean that each of the states draws furni-
ture material from its own forests only. No state
in this country does that. There is a constant ex-
change of lumber between different regions, and
often these regions are far apart. The Pacific
Coast draws supplies from the East, and the East
draws from the Pacific Coast; Wisconsin manu-
facturers send to Louisiana for cypress, Maryland
buys cottonwood, white oak, and cypress there, and
Louisiana in turn purchases white oak in Tennessee,
cottonwood in Mississippi, and cypress in Arkansas.
Statistics show that Louisiana actually uses a less
amount of its homegrown lumber in its own furni-
ture factories than it ships to the furniture factories
of Illinois.
The table is instructive because it shows how
great may be a region's forest resources, and how
moderate the use made of them at home, as in Lou-
isiana's furniture industry; while, conversely some
regions with comparatively small resources of the
kind demanded, have developed extensive industries
by drawing supplies from distant localities, as in
the cases of Massachusetts, Maryland, and Illinois.
A very high development of home resources is seen
in North Carolina's furniture industry which draws
94 per cent of its wood from the state's forests; and
with a wooded area but little larger than Louisi
ana's, it turns into furniture more than twenty times
as much lumber, and pays nearly one and a hall
times as much for it, per thousand feet. Illinois
furniture makers pay three times as much per thou
sand feet for their lumber as the manufacturers
in Louisiana pay, and Massachusetts, Kentucky
Wisconsin, and Maryland pay more than twice as
much. The markets in which the finished products
are sold are not equally accessible to all these
states, for Louisiana, by reason of higher freighl
rates, is at a disadvantage in competing for sonu
of the northern markets. There are, however ,manj
markets where the Louisiana product competes witl
little or no disadvantage on account of highei
freight. Water carriage is cheap, and the ports ol
Louisiana are within reach of the whole Atlantic
Coast from Maine to Florida, as well as the Wesl
Indies, and most of the Spanish-American and
European countries. The possibilities of develop
ing a trade in furniture manufactured from the ex
cellent and very cheap woods of Louisiana, wili
doubtless attract much attention in the near future
