Except a little yellow poplar, locust, and red oak,
Louisiana depends entirely upon its own forests
for vehicle wood. The poplar is made into panels
for carriages, the locust into hubs, but the use to
which the 2,000 feet of imported red oak is put
is not stated. Oak and hickory are the most im-
portant woods in this industry. Four oaks are in-
cluded, namely, the common white oak, the cow oak,
the overcup oak, and the Texan oak, which is com-
monly called red oak, or spotted oak. Louisiana is
a large user of hickory, and it nearly all goes
into vehicles. Most of the hickory cut in the state
is shipped to the other states rough or only partly
manufactured, there to be finished and made ready
for use. The cut of hickory lumber in the state
is nearly eight million feet, besides much not listed
as lumber which goes out as logs, bolts, or billets.
The manufacturers in the state use less than three
million feet of this fine vehicle wood. A considera-
able part of that appearing in the accompanying
table as manufactured product, is not in the form of
vehicles ready for use. but as completed parts, such
as spokes, hubs, shafts, poles, and gears. These
are shipped to northern factories where they are
assembled, ironed, painted, and sent out as finished
vehicles. It is not possible to state how much of
Louisiana's six and a half million feet of vehicle
wood shown in the table is actually finished in the
state and made ready for the consumer. Vehicle
making in many regions is somewhat different from
most other kinds of manufacturing, because it is
rather unusual for one factory to begin with the
rough wood and turn out the completed vehicle;
but the finished product of one concern becomes the
raw material for another, thus passing by successive
stages, and through successive mills and factories,
from the rough material to the completed product.
There are, however, a number of shops and fac-
tories in Louisiana which make vehicles ready for
use. These vehicles are of many kinds, from the
heaviest wagon, to the lightest buggy. First con-
sideration is given to supplying local demand, and
after that, buyers in neighboring states are sup-
plied. Louisiana farm wagons are sold in Central
Texas and Eastern Missouri. In the latter instance,
the cheap freight by river assists the manufacturer
in selling his wagons. The complaint is common,
however, that freight rates to many parts of Texas
render it difficult to sell Louisiana-made wagons
there in competition with large wagon manufac-
turers of Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, and
Arkansas.
Water rates are low from Louisiana ports south-
ward, and vehicles are shipped to Mexico, Central
America, and Panama. The latter country buys
heavy wagons made in New Orleans, and also light
vehicles, such as are demanded by butchers, bakers,
and peddlers. The beech reported by this industry
is made into felloes for heavy wagons; the locust
for small business vehicle hubs. It is claimed for
beech that it seasons more quickly than oak, and
that it stands well the strain to which it is sub-
jected in heavy trucks. Wagon bottoms are made
of longleaf pine and Texan oak; and cypress bends
well and is used for bows for tops of light wagons.
Strong, thick panels for coal wagon bodies are
made of ash. which is less liable than oak to split
and pull apart by shrinking and swelling. The
small quantity of magnolia reported was substituted
for yellow poplar in light panels. Kentucky sup-
plied the red oak and the locust, and Tennessee the
yellow poplar bought by the vehicle makers.
It does not appear that vehicle makers are work-
ing much waste into by-products. One factory uses
small pieces to make wheelbarrows. Much of the
white oak and hickory goes to the factory as logs;
but many billets, and much sawed lumber and di-
mension stock are demanded. The sawed stuff is
one inch thick and upwards. The pine is bought
after surfacing. Buggy makers report the use of
considerable red hickory, that is, the common hick-
ory's red heartwood, which was formerly considered
unsuited for use. Tests have shown, however, that
for many purposes it is entirely satisfactory.

at one time contained 90,000 cisterns. The esti-
mate would seem high were it not for the fact that
many houses had two or more cisterns, some out-
side and some indoors. In nearly all cases, the
cisterns were above ground unlike those in many
dry regions which are built of masonry and cement
below the surface-. The soft and saturated soil
underlying New Orleans was not suited to the con-
struction of subterranean cisterns of masonry.
At the present time in New Orleans many cisterns
are being torn down, and after rejecting such pieces
as are too much decayed for further use, rebuilt
cisterns are constructed of the old serviceable lum-
ber. These are shipped to the country where they
find sale for windmill tanks, or some other use.
Some of the shops which formerly manufactured
cisterns for city use, now confine their activities
chiefly to rebuilding old ones which they ship away
to sell, often outside the state.
All cisterns in ixmisiana are not for rainwater,
though most of them are. Breweries, 'bakeries, dye-
works, laundries, vinegar makers, and others use
them. The distinctions between cisterns, tanks,
vats, and troughs are not always clearly drawn. The
use is given more consideration than the shape in
assigning names to the different articles. In this
report all wooden containers too large to be classed
with cooperage, and constructed to hold fluids, are
considered under the general caption of cisterns
and tanks. Silos might properly be included, but
none were reported in the state.
Manufacturers of cisterns and tanks in Louisiana
export many to the West Indies and to Central
America. Belize and British Honduras are good cus-
tomers. Most of the cisterns sent to Central Ameri-
can countries are for rain water in towns which
have no water works. Some that go to Panama,
Mexico, Cuba, and Porto Rico are for use in manu-
facturing establishments. Shipments are regularly
made to several "European countries, and occasion-
ally to South Africa.
An examination of Table 11 will show that cy-
press is used almost exclusively. The longleaf
pine, white oak, and Texan oak together amount to
only 30,000 feet, a quantity so small in comparison
with the cypress that it is almost negligible. Cy-
press is an ideal wood for this purpose, and stands
as high as any in the United States. It lasts many
years, even in warm and damp situations which in-
duce speedy decay in most woods. Some of the old
cisterns in New Orleans which are now being re-
moved because the installation of city water works
renders them unnecessary, were built before the
Civil War, and often there is not a stave in them

The manufacturers engaged in this industry re-
port that the output for the whole state has de-
clined in recent years. Water cisterns built above
the ground were once a necessity in nearly all parts
of the state, but particularly in the southern por-
tion and in regions where the land lies low and
flat. The decline in the use of such cisterns is not
due to any change in the ground level, but to the
fact that many of the larger towns have installed
municipal water works, and private residences no
longer need cisterns to store rain water. In many
parts of Louisiana, water from shallow wells has
never been a success; not that there was any lack
of ground water, tout rather that there was too
much of it. It rose in wells within a few feet of
the surface, and often quite to the surface of the
ground. It was frequently little better than stag-
nant surface water, and was unfit for domestic use.
The country being flat, there were few springs any-
where, and in many places none. It often happened
that, with a superabundance of water everywhere,
there was none fit to drink. One of the first cares
of the house builde'r, therefore, was to provide a
cistern for collecting and storing rain water. The
custom prevailed in the towns as well as in the
rural districts, but less in the northern part of the
state than in the south, because among the hills
and rolling country of the north many wells and
occasional springs met the demand.
Municipal water works have been built recently
in many of the towns. New Orleans is just now
completing a fine system at great expense, and thou-
sands of cisterns in that city are approaching the
end of their usefulness. It is said that New Orleans
but can be used again. However, the average life
of a cypress cistern is not so long. The best and
clearest lumber is used. None was reported bought
for cisterns that was under one inch thick, and
much was over two inches, and all was of the best
grades. Some was bought as rough lumber, but
most was dressed.
The waste in a cistern factory is comparatively
small, since the material is generally bought in the
sizes and grades which can be worked with great-
est economy. Pieces under size are made into small
tanks and tubs;. and what is otherwise unsuited for
the general purpose, is occasionally disposed of for
screen doors, brackets, and plasterer's lath.
Many sizes and shapes of tanks and cisterns are
made. A few hold 40,000 gallons, and from that ex-
treme size the range is downward to fifty or a hun-
dred gallons. Those bound with hoops, as all the
round ones are, are smaller at the top than at the
bottom, an arrangement which prevents the hoops
from dropping off and wrecking the structure in
case of shrinkage of the wood in dry weather when
the water within becomes low. Many slender, two-
story cisterns are seen in the crowded quarters of
towns, principally in New Orleans. They are built
thus to economize space where buildings stand close
together and cisterns depend upon height rather
than diameter for their cubical contents. The two-
storied cistern, which may be twenty feet tall, has
two water-tight parts, the upper and the lower.
Water may be drawn from either without disturb-
ing the contents of the other. The purpose in hav-
ing two, one above the other, rather than one very-
tall cistern, is that the pressure may be lessened.
