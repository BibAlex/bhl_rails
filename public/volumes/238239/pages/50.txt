Most of the veneer made in Missouri is rotary
cut. It is usually measured by log scale and the
output in that State in 1909 was as follows:
Red gum 18,208,000
Cottonwood 4,883,000
Tupelo 800,000
White oak 726,000
Elm 610,000

Uses of Wood by Species.
There is no universal wood that is, one fit for
everything that is made of wood, but some have
ranges of uses so wide and varied that they are in
general demand. Such a wood is white oak, yet
it is not suitable for a shoe last, a spool, a pat-
tern, a wooden limb or a violin. Other woods are
in practice restricted to a few uses which they
fill so well that by a sort of common consent they
are set apart for those special uses; for instance,
paper birch for spools, persimmon for shuttles, lo-
cust for small hubs and tree nails, and Spanish
cedar for cigar boxes. It is interesting and in-
structive in a manufacturing State like Missouri
to bring together all the commodities made of a
certain wood, in all the industries, and present
them in a single list. This is done in the pages
which follow. The species are arranged alpha-
betically so that any one of tfiem may be easily
found. The commodities under each species are
also arranged alphabetically for a like reason. It
should not be supposed that the uses given include
all that the species is fit for. The list gives only
uses reported in Missouri. In another State the
same wood might have a list of uses much shorter
or much longer, depending upon supply and the
extent to which wood manufacturers are diversi-
fied in that region. An example will suffice. In
Missouri sugar maple is reported in the manufac-
ture of 61 articles, and yet in Michigan its uses
are three times as many; but in Missouri short-
leaf pine has twice as many uses as the same
wood has in Michigan.
Manufacturers in Missouri report the use of 56
species of wood in that State. Without doubt sev-
eral others are used and are not separately reported.
There are more than a dozen commercial oaks con-
tributing to the lumber cut of Missouri, but several
are called simply oak, or, if they belong to the white
oak group, they are listed as white oak; or if to the
red oak group they are designated as red oak or yel-
low oak. Among the oaks which almost certainly
enter generally into the manufactured products of
Missouri, though not separately reported, are the
following:
Cow oak, Scarlet oak,
Chinquapin oak, Water oak.
Swamp white oak, Shingle oak,
Texan oak, Willow oak,
Some of these are generally classed by lumber-
men as white and others as red oak. It is usually
easy to distinguish the species of the two groups
by observing the acorns. White oaks ripen
their acorns in one year; red oaks require two.
Hickories are grouped in the same way. With most
mill men hickory is hickory and no identification
of species is attempted. In practice not much harm
results, because the hickories are all good, although
there are different degrees of fitness for special pur-
poses. There are seven commercial hickories in
the State and all of them are used for similar pur-
poses. They are:
Bitternut hickory, Mockernut hickory,
Shellbark hickory, Pignut hickory,
Water hickory, Small pignut hickory,
Shagbark hickory,
There are two woods which are classed as ma-
hogany in manufacture. By some they are kept
separate, and others consider them as one. Botan-
ists draw a clear distinction. The mahogany that
has been in the American and European market for
two hundred years or more i the American species,
the genuine mahogany. It grows in Mexico. Central
America, Northern South America, the West Indies
and a small quantity in Florida. It all grows in
America, -jcept that a little has been planted in
other countries, notably in the East Indies, where a
small amount is cut for market. The other wood tha^
pas?es in commerce as mahoaany comes from South
Africa and is botanically a different species, though
it is a very fine wood and many consider it in ev-
ery way equal to American mahogany. There are a
number of other woods which sometimes pass for
mahogany, some foreign which are sold in their
natural color, others American, which must first be
stained to give them the mahogany color. Among
home woods most frequently passing for mahog-
any (first being stained) are yellow poplar, sweet
birch, black cherry and red gum. Some success has
attended efforts to stain California eucalyptus in
imitation of mahogany. The so-called white mahog-
any is prima vera and is listed under its proper
name in this report.
The uses for which the several woods are reported
in the lists which follow should not be understood to
include all the uses for which the woods are suit-
able. In many instances, classes or ranges of uses
only can be shown. For example, white oak listed
for furniture includes many articles and kinds of
furniture. It would be impracticable to name all of
them. In the same way, when cottonwood is listed
for boxes that is deemed sufficient without specific
mention of each kind of the score or hundred sorts
of boxes for which this wood is used in Missouri.
It will thus be understood that no greater complete-
ness is claimed for the lists of uses than that they
indicate the scope and range of usefulness which
has been found for the different woods of the State.
