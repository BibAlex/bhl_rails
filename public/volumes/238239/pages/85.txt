Louisiana's output is nearly twice the combined
output of North Carolina, Wisconsin, Maryland,
Oregon, Kentucky and Massachusetts. Its raw ma-
terial is much the cheapest, the nearest above it
being North Carolina's. Large as is the planing
mill output in Louisana, as shown in the table, the
figures there given are known to be too small. In
making their reports, upon which these figures are
based, some of the mill operators in Louisiana did
not understand that the output of planing mills
was desired, and the item was omitted. The error
due to that misunderstanding was corrected, as far
as it was practicable to do so, but a complete re-
vision of the reports was not practicable. There-
fore, Louisiana's enormous total planing mill out-
put, exceeding one and a quarter billion feet as
shown table 2 is slightly under the true amount.
It equals nearly three per cent of the entire lumber
cut of the United States in 1909, and 35 per cent
of the cut in Louisiana for that year. There are
thirty-one states, each of which has a total lumber
cut smaller than the planing mill output of Louis-
iana, and some of these states are important pro-
ducers of lumber. Among them are Tennessee,
Florida, California, Maine, Missouri, and Kentucky.
Considering the large output of the planing mills,
few efforts at utilizing waste are reported. The
shavings are usually burned as fuel under the boil-
ers, and in some instances are sold for bedding for
horses. Pine scraps in some cases are disposed of
to distillation plants, and are converted into tar,
charcoal, and other commodities. The pine shav-
ings alone exclusive of dust from the saws is an
enormous item in Louisiana. If each thousand feet
of lumber going through the planer loses 500 pounds
as shavings, the total in the state is 250,000,000
tons.

Louisiana box makers sell their wares in many
northern and western states, and also in Mexico,
Central America, the West Indies, and in Europe.
Orange and lemon boxes constitute an important
part of the shipments to the republics south, and
much of the wood is tupelo. It is a favorite mate-
rial for macaroni boxes for domestic trade, and
yellow poplar and basswood are put to some use for
the same purpose. The white color of cottonwood,
which makes it suitable for stenciling, causes its
employment for cracker boxes, not only in this
country, but in Germany and England. Boxes
shipped to foreign countries, as well as those to
neighboring states, go in the knocked down form,
as shocks, and are nailed in final form when they
reach their destination. The West Indies countries
which buy boxes in Louisiana are Cuba, Porto Rico,
and Jamaica; and on the mainland are Mexico, Hon-
duras, and Panama. The available statistics do not
show the quantity or value of boxes sold to the
export trade. Boxes for both domestic and foreign
markets are of white woods, if it is desirable to
print or stencil upon them; and when this is not
necessary, darker woods will answer. Cottonwood,
yellow poplar, basswood, tupelo, the sap of red
gum, and the pines, are generally of sufficient white-
ness to be unobjectionable from the stenciler's
view point. Evergreen magnolia, which is rapidly
taking its place as a boxwood, is uneven in color.
Some of it is nearly as white as basswood, but much
is very dark, almost as black as persimmon, and of
course is unsuited to stenciling or printing. Occa-
sionally black streaks disfigure boards otherwise
white enough. Much magnolia is made into small
berry crates, or crates for vegetables, and goes to
market plain. Some serves as sides of crates, and
boxes, while cottonwood, or some other white wood,
is employed as ends, and takes the stenciling. Mag-
nolia is tough and strong, and compares favorably
with the best box lumber in these particulars. The
high price paid for it is evidence of its value. A
large part is converted into veneer by the rotary
process.
Willow, if judged by quantity, is the most import-
ant of the dark woods employed in the state as box
material. It is tough, light, strong, and cheap. The
black willow (the common willow in most parts of
the United States) is the only one cut for lumber in
Louisiana. About half of the supply is home grown
and the remainder comes from Mississippi and Ar-
kansas, being floated down the Mississippi River in
rafts. Logs three feet in diameter are frequent, and
a few exceed four feet. Much of the willow lumber
is marketed as "brown cottonwood." Like magno-
lia, the wood of different trees shows many colors
and shades. Some is nearly white when freshly
sawed, and changes to a darker shade as it seasons;
other is brown, or deep purple, or nearly black
when first cut into lumber, but fades while drying.
Thus, what was light at first becomes darker, and
that which was dark when newly cut, changes to
a lighter shade in seasoning, and when finally sea-
soned, all presents nearly the same appearance.
The largest users of willow boxes are meat packers
in Kansas City, Omaha, St. Louis, and Chicago.
The black gum reported was cut into rotary
veneers and was made into berry crates and vegeta-
ble containers. In some parts of Louisiana tupelo
is called black gum, and it is not improbable that
some of the 120,000 feet reported in table 4 as black
gum was tupelo. The two trees bear little resem-
blance, except that their leaves are somewhat simi-
lar in shape. The wood of black gum is tough,
with scarcely any figure in the grain, and the fibers
are so interlocked that splitting is next to impos-
sible.
The basswood was all reported cut outside the
state, but the low price suggests that some of it may
have come from the forests of northern Louisiana.
It is not an abundant, wood in the state, however.
The most of that reported was used as crating for
shipments of doors and sash. Jobbers insist that
these must be put up in attractive crates in order
to sell to advantage.
Wirebound boxes for roasted coffee constitute
part of the box exports to Europe, and red gum is
preferred for that purpose. The domestic purchas-
ers of coffee boxes likewise prefer red gum.
The 5000 feet of beech was manufactured into
lids for vegetable and berry crates.
The well-managed box factory has little ultimate
waste. The veneer machines accumulate cores
the hearts of logs left after the rotary veneer is cut
off and these would constitute a heavy waste were
they not worked into other commodities. Some fac-
tories saw them into cleats for crates, lids for small
containers, and narrow box lumber; while others
install machines to cut the cores into excelsior. In
the larger towns it is generally profitable to sell
sawdust to stables for horse bedding. This is a
common mode of disposing of sawdust in New Or-
leans, where the damp floors of many of the stables
require frequent renewals of the bedding.
Six states contribute to Louisiana's box lumber
supply. Nearly all of the outside material comes
from the neighboring regions of Mississippi and
Arkansas. The yellow poplar and basswood are
credited to Wisconsin, Kentucky, and Tennessee.

The line separating the material grouped in Table
4 from that included in Table 6 is, in many in-
stances, difficult to draw. The manufacturers who
report one or both of the classes do not always dis-
tinguish one from the other. "Planing Mill Produ-
ccts," as the term is used in Table 4, is very general
in its application, and, as it is explained in the dis-
cussion following that table, might including any-
thing which passes through a planing mill. "Interior
Finish," and included with it sash, doors, blinds,
frames, stair material, etc., is more restricted in
meaning, and it is practicable to separate it from
planing mill products in general.

Louisiana is a large producer of doors, sash, and
kindred products. The bulk of this output is made
up of four woods, cypress, longleaf pine, shortleaf
pine, and red gum, the relative quantity of each
following the order in which they are here named
Loblolly pine is only a little below red gum, and
spruce pine appears in no other industry of this re-
port. This wood should not be confounded with
spruce cut in the northern. part of the United States.
It is a product of southeastern Louisiana, is very
soft, of attractive grain, and otherwise more nearly
resembles white pine than any other wood of the
Gulf region.
