APPENDIX. '
' The Bureau of the Census, in cooperation with
the Forest Service, collects and publishes year 1
year statistics showing the output of lumber, lath,
shingles, cooperage, veneer, and certain other for
est products in the United States and in the sepa-
rate states. That work is independent of the studies
oi the manufactures which the Forest Service has
made in several of the states. The latter supple-
ments the former, and care is taken that work done
by the Bureau of the Census is not duplicated. The
Forest Service begins where the Census leaves oft
after lumber leaves the sawmill. There are cer-
tain products which are in their finished form when
they appear in the Census figures, and for that rea-
son they are outside the scope of the Forest Ser-
vice's study, because they are not subject to fur-
ther manufacture. If, however, a state's wood-using
industries are to be fully presented, it becomes
necessary to include some of the census statistics.
Such is the purpose of this appendix. The figures
which the census gives are for all states, but such
only as relate to Louisiana are here presented and
in condensed form.*
Those who wish to examine the statistics more In
detail are referred to "Forest Products of the United
States 1909," issued in final form May 19, 1911, Govern-
ment Printing Office, Washington, 'D. C., compiled by tin-
Bureau of the Census in Cooperation with the Forest
Service Department of Agriculture.

LATH.
A complete list of woods used in making lath
cannot be given, because this commodity is often a
by-product in saw mills and is cut from slabs,
crooked logs, and odds and ends of all species which
come to the mill. The usual woods for this pur-
pose in Louisiana are pine, cypress, and tupelo.
Figures are presented in Table 24.

Cooperage is divided into two general classes, that
meant to contain fluids, and that intended for dry
commodities. Each class is divided into numerous
grades or kinds. Tight cooperage may hold molasses
when it will not do for alcoholic liquors, because the
pores of some woods are so open that alcohol will
pass through. In the same way, a slack barrel may
do well enough for apples or potatoes while granu-
lated sugar will sift through the cracks and be lost.
The maker of a barrel, whether slack of tight, must
know the commodity which will be carried in it;
and the buyer of the barrel must be careful, also, and
not accept what will not answer his purpose. The
best woods and the most efficient workmanship are
required in the making of whisky barrels, and white
oak under which name a number of species are in-
cluded is the best. Wine, vinegar, and oil barrels
are less exacting, but comparatively few woods an-
swer well even for these. The makers of slack bar-
rels have more woods to choose from, and so various
are the commodities to be carried, that a barrel
which will not do for one sugar, flour, or cement
may 'be satisfaceory for others, such as potatoes,
poultry and cabbage.
Three articles make up a barrel, the staves, the
heading, and the hoops. Table 25 shows the number
of staves, their equivalent in board measure, and the
species of wood of which they are made.

A comparison of Tables 25 and 26 shows that more
wood is reported in Louisiana for heading than for
staves. This does not necessarily mean that it takes
more wood to make a barrel's heading than to make
its staves. The two commodities are separately
made, and it happened in Louisiana that more lum-
ber went into heads than into staves. The reverse
might be the case in other states.

Hoops are listed with slack cooperage. Tight bar-
rels also need hoops, but they are usually of metal,
while many of those for slack barrels are of wood.
Wire hoops, however, are used in large numbers.
The hoop pole business has been Important in this
country since cooperage began, but it has undergone
change to meet changed conditions. It was once
supposed that hickory was about the only wood suit-
able for barrel hoops, and young hickories, from one
to two inches in diameter, were cut from New Eng-
land to Florida in unnumbered millions for the hoop
pole market. The old style tobacco hogshead the
kind that was rolled to market and gave the English
language the word "rolling house," which word went
out of use when the hogshead ceased to roll was
an extravagant user and waster of hoops in its day.
Two or three full sets of hoops were often required
for a hogshead, for it was customary to cut the
hoops whenever a prospective buyer wanted to look
at the tobacco. Other barrels used immense num-
bers, and the drain upon the forest's straightest,
smoothest, most promising young trees was beyond
calculation. Finally coopers began to learn that
hoops could be made from large trees as well as
from sprouts. A tree which would make only one
hoop when four years old might make a thousand
when it reached the age of fifty. A marked change
likewise came about in the kinds of wood found
available. An inspection of Table 27 will not show
one foot of hickory or oak which were once almost
the only species cut for hoop poles.
A cooper of a century ago would have thought
pine and red gum as utterly unfit for hoops, yet
Louisiana makes nearly all its hoops of these two
woods.

Tight Cooperage.
More wood is required for a stave or a set of
heading in tight cooperage than in slack. The staves
and heads are thicker. There are, of course, differ-
ent sizes and classes of barrels in both slack and
tight cooperage, and any comparison of one with the
other must 'be in a general way only. A stave for a
huge crockery hogshead, which is slack cooperage,
is larger than a whisky barrel stave; but comparing
class with class, tight cooperage staves are larger
than slack.

There are other kinds of cooperage not usually
listed as tight or slack. Tubs, buckets, firkins, keel-
ers, piggins, noggins, churns, ice cream freezers, and
the like, are examples. These articles are not ex-
tensively manufcatured in Louisiana, and what ma-
terial was found on the subject is included in Table
17 of this report. Such articles are generally called
woodenware.
VENEER.
Table 29 shows the cut of veneer in Louisiana, re-
duced to feet, log scale. It was practically all rotary
cut. A log is held in a machine and made to revolve
against a strong knife which pares off the wood
round and round, like peeling an apple. The shaving
thus cut off is a wide as the log is long, often three
or four feet, and is usually about as thick as a sheet
of pasteboard. The thicknesses range from 5-16
down to 1-50 of an inch. There are three kinds of
veneer, classified according to the method of manu-
facture: the rotary cut, the sliced, and the sawed.
The sliced veneer is cut on the principle of a car-
penter's plane cutting a shaving. The cutting ma-
chine is very strong and rigid. Sawed veneer is pro-
duced like any other lumber, but the saws are very
thin, in order that unnecessary waste may be avoid-
ed. Ususally, but not always, the rotary veneer is
the cheapest, and is cut from cheap woods, while the
sawed and the sliced represent expensive material.
The woods cut into veneer in Louisiana were of the
cheaper sort compared with mahogany, Circassian
walnut, and white oak. The most of the product
probably went into boxes and crates. The quantity
seems small, and it is difficult to reconcile it with
the 56 million feet of wood made into boxes and
crates in the state (See Table 4). It is not possible
to say what proportion of the boxes and crates were
made of veneer, for statistics of lumber and veneer
in that industry are not kept separately, but much
veneer is used for boxes apparently much more
than the whole reported output of veneer in the
state.

TURPENTINE AND ROSIN.
The seven states, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Lou-
isiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and South Caro-
lina, produce practically all of the rosin and turpen-
tine in the United States. The output of turpentine
in five of those states is declining, and in two, Flor-
ida and Louisiana, it is on the increase. In five of
them the yield of rosin is increasing, and in two.
South Carolina and Mississippi, it is decreasing.
The increase in Louisiana from 1904 to 1909 was
nearly 600 per cent for turpentine and about 800
for rosin. Similar increases are shown for no other
state. In the whole country in 1909 the output of
turpentine was 28,989,000 gallons, and of rosin 913,
920,000 pounds. Table 30 shows the output and the
value in Louisiana.

OTHER PRODUCTS.
The Bureau of the Census gives statistics of out-
put for railroad ties, telegraph and telephone poles,
and wood distillation, but not by states, and it is
impossible to allot Louisiana's portion of the whole.
The sawed railroad ties are included in the lumber
cut; but most ties are hewed. Such data on wood
distillation as were secured during the field work in
the state are included in Table 17.
SUMMARY.
The saw mills of Louisiana cut more lumber per
mill than those of any other state, the average being
