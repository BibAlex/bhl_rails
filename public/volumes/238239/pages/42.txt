THE ST. LOUIS LUMBERMAN.
left in the woods by the log cutters. Missouri
still works more than half a million feet of white
pine into boxes yearly, largely into florist boxes,
which is a very small amount compared with red
gum, cottonwood, short-leaf pine and others. More
than half of all the box material demanded an-
nually in Missouri is red gum. Some of it goes into
very cheap boxes and crates, and some into those
of high class. That wood is plentiful, and an-
swers most purposes well, either as boxes, crates,
fruit baskets, or small cups for berries. Cotton-
wood answers as well for all purposes, and for
some it is better liked, because of its white color.
It. is more expensive than red gum, and naturally
where the gum will -do as well, cottonwood must
give way. Packers who ship meat in wooden
boxes consider cottonwood among the most suit-
able woods for such boxes, because it is free from
odor and taste. Willow from States further south
is a pretty active competitor with Missouri cotton-
wood for meat boxes. It is darker than cottonwood,
but otherwise is as satisfactory. Considerations
which give cottonwood an important place in tne
manufacture of meat boxes, cause the employmeni
ot yellow poplar and tupelo for butter boxes. Most
of the basswood reported was bought by lard box-
makers, and its principal recommendation is that
it is odorless and tasteless. The maker of ship-
ping containers for provisions must make a closer
study of the properties of woods, with regard to
odor and taste, than any other manufacturers. Some
kinds of foods absorb impurities so readily that
proximity to objectionable wood may ruin the con-
tents of a box. Other food products, such as ap-
ples, potatoes, and most vegetables, are affected
little or not at all. When the maker of egg cas"es
selects cottonwood he is influenced by the wood's
color and lightness, not its lack of taste or smell.
For the same reason, cottonwood seems to be the
favorite material for boxes in which to ship sirup
cans. The prevailing use of red gum in Missouri
for apple barrels is due to the wood's cheapness
and toughness, and white elm hoops are recom-
mended for banana hampers. Strength of material
seems to be the only consideration. Drums (a kind
of barrel) for shipping coffee are made of syca-
more veneer. They are almost air-tight. Sycamore
has long enjoyed a high reputation as a tasteless
and odorless wood. Sugar drums, for powdered su-
gar, are of cypress. They are constructed in near-
ly the same way as the sycamore coffee drums.
The makers of cheese boxes with best rims give
preference to white elm. It is very tough and bends
without splintering.
An examination of Table II shows that several
rather high-priced woods are bought by boxmakers.
Among these woods are Douglas fir and Sitka
spruce from Washington to Oregon, redwood and
yucca from California, and red and white oak.
Some of these are made into boxes of large size,
such as piano boxes, where strength is demanded,
and good grades of lumber must be had. Others,
as redwood, are intended for boxes of a perma-
nent kind, such as tool boxes, or boxes in which
beer bottles or milk bottles are carried about. They
are used again and again and must be not only
strong, but respectable in appearance. The yucca
listed in this industry is a desert palm from Cali-
fornia and Arizona, and is used for veneer bottle
packing.
listed in this industry in Missouri. The convenience
of short-leaf pine accounts for its low average
price. The grades are rather high, and $13.71 for
such lumber is cheap. It is based on the boards
when they reach the planer.
The reported average cost of white oak in this
table is low. The only explanation offered is the
proximity of the wood to the factories. It is nearly
all produced in Missouri, and it is notable that the
small amount imported from other States costs
$70 a thousand, or about the price in other States
of white oak suitable for flooring and molding.
Siding is not made of white oak. The native-grown
red oak, and that brought from other States, fol-
low almost exactly the same rules as the white
oak, namely, the home-grown wood is cheap, and
the imported is expensive. Some of the manufac-
turers explain the difference in cost by pointing out
that the imported oak is much better than that cut
in Missouri forests. At any rate, they say, only
high grades are brought into the State, while all
grades make up the average cost of that procured
at. home.
The cheapest wood listed in this Industry is cot-
tonwood, all of which is home grown; but the
amount is not large. Red gum is cheap and does
not reach the importance in the industry which
might be expected of a wood so highly regarded
av/ay from home, particularly in some foreign
countries.
Most of the flooring included in this table is the
ordinary tongued and grooved kind, yet parquetry
belongs here, although much work after it leaves
the planing mill is necessary before it becomes
a finished product. The black walnut listed in the
table was used for parquetry and inlaid borders and
fields, but some of the woods which are associated
with it, being demanded in small amounts, were not
reported by the manufacturers, perhaps for the rea-
son that most of the colored woods were supplied
by carpenters and contractors who laid the par-
auetry floors. Among woods put to that use are
black walnut, already mentioned, which is of dark
color; maple, white in color, and forming sharp con-
trast with walnut; mahogany and ebony, dark or
black in color; vermilion, red; holly, white; cher-
ry, red; and oak for borders and general pattern
pieces. White pine is soft, and is liked for a foun-
dation on which to lay the parquetry floor.
The waste in a planing mill is an important item,
even when the best economy is practiced. Pour or
five hundred pounds of wood (and sometimes twice
that) are planed off of every thousand feet passing
through the machines. Manufacturers make special
effort to lessen this loss by finding sale for shav-
ings, sawdust, and the dust from polishing belts.
Shavings are occasionally sold at 25 cents per
PLAINING-MILL PRODUCTS.
in Table IV. Thirty-eight woods are listed, rang-
ing in amounts from over 23 million feet for short-
leaf pine to 300 feet for sycamore, and in cost
from $500 a thousand feet for satinwood to $18.24
for chestnut. The average cost of the wood when
it reaches the factory where it is converted mto
finished products is high, $36.55. The wood de-
manded by manufacturers in this business must
be of good quality, seasoned, and well selected.
Practically none of it comes to the factory in the
log. Little more than one-seventh of that shown
in the table grew in Missouri, and four species
are not native of the United States. Woods from
the Pacific coast hold an important place, and
average above $45 in price. Seven species are list-
ed from the far west. This industry is highly
developed, and material is selected more carefully
than in almost any other industry. If a wood Is
found specially suitable for a particular purpose,
and is procurable it is pressed into service, eveil
if it must be brought from distant regions.
Perhaps the largest use of white pine in this in-
dustry is for the backing of veneer in the making
of doors, interior finish, and columns. Formerly
much of that kind of work was made of solid white
pine, that is, a door or a column was of that wood
through and through. Built-up construction has
largely taken the place of the solid work of former
times. The inside is of one wood, and the visible
part is of something else. The outside material
is veneer oak, birch, mahogany glued upon the
core. One of the best known woods for the core
or backing is white pine. It is light, strong, and
holds its shape well. It warps and twists very lit-
tle, and glue adheres to it with firmness. Another
good core wood is chestnut, but it is not usually
considered equal to white pine. Western while
pine from Idaho and Montana also serves well as
core material. The western yellow pine is em-
ployed in the same way and also for solid doors
and frames; sometimes under its own name, but
frequently as "California white pine." It is not a
white pine, but belongs to the yellow pine group,
though it bears considerable resemblance to white
pine. It is more resinous than any of the white
(five-needle) pines, and for that reason is often ob-
jected to as a substitute for white pine for doors,
frames, molding, and sash.
Douglas fir is much employed for porch columns
in Missouri, and for outside house finish in gen-
eral. It is taking the place of white pine in such
places, and for doors, frames and sash. Rotary-
cut veneer of Douglas fir possesses a handsome and
characteristic figure. It shows to good advantage
in using figured pieces. The fir's strength and
lasting properties are its chief recommendations
for this class of work.

Planing-mill products, as considered in Table III,
include flooring, ceiling, siding, finish, and such
molding as is used in the interior finish of houses.
These products are usually made by planing-mills
run in connection with sawmills. Nearly 94 per
cent of all of it is short-leaf pine. This excellent
wood is abundant in Missouri, and in regions south,
and the quality of the wood is high. In softness
and color some of it is claimed to approach white
pine, and is popular for skiing, ceiling and molding.
It is employed also in large amounts for flooring;
but if in situations where wear is heavy, it has not
quite the lasting qualities of the harder long-leaf
pine which grows a little farther south, but is not
two-horse wagon load. The buyers are distillers
of wood alcohol, livery stables which use the shav-
ings for horse bedding, and some shavings are
thrown on muddy walks. Sawdust is generally
salable in large towns. About 10 cents a sack re-
tail is the price for that spread on saloon and meat-
shop floors, and the demand for it is rather large.
Certain floor-cleaning compounds are made of saw-
dust with chemicals added. The dust is often
ground to powder before the chemicals are added.
Another use for sawdust is as an absorbent for
nitroglycerin in dynamite manufacture.
Sash, Doors, Blinds and General Millwork.
Statistics of this industry in Missouri are given
Sitka spruce, from the same region as Douglas
fir, is demanded in more than twice the amount
of that wood. Many of its uses are the same as
Douglas fir, but it is employed indoors rather
than out. It is light in weight, white in color,
strong, rigid, and generally free from objectionable
knots and defects, and is an ideal material for in-
terior house or hall finish, except that it has little
figure.
Another substantial wooii from the Pacific coast
which fills a place in this industry is the western
red cedar. The amount demanded is much below
Douglas fir and Sitka spruce. It is more frequently
mentioned for window frames than for any other
purpose, and the part of the frame where it gen-
erally appears is the sill. That is the bottom
piece of the frame, and if outside, it is much ex-
posed to dampness, and therefore subject to decay.
The western cedar is one of the so-called "ever-
lasting woods," and it is purposely selected for win-
dow sills because of its ability to resist decay.
The eastern red cedar, which grows in Missouri,
but reaches its best development in Tennessee, is
also selected for window sills, and a rather large
amount of it is so used in Missouri. Cypress,
which is also an enduring material, is employed
for the same purposes, but the whole frame is
made of cypress more frequently than the sill alone.
Cypress and California redwood are specially
reported as suitable for fire doors and fire shut-
ters because they contain no resin and are slow to
take fire. Redwood is the less combustible and
absorbs water so readily that if dampened, its in-
combustibility is increased in a marked degree.
Some manufacturers refer to the slow combustion
of white pine as one of its chief recommendations
for fire doors and shutters. It contains little resin,
but when it takes fire it is speedily consumed.
