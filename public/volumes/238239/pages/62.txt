distillation plants are expensive, and it is doubtful
if small plants will pay with present processes.
Mill Waste. Much progress has 'been made in
Alabama toward converting mill waste from loss
to profit by distillation. Rosin and turpentine are
produced. The unoccupied field Is still large. Ma-
chines for making lath and shingles now use large
quantities of slabs and defective logs which formerly
were burned. It cannot be called waste when slabs
and sawdust are burned under the boilers to pro-
duce power, If that is the cheapest method of ob-
taining power. The notion held by many, that to
burn wood is to waste it, is true only at certain
times and places. Many times the mill waste's
greatest value is as fuel and then not to burn it
would be to waste it. Wood-working factories waste
less than is popularly supposed. The owners give
much thought to the matter of saving odds and
ends. It is an exceptional case if a piece of wood
is thrown away if it can be converted into anything
that will seii. The vexing problem is to find uses
for small pieces. The cost of working them into
salable articles is frequently greater than the value
of the finished commodities. . To manufacture un-
der sucn conditions is waste, not conservation. Many
persons who see cartloads of odd-sized blocks and
scraps from a wood-working factory on the way to
the waste heap ask why the pieces are not made into
matches, toothpicks, shoe pegs, clothespins and ar-
ticles of that kind. In most cases the reason is that
it is impossible to do it at a profit. Small commodi-
ties are generally made toy expensive machines
which cannot work small and irregular pieces b
wood. It does little good to complain of wrong use
unless a practicable remedy is pointed out.
Substitution, etc. The general public scarcely ap-
preciates the saving due to the substitution of cheap
woods for those more expensive, and to the practice
of making a smaller quantity answer where a lar-
ger quantity was formerly used. The latter point
is well illustrated in the box business. A packing
box large enough to hold four or five bushels was
once made of inch boards. Much thinner lumber
is now found sufficient; or such a box is made of
built-up veneer in sheets not more than a quarter of
an inch thick, reinforced at the corners. It requires
less than half the material of the old inch-board
box, and it is as serviceable. The saving is fifty
per cent or more. The furniture factory saves in
the same way. Solid oak or mahogany pieces of
former times are seldom made now. A sheet of
veneer, one-twentieth of an inch thick, takes the
place of the two-inch plank of former times. If it
is a table that is being made, the frame is construct-
ed of cheap wood, and it is overlaid with veneer.
The article is as handsome and as substantial as if
made of solid expensive wood. Costly wood is saved
and cheap wood is substituted for it. The saving
brought about in this country by that process alone
is so great that it can scarcely be estimated. If the
old method had continued, the high-grade woods
long ago would have become so costly that they
would now be practically out of use. One of the
most effective agents in the conservation of wood
in this country has been the substitution of cheap
and plentiful woods for the scarce and costly. It
has saved in two ways: the expensive material has
been made to last longer, go farther and remain
cheap enough to be within the reach of the people;
and the plentiful woods formerly not used at all
and therefore of no commercial value have been
made available, given a value, and changed from a
useless encumbrance to a marketable product.
Substitution in the uses of wood has gone much
farther than the building of frames or cores of
cheap lumber and coverinc them with costly veneer.
In many instances the veneer is of cheap wood, so
prepared by the skill of the woodworker that it re-
sembles costly wood, and is not only as handsome
but for all practical purposes is as good. Take the
one instance, Circassian walnut, as an example. This
is a beautiful cabinet wood_ brought from the moun-
tain fastnesses of Asiatic Turkey and southeastern
Russia at so great an expense that even the wealthy
seldom buy it in other form than veneer, and the
ordinary purchaser foregoes the pleasure of owning
furniture or finish of that wood. "Circassian wal-
nut" furniture and finish are now in great demand
in this country; yet most of what is seen is a pro-
duct of the southern states Missouri, Arkansas,
Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and oth-
ers. It is red gum, which, when carefully selected
and cut into veneer, may be finished to resemble so
closely Circassian walnut that few can tell the dif-
