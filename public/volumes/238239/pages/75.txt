Table 10 presents statistics of manufactures which
are not of sufficient importance in Mississippi to be
classed as separate industries. The chief lines cov-
ered by statistics in this table are pumps, patterns,
saddles, harness, laundry appliances, paving blocks,
mill machinery woodenware, novelties, tooats and
ships, coffins, caskets and excelsior. The cheapest
wood reported in the state is in this table, shortleaf
pine for excelsior and the most expensive is white
pine bought 'by pattern makers.

FUTURE SUPPLY OF TIMBER.
It was formerly not customary in this country for
people to trouble themselves to look ahead to see
where the future supply of timber was to come from.
The evidence of this is seen in the fact that large
regions which were once heavily timbered now have
little. The tree cutter and tree planter were stran-
gers to each other. A slight tendency toward a
change in policy is noticeable in many parts of the
United States. It has been learned that it not only
is possible to grow timber for commercial! purposes,
but if done with judgment and patience, it may be
carried out with profit.
The 'people of Mississippi are now passing over a
road on their industrial journey which some other
states traveled some years ago. They are harvest-
ing the crop of trees which nature planted and
brought to maturity unaided by man. Nature will
not do it again, for conditions have changed. Grow-
ers of farm crops will not give up their rich land
and wait two hundred years for nature to bring on
another cutting of trees, but another way to procure
needed timber must be found, and it is now time to
begin seriously to think it over. Thinking alone
will not suffice, but experiments and experience must
be made use of.
Mississippi's future woods must grow on land
which can be spared from agriculture; that is, on
thin, rugged, and wet land. When the present for-
ests are cut off, which will be accomplished in the
not distant future, the second and succeeding timber
harvests 'will come from wood-lots which will 'belong
with the farms -and plantations; from thin lands
where annual crops will not pay; from wet and
partly submerged ground where trees will flourish,
but corn, cane, rice and cotton will not. Drainage
will doubtless reclaim large areas of swamp in Mis-
sissippi, but much 'will never be drained for many
years, and that land's proper function -will be to
grow trees. 'Some of the soil of the uplands, owing
to its great depth and its friable nature, gullies bad-
ly. Protecting cover and belts of trees will be plant-
ed to check erosion, and the timber so planted will
serve the double purpose of protecting the ground
and producing posts, fuel, and saw timber.
Timber planters will select species which will suit
place and purpose 'best. Pine will not be relegated
in swamps nor willow to uplands. Slow-growing
species will not be favored in situations where trees
of quick growth will flourish, for time is an import-
ant factor in forestry. Seven or eight pines are na-
tive in Mississippi, but if a man means to plant he
will select the one or two which will grow fastest.
The slow growth of longleaf pine would seem to be
a pretty effective 'bar against much of a future for
it: and shortleaf has only a little more hope. Lob-
lolly and Cuban, neither of which occupies first place
in the state now as a source of supply, promise to
strike up to the front, because a tree of either of
these species can produce a saw-log while longleaf
is growing a cross-tie. The spruce pine which is
seldom mentioned now because it is scarce and its
range is local, may have a surprise in store when
tree planting comes into practice. The excellent
quality of its soft, wliite wood, and its rapid growth,
hold great promise for this tree. It has never been
able to get much foothold under natural conditions.
Neither did catalpa and osage orange which by
man's help have now spread over a considerable part
of the United States.
Nature was profuse in planting species of oak in
Mississippi, .but when men shall begin to do the
planting it may be depended upon that some of the
small, slowly-growing kinds will be relegated to the
ravines and sterile ridges where natural methods
will hold longest. The tendency in forestry Js to
reduce rather than increase the number of woods
found under natural conditions. There are nearly
five hundred tree species in the United States. If
timber were grown from plantings and coppice
(sprouts) in this country as in some European
countries, probably not more than one species in ten
would survive. The oaks in Mississippi may toe ex-
pected to follow that rule, when the time of tree
culture arrives. The .best and most rapid growers
will toe chosen, the others will be rejected. It does
not, however, necessarily follow that the trees which
grow most rapidly will toe the most profitable, for
the fast grower may have wood of poor qualities, and
in that case it will pay to wait longer for a better
tree. White oak, post oak, Texan oak and willow
oak will be strong candidates for favor. The first
two, though not very rapid growers, have wood of
sterling qualities, and with good grain and figure;
and the planter can afford to wait a good while for
them to reach marketable size, for the price will be
high. The Texan oak accommodates itself to most
soils, as it is one of the most vigorous trees of Mis-
sissippi. The willow oak may be a little off if beauty
of grain is considered, but it lays on wood at such
a rate that it 'has all the other oaks of the region
beaten, except the water oak which appears to do
about as well.
There are many kinds of trees which grow rapidly
in wet ground, such .as cottonwood, Carolina poplar
and black willow; and others grow more slowly, like
red gum, tupelo and cypress. So much swamp land
is found in Mississippi that tree culture on such
land may toe expected to assume large proportions
in future years. Enormous cuttings of cottonwood
and willow may be made at intervals of thirty to
fifty years, while cypress, tupelo and red gum will
take longer to reach desirable size; tout many tracts
will doubtless toe kept growing such species long
after forests planted and cared for in nature's way
cease to toe looked upon as a profitable resource in
that region.
Tree planters will always find profit in such spe-
cies as yellow poplar and black walnut, hickory and
persimmon, which possess qualities fitting them for
special uses. The growing of fence posts, cross-ties,
and telephone poles 'will be one of the first practical
purposes to which forestry will be devoted in the re-
gion. The demand is ever present, the trees soon
grow to proper size. Locust, catalpa, red cedar and
osage orange will answer for posts and poles, and
are long-lasting woods, but they are rather small
for tie material, unless permitted to stand a long
time; and some more suitable species may be ex-
pected to meet the demand for ties.
ADDITIONAL STATISTICS.
Many sawmills in Mississippi plane timber prima-
rily to reduce freight. Sometimes heavy timbers
are so dressed. The weight removed in the process
of planing may amount to 500 or more pounds per
1,000 feet, and the item is worth saving. The lum-
ber or the timbers so dressed go into the general
market, and much of it becomes the raw material
for further manufacturers. Other is used in rough
construction. This study did not regard lumber
dressed in that way as a manufactured product en-
titled to a place in this report; but figures showing
the annual quantity of such material turned out in
Mississippi are presented as a matter of informa-
tion. Table 15 which follows shows the kinds of
wood planed and the quantity of each, with the total
cost and the part grown in and out of the state. It
is. of course, understood that it is in addition to the
totals given in preceding tables.
