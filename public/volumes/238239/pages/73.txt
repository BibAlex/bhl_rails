Red gum leads the list of furniture woods in Mis-
sissippi, and supplies nearly twice as much as any
other, but it is third from the bottom in average
price. A man does not need a long memory to carry
'him beyond the time when red gum was not consid-
ered suitable material for furniture, or for much of
anything else. If thrown upon a lumber pile in the
mill yard, as was the custom once, and left to sea-
son in sun, wind, and rain, red gum boards warped
so persistently that they became a discouraging .prop-
osition. Artificial heat in an old-style kiln was not
much .better; but mill men knew that red gum had
the stuff in it that makes good lumber, and they be-
gan experimenting with it, and gradually the secrets
of seasoning it were found out, although experi-
enced lumbermen say there is something to be found
out yet. When seasoning is done according to the
latest approved methods, it sometimes falls a little
short of expectations. The test frequently comes in
working veneer glued upon a backing of some other
wood. It appears that three things must work to-
gether to make success sure: the red gum must be in
proper condition, the wood upon which it is to be
glued must be just right, and the glue must lack
nothing. If one of these factors is wanting, the job
may fall short of success. That is true, of course,
for all woods to some extent, but since it occurs a
little oftener when the veneer is red gum than when
it is mahogany, oak, or walnut, the conclusion has
been reached that red gum has some peculiarities
which must be carefully studied if success is to be
attained in high-grade work. On a former page of
this report something was said of the manner of
making red gum veneer and of the characteristic
figure of the wood. Furniture makers study these
matters carefully. They not only use the gum under
its own name, but they finish it in imitation of sev-
eral other woods, among those most frequently imi-
tated being Circassian walnut, mahogany, cherry,
birch, maple and oak. Some of these imitations are
produced almost wholly by the application of stains
to give proper color; others have grain and figure
printed upon the wood. That is the usual method
of imitating oak. A certain manufacturer (not in
Mississippi) suggested the process when he said:
"We bring nothing but red gum into our mill and
send nothing but oak out."
It should not be supposed that all red gum in the
furniture business is choice figured veneer for out-
side use. Much common lumber and cheap veneer
are employed for inside. It goes into frames, slides,
drawer bottoms and backs, shelves, partitions,
pigeonholes and boxes. Some cheap furniture for
kitchen or pantry use is solid red gum, though many
other cheap woods are as good or even better for
that ipurpose. In England they make furniture of
red gum and call it "satin walnut." That is only
a trade name, as there is no such wood as "satin
walnut." It has been said though specific instances
have not been cited that red gum from the southern
states is exported to Italy and Prance, is there made
into furniture of artistic patterns, is reshi-pped to
this country and sold under the name of French and
Italian walnut. At any rate, there is a good market
in Italy and France for red gum, and its identity
seems to be lost when it reaches these countries, and
at least some of it must be manufactured under the
name of some other wood. Exporters of the wood
say that foreign countries have been very successful
in handling this wood and it is popular there. The
field 'for the development of the red gum industry
in this country, the making of high-grade commodi-
ties, appears 'to be only opening. The prediction
has been made that the wood in a few years will
sell for as much as good white oak.
The second wood on the furniture list, shown in
Table 4, is red oak. That is the name under which
it was reported, but the low average cost casts doubt
on the wood's identity. It was probably Texan oak,
yellow oak and others, with some genuine red oak;
for the latter cannot be bought in Mississippi in
grades suitable for furniture, for $15.23 per thousand
feet. The low cost of yellow poplar was due to the
low grades used which went into drawer bottoms,
sides and other unexposed parts. The average low
cost of all the furniture woods in the table is sur-
prising, except for cypress, white ash and longleaf
pine. The table shows that the average cost of the
10,278,000 feet of material was only $13.44. That in-
dicates a remarkable opportunity for building up a
furniture manufacturing business in Mississippi
Cheap material ought to more than offset high
freight rates in carrying the finished products to
market. If northern manufacturers can buy lumber
in Mississippi, freight it north, make furniture of it,
ship the furniture back and sell it in the region
where the timber grew, there ought to be 'business
for somebody in making and selling the finished arti-
cle near the source of the raw material. The amount
of furniture now made in Mississippi is a fair be-
ginning only. There are possibilities of enormous
expansion. Every foot of the wood used in the fur-
niture factories of the state grew in Mississippi. It
is doubtful if another state in the Union can make
that showing.

VEHICLE AND VEHICLE PARTS.
Statistics of the vehicle industry are given in Ta-
ble 5. The investigation is two-fold, in a measure;
that is, the making of finished vehicles constitutes
only part of it, while the manufacture of pants of
vehicles ranks almost as a separate industry. Con-
ditions are peculiar. Some shops take raw material
and turn out the finished wagon or buggy ready for
hitching the horses, but that is not the customary
way of doing it. A portion of the work is done in
one shop, and another shop finished it. Perhaps one
factory makes wheels only, ready for the irons and
the paint; it may be that hubs are the sole product
of another. Some rough-turn spokes; some 'make
poles and shafts; others assemble the parts, put the
irons on and apply the paint. Occasionally a shop
confines its operations to producing carriage bodies.
Thus a number of factories may have a hand in the
production of a single vehicle, and the report of no
operator will give complete statistics. The finished
product of one factory may become the raw material
of another. The job must be followed through all
the operations to get the first and last of it. Ve-
hicle making is one of the most difficult of all the
wood-using industries for the statistician to handle.
There is constant danger of counting the same ma-
terial twice, as it passes from factory to factory, or
of missing it altogether. The difficulty is often
much increased by the fact that parts of the work
may be done in different states. The assembler of
a carriage may buy the unpainted wheels in Ark-
ansas, the pole or shafts in Kentucky, the body in
Tennessee, and put on the irons and the paint in
Mississippi. How can each of the states, in a case
like that, receive its proper credit for the part it
$138,110
10,278,000
makes of the carriage? The only practicable course
for the statistician in a case of that kind is to check
and recheck as carefully as possible, and offer the
result as the best approximation obtainable under
the circumstances.
White oak, hickory and yellow poplar are the
three chief vehicle woods in Mississippi, and consti-
tute more than ninety-seven per cent of all. The
hickory and the oak are made into wheels and other
running gear, while the poplar is converted into
bodies. Beds for farm wagons take some of the 'best.
Poplar has always been a favorite material for wa-
gon beds in this country, but the advance in its cost
within the past twenty or thirty years has opened
the way for substitutes, and cottonwood, willow,
and some of the pines have taken much of the wa-
gon-ibed trade. Yellow poplar, however, is still large
in spite of high price. The same wood has long
filled a place of equal importance in the manufacture
of fine carriage bodies, particularly broad-panels and
curved parts. Yellow poplar finishes with a fine,
smooth surface, and it receives and displays paint
better than any other wood. It is much used for
the tops of light business wagons, for butchers, ba-
kers, grocers, milkmen and others.
The only water oak and pin oak listed in the state
are found in this industry, and they are the cheap-
est in Table 5. Most of the longleaf pine was made
into wagon bottoms, and the small amount of cot-
tonwood listed was converted into farm-wagon beds.
In addition to wagons, this industry includes
carts, trucks, sleds, wheelbarrows and push carts. A
good many hand trucks are used at wharfs and land-
ings on the banks of navigable rivers where bulky
commodities are loaded on boats or unloaded.

Ten woods contribute to this industry, but four
of them aggregate ninety-eight per cent of all, and
three-fourths are longleaf and shortleaf pine. Win-
dow and door frames are important commodities be-
longing here, as are stair work, railing, balustrades
and posts. Among the woods listed, sweet birch is
highest in price, and of course comes wholly from
without the state, as it does not grow in commercial
quantities in Mississippi. Most of the 40,000 feet
was made into doors. In only one other industry,
