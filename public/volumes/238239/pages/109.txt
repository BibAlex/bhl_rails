Beehives are manufactured from clear longleaf
pine, but the frames or boxes in which the honey is
stored by the bees are of cottonwood, basswood, yel-
low poplar, or some other wood without offensive
odor and with pleasing color. Honey frames are one
of the few commodities turned out by the wood-
worker that are sold to the ultimate consumer by
weight, and they are sold at the same price as the
honey they contain.
The manufacture of excelsior is not important in
Texas. A soft cheap wood is needed and it must
possess a considerable element of toughness and
elasticity. The principal use of excelsior is for
packing purposes and not for upholstering, as many
persons suppose. Shippers of dishes, small articles
of hardware, and 'of other breakable commodities,
are the largest users. All of the excelsior reported
in Texas was made of shortleaf pine.
The makers of chicken coops in the State use a
liberal amount of wood. Some of it Is pine and
some white elm. The latter wood is tough and is
made into the long dowels or rods forming the sides,
ends and tops of coops. The elm was bought for $10
a thousand, which indicates that it was purchased
in the log form.
Paving blocks are made of tooth longleaf and short-
leaf pine in Texas, and large numbers are manufac-
tured. Wooden paving blocks have been used and
experimented with in this and foreign countries for
many years; many kinds of wood have been tried,
and many failures and many successes have been
recorded. The successes have been more than the
failures, and the use of the blocks is rapidly extend-
ing. Most of the failures and unsatisfactory experi-
ments may be checked against the use of untreated
wood. Since treated blocks have become the rule,
that form of pavement has grown rapidly in popu-
larity. The blocks are about twice the size of an
ordinary brick, and so cut that the wear falls on the
end of the fibers; that is, on a cross section of the
tree.
Some very hard woods, as osage orange and mes-
quite, have been used as paving blocks in Texas;
but they are objectionable on account of excessive
cost, the difficulty of procuring them of proper form
and size, and their tendency to wear smooth and be-
come slippery in rainy weather. As far as their
resistance to decay is concerned, they are all that
could be desired. A little osage orange block pave-
ment may still be seen in San Antonio which has
well nigh outlasted the memory of those who laid it.
In selecting pine for paving blocks, the annual
rings of growth are carefully inspected. They must
not be too broad; that is, the trees from which they
are cut must not be of too rapid growth. The ring,
as is well known to most persons, is made up of two
kinds of wood the dark-colored, porous spring
growth, and the dense wood laid on in the summer.
The latter is harder than the spring wood, and wears
down more slowly under the traffic to which paving
is subjected. If the rings are wide, the wear gives
the top of the 'blocks a corrugated surface, like a
washboard, and makes it objectionable for sanitary
reasons. Blocks of longleaf and of selected shortleaf
are of such regularly-spaced narrow rings that they
wear smooth and always present good surfaces.
Four woods in Texas constitute the cigar box ma-
terial red gum, yellow poplar, basswood and Span-
ish cedar. The four are employed in nearly equal
amounts. Red gum is cheapest, yellow poplar next,
basswood third, and Spanish cedar the most expen-
sive. Much of the cedar is made into very thin-
sliced veneer and is used as overlay or covering for
the other woods. In quantity this cedar surpasses
any other cigar-box wood in the United States. It
is much employed as veneer, yet large quantities are
worked into thin lumber and converted into boxes
of solid wood.
Butcher supplies make up part of the material in
the miscellaneous table, and two woods white and
Texan oak are the only species listed.
Refrigerators are made in so small a way that
they call for only brief mention. White ash and cy-
press are the only woods reported for this business.
The market for refrigerators in Texas is excellent,
and plenty of wood may be had for making them.
It would seem that there is room to build up an in-
dustry in that line.
A large quantity of wood is made into caskets and
coffins in Texas yearly, but the statistics were not
obtained in form to appear as a separate industry,
and are included in the miscellaneous table. Red
gum and cypress are the only woods repprted, three-
fourths of all 'oeing cypress. A large number of the
caskets used in Ihe State are made in northern fac-
tories, and many more are the work of cabinet
makers who turn out a few each in the course of a
year, but do not make detailed reports of their out-
put The boxes in which caskets are always shipped
are counted as part of the Industry.
SUMMARY BY INDUSTRIES OF WOODS USED
IN TEXAS.
Table XV is a summary of all the wood-using in-
dustries in Texas. It is a counterpart of Table I,
which is a summary by species. Both tables present
the same totals 'but interpret them in different ways.
The first shows how much of each wood is used, the
cost, etc.; the last shows how much wood of all
kinds Is demanded by each one of the fourteen in-
dustries of Texas. Forty-eight woods are listed iu
Table I and thirteen industries in Table XV. In
this enumeration "Miscellaneous" Is classed as an
industry, though it is only a grouping of many
items. It Is numbered XIV. The highest average
price for the wood used was by the makers of fix-
tures, and the lowest by planing mill products. The
makers of tanks bought the smallest percentage of
material in the State, and the manufacturers of
planing-mill products the largest; but no industry
procured all of its wood In the State, and none
bought all outside. The average cost of the wood
reported 'by all the industries was $13.30 per 1,000
feet. That can be compared with similar data 'for
other States where the average costs for all wood
used were as follows:
Average
State. Cost.
Arkansas $11.49
Louisiana 11.64
Mississippi 12.22
Alabama 12.24
Maryland 20.6?
Massachusetts 21.23
Kentucky 23.07
Missouri 24.12
Illinois 28.63
PERCENTAGE OF DIFFERENT WOODS USED BY
EACH INDUSTRY.
Fourteen of the forty-eight woods reported by the
hackberry, Gambel oak, mesquite, mountain juniper,
one-seed juniper, red cedar, Spanish cedar, teak, tu-
pelo, western white pine and willow oak. No spe-
cies is used by all the industries, but four woods
white oak, red gum, cypress and white ash appear
in ten of the thirteen, and Texan oak and longleaf
pine in nine. No industry uses more than one-half
of the reported woods. Car makers list 24, furni-
ture 23, and sash, doors and blinds 21, of the 48
species; while patterns take 6 and handles and
tanks 3 each.
AVERAGE COST OF WOODS IN EACH INDUS-
TRY.
The difference in the prices paid for a wood by
different industries that use it is well illustrated in
Table XVII. Practically no one of them have the
same average price. White oak is a wood well
known and as universally used as any in this coun-
try. Some manufacturers in Texas pay three or
four times as much for it as others. Longleaf pine
does not show such marked difference, but some
users pay double what others buy it for. Red gum
ranges from $12 to $40; Texan oak, from $10 to
$33.19, and white elm from $10 to $50. No general ex-
planation would account for all of these variations,
but difference in grade of the materials used is re-
sponsible for much of it. Freight rates have some
effect on cost, and the form of the material pur-
chased c has a great deal. Some buy it in log form
for half or less of what rough lumber would cost;
a few purchase it by the cord, and others procure it
