Homer sang the praises of the washerwoman,
Nausicaa.
Supplies for dairymen and poulterers are manu-
factured on a small scale in Tennessee and employ
most of the species shown in Table 20, though none
of them, in large amounts. Makers of refrigerators
draw material from these woods also, and kitchen
cabinets belong in the same class. Curtain poles
of chestnut are produced in quantity worthy of men-
tion. Well-boring machines are constructed of white
and red oak and of ash. Cotton picking baskets are
woven of thin strips of white oak.
Summary of Industries.
Table 21 brings together some of the essential
features of the preceding tables and affords a brief
review of all and a convenient means of comparing
industry. If not, the material goes into the miscel-
laneous table. No fixed rule has been set for the
minimum quantity of wood for a separate industry.
Each case is decided on its merits. In the Missouri
report a separate table was given to airship man-
ufacture, though the amount of wood was very
small. The reason for doing so was that the line
was distinct from all others, and was of special in-
terest. This explanation is offered to remove mis-
understanding if such may exist, as to just what
is meant by the term "wood-using industry" as it is
employed in state reports like this. It is nothing
more than a convenient and somewhat arbitrary
separation into groups of the woods manufactured
in a state, the separation being based not on the
kinds of wood, but on the products made. With this
explanation, a comparison of Tennessee's wood-

them. The term industry as employed in reports
such as this is general rather than exact. It is not
the same everywhere. Some regions have indus-
tries which others have not. For example, Tennes-
see produces playground equipment, but not in
amount sufficient to be called an industry. It is
an industry of much importance in Illinois. Ten-
nessee supports a lead pencil stock industry.
Illinois has nothing of the kind. What in Tennessee
is grouped as a single industry under the name
furniture is sufficiently large and diversified to make
several industries in Illinois. Thus it goes all the
way through the list. In preparing such a report
as this, a decision must be arrived at whether the
making of a distinct class of commodities in the
state is of enough importance to be considered an

If the number of woods listed in the state were
compared, the differences would be as marked as in
cost of material and the number of industries.
Apportionment of Woods Among Industries.
'Some industries make use of certain woods only,
though others may be available, while other indus-
tries take what is cheapest and most convenient.
Generally, however, manufacturers choose woods
carefully and select those possessing in the highest
degree' : the properties desired. Some manufacturers
who specialize on a single commodity use few
woods. The maker of pencil slats is an example.
He has few species to choose from, for most woods
are totally unsuited to his purpose, and he depends
upon red cedar in Tennessee. But red cedar is
good for many things, and Table 22 shows that
five industries use it, though pencil stock takes
most. White oak has no place in six of the tables.
Makers of pencil slats, shuttles and of excelsior can
do nothing with white oak, though other manufac-
turers could scarcely carry on business without it.
It is evident, therefore, that there is no such thing
as an all-round wood. More species are good for
nothing than are good for everything. Black wil-
low appears in only two columns of Table 22. That
is not because it was not fit for any of the other
places, but because it was not convenient. The
cucumber tree was all used by box and crate
makers, and yet it is good material for manufacture
into the products of every industry in Tennessee
except pencil slats. Scarcity and inconvenience
kept it out, although it was probably made use of
by a number of factories that did not report it sep-
arately because they thought it was basswood.
Cost of Species by Industries.
Table 23 is a companion of 22. The species are
the same in both, but the former table showed how
the 'material was apportioned among the industries,
and this gives the average cost of each one of the
woods to the factories that used them. The first
feature to attract attention in studying Table 23 is
the remarkable differences in prices paid for the
same species. Some paid two or three times as
much as others; some of the red cedar and white
oak varied as one to five, and black walnut as
seven to one. These differences are so great that
it becomes necessary to find reasons for them, or
the value of the table as statistics will be lessened.
No general statement will cover all. Each price
must be investigated for itself, for what applies
to one may have nothing to do with another. The
nearest approach to a general statement that can
be made to apply in most instances is that cost of
wood is controlled by three factors grade, supply
and convenience. When unexpected differences in
cost occur for the same species when bought by
several manufacturers, an explanation is usually
possible when the three factors grade, supply and
convenience are analyzed. Sometimes the facts
essential to an intelligent analysis are not avail-
able, and then the figures lose some of their value.
