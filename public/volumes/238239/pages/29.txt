Less than 1-100 of 1 per cent.
Tennessee's nine woods aggregate 14,164,918 feet
at an average cost of $19.41 a thousand. Illinois
is the leading state in this country in car manufac-
ture, and the comparison with Tennessee may be
of interest. Car makers in Tennessee pay little
more than half as much per thousand as is paid in
Illinois; but the important difference should be rec-
ognized, that in Illinois a number of expensive for-
eign woods are used in large amounts, while Ten-
nessee builders used no foreign material. The pro-
portion of high-grade work, such as sleeping and
dining cars, is higher in Illinois than in Tennessee,
where mining cars constitute a leading item. Cars
of that kind operate underground to bring coal
to the surface, -or on switches and top lines In
bringing coal and ore to the standard railroads.
Seventy-seven per cent of all the wood entering
the car shops in Tennessee is longleaf and short-
leaf pine, and the proportion of these two species
in Illinois is 62 per cent. Longleaf pine in the latter
state costs $29.28, and shortleaf $27.52. while in
Tennessee they cost, respectively, $21.32 and $18.
In matter of cost the advantage is with Tennessee.
Yellow poplar costs Illinois manufacturers $51.59,
and Tennessee $42.12. This is a valuable ma-
terial and is one of the best for interior car finish,
and Tennessee has the advantage over Illinois.
Other comparisons might be made, and in almost
every instance concerning the cost of wood the
advantage is with Tennessee. Nevertheless, con-
clusions should not be drawn from that showing
alone, for the grades used may not be the same.
It is none the less evident that Tennessee possesses
the resources and occupies the geographical posi
tion to warrant a trial at making it one of the
greatest car building centers of the country. The
industry is not yet developed to compare with
Illinois, but the field is ready for development. It
has the wood, coal, iron and the water power. The
latter has not yet been much thought of, but its
development is destined to become one of the sur-
prises which the future has in store. The water
power is in the mountains of the east where the
rivers pour down steep channels. It will last for-
ever if the forests are protected against fire so that
stream flow may be regular and not subject to
alternate destructive floods and withering drought.
Car manufacture is only one of many industries
which may become great in years to come if re-
sources are wisely husbanded. Five oaks appear
in the list of material in Table 7. That many more
might be included, for they are obtainable.
cies as in parts of the same tree. Some buyers,
with special purposes in view, buy the butts of
medium-sized trees and use only the white sap-
wood. The tops, which by some are considered
more brash, and the red heartwood of the butts are
disposed of to >.'her buyers. As much of this dis-
crimination may be based on sentiment and tradi-
tion as on characteristics of the wood. The red
heartwood is more used now than formerly. Much
of it goes into pick handles, which demand strength
more than resiliency.
tshed work these holes are not usually visible.
Sometimes casket manufacturers use wormy ma-
hogany in the same way. The holes in the ma-
hogany are made by teredoes while the logs are
floating in brackish water; but the perforating of
the chestnut is done on land. In Tennessee the
cost of the chestnut reported in this industry was
low, there being only two beneath it in the list of
twelve woods. The average cost of all the woods
may be compared with similar figures in certain
other states, as follows:
North Carolina $17.09
Missouri 19.99
Wisconsin 24.42
Illinois 26.60
Kentucky 40.19
The Kentucky average is greatly raised above
what it otherwise would have been because con-
siderable quantity of very high-priced black walnut
was used and a larger quantity of white pine. The
Kentucky coffin makers paid $50 for yellow poplar,
the Tennessee makers paid only $22.63; chestnut
in Kentucky cost $20, in Tennessee $13.94; red
cedar $40 in Kentucky, and $45 in Tennessee; oak
$44.07 in Kentucky, and $18 in Tennessee; white
pine $24 in Kentucky, and $16.01 in Tennessee.
The striking differences in most of these prices,
with only a state line separating the two regions,
should be attributed to grades more than to any-

Though hickory far surpasses all other woods in
Table 8, it is not the only one. A small quantity
of white oak competes with hickory for handles.
Some assert that by boiling the oak handle in oil
it is rendered much tougher than when in its nat-
ural state; but further experiments and additional
thing else. It is impossible that so much difference
can be due to freight rates. Some manufacturers
specialize on high-class commodities and buy ex-
pensive wood; others cater to a different trade, and
their raw material costs less. The rough shipping
boxes are included as one of the commodities of
CASKETS AND COFFINS.

reports seem necessary to establish that claim.
The ash listed in the table represents handles for
hoes, rakes, shovels and pitchforks. Strength and
stiffness fit that wood for the place it occupies as
the most important handle material for agricultural
tools. Red gum occurs in this table. It is made
into certain tool handles and into a class known as
CAR CONSTRUCTION.

Handles.
Almost 90 per cent of the handles made in Ten-
nessee are of hickory, several species being in-
cluded under that name and not distinguished in
trade, though they may be when trees yet stand
in the forest. This is the best known material
in the world for two important classes of wares
light vehicles and handles. It has been said with
much truth that the hickory handles sell American
hammers the world over. Substitutes for hickory
have been sought in all markets of civilized coun-
tries; and the little known forests of barbarous
islands and remote mountains have been ransacked
in the search, but no satisfactory substitute has
yet come to light. There is a rare toughness and
elasticity in hickory which nature has denied to all
other known woods. 'Some are stronger, many are
harder, but the rare quality is lacking in all of
them, and the fact has come to be generally rec-
ognized, so that the handle sells the hammer.
Hammers are not the only tools with handles.
Axes are almost as important, but the handle if
more frequently sold separately than in the case
of hammers. There is a recognized difference in
value between hickories, not so much between spe-
D-handles, because the shape suggests that letter.
Such handles are equipped with a wire for fasten-
ing them to such packages as tailors, milliners and
other trades people deliver to their customers. The
very low cost of the gum and ash in this industry
indicates that purchases were made in log form.
Caskets and Coffins.
The average cost of material used for coffins and
caskets in Tennessee is low. The cost of the wood
employed varies greatly in different parts of the
country, and customs vary as to the kinds of wood
used. In Louisiana more mahogany is reported than
any other wood, while in Tennessee no mahogany
is listed. In most regions in the eastern half of
the United States chestnut is prominent as a ma-
terial for caskets, coffins and burial boxes. The
latter are the rough boxes enclosing the caskets.
Manufacturers assign no special reason why chest-
nut should hold so prominent a place, except that
custom demands it, and the demand is met. In
most instances the grade of chestnut known to the
trade as "sound wormy" is unobjectionable. Such
wood has been perforated by small boring insects
whose galleries are about the size of large pin
holes, but otherwise the wood is sound. In the fin-
the casket and coffin industry, and most of the cheap
lumber is used in their manufacture. In Tennessee
some of the red cedar, which is next to the highest
priced wood in the industry list, is made into outer
boxes because it is a long-lasting wood. Another
reason for the use of cedar for burial boxes is that
custom so long demanded them when the wood was
abundant and cheap that the demand continues
though red celar is now scarce. With pencil makers
paying $7.50 per ton for cedar logs, the casket
makers must pay a correspondingly high price to
procure this wood for burial boxes.
Chairs.
The reason for treating the manufacture of chairs
separate from furniture is that the makers of chairs
frequently confine their operations to that branch
of the furniture business. Wood for chair making
is usually cheaper than that demanded by manu-
facturers of other furniture. The same kinds of
wood are used by both, but chair material is in
smaller pieces, permitting of a closer utilization of
waste through the workng up of scraps. In some
localities there are mills which saw nothing but
chair material. Small and crooked logs are accept-
able, and can be used for dimension stock down to
one inch square and a foot or more in length. A
general furniture factory could make small use of
such material. There are standard sizes for chair
stock, such as rounds, backs, seats, legs, but o.ther
kinds of furniture are made in such various pat-
terns, and the fashions and styles change so often,
that standards in sawed stock are not often prac-
ticable. Red oak is the principal chair wood in Ten-
nessee as shown in Table 10. This wood, as was
explained in a preceding paragraph of this report,
is not a single species, but includes several oaks
under one name. The chair stock mill makes a
pretty clean sweep of the various oaks on a tract
of land where it is operating, and after culling out
some of the white oaks, the rest goes in as red
oak.
The white oak nray not be culled out, but all may
go to the chair factory. Table 10 shows a remark-
ably even run of average costs of the different kinds
of wood. The highest is $15.53, the lowest $10, and
the average $15.01. The quantity of sawdust and
shavings in a chair factory is large because much
