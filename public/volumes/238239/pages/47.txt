seed boxes, chutes, drawers, slides, riddles, pitmans,
tongues and other parts are supplied by the ten
other woods on the list. Longleaf pine is made into
tongues or poles for many implements drawn by
horses and for this use competes with white oak,
red oak, hickory and Douglas fir. Pitmans and con-
necting rods which operate the oscillating parts of
machines are generally of hickory. Hoppers and
boxes, as well as sides and lining, are of cotton-
wood, cypress, red gum and' white pine.
Farm wagons and carts are not included in this
industry, and a good many kinds of tools are not.
Fitchforks, shovels, hoes, scythes and some kinds of
rakes are excluded because the handles are the
only parts made of wood, and they are accounted for
in the handle Industry. Wagons belong with ve-
hicles and vehicle parts. The list of agricultural im-
plements is so long that a catalogue of separate ma-
chines is not practicable at this place, but some of
the most important are threshing machines,, fan-
ning mills, horse rakes, hay tedders, corn planters,
cutters and shellers; manure spreaders, plows, har-
hows, listers, cultivators, mowers, potato planters
and diggers, meadow and alfalfa renovators; reap-
ers, stackers, ditchers and grain drills.

Dairymen's, Poultrymen's and Apiarists' Supplies.
Recent years have brought notable changes In
the methods of conducting the business of dairymen,
poultry raisers and the keepers of bees. It was once
thought that a dairy was properly equipped if it had
a pail or two, a supply of crocks and a churn; and
that the raising of poultry could be successfully car-
ried on with a "henhouse" outfitted with sassafras
poles for roosts, a few coops for restraining the
scratching proclivities of the mother hens with
hungry broods chirping for supplies, and a corncrib
to be drawn upon in time of scarcity. Bees were
provided with gums sawed from hollow logs and
they were left to fight their battles alone. Old things
have nearly passed away along these lines.
In Missouri white ash is the most important wood
in the manufacture of apparatus for the dairy. The
churn with its dash is yet in use, and no wood is
more suitable than ash. It has been said that the
churn dash and the sickle are the oldest tools of hu-
man invention that are still in use, and in spite of
all improvements they still hold their place, though
a somewhat inferior one. Until recent years churns
were home made, but they are now turned out by
factories and in different patterns, the barrel with
Its revolving dash, the box to be turned with a
crank. The separator is winning its way over the
churn. Other apparatus may be listed, such as but-
ter molds, butter workers, trays, paddles ice-cream
freezers and cooling boxes.
Brooders and incubators constitute a large part
of poultry outfits made of wood. Coops and nests
of many designs are provided to lessen labor and
improve efficiency. California redwood, shortleaf
pine and cypress are used in making these commodi-
ties. Some of these articles are constantly handled
and carried from place to place, and lightness is es-
sential. Redwood is very light and does not take
fire easily, and this probably accounts for the high
place it holds. It is very smooth when finished and
is sanitary. The surface does not catch and hold
dust and germs as rougher woods might do. It is
also a peculiar wood in that it is not apt to become
damp and foul. The surface absorbs dampness
which may come in contact with it.
B'ee keepers demand much improved apparatus of
wood. They are no longer satisfied with hives made
by sawing off hollow gum or sycamore logs or the
hollow knees of cypress. The factory-made hives
are of redwood, cypress and shortleaf pine. One of
the essentials of a hive wood is that it shall resist
decay. It is more or less exposed to dampness, and
when decay begins the wood becomes unsanitary.
Both redwood and cypress meet the required condi-
tions.
The small frames provided for the comb are of
licht, thin material, and basswood is ideal. Only
five woods are reported in Table XVII, and nearly
90 per cent of the amount is cut in the State.
Sporting and Athletic Goods.
Table XVIII presents statistics of the manufac-
ture of sporting and athletic goods in Missouri
in the year 1910. Various articles are included in
this industry and woods of several kinds are de-
manded, but more than half is yellow poplar. The
following are among the commodities manufac-
tured:
Baseball bats,
Croquet sets,
Tennis rackets,
Billiard tables and
purtenances,
Pool tables,
Bowling alleys, pins
balls,
Tenpins,
Calisthenic rings,
Indian clubs,
Dumbbells,
Parallel bars,
Springboards,
ap- Vaulting poles.
Golf clubs,
Skiis,
andSnowshoes,
Decoy ducks for hunters,
Net floats,
Fishing rods,
Wooden bait.
Of course, a single factory does not turn out
the full line of athletic goods, any more than one
furniture factory makes all kinds of furniture.
Much of the yellow poplar reported is worked
into billiard and pool table tops. It is one of the

best woods for that purpose, as it may be had in
large pieces and it polishes smooth. However,
the price paid for it is low, $31; and that is
cheaper than good poplar usually can be bought.
If the poplar is so cheap as to call for comment
the small quantity of sweet birch is very high
about double what should be expected. It was a
small lot and was probably of extra fine quality.
The hickory was manufactured into parallel bars,
ladder rungs and springboards. Ladder sides
and vaulting poles were made of Sitka spruce.
Not one foot of the wood reported for this in-
dustry was grown in Missouri, though eight of
the ten species in the table are found in com-
mercial amounts in the State.
SPORTING AND ATHLETIC GOODS.
State. As might be expected, foreign woods hold
an important place in this industry, six being on
the list, but the total amount is not quite 15,000
feet. In the manufacture of musical instruments
foreign woods are given place for the artistic ef-
fect they produce and frequently they are em-
ployed in very small amounts. An example is at
hand in the case of ebony when used as mandolin
and violin keys. One block measuring ten feet
might last a factory for months. Nevertheless,
it is an important wood for that purpose because
buyers of instruments insist upon having ebony
where it adds to appearance, though a plainer and
cheaper wood might give as much service. Finger
boards and bridges of several small stringed in-
struments are usually ebony. In denseness of
fiber it is claimed that no other wood equals ebony,
and in certain parts of fine instruments it is liked
for the service it gives as well as for its beauty.
It is frequently seen in piano keys, and as veneer
it becomes the outside visible part of pianos.
Rosewood, which like ebony comes from different
countries and is not all of one species, is a popu-
lar, high-grade finish for musical instruments. The
massive legs of some old pianos are of solid rose-
wood, but no modern piano maker is apt to be so
extravagant. A rosewood veneer, carefully and
skillfully glued upon a core Of silver maple, chest-
nut or white pine, looks as well, gives as good
service and is cheaper. Rosewood is employed in
the making of many small instruments and is fre-
quently seen in the necks of guitars, mandolins
and banjos. It is very firm and durable and is
both useful and ornamental. Tulip wood sees
service in much the same way as rosewood. Sev-
eral species pass under this name. They come from
Australia, Africa and South America and most of
them are characterized by bright stripes, which
resemble the variegated colors of a zebra. There
is, however, much difference in the various species
of tulip wood. The colors in some of them have a
tendency to fade after long exposure.
Circassian walnut, mahogany and prima vera
(white mahogany) are used in the same way for
instrument making as in the manufacture of fur-
niture. Some of the mahogany listed in this indus-
try is the African species. In violin making the
backs are often of black or Sitka spruce, and in
some instances of Swiss pine (Pinus austriaca).
Spruce is usually considered the most suitable ma-
terial for the sounding boards of musical instru-
ments, from the piano down to the smallest. The
long fibers of this wood, and their uniform arrange-
ment are supposed to give spruce its resonance.
The quality belongs to all of the species five in
the United States the Sitka spruce of the Pacific

Coast has won a prominent place as sounding-
board wood. A little Norway spruce is imported
into Missouri from Europe by violin makers, who
claim that the tone quality has an individuality
not found in other species. The seasoning of sound-
ing boards is attended to with more care than is
accorded wood intended for almost any other pur-
pose. The maple selected for violin making is fre-
