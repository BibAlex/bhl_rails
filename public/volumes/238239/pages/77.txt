New Orleans, La., March 15, 1912.]
THE LUMBER TRADE JOURNAL
The falling off in the output in recent years is at-
tributed to the depletion of the pines which produce
the turpentine, chiefly longleaf. Old turpentine re-
gions become exhausted, and the operators move on
to new areas. Georgia was once a much larger pro-
ducer than it now is, while Louisiana and Texas
furnished little. The center of supply has moved
west, and old districts have declined more and more.
USES OF WOODS.
The following list shows the uses of each of the
woods in Mississippi, so far as reported by the man-
ufacturers; but it would be misleading to conclude
that these are all the uses of the woods, or even all
the uses to which they are put in the state. Manu-
facturers generally regard only the most important
uses; the places wh-ere it has served them 'best, and
this fact should be kept in mind when considering
the uses given.
