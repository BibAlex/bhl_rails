PREFATORY NOTE.
The following report was prepared by Charles F.
Hatch, statistician, and Hu Maxwell, expert, under
the direction of H. S. Sackett, chief, office of
wood utilization, United States Forest Service. It
is published and thus made available to the pub-
lic through the courtesy of the St. Louis Lumber-
man.
INTRODUCTION.
The area of Missouri is 69,415 square miles, of
which G80 are water. About 40,000 square miles
are under forest cover, but that includes many
large areas of cut-over or brush land, where timber
of commercial size is scarce. Other regions contain
uuculled forests of great value. Estimates of the
total remaining stand of timber have not been
made, nor does such an estimate appear practica-
ble with the meager available data. If it is assumed
that the average for the entire wooded area of the
State is 1,000 feet board measure per acre it would
foot up 25 billion feet still uncut. It has been esti-
mated that the State contains 10 billion feet of un-
cut short-leaf pine, on 3 million acres.
Originally, the surface of the State was covered
with forests, some very heavy, others thin. Much
of the best was removed to open farms. The pio-
neers selected the rich bottom lands for their home-
steads where the best timber grew. There being
little market for it, the settlers used what timber
they needed and destroyed the rest. All accounts
agree that some of the timber on the fertile bot-
tom lands was of exceptional size and quality, and
rich in variety. There are more than one hun-
dred tree species native to Missouri, and most of
them attain sizes fitting them for use, and practi-
cally all have been put to some use, either sold as
lumber in the market, pressed into service as farm
timber, or at least as fuel. Many valuable trees
reach their largest size in the region in which Mis-
souri is situated. It is well known that when a
species covers a large part of the country it attains
its highest development in some favored part of
its range. The table which follows presents at a
glance some of the well-authenticated records of
finely developed trees of numerous species in Mis-
souri. Doubtless, in many cases, individual tree*
much larger have been seen in the State, but rec-
ords were not preserved.

In 1909, which is the latest official return of lum-
ter production by the United States Census, Mis-
souri stood 23 in the list of 45 States reporting.
It is worthy of mention that the State which stands
midway in the list in point of lumber production,
nlso occupies a place nearly in the geographical
center of the United States a little east of it.
The table which follows gives the cut of lumber in
1909, and the average value of each species at the
mill. The figures are from "Forest Products of
the United States, 1909," compiled by the Bureau

The maple probably includes sugar or hard ma-
ple, silver or soft maple, black maple, and box elder.
The elm includes white elm, slippery elm, cork
elm, and wing elm.
The ash includes white, black, red, green, blue,
and pumpkin ash.
The hickory listed in the table doubtless em-
braces the following species:
Shagbark Small pignut
Shell bark Bitternut
Mockernut Pecan
Pignut
The "al! others" is made up of a large number of
species, some of which are of much greater im-
portance in other States than in Missouri, such as
yellow poplar, beech, basswood, cherry, hackber'ry,
and willow.
This report, in its plan of treatment of the sub-
ject, is divided in three parts. In the first part,
consideration is given to the kinds of wood growing
in the State or brought in for manufacturing pur-
poses. The supply of available timber in Missouri,
and the extent to which it will probably figure in
the future, are considered. In the second part the
industries which draw a portion or all of their
raw material from the forests are presented statis-
tically, and their annual demands are shown. The
tables which accompany the discussion of the in-
dustries show what woods are employed in each
industry, the cost, and the quantities used. The
third part is a summing up of uses for each species
in all the industries. It does not pretend to give
a list of all the uses for which a certain wood has
been or may be found suitable, but only those re-
ported in actual practice by manufacturers in Mis-
souri. In the discussions of industry tables in the
second part, the purpose has been held constantly
in view of explaining, as far as information war-
rants, what reasons underlie the use of a wood for
a particular commodity.
THE WOOD-USING INDUSTRIES OF MISSOURI.
Kinds of Wood Used.
Missouri manufacturers report the use of 5G spe-
cies of wood, and in 1910 they consumed 443 mil-
lion feet in producing their commodities. - These
woods, with the quantity of each, are shown in
Table I. The common names are given in the first
column, and the botanical names in the second.
These are the official names recognized by the
United States Forest Service. Nearly all commer-
cial woods have different names by which they are
known in different localities. It occasionally hap-
pens that the name by which a wood is known in
one part of the country is never spoken in another
region. Thus, a well-known wood is called white
wood in Massachusetts and yellow poplar in Mis-
souri. Some of the pines possess more than a
dozen names, and some of the oaks nearly as many.
Confusion and misunderstanding often result. The
Forest Service, wishing to establish a uniform list
of names for the commercial woods as far as could
be done in a practical way, compiled an official
"Check List of the Forest Trees of the United
States, Their Names, and Ranges," and in all For-
est Service reports and publications each one of
the trees is always accorded its official name. It is
believed that, in this way, a certain specfes will
finally come to be known everywhere by a single
and recognized name. The process, however, will
be slow. People in one locality who have always
known a tree by a certain name will not be quick
to drop that one for another. It will do no harm,
however, for them to know what the official name is
that which it is hoped will sometime be recog-
nized in all parts of the United States.
This applies to the common names only. Nearly
every tree, however, has two names; one the com-
mon or English, the other the botanical or Latin.
The botanical names are given in the second col-
umn of Table I for the convenience of persons who
may wish to consult them, and to assist in the
identification of the species. There is no such con-
fusion among botanical names as among common
Tor the reason that comparatively few persons
(principally scientists) make use of the botanical
names, and they agree among themselves what the
names shall be, and all call them the same. For
example, the botanical name of short-leaf pine is
Pinus echinata, and botanists in all parts of the
world, whether in America, Germany, India, or Ja-
pan, all call the tree by that name when they speak
of it, though perhaps some of them do not know
what the tree's English name is. This is the ex-
planation of the purpose of the second column of
names in the table for the convenience of persons
who may wish to ascertain, or to refresh their
memory as to the world-wide name of any tree in
the table.
Twenty-nine of the woods listed in the tables
came wholly from without the State, while 24 were
grown partly within. Only 3 were produced en-
tirely by Missouri. They were butternut, Spanish
oak, and hackberry, no more than 02,000 feet in all.
Ten woods were wholly supplied by foreign coun-
tries. Only one foreign wood mahogany supplied
a million feet to the Missouri manufacturers.
Short-leaf Pine.
Four valuable southern trees are usually grouped
as the yellow pines of the South. They are long-
leaf, short-leaf, loblolly, and Cuban, all confined to
the Atlantic and Gulf coast region, and the lower
Mississippi valley. Only two were reported by
Missouri wood-users, long-leaf and short-leaf. The
latter grows in Missouri, the former does not.
Short-leaf pine is of more rapid growth than long-
leaf, and the wood is softer, often a little lighter
in color, and many prefer it for doors, sash, blinds,
and window frames. The softest of it bears con-
siderable resemblance to white pine. The State
now furnishes a little more than half of what is
demanded by its manufacturers of wooden products.
Most of the remainder comes from Arkansas. THfe
short-leaf pine does not grow north of Missouri in
the Mississippi valley, and there is no reason to
suppose that it ever will. As a species, it is not
extending its range, but is withdrawing from re-
gions where it once grew, and seems to be retreat-
ing south. It once was found in New York, and
later it was lumbered on the Potomac river and
on some of the upper tributaries of the Ohio. In
some of those regions a single tree can now scarcely
be found. Southern Missouri is at this time the
northern range of the species in the Mississippi
valley; and it is the opinion of many observing men
that the tree is soon to disappear there as a com-
mercial wood. Young trees are not coming in
sufficient numbers and vigor to make up the loss
of old forests which are passing. The Missouri
manufacturers use more short-leaf pine than of any
other two woods.
Red Gum.
Of the woods used in Missouri, red gum is sec-
ond largest in quantity, and the State supplies one-
third of it. Most of the State-grown wood of the
species conies from the southeastern part. Users
frequently list two kinds, white and red. The
white is more often called sap gum. It is all the
same wood, however. The white wood is the out-
side, or sapwood; the red is the colored heartwood.
Some gum trees are nearly all colored wood, others
are largely the white sapwood. One manufacturer
prefers one kind of wood, another takes the other
kind. It depends upon the purpose desired. Some
of the fine rotary-cut veneer which is finished to
imitate Circassian walnut is sapwood. The natu-
rally watered or clouded appearance of the wood
bears close resemblance to the very expensive Cir-
cassian walnut which comes from the Caspian sea
region. Few woods have risen more rapidly and
steadily in favor during late years than red gum.
It was not so long ago that it. was little thought of,
and most of it is still employed in this country
