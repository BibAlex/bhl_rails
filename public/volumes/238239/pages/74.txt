fixtures, was this wood used in the state. The quan-
tity of cypress scarcely comes up to expectation.
Tupelo is second in the table, with a million and
a quarter feet. This wood was late in receiving
recognition, and lumbermen once were in the habit
of passing it by. It was subject to seasoning trou-
bles the same as red gum, or perhaps the troubles
were worse. Partial seasoning is sometimes effect-
ed by girdling the standing trees six months or a
year before they are felled. That step is generally
taken to facilitate the handling of the logs. Tupelo
is a deep swamp tree, and frequently stands in- water
from one to ten feet deep. In that case it is diffi-
cult to transport the logs to the mill unless they can
be floated. Green logs are too heavy to float easily,
but six months after deadening they have dried suf-
ficiently to keep on the surface.
The wood of tupelo more nearly resembles yellow
poplar in appearance than any other wood with
which it is apt to foe compared. It is often called
'bay poplar, and sometimes the name is shortened to
bay. The name is said to have been applied origin-
ally to this timber cut on the lower Chesapeake Bay,
the intention being to pass it as yellow poplar grow-
ing near the ibay. Though the standing trunk bears
some resemblance to yellow poplar, and the wood
also suggests poplar, the latter wood possesses sev-
eral properties which tupelo does not. In the pres-
ent industry, Table 6, the yellow poplar cost about
$42 per thousand, and the tupelo cost $11. That is
sufficient to show that manufacturers who use both
woods recognize considerable difference between
them. Nearly three-fourths of all the tupelo report-
ed by the wood-using industries in the state was
made into sash, doors, blinds and general millwork.
It is sometimes called cotton gum.

HANDLES.
Hickory is the chief handle wood in Mississippi,
and as Table 7 shows, supplies more than eighty-
nine per cent of the material. For certain kinds of
handles it 'has no superior among the world's known
woods. Its best qualities are seen in slender han-
dles where strength, toughness and resiliency are
required. The ax handle and the long hammer han-
dle are typical. Though hickory may 'be greatly
'bent and deflected, it will spring back and regain its
original position, and continue to do this for a long
period, and times almost innumerable. Other woods
may do it for a short time, but they are apt to lose
their resiliency, and set permanently out of shape.
All 'hickories do not give similar results when made
into handles. Different parts of the same tree show
different results, and the qualities of the wood
change with age. The butt of a young tree is tough-
er than the same wood when the trunk is old ; and
the part of the trunk near the ground is better than
that toward the top. Handles test the qualiy of hick-
ory more thoroughly than any other commodity, not
even excepting buggy spokes.
It is well known that hickory wood is of two col-
ors, white and red. The white is the sapwood, the
red is the heart. The proportion between the heart-
wood and the sapwood varies greatly in different
trees, in different ages of the same tree, and between
different species. Sometimes young trees growing
in the open are nearly all white wood; some large
trunks have comparatively thin shells of sapwood.
Prejudice has long existed against the use of the red
heartwood for handles. Better acquaintance with
the properties of the red wood of hickory has some-
what lessened the prejudice against it, at least for
some kinds of handles. If resiliency is not insisted
upon, as when a thick pick handle is wanted, the red
hickory answers very well. There is a general ten-
dency to work into use more and more of the heart-
wood. Scarcity and the desire to utilize more close-
ly are powerful influences operating to give the
heartwood a place.
Much of the hickory-handle wood never passes
through an ordinary sawmill. The bolts are cut in
the woods, and are often split into bilelts and in that
form go to the handle factories. Many sizes are
made, the largest being the cant-hook handles, and
from that the sizes range down to chisel and gimlet
handles. A fourth of a million feet of white oak is
employed in this industry and a rather large quan-
tity of red gum also. The ash on the list is used for
hoe, rake and pitch-fork handles. Most of the pop-
lar and gum was made into small handles, such as'
are employed for hand grips on wire 'bails and on
bundle carriers. Some of them are used for flatiron
handles, and as the wooden part of pan and cooking
pot handles. Neither a tough nor a hard wood is
required for this service. Some handles of this
kind are painted black; intended for cheap imita-
tions of ebony. Handle woods average low in cost
in Mississippi, about $12 a thousand feet. That ia
because a large part of the material reaches the fac-
tory before much labor has 'been expended on it.

AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.
The most important commodities of this industry
are machine and appliances for growing, ginning
and handling the cotton crop. The state supplies
all the woods demanded by the manufacturers, and
nearly three-fourths of all is longleaf pine. It pos-
sesses the requisite hardness and strength for cot-
ton presses and gins. The figures shown in Table 8
do not indicate that general plantation machinery is
extensively manufactured in the state.

FIXTURES.
Fixtures are akin on the one hand to furniture
and on the other to interior finish. They are not as
movable as furniture or as fixed as finish. They are
made for banks, stores, offices, saloons and halls, and
consist of showcases, cabinets, shelving, specially-
made desks and tables, partitions, counters, bars,
railings and many other appliance of like kind. The
wood used was of higher average cost than for any
other industry in Mississippi. That was not so much
on account of the demand for rare or costly kinds
as to the fact that high grades and large pieces were
demanded. Extra wide boards are demanded for
counter tops and broad panels in partitions, tables,
desks and cabinets. These panels are usually built
up of veneers laid upon cores or 'backing of other
woods to lessen the liability to warp, check and split.
More than half was longleaf pine, but it went largely
into frames and concealed parts while the surface
material was some wood more expensive, and was in
most cases applied in the form of veneer. The prices
paid for the white oak, yellow poplar, cypress, sweet
'birch, sycamore, red gum and magnolia listed in
Table 9 indicates that good grades were used. Long-
leaf and Shortleaf pine are the cheapest woods in the
table. Some of the red gum was finished in imita-
tion of other woods. Part of the sycamore was made
into shelving and interior parts of cabinets and
counters; but part was of high grade and was select-
ed for the exposed surfaces. This wood may be
sawed in a way to show attractive grain. It lends
itself readily to quarter sawing, and has a character-
istic appearance. When most woods, as white oak,
are quarter sawed, the medullary, or silver-like rays
of wood, are cut obliquely across, exposing bright
patches, streaks and flecks. The medullary rays of
sycamore are cut across in the same way when that
wood is quarter sawed, but the rays, instead of being
the brightest parts of the wood, are the darkest, and
the result is that quarter sawed sycamore is darker
than plain sawed. Its peculiar appearance is much
admired.
The high price of evergreen magnolia in this in-
dustry is notable, for it is usually quite cheap. It
is one of the southern woods which is coming into
favor. It was formerly left standing in the swamps
when the other woods were cut out, and the heavy,
intensely-green, laurel-like foliage attracted the at-
tention of travelers who were often led to ask why
such fine-appearing timber was left when other was
taken. The reply was almost invariably that it was
not worth marketing. That answer was of long-
standing in Mississippi. Nearly a century ago Wil-
liam Darby, who has been several times quoted in
this report, dismissed magnolia in his forest survey
of the state, with the short and decisive remark:
"Magnolia abounds, but is too useless to deserve
mention."
It is better thought of now, but it is a variable
wood. Some is of high grade, other is poor; one
piece may be nearly as white as holly, another black
enough to compare with ebony. The wood may be
interspersed with very hard streaks which make it
a difficult material to pass through wood-working
machines. The colors are not permanent, the light
grow darker, the dark lighter. 'In spite of these dis-
advantages, magnolia is liked for many purposes.
It is substituted for holly in brush backs, for yellow
poplar for panels, for various woods in boxes, for cot-
tonwod and basswood in some kinds of woodenware,
and it has a place of its own as general lumber.
There are two species in use, the evergreen which is
largest, and the sweet which is scarce and not so
frequently used.
