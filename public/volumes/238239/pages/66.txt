THE LUMBER TRADE JOURNAL

often shows the grain of the wood quarter-sawed
if the wood permits it. Sliced veneer is cut from
the side of the log, like that which is sawed, but a
knife is used in place of a saw, and the machine by
which the slicing is done is very strong and rigid.
One of the advantages of slicing over sawing is that
the slice wastes no sawdust.
Annual Lumber Cut.
The cut of lumber in Alabama, by species, in 1910,
was as follows:
Yellow pines '...1,322,950,000
Oaks 67,485,000
Yellow poplar 26,701,000
Red cedar v 13,693,000
Red gum 10,541,000
Tupelo 6,227,000
Hickory 5,079,000
Cypress 3,340,000
Maple 2,231,000
Ash 2,146,000
Cottonwood 1,683,000
Chestnut 637,000
Elm 561,000
Beech 497,000
Basswood 461,000
Black walnut 332,000
Sycamore 207,000
Birch 7,000
All others 870,000
Softwood Distillation.
One-third of all the softwood distillation in the
United States in 1910 was in Alabama. Pour large
plants consumed 64,963 cords of wood. This does
not include a little charcoal burning in old-style
pits in various parts of the state. Pits of that kind
make charcoal only and other products are wasted.
The modern distillation plant saves a number of
products. Two processes are in use, known as
"steam distillation" and "destructive distillation."
In the former, the turpentine and heavy oils of pine
are forced from the wood by subjecting it to the
action of hot steam. The wood is not converted into
charcoal by that process. "Destructive distillation"
is so called because it destroys the wood, and con-
verts it into turpentine, tar and charcoal. Dry heat
is the agent of destruction. In Alabama the long-
leaf pine is most used in distillation, tout shortleaf
and Cuban pines are profitable in this industry.
There is much difference in the yield of different
woods. Only one-half of the material employed in
the distillation processes is "body wood" logs. The
rest is what otherwise would be wasted, such mate-
rial as sawdust and edgings.
The collection of resin from standing trees is not
included in the statistics of wood distillation. The
resin is drawn from the trees iby wounding the bark
and outer layers of wood while the tree stands. The
old way still largely in use was to cut a . deep
notch in the tree (often two or more notches) called
a box; the >bark and some of the wood was then cut
away above, and the resin exuded fro mthe wounded
wood and ran down into the box, from which it was
collected from time to time. A new method is com-
ing into use, by which the tree is less severely in-
jured. No box is cut in the trunk, but the bark is
removed over a small space, and a tin "gutter" or
"apron" is applied to collect the resin and lead it
to a tin or other receptacle. At the present time
in Alabama about five trees are worked by the old
process to one by the new. In 1909 the state pro-
duced 2,840,000 gallons of spirits of turpentine, and
310,000 ibarrels of rosin. The rosin is what is left
over, when the spirits of turpentine have been sep-
arated by distillation. The substance as it exudes
from the tree is resin. The stills ordinarily used are
simple apparatus, and no special scientific knowledge
is needed to operate them. In the whole United
States the output in 1909 of spirits of turpentine was
28,989,000 gallons, and of rosin 3,264,000 barrels.
Most of it is produced in the southern states. Ala-
bama's output both of spirits of turpentine and of
rosin is declining. Other states are declining also,
owing to the depletion of large areas of longleaf
pine forests.
Cooperage.
Alabama in 1909 produced 12,978,000 tight cooper-
age staves; that is, staves for barrels and kegs which
are meant to contain liquids. Its output of staves
for slack cooperage ('barrels and kegs not meant to
contain liquids) was 14,977,000, all of which were
pine. Four million sets of pine heading were pro-
duced, and an equal number of hoops.
