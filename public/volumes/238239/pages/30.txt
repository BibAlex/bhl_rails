Pencil Stock.
Table 11 lists two woods for lead pencil stock
in Tennessee red and white cedar. Though re-
ported in that way, it is probable that only red cedar
is used, and what is called white cedar is the
white sapwood of red cedar. The white cedar or
arbor vitae in the mountains of Eastern Tennessee
is a different species. The average cost of pencil
cedar as shown in the table is misleading unless
explained. It might seem unreasonable that cedar
suitable for pencils should be purchased for $8.30
a thousand feet, when other manufacturers pay $25
and $30 for what they convert into furniture. The
difference in cost is due to the different forms in
which the stock is purchased. The furniture peo-
ple buy theirs as sawed lumber, after the slabs and
sawdust have been removed; but the pencil wood
is bought with all the waste. Not only are logs
purchased, but also old stumps, fence rails, gate
posts, barn logs, bridge cribs and cedar in all
shapes, sizes and conditions, some of it half rotten,
other wheather" checked, and all piled together,
loaded on cars and sold by weight to the makers
of pencil slats. This is the material which costs
$8.30 per 1,000 feet, when the weight has been re-
duced to board feet. It is evident that most of the
collection of all cedar wood thus brought together
is waste. By the time the slat maker has worked
out such of it as he can use, he has thrown away
perhaps four-fifths of all he bought. Though the
mass of wood in the rough may have cost him $8.30
per 1,000 feet, the slats will cost several times that
much if estimated by the thousand feet. The fac-
tory which reduces the rough material to slats
does not make the finished lead pencils. Other
factories, some in New York. New Jersey or other
states, and some in Europe, buy the slats and con-
vert them into pencils ready for use. The slats
are one-quarter of an inch thick, seven inches long
and two and one-half inches in width. A slat of
that kind makes six half pencils. Formerly when
cedar was abundant pencil makers bought wide
slats only; but cedar that can be worked into
wide slats is becoming so scarce that narrow stock
now finds ready sale. Other woods have been tried
for pencils, and some have been fairly successful,
particularly for the cheap grades; but the un-
remitting search that still goes on for red cedar is
proof that no available and wholly satisfactory
substitute has been found. Several qualities are
demanded of a pencil wood. It must be soft and
must whittle easily. To meet that requirement, it
must be brittle so that the shavings will fall
away as. the knife cuts. The wood must be mod-
erately light to keep transportation charges down
when shipments are large or go long distances.
It must be moderately dark in color, such as will
not soil easily in handling. The wood must have a
pleasing odor when freshly cut. It must not be
cross-grained, for that lessens its good whittling
qualities. Some of these qualities seem trifling,
yet the buying public has learned to expect them
in a pencil and is disappointed if any one of them
is absent. The extensve search for substitutes
among the many woods of this and other countries
has demonstrated how hard it is to find a wood
combining all the desirable qualities of red cedar.

erally understood that woodenware overlaps on
cooperage in certain directions. Small vessels made
of staves are the work of the cooper, yet some of
such belong with woodenware. Among that sort are
firkins, keelers, piggins and small buckets and tubs,
found principally in kitchen and pantry. 'Stave-
made receptacles for salt, pepper, spices and other
condiments used in cooking, are in this class'.
Water pails and candy buckets are within the lim-
its also. A large part of the red cedar shown in
Table 12 was manufactured into ware of this kind.
Tennessee has long been noted for the excellency
of its cedarware. A red cedar bucket with brass
desired size and pressed into shape. It Is bought
in the log, and for that reason is cheaper than the
other woods in Table 12.
Trunks and Valises.
One of the most noticeable features of Table 13
is the difference in cost of woods used in manufac-
turing an article as simple as a trunk. Neverthe-
less, there is need of woods of different properties
and grades, and this accounts for part but npt all
of the difference in cost. Next to the highest in
price is elm, which is generally a cheap wood. Its
high cost to trunk makers in Tennessee is due to
the fact that many of the users buy it after it is
cut to the exact sizes needed. It is thus a manufac-
tured article when bought and all waste has been
removed. It is made into slats to strengthen the
tops, sides and bottoms. Trunk makers in some
other regions buy this material in the rough and
work out the slats in their own factories, and, of
course, they buy it cheaper. Prices paid for elm
by trunk makers in four states, including Tonnes-
see and ranging, northward, are. Tennessee ?37.87;
Kentucky, $17.82; Illinois, $25.60; Wisconsin. ^24.23.
What is true of the prices of e'm is true cf other
woods employed, by trunk manufacturers. Where
a marked difference in cost exists for the same kind
of wood, it is due to the form in which the manu-
facturers bought it. In Wisconsin cottonwood costs
$27; in Kentucky, $37.50, and in Tennessee. $41.36.
This wood is purchased as veneer, either in large
single sheets or glued together in three or more

hoops, made in Tennessee in 1767, was exhibited at
the World's Fair held in St. Louis in 1904. The
wood was sound and the hoops were bright after
the lapse of 137 years. Factory-made ware of this
kind has taken the place of the hand-made articles
of former times. Not only is the red cedar more
largely used than any other wood in this industry
in Tennessee, but it is higher in price than any
other. The entire quantity used grew in the state.
Other articles than staveware belong in this in-
dustry, and other woods furnish large amounts of
material in Tennessee. Cottonwood follows cedar
in amount, but all of the raw material comes from
ply and cut to the exact sizes needed, and in some
instances it is bent in the form desired. Ten-
nessee trunk makers bought yellow poplar for trays
and compartments at $17.33; in Kentucky it cost
$10 a thousand more. In Tennessee buckeye costs
$21.33, in Kentucky $22. Similar comparisons might
be made for other woods, and as great differences
and as close agreements may be shown. The short-
leaf pin reported second in quantity in Tennessee
is so low in price that it can be no other than low-
grade lumber employed in making very cheap
trunks. The hickory and ash listed in this in-
dustry are used for slats. Woods made into veneer

without the state. It is made into washboards, iron-
ing boards, bread boards, cutting boards, drying
racks and, numerous articles found in kitchen,
pantry and laundry. Cottonwood's white color is
one of its good qualities. This makes it particu-
larly serviceable where stenciling and printing are
to be done on it. Makers of washboards value cot-
tonwood highly because it stencils so well. Bass-
wood closely resembles cottonwood in color and
character of the wood, is used for the same purposes
and is a little higher in price. It has some uses
for which cottonwood is not suitable. One of these
is pyrography, where pictures, ornaments and dec-

Woodenware and Novelties.
Novelties and woodenware include a considerable
but indefinite number of commodities. Novelties
are small articles of various kinds and are either
useful or ornamental. Some of the most common
are paper knives, pen racks, rulers, small trays,
boxes and receptacles for buttons, thread, jewelry
and the like; two-piece boxes produced by the lathe,
in which ink bottles, paints, pills, powders and
other similar articles are shipped and sold. The
line between novelties and toys on the one hand and
woodenware on the other cannot be very clearly
drawn. Whole groups of articles may fall in doubt-
ful classes. Exact definitions and strict classifica-
tions are not necessary in a report such as this,

orations are burned in wooden panels and platters
with a hot needle. Some articles of this kind should
be classed as novelties, some as woodenware and
still others are so well executed that they might be
classed as works of art.
Red gum and cypress in the table aggregate a
million feet. They are all-round woods for this
industry and are made into some of the commodities
named above and into many others, such as rolling
pins, chopping bowls, wooden dishes, vegetable cut-
ters, bread boxes, etc. Beech is one of the best
woods of which to manufacture the class of ware
represented by thin veneer picnic plates and pie
platters. It is produced in sheets of veneer one-
twentieth of an inch thick, or less, and is cut to the
and used in several thicknesses are yellow poplar,
basswood, buckeye and cottonwood. These are gen-
erally cut by the rotary process and may be had
in sheets of any size wanted. This is an important
consideration, for when a sufficient number of
sheets have been glued one upon another to give
the desired strength they may be cut to size, and
by bending, a single piece will make the bottom
and two sides of a trunk. It was formerly the cus-
tom to construct the box of a trunk of lumber and
cover it with leather. That was before the days
of the railroads, when the trunk that traveled at all
went by boat and stage coach, and was handled
with due consideration of the feelings of the owrtef,
who was usually standing by and watching it go
aboard or come off. But when trunks began to go
by rail and chute-the-chutes in modern stations,
stronger material than boards and calf skin had to
be found for their construction; and sheets of ve-
neer with an abundance of brass reinforcement and
sheet iron overlay were brought into use.
The average cost of all wood used by trunk
makers in Tennessee is $17.55; in Wisconsin, $23.11;
Illinois, $30.01; and Kentucky, $44.81.
Agricultural Implements.
The line between a tool and an implement is not
very definite when it concerns agricultural ma-
chinery. In a general way tools are small and im-
plements large; tools are operated by hand and im-
plements by horses or some other power. These
are not hard-and-fast definitions, and it would not
be difficult to find exceptions. The commodities
represented in Table 14 belong chiefly to the im-
plement class, if a difference is to be drawn between
implements and tools. The sickle, scythe, cradle,
hoe, flail and pitchfork are tools; the mowing ma-
