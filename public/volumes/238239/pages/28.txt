THE SOUTHERN LUMBERMAN
The oaks are seldom used for boxes, except where
extra strength Is wanted, and weight Is of minor
consideration. It is true that nearly a million feet
of white and yellow oak are listed in the table, but
most of it was crates. Oak's strength creates a
demand for it; but it is heavy and it nails poorly.
A study of each wood separately in the table would
probably fail to show reasons why all are there,
except that some are cheap and convenient, but
others have special properties which give them a
place whether they are convenient or not.
About one-fourth of the box material comes from
other states, and cottonwood is imported in largest
amounts and shortleaf pine next. No wood comes
wholly from other states, and that which is brought
in comes solely because it is more convenient to
procure it there than in Tennessee. Most of the
imports come from Arkansas and Missouri.
Furniture.
The manufacturers of Tennessee have entered
into the furniture business in a serious way. They
are competing successfully with all comers and
their product reaches markets far from the places
of manufacture. The state is still below North
Carolina in the total quantity made, but it produces
nearly three times as much as Kentucky. The
abundance of good furniture material in the forests
of the state, and in those within reach, give ad-
vantages which the Tennessee manufacturers are
making the most of. They procure about two-thirds
of their furniture wood in the state, and it costs
them on an average $22.34 per thousand feet.
North Carolina furniture makers buy their raw ma-
terial cheaper than that ($18.23'), but most other
states pay more Massachusetts, $28.36; Illinois,
$39.09; Maryland, $29.32; Wisconsin, $25.22, and
Kentucky, $30.73. More than nine-tenths of Ten-
nessee's furniture material shown in Table 4 is
hardwood. The number of species used is large,
and only two, longleaf and mahogany, come wholly
from without the state, and mahogany is the only
foreign wood in the table. The extraordinarily
high cost of this wood was doubtless due to the
small amount purchased and its high grade. Ma-
hogany lumber usually costs about half the figure
given in the table, but sometimes double or three-
fold that for extra fine figured wood.
A rather large quantity of red cedar is listed
in Table 4. This wood has been used for fur-
niture in this country since the first settlements on
the Virginia coast. Some of the earliest records
speak of the odor of the wood and of the favor in
which it was held on that account. One of the
important uses for it has always been for clothes
chests and wardrobes. The belief has long pre-
vailed that its odor drives moths and other In-
sects away from clothing and prevents injury from
that source. Large numbers of clothes chests are
still sold every year to persons who believe the
odor is offensive to insects. It is not known that
any carefully conducted investigation has been
made to determine red cedar's value in that re-
spect. The most that can be said for it is that
for three hundred years the belief has been com-
mon among people acquainted with the wood that
clothes stored in cedar boxes and wardrobes are
immune from insect attacks. Some of the Western
cedars, particularly Port Orford and incense cedar,
have the same reputation, and sassafras is not much
behind them in reputed efficiency. It does not ap-
pear that any sassafras was used for furniture last
year in Tennessee. It was once highly esteemed
for bedsteads because of the belief that it contrib-
uted to the soundness of sleep by keeping trouble-
some nocturnal insects away.
Many kinds and patterns of sash are demanded by
the building trades, and an establishment may turn
out but one or two kinds. 'Millwork is so broad
a term that it covers a miscellaneous group of
commodities that cannot be designated by any
name more appropriate. Among the principal things
included may be named stairwork, including balus-
ters, railing, steps and newel posts; interior trim
or finish, consisting in part of picture molding, base-
boards, chair boards, panels, brackets, capitals,
ornaments and shelving in niches and cubbyholes;
porch columns and railing with spindles and lattice
work, and many other kinds of dressed building
material. The differences between the output rep-
resented in Table 5 and that classed as planing
mill products and included in Table 2 are clear
enough in general outline, but in details there must
be more or less overlapping. The flooring, ceiling
and siding of Table 2 is made according to gen-
eral patterns, and is not usually manufactured for
particular persons or markets; while much of the
class of millwork belonging in Table 5 is made to
order. A man may want finish of a special kind,
wood or design for a house and gives the order for
it, and the mill turns it out. A stair of unusual de-
sign or a portico, hallway, or suite of rooms re-
quires millwork out of the ordinary, and such can-
not be bought in the open market and must be
made to order. General planing mills which pro-
duce flooring, siding and ceiling are usually, though
not always, run in connection with a saw mill. The
door and sash factory is not, but procures its raw
material in the open market or has it sawed under
contract. The machine in a plant of that kind must
be designed for a greater variety of work than the
simple ones in a planing mill which make only a
few staple articles.
from outside the state and was cheaper than chest-
nut. Red gum does not occupy a high place to
judge by the small quantity and the low price.
It is in less demand for interior finish in Ten-
nessee, where it grows abundantly, than in states
farther north where it does not grow at all. As
much red gum is made into interior finish in Wis-
consin as in Tennessee, and it costs nearly $4 a
thousand more there. Illinois manufacturers
bought twenty times as much and paid $30.13 for
it. The use of only 20,000 feet of red cedar for
interior finish in Tennessee emphasizes the great
change in the use of this wood for houses in that
region. It has been said that half of the pioneer
cabins of Tennessee were of red cedar, but that
estimate probably applied to certain regions only.
The whole quantity employed in house building last
year in Tennessee, as shown by data compiled for
this report, was hardly enough to make one modest
cottage.
White pine's place seems very insignificant in
this industry, only 10,000 feet, or about what a small
factory can work up in a day. It is among the best
woods in this country for sash, doors and blinds;
and its cost as shown in the table does not indicate
that high price cut it out. Millions of feet of
chestnut, cypress and yellow poplar were bought
at higher prices. It would not seem that door and
sash manufacturers in Tennessee are getting the
most out of their opportunities as long as they
fail to make a specialty of white pine in producing
their commodities. The saw mills of Tennessee
turned out 39,000,000 feet of white pine lumber in
1910, and a little more than one foot to 4,000 found
its way to the door and blind factories which ought
i.o have had a large part of it.

Shortleaf pine leads all others by long odds in
millwork and constitutes nearly 40 per cent of all,
though twenty-two woods are in use. Ten of the
15,000,000 feet are imported, chiefly from Arkansas
and Missouri. It comes from that region because
it is convenient. Some preference is shown the
pine from those states because it is of excellent
quality. The wood is white, soft and of good figure.
Most of it goes to manufacturers in Western Ten-
nessee because of their proximity to the source of
supply; while the eastern part of the state depends
on home-grown shortleaf, or procures it from states
further south.

The articles manufactured from woods listed in
Table 5 are too many to be enumerated separately,
but they belong to groups and are shown in that
way. It seldom happens that one factory makes all
of them. It may devote all its energies to doors,
and probably to a single grade or class of doors.

Kentucky, Virginia and North Carolina grow most
of the chestnut used in Tennesse and shown in
Table 5. The state forests meet about one-third
of the demand, yet Tennessee is not surpassed by
any state in the annual cut of chestnut or in the
quality. The average high cost of the wood is
proof that grades are high. Cypress came wholly
Vehicles and Vehicle Parts.
This industry is large in the aggregate, but it
is made up of many small shops in all parts of the
state and a few large factories. Almost every vil-
lage has a shop which makes or repairs wagons
though the number of such vehicles in a year is
small for each. In collecting statistics for this re-
port it was not practicable to include all blacksmith
shops in rural districts, though some of them occa-
sionally make or mend vehicles, but the larger
shops and factories were included. Constant care
was necessary to avoid counting the same ma-
terial more than once. Vehicle making is peculiar
in that some of the wood passes through two or
more factories before it appears in finished form.
One may rough-turn the spokes, and another finish
them; hubs may be partly made in one factory
and completed in another. The same comment
applies to different parts of vehicles, both wagons
and buggies. Carriage bodies may be made in a
shop which turns out bodies only. Sometimes parts
made in various places are assembled by a factory,
and a complete vehicle is turned out, though the
work was done in several places. Conditions like
these do not exist in many industries, and vehicle
making is peculiar in that respect. Hickory is
the most important wood in the quantity used, but
several others are higher in cost. The most costly
is osage orange, which is used for farm wagon
felloes. The price is figured on the finished pieces,
ready for use. after all work has been done and
all waste eliminated. Wagons with felloes of that
wood give best service on sandy roads in dry re-
gions. For very strong, large felloes beech is pre-
ferred to nearly all other woods. Yellow poplar,
which is third highest in price in this industry,
is made into carriage bodies. It finishes very well,
takes high polish, and it holds paint. The small
lot of black walnut was made into fine carriage
finish.
Car Construction.
Nine woods make up the material employed in
car construction and repair in Tennessee, accord-
ing to Table 7. The number of woods is small,
but the total quantity of lumber is fairly large.
The car factories of Illinois reported the use of
thirty-three woods, and a total amount of 407,-
333,000 feet, at an average cost of $30.44 a thousand.
