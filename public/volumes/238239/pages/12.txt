FOREST SERVICE GIVES RESULTS OF VALUABLE TESTS OF STRUCTURAL TIMBERS
The U. S. Forest Service has recently issued
Bulletin 108, "Tests of Structural Timber," by Mc-
Garvey Cline, Director of the Forest Products Lab-
oratory, and A. L. Heim, Engineer in Forest Prod-
ucts. This bulletin is a summary of the results of
investigations of the mechanical properties of the
most important structural timbers of the United
States, and is of particular interest to Northwest
lumber manufacturers, timberland owners and en-
gineers. It gives the properties of our most im-
portant Northwest woods and woods from other
regions of the United States with which these
woods come in competition.
These timber tests are part of the program of
testing work inaugurated by the government a
number of years ago, and are the most exhaustive
series of investigations for determining the me-
chanical properties of wood ever undertaken by
any government.
The publication describes the various species on
which tests were made and contains a map show-
ing the distribution of these species. The tests
were made on various commercial sizes, so that
the results are directly applicable and representa-
tive of the strength of the wood in the various
grades in which it reaches the market.
The tables contained in the publication give all
of the strength functions of the wood, including
its bending strength, stiffness, shearing strength,
compressive strength along the grain, and com-
pressive strength across the grain. In addition,
laboratory, determinations of the average moisture
content of the wood, its rate of growth and weight,
are included. The authors have presented in con-
cise diagrammatic form the variation In strength
through the limits of quality represented by the
various species, and also give in like form the re-
lationship between the rate of growth, weight and
other physical elements, and the strength and
stiffness of the various woods.
This bulletin is the first composite statement of
the results of tests on many woods, and readily
shows the relatiive structural merits of the princi-
pal timbers of the United States. It contains an
analysis of the effect of various defects found in
commercial size timbers on the strength of the
timber and its stiffness two important elements
considered in the design of timber structures. The
analysis of the effect of knots and their location
in timber beams on the mechanical properties of
the various species Is both interesting and conclu-
sive. The results of the tests form the basis for
a discussion of the grading rules now used for the
various kinds of timber, and indicate the reliability
of these rules for dividing the timbers according to
the service which they should give.
In addition to the composite tables showing the
average strength values for like grades and like
sizes of commercial timbers, the publication gives
the results of each test made on each of the tim-
bers which form the basis for the publication.
The following table shows the average strength
values on the various sizes of the most important
woods tested as beams, and gives the relation be-
tween the strength of commercial sizes and the
strength of small pieces of the same wood contain-
ing no defects. These results are based entirely
on tests of green material, since the moisture con-
tent of wood materially affects its strength, and
green material is used so that all species may be
compared on a uniform basis:
The column headed "Modulus of Rupture" in the
above table gives the unit strength of the species
and is a measure of the maximum load required to
work the timber to destruction. The column headed
"Modulus of Elasticity" gives the unit measure of
the stiffness of the wood.
This is a publication of merit which should serve
an excellent purpose in standardizing the struc-
tural timbers of the country. It can be obtained
upon request to any of the offices of the Govern-
ment Forest Service or to the Public Printer at
Washington, D. C.
