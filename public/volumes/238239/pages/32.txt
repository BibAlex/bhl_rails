THE SOUTHERN LUMBERMAN
particulars Furniture is moved from place to place j s that the wood must be fairly light, moderately a facsimile of the casting to be molded. It is
and is not designed for any particular room or c h e ap/not too dark in color, and it must produce
space. Fixtures are intended to remain in the posi- elastic excelsior. The article has uses other than
tions where the maker places them, and they can- &g packing mate rial. Upholsterers make mattresses,
not be moved without more or less injury. They are
divided into three classes, based on the uses in-
tended office, store and bar. Office fixtures in-
clude desks and tables built in certain spaces and
intended to be left there; partitions between differ-
ern parts of the same room, and benches and seats
which are made fast to the walls or the floor. Bar
fixtures consist of racks and cabinets for glasses,
frames in which to exhibit commodities for sale,
and the bar itself. The fixtures for stores in
elude counters, showcases, cabinets, shelves and
benches and seats made to fit certain places. Banks
use the same class of fixtures as offices. No at-
tempt is here made to name or enumerate all arti-
cles classed as fixtures. That would not be pos-
sible, for special kinds and odd articles are con-
stantly demanded. Sometimes the line separating
fixtures from furniture cannot be exactly defined,
nor the separating line between fixtures and finish :
but after due allowance is made for exceptions the
fixture industry is adequately defined in its scope.
No other industry in Tennessee buys wood of so
high average price. The material is expensive be-
cause much of it is of high class and must be
had in large sizes. Cabinets and counter tops
require broad panels, and they are expensive. If
extra wide, they are built up, usually of several ply
veneer. An examination of Table 18 reveals the
fact that a number of woods which are cheap in
other industries are costly in this. That is due to
high grade and large prices. Sycamore is $30, white
ash over $40, red oak, $42, white oak still higher
and so on. The cheapest is shortleaf pine. The
whole quantity of that wood listed was used by a
single manufacturer who was able to buy it cheap.
Fixture manufacturers in Kentucky pay an average
price of $26.20 for their wood; it costs $34.52 in
North Carolina. $41.44 in Illinois, $40.40 in Mary-
land, $44.12 in Wisconsin, and $38.28 in Tennessee.
It should be borne in mind in this instance as in
so many others that a mere ratio between prices
for woods employed in a given industry in a num-
ber of states is not always a safe ground for the
conclusion that the material is cheaper or dearer
in one state than in another. A difference in price
for a certain wood may be due to difference in
grade; or a large amount of a costly wood in-
creases the general average of all; or one cheap
wood in large quantity lowers the general average
of all. Mahogany in Table 18 cost $155 a thousand,
and 80,000 feet were reported. Suppose it had been
800.000 instead of 80,000. The average cost of all
woods reported for the industry would be raised
above $75 a thousand.
The woods in Table 18 which were largely em-
ployed as cores or backing for veneers or as in-
side frames or shelves are red gum, shortleaf pine
chestnut and black gum. The others possess figure,
grain or color fitting them for outside places.
cushions and filling for seats and backs of parlor
furniture of it; but the amount going into commodi-
ties of that kind is much smaller than that em-
ployed for packing. Excelsior, even of the finest
grades, is not in the same class with hair of Spanish
moss for upholstery. It is packed in bales like hay
and is sold by weight. It is not usually shipped far
from the place of manufacture, but each industrial
buried in damp sand which is tamped about it. The
pattern is then removed in a way provided for,
and the hollow space, the shape of the pattern, re-
mains. The metal is poured in and the casting is
formed. The flask is the box which holds the sand
into which the casting is run. High-class wood is
not essential for flask making as it is for patterns.
The foundry is not the only user of patterns. They
are necessary in shops of many kinds, and a cer-
tain class of patterns are called models.
Most of the sycamore and some of the maple in
the miscellaneous table were converted into butcher

Miscellaneous.
Much wood is used for manufacturing purposes
in Tennessee which does not go to any of the in-
dustries represented in Tables 2 to 19 inclusive.
It is made into various articles, so different in char-
acter and purpose that they cannot be logically
grouped in amounts large enough to be properly
called industries. All such are represented in Table
20 as "Miscellaneous." Eighteen woods are In-
cluded, all of them American, and all but one long-
leaf pine native of Tennessee. It is not practica-
ble to list all the kinds of articles made from the
woods shown in the miscellaneous table; but some
of the most important follow.
iSome of the black walnut is bought by manufac-
turers of firearms, and is made into gunstocks and
pistol grips. This has always been the leading gun-
stock wood of Tennessee, as well as of the country
generally, and it holds the place in spite of ad-
vancing price. It does not appear, however, that the
price paid for the walnut in Table 20 was very high.
In former times a good many gunstocks were made
in Tennessee which never saw a factory. They
were cut out by hand for old-fashioned rifles, and
were usually of maple. At the present day a few
gunstocks are so made in the state, though no report
of them was compiled in a way to render the data
available for Table 20. Yellow wood (Cladrastis
lutea) is used. This wood is known also as yellow
ash, yellow locust and gopher wood. It takes a
good polish and is serviceable.
White pine is the best wood for patterns because
it cuts easily and holds its shape well, provided it
has been thoroughly seasoned. Choice pattern

Excelsior.
The low average cost of wood bought by excelsior
manufacturers is due to purchase in log form. Logs
smaller than ordinary saw timber are suitable; but
there, should not be too many knots. Excelsior is
nothing more than narrow shavings cut by ma-
chinery adapted to that purpose; and if these shav-
ings are broken into short lengths, as is likely to
be the case if the wood is knotty, the product be-
comes little better than sawdust, and, of course,
depreciates in value. The principal use for it is
packing breakable articles of merchandise for ship-
ping. If the excelsior is not soft, yielding and some
what elastic as a mass, its worth is reduced. The
machines that make it are equipped with knife-
like points for slitting the bolt of wood length-
wise, and another blade that shaves off tha scored
surface and makes the narrow, thin ribbons of wood
constituting the manufactured article. There are
different qualities, depending upon the fineness of
the ribbons and the quality of the wood used as raw
material. Yellow poplar is the leading wood for
this industry in Tennessee, and costs $9.58 per
thousand feet; in Wisconsin the principal excelsior
wood is aspen and costs $11.37; in North Carolina
white pine and yellow poplar are reported in equal
p-nounts. the former costing $6.34, the latter $10.
Most regions have one or more available woods;
some have many. The most essential requirement

woods come from old trees such as are seldom found
in forests now. Material of that class is often called
pumpkin pine or cork pine. Foundries use some
of the best obtainable wood for patterns. Other
species have taken the place of white pine for cer-
tain kinds of patterns; cypress is one and sugar
pine of California is another, but neither of them
was reported by pattern makers in Tennessee.
Foundry flasks go with patterns. The pattern is
$ 9.02
blocks. The old-style block, which was simply a
piece of a log the proper length and stood on
end, is not holding the ground it once had. Health
boards and sanitary committees have discouraged
its use on the ground that it is not conducive to
health. The piece of a log checks and the opening
cracks form lodging places for bacteria and other
impurities where the scrubbing brush cannot reach
them. The built-up meat block is less objection-
able because it checks less. Thoroughly seasoned
pieces are fitted together and held with dowels and
glue. Blocks of that sort wear as well as the one-
piece kind and are replacing them.
Some of the hickory in the table was converted
into skewers, a meat shop article, consisting of a
small peg for preparing certain cuts of meat for
the pot or oven.
A number of woods figure in the manufacture of
play-ground equipments which are rapidly gaining
in favor in all parts of the country. Among the
articles are swings, slides, teeter boards, flying
Dutchmen, toboggans and the like.
Brooms are listed among the miscellaneous man-
ufactures. The handle is the only wooden part of
most brooms. The search for suitable wood tor
broom handles is active. At one period in broom-
making history in this country it was desirable
that the handles be of light material such as bass-
wood and yellow poplar; or. at any rate, woods were
not discriminated against because they were light
in weight. The advance in recent years in the
price of broomcorn has caused manufacturers to
look with more favor on heavy woods for handles.
Brooms at wholesale are sold by weight, and if
the handle is heavy a little less broomcorn may be
used without resulting in an underweisht broom.
Handles are of beech, birch and maple, with smaller
lots of other woods. In some Southern States gum
and magnolia have been successfully tried.
The manufacturers of pumps draw for supplies
upon the woods listed in Table 20. The sucker rods
are of ash and hickory; the handles of beech,
maple, hickory or ash: and the logs yellow poplar,
maple and basswood. The well sweep of early times
and the old oaken and cedar buckets that hung in
the wells are passing away and the pump is taking
their place, but the change is by no means complete
in Tennessee. Though the manufacture of pumps
has reached respectable proportions, the bucket
and sweep linger among the hills and valleys.
Laundry methods and appliances are likewise
undergoing change, and a considerable part of the
wood listed in the miscellaneous table is converted
into washing machines, stationary tubs, wringers,
dryers and other modern conveniences which are
driving from use the old-time back-breaking tubs
made by sawing whiskey barrels in two. The old
tub and its worthy mate, the home-made rubbing
board, have not disappeared, nor will they soon
disappear entirely; but machinery to run by steam
or some other power than muscle has entered the
field and has lifted from feminine shoulders part of
the burden that has oppressed since the days when
