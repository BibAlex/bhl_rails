are not unusual, and some attain three or four
times that size.
SASSAFRAS Probably the principal value of
sassafras in the future will be for oil and not.
lumber. The oil is manufactured from the wood
and bark, chiefly from the roots, and is used to
perfume soap. It has long been so used, but of
late years synthetic oils, of which one of the in-
gredients is camphor, have somewhat lessened the
demand for sassafras oil. The whole reported out-
put of sassafras lumber in 1909, according to census
returns, was only 24,000 feet, and yet Tennessee
alone last year used fourteen times that much in
its factories. If the wood were more abundant, it
would be a valuable commodity, for it is of good
color, attractive grain, and is hard, strong and
durable. Its tendency to season without checking
was recognized generations ago by early settlers
who for that reason selected it for dugout canoes
on the Mississippi River and elsewhere. It is of
historical interest that sassafras was once (for a
brief period) the most valuable wood in the United
States, due to a belief that it was a cure-all for
diseases. Sassafras is in no danger of becoming
extinct. It spreads so rapidly into open ground
that in some localities it becomes a nuisance; but
large trees, suitable for lumber, are apt to become
scarcer than they now are.
BUCKEYE This wood is of considerable im-
portance in Tennessee and manufacturers last year
used nearly 3,000,000 feet of it, which was almost
one-fourth of the entire cut of the wood in the
United States. Three species of buckeye are cut
in Tennessee, Ohio buckeye (Aesculus glabra), yel-
low buckeye (Aesculus octandra), and purple buck-
eye (Aesculus octandra hybrida). The yellow buck-
eye is niost abundant and of largest size. The box-
makers, trunkmakers and ' coffin manufacturers
used nearly all the buckeye reported in Tennessee,
and practically all of it was state grown. It is
especially valued by manufacturers of candies and
chocolates. The seasoned wood is white, clean
and odorless, and when made into boxes imports
no taint to articles of food. When green it is one
of the softest woods, but it hardens and toughem
as it becomes dry. It is among the lightest of the
broad leaf trees, lighter even than basswood, which
in some respects it closely resembles.
MAHOGANY This is a foreign wood and comes
from Mexico, the West Indies and other parts of
tropical America. Other woods commercially
known as mahogany are brought from Africa. Next
to osage orange, mahoc-iny is the most costly
wood reported by manufacturers in Tennessee.
Sixty thousand of the 183,000 feet reported was
the African species (Khaya senegalensis).
CHESTNUT Tennessee ranked fifth among the
chestnut producing states in 1909, with a cut of
58.000,000 feet. That was four times as much as
its factories worked into commodities, and it shows
that the state is sending most of its chestnut be-
yond its borders. In fact, nearly two-thirds of what
was used in the state was imported. Home-grown
chestnut was sold out of the state, while Tennessee
factories were sending away from home for what
they needed. Chestnut is perhaps the most im-
portant wood of this country for coffins and cas-
kets, and it goes to large cities where these com
modifies are manufactured on an extensive scale.
The owners of chestnut timber are concerned lest
.a blight affecting the species in some of the
Northeastern States shall spread into other regions.
OSAGE ORANGE Only 8,000 feet of the wood
was used last year in Tennessee, but it cost more
per thousand than any other. It came wholly from
Texas and Oklahoma, which is its natural range.
It has been planted for hedges and ornament In
nearly every state, and is known by many names.
In Tennessee some call it osage apple tree, and
others yellow wood. The last is the proper name
of another Tennessee wood (Cledrastis lutea).
which is not closely related to the osage orange.
Manufacturers of wagons use all the osage re-
ported. It is a very hard wood and shrinks and
swells little under climatic changes. The very high
price is accounted for by the fact that it was
already manufactured into felloes when received
at the wagon factories.
BASSWOOD Tennessee finished 8,500.000 feet
of basswood in 1910. That was three million feet
under the reported output of the preceding year.
There has been a general decline during the past
five years in the cut of this wood in the United
States. In Tennessee it is occasionally called linn
and black limetree. Two or more species are cut
in the state, but they are considered one by most
lumbermen. The white basswood (Tillia heter-
ophylla) is often known in Tennessee as large-
leaved limetree, or linn.
CUCUMBER This wood resembles basswood,
but if leaves and fruit are observed, it is not likely
to be mistaken for basswood or any other tree.
It is scarce and not very important. In early times
it was much sought for by pioneers who hewed
dough trays and woodenware from solid blocks
but that use has passed away and it now goes
to mills to be made into doors and other mill
work. The tree is conspicuous in the forest after
the first severe frost in the autumn, for the leaves
taUe on strange and mottled colors and all come
down within a day or two. As they He on the
ground they resemble, in color, a heap of owl feath-
ers. This may be classed as one of the trees that
will disappear with the cutting of the original for-
ests; for no one will plant it except as a curiosity
and a relic in parks. It is named for its fruit,
two or three inches long. When green, the fruit
resembles a stunted, misshapen cucumber, but
when ripe it is bright scarlet. It yields abundance
of seeds and ought to reproduce vigorously, but
it does not appear to do so. Trees are found only
here and there scatered through forests of other
woods.
BEECH Tennessee produces three times as
much beech as its factories use. Only one species
of beech grows in the United States, except in
parks where others have been planted. A tree
bearing some resemblance to it is known as blue
beech (Carpinus caroliniana). Though the blue
beech was not reported by any manufacturer in
Tennessee, it is probably used in a small way for
handles and for other purposes. The common
beech has been classed as a food tree for cen-
turies; and in some parts of this country the
nuts constitute an article of diet, but in Tennessee
they are valuable only as mast for hogs.
Planing Mill Products.
This is the largest wood-using industry in Ten-
nessee, and the chief commodities manufactured
are flooring, ceiling and siding. These products
are made and are offered for sale in the gen^
eral market, it not being essential that they be of
cypress and sassafras In the table was procured
in the state.
Packing Boxes and Crates.
This is the second largest wood-using industry in
Tennessee. In some other states it is the largest.
Since this product is employed in shipping mer-
chandise and the commodities of truck patch and
garden to market, the quantity of such boxes and
crates made in a state is a fair index to the state's
position as a manufacturing district. Tennessee
ranks high, though not as high as some of the
states north of it. This business in Kentucky
demands 109,000,000 feet of lumber, Wisconsin
119,000,000, Maryland 136,000,000, and Illinois 372,-
000,000. No satisfactory reason has been found
why Tennessee with its abundance of cheap wood
should pay a higher average price for box material
than is paid by any of the states named. Box-
makers in Wisconsin buy theirs for $13.09, in Mary-
land for $13.31, in Illinois for $15.31, in Kentucky
for $15.36, while in Tennessee the average for the
whole state is $16.26. Cottonwood is Tennessee's
leading box material, and it is high in price. It
possesses almost every requisite for a good box.
It is strong, tough, hard to split, holds nails well,
has no disagreeable odor or colored sap that will
stain the contents. It is white in color, which is
a quality greatly desired by certain shippers who
wish to stencil their advertisements on the pack-
ages. The wood suits so njany other purposes that
box-makers must bid high for it or it will not come
to them. That they get it in spite of cost and in
amounts larger than any other wood, is the best-

special sizes and patterns. The planing machines
which turn them out are generally adjuncts of the
saw mills that cut the lumber. Red oak, which
doubtless includes a number of species under that
name, heads, for quantity, the list of thirty-one
species. The rather large amount of black walnut
in this industry is unexpected, since the wood is
never used as siding and seldom as flooring except
for parquetry which is not included in Table 2.
Black walnut's low price may be accounted for by
assuming that the material was purchased in the
log. The cost of white pine is lower than would be
expected for grades acceptable at a planing mill.
The 'Massachusetts box-makers pay that much for
what passes through their hands. Mahogany's
price is rather low, but the prevailing grades may
account for it. Thirty-one species in all is a good
showing when it is considered that twenty-nine of
them grow in Tennessee, though no part of the
evidence that it is looked upon as the box material
par excellence of Tennessee.
Red gum, yellow poplar and shortleaf pine are
extensively demanded for boxes and possess most
of the essential features required. Medium weight
is one requisite that should not be overlooked.
Though a few pounds more for a single box might
be a smalt thing to consider, it is not small if
hundreds or thousands of boxes are shipped by
freight, and the weight would be still more im-
portant were shipments to go by express. Buck-
eye and basswood. both present in large amounts
in Table 3, are light in weight. They are likewise
light in color which puts them, as far as stenciling
qualities are concerned, in the class with cotton-
wood. It is worthy of note that these two woods
which are nearest to cottonwood in color are near-
est to it in cost. Except cottonwood, they are the
costliest in Table 3.
