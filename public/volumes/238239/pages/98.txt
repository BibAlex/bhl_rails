One hundred and twenty-nine woods were found
in use in Texas for manufacturing purposes. Four
were foreign, and all the others grow in the United
States, and all but ten in Texas. The State, there-
fore, 'has 115 species of trees that are in commercial
use. Some are used in a very small way at present,
and there are a few others fit for use, but in the
course of this investigation they were not found in
actual use and for that reason are not included in
Table I
The forty-eight species reported by manufactur-
ers follow:
Basswood. The manufacturers in Texas use little
basswood, and none of it is cut in the State, though
an occasional tree is found near the eastern border.
It is one of the whitest, cleanest woods of the. for-
ests, and high price alone stands in the way of its
use for boxes in which to ship food products, and
for woodenware of many kinds.
Beech. Although the natural range of beech ex-
tends as far west in Texas as the Trinity River, it
does not appear that any of this wood reported by
wood workers in the State was home grown. An
average price of $60 a thousand is unusually high
for this wood, for it is not generally expensive.
That cost is explained by the fact that the amount
used was small, and was of the highest grade.
Beech never has "been an important tree in Texas
forests, and it is not likely that it ever will be. It
grows slowly, demands ideal forest conditions to
develop good wood, and the 'best of it is not well
liked except for a few purposes. None of that re-
ported in Table I grew in Texas.
Birch. At least three kinds of birch are used in
Texas, but only one grows there the river "birch.
The yellow and sweet birches come from the north-
ern and northeastern States, and are the species gen-
erally employed by furniture makers and the manu-
facturers of high-class articles of wood. The two go
to market as one in the Lake States, though the
trees are easy to tell apart as they grow in
the woods. River birch has a wider range than the
others, but is best developed south and east of the
Ohio River. Its wood lacks figure and color, and
unless artificially treated it is used only where a
very plain material will answer. It takes stain well
and may be colored and finished as a satisfactory
imitation of mahogany. The tree may be recog-
nized along water courses by its rough, ragged bark,
which often hangs in shreds and tatters.
Black Cherry. This tree is scarce in Texas,
though it is found in both the eastern parts and in
the western mountains. It is small, and only an oc-
casional log finds its way to the sawmills. Most
of the small quantity used by manufacturers in the
State comes from outside regions. The highest de-
velopment of the species is found in the mountains
of Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
Black Gum. Sometimes tupelo in Texas is called
black gum, and it is probable that some listed in
Table I as 'black gum was tupelo. It is certain,
however, that the cut of -black gum in the State is
considerable. Its 'bark is the roughest and blackest
of the gum woods hence, its name, If the bark is
considered, there is little likelihood that this tree
will be mistaken for any other except persimmon,
to which it bears some resemblance. The wood is
tough and difficult to split. It has no figure and is
one of the plainest woods in the country. It pol-
ishes well, and panels made of it bear a little re-
semblance to plain maple, or the sapwood of yellow
poplar.
Black Walnut. The natural range of black wal-
nut covers northeastern Texas, and a little is cut
each year, but the wood is not important as a re-
source of the State. Five mills reported it for the
census returns of 1910. It is a long-lasting and a
beautiful wood, and has been in use in Texas since
the earliest settlement. Two hewed beams in the
Alamo at San Antonio were found in a sound condi-
tion in 1912 when the work of restoring the old
building was under way. It could not be ascer-
tained with certainty at what date the 'beams were'
placed in the walls, but certainly very early, and a
service of about 195 years was claimed for them.
Decay had produced no visible effect, and a fresh
cut in the wood released the characteristic walnut
oder. Black walnut is usually regarded as the
highest-priced native wood of the United States.
The 'best comes from old trees with heartwood solid
and black. Young walnut produces little valuable
lumber, and for that reason plantations will be a
long time in attaining size fitting them for market.
When the tree is young most of the trunk is white
sapwood, which is undesirable.
Black Willow. This has not generally been con-
sidered other than a minor species in this country,
yet in some localities it fills an important place.
The amount used in Texas is not very large, but an
of it grows in the State. It is a cheap wood, and as
it will not pay the freight charges on long ship-
ments it is apt to be used in the region where it
grows ,or not at all. Wet lands, but not too swampy,
