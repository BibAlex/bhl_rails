THE ST. LOUIS LUMBERMAN.
metal, but only cheap trunks arc now made that
way.
The trays and other compartments for a trunk are
not subject to strain like the outer box is, and they
may be of thin boards, covered with cloth or pa-
per, but even there a preference is shown for built-
up veneers. White pine is liked for the inside equip-
ment of trunks because it is light, but other woods
are used. When cheap trunks are made in the old
way by nailing boards together, short-leaf pine is
frequently selected. The white elm reported Is
practically all worked into slats. Its toughness
fits it for that use. Veneer is made of cottonwood,
red gum, sycamore, soft maple, white oak, red oak
and white ash. The basswood and cypress appear-
ing in the table are worked into trays and other
compartments of trunks and the wooden parts of
suit cases and valises.
Some of the trunk makers have little wood-work-
ing machinery, but buy the veneer, slats and other
wooden parts cut to proper size and ready to as-
semble.
Excelsior.
Excelsior consists of fine, narrow shavings cut
by machinery made for that particular purpose. The
woods of which it is made are selected with a view
to their fitness. The somewhat general belief that
nearly any wood will make good excelsior is erro-
neous. The product is not made from odds and ends
of waste to be gathered about mills and factories nor
from species selected at random. The wood must
be tough and stringy. The fine ribbons must not
break easily and pull apart or the excelsior will lose
its softness and elasticity and possess little value,
to Missouri only three species were reported in this
industry basswood, cottonwood and black willow
and nearly 90 per cent was cottonwood, but in cer-
tain other parts of the country several other species
are manufactured into excelsior. The bolts em-
ployed in excelsior making are 18 inches long and
about six inches thick, and they must be fairly free
from knots and other defects. Machines with cut-
ting points and plane-like knives slice the excelsior
iu thread-like ribbons 18 inches long. With suitable
wood these ribbons do not break badly. If the wood
Is not stringy, however, the excelsior is easily re-
duced to a state resembling sawdust and becomes al-
most valueless.
It is commonly supposed that most excelsior
serves for upholstery purposes, but such is not the
case. Five or 10 per cent of the output may be so
used, but very much more is demanded for packing
dishes, glassware, hardware and general merchan-
dise, and some for filtering. It is not usually
shipped far from the region where it is manu-
factured, for the mills are numerous that make it
and each seeks to supply local markets. It is
packed for shipment into bales like hay and is sold
by weight or by the bale.
Waste is moderate in the manufacture of excel-
sior and results chiefly from the rejection of knots
and defects and from the loss of the small slab or
spall by which the dogs hold the bolt during the
operation of slitting and slicing the excelsior. Even
that small piece is occasionally utilized by working
it into plugs three and one-fourth inches in diam-
eter. These plugs are bought by manufacturers of
roofing papers and are inserted in the cylindrical
hollow space in the ends of paper rolls. It is cus-
tomary in shipping such paper to customers to pack
certain accessories, such as paint, brush and nails
in the center of the roll, and the plugs are forced in
each opening and a safe shipping cavity is thus pro-
vided.
The average price paid for wood demanded by the
excelsior industry is lower than in any other wood-
using industry of Missouri. Its cheapness is partly
due to the fact that it passes directly from the for-
est to the factory wthout going to a sawmill for a
preliminary step in its manufacture. This would
not be the case if excelsior were made from sawed
lumber instead of bolts.
EXCELSIOR.
of the dolly, which is that portion of the washing
machine that encounters most friction. It does not
appear that many clothespins are made in Missouri.
That would not naturally be expected if the wood
for making them must be imported. Clothespins
are usually manufactured near the source of wood
supply. Ironing boards demand a smooth wood for
the board, on which the clothes are worked, but the
frame may be of nearly any species that it strong
and light. Basswood and cottonwood are ideal for
the smoothing board and tupelo serves well for the
frames. The rollers of the mangles are of sugar ma-
ple. A hard, firm wood is demanded. Drying frames
of western red cedar are light and serviceable.
Washboards are made in large numbers in spite of
the increased use in recent years of washing ma-
chines. The washtub and the washboard are going
out of use to some extent, but they do not seem to
be going out of existence. They cannot be dispensed
with in taking care of certain odds and ends of the
family washing, though the hardest part of the work
may be done with machines operated by electric
power or water motors. The manufacturers of wash-
boards insist on white wood for the small piece on
which the name is stenciled, and cottonwood and
basswood are preferred. Woods of darker color are
satisfactory for the rest of the article.
LAUNDRY APPLIANCES.
in stores) sugar maple, sweet birch, and even ma-
hogany, are employed. The stepladder is sometimes
considered related to furniture and finish, particu-
larly store finish, and is made of woods to match.
Otherwise, costly woods are not demanded.
As far as information was supplied by manufac-
turers, every barber pole made in Missouri in 1910
was of sycamore.
A large part of the product included in the wood-
enware and novelty industry consists of various
kinds of boards, such as shoemakers' and saddlers'
cutting boards, bread boards, meat boards, the
boards which textile mills use in the centers of bolts
of cloth, and the boards employed by cigar makers
and tobacconists. Most of these are of cottonwood.
It is clean, soft and white. A few are of cypress,
silver maple and white pine. Small trays for jewel-
ry, buttons, pins and the like are made of cherry,
yellow poplar, mahogany, white and red oak, sweet
birch and basswood.
The bulk of the woodenware included in Table
XV is for kitchen and pantry, and consists of small
tubs and keelers, bowls, platters, rolling pins,
spoons, paddles, vegetable cutters, lemon squeezer* ,
turnip and potato mashers, boxes for salt, pepper
and spices. Pie and picnic plates, cut from veneer,
are manufactured in enormous numbers. This com-

The classes of articles belonging to this industry
are rather difficult to define. Laundry appliances,
vhich in this report are considered to belong to a
separate industry, are often listed as woodenware.
There is a difference of opinion also as to what arti-
cles should be known as novelties. The term is
rather general and includes such articles of wood
as do not seem to belong clearly in some other in-
dustry. Some of the commodities which in this re-
port are classed as woodenware are buckets and
pails, bread and meat boards, butter dishes and but-
ter tubs and other small tubs and stave ware, cloth
boards, cutting boards, various kitchen utensils, lad-
ders, measures picnic plates and all sorts of small
veneer dishes, flag poles, shovels made chiefly of
wood, scoops, show racks, tent poles stakes and tog-
gles. One of the conditions in defining woodenware
is that the articles must be useful. Novelties may
be simply ornamental or their purpose may be to
amuse, however, the idea of usefulness is often pres-
ent. Among commodities which fall in the novelty
class are games, such as chess and checkers, doilies
made of wood, gavels, match boxes' and many other
small boxes for hairpins, buttons, jewelry and the
like; paper weights, paper knives, and many kinds
of small turnings and carvings.
In manufacturing the commodities included in the
statistics shown in Table XV fourteen woods are
used, three of which cypress, shortleaf and white
pine are soft woods. More than half of all is short-
leaf pine, but practically none of it comes from the
forests of Missouri. In fact, comparatively little
of any of the wood comes from the State, although
eleven of the fourteen grow in commercial quanti-
ties in Missouri. In the manufacture of long lad-
ders use is made of longleaf pine from Mississippi
and Louisiana, shortleaf pine from Arkansas, with
hickory and white and red oak for rungs; and in
making stepladders and for rolling ladders ( used

Manufacturers of laundry appliances in Missouri
demand nearly four million feet of wood annually
and not one foot of it comes from the forests of the
State, yet eight of the ten species employed grow
in Missouri and in commercial quantities, and West-
ern red cedar is the only one not found in the State
at all. Tupelo is the cheapest and sugar maple the
most expensive of the woods which figure in the in-
dustry. About one-third of all is cypress.
Laundry appliances include many arti^s. Amont;
them are wash tubs, washing machines, wash boards,
ironing boards, drying racks, clothespins, flatiron
handles, mangles, wringers and others. Experience
has shown one or more woods specially suited to
each of these articles. Tubs and washers must re-
sist wear while in a wet condition and must be
proof against leakage. Cypress meets these require-
ments well. White ash is generally used for parts
WOODENWARE AND NOVELTIES.
modity, which is intended to be used once and then
thrown away, should not be confused with plates
and platters produced on the lathe and intended as
a permanent part of the pantry's or sideboard's
equipment. Such articles are often ornamented
with carvings and not infrequently are of costly
woods. Large hewed or turned trays are in general
demand for mixing dough or preparing salads in the
pantry. The best woods for such utensils are yellow
poplar, basswood and sycamore. They are soft and
can be easily cut with tools, they do not check bad-
ly under the influence of seasoning, the color is sat-
isfactory and they contain no acids to taint articles
of food.
Agricultural Implements.
The manufacture of agricultural implements in
Missouri is not as large an industry as might be ex-
pected from a consideration of the State's extensive
land resources. It is probable that other States
supply a portion of the demand for farm machinery
in Missouri, but on this subject there exists no sta-
tistics to show exactly what the demand is, though
Table XVI gives the home supply, the amount of
wood used and the cost. It shows, further, that 92
per cent of the wood demanded by manufacturers of
agricultural implements is brought into the State
from surrounding regions, though Missouri produces
all the species listed except three. That demanded
in largest amount, longleaf pine, does not grow in
the State and must, of necessity, be imported. This
wood supplies more than the combined eleven other
species which are listed in the table, and it is, there-
fore, the most important wood in this industry. It
is almost an ideal material for the manufacture of
farm implements. It wants toughness and this dis-
qualifies it from certain purposes, but it lacks little
else required in the business. It is very strong and
very stiff, and is well fitted for frames of machines.
About the only complaint against it is that in some
situations the heads of bolts pull into and through
the wood if the strain is great and oscillation con-
stant. This is apt to occur if longleaf pine is em-
ployed for frames of hay presses, cider mills and
cornshellers, but that objection is removed by fit-
ting the bolts with large heads and washers. If this
objection holds for longleaf pine, it holds yet more
for shortleaf and other pines, which are softer. So
extensively are longleaf and shortleaf pine employed
in this industry that it is not necessary to specify
particular places where greatest importance is seen:
generally they go into frames, but hoppers and
