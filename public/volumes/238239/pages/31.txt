chine, thresher, plow and cultivator are imple-

About half of all the wood reported was white
oak, which includes a number of species. This
wood possesses most of the properties demanded
in this industry, the chief one being strength and
the next hardness. Where hardness alone will suf-
fice, beech answers well. It is suited for slides
where one part of the machine must work back and
forth, the surfaces sliding upon each other. The
high cost of the beech in Table 14 indicates that
the best grades were in demand. The wood is
liked well for the felloes of very heavy wheels.
Red oak and chestnut oak are utilized for strong
frames. A large amount of yellow poplar appears,
and much of it was made into hoppers, seed boxes,
chutes, drawers and compartments in fanning mills,
cleaners, drills and threshers. The shortleaf pine
was used for the same purposes. It might be ex-
pected that ash would appear in this industry, and
its qualities make it suitable for many purposes;
but it is identified with the tool industry rather than
wth the manufacture of implements. If such tools
as pitchforks, rakes, hoes, shovels and scythes were
included in Table 14, ash would appear in large
amounts, for it is the usual handle wood for such
tools.
The manufacturer of agricultural implements is
not yet as important in Tennessee as in some
other states, but the abundance of raw material in
the region and the accessibility of many markets
justify the prediction that before many years Ten-
nessee will attain a high place among the states in
the manufacture of machinery for the farms. The
fertility of the land, the diversified surface which
calls for crops of various kinds and the mildness
of the climate and abundance of rainfall assure
great and permanent prosperity for Tennessee farm-
ers. They will buy more farm implements in the
future than in the past, for scientific methods are
replacing the poor makeshifts of yesterday. Up-to-
date farming calls for better machines and more of
them.- The forests of Tennessee contain an
abundance of the woods needed in that line of man-
ufacture, and the people have made a beginning
in putting it to use. It is only a beginning, how-
ever. Tennessee ships twice as much implement
wood to Illinois, there to be manufactured, as is
worked up at home; and in many instances the fin-
ished machines are shipped to the region where the
woods grew and are sold there. Full development
of home resources will demand the manufacture of
this wood at home. The state may become a man-
ufacturing center along that line, instead of a feeder
for other manufacturing centers. A comparison of
what Tennessee is doing and what some of its
neighboring states are doing is worth consideration.
The state annually uses 2,890,000 feet of wood in
producing agricultural implements, and pays an
average of $22.58 per thousand for it. North Caro-
lina uses 3.391,000 feet and pays $11.95; Kentucky,
6,610.000 feet at a cost of $32.54; while Illinois,
which has a comparatively small supply of home-
grown wood and buys from other states 99.9 per
cent of what it makes into implements, uses 103,-
649,000 feet, and pays $34.54 a thousand for it.
due to its purchase in the log or bolt form. The
average value of hickory lumber in the mill yards
of Tennessee in 1909, which are the latest available
figures, was $37.13, more than double the cost of
the wood as listed in Table 15. Though in 1909 and
again in 1910 Tennessee led all the other states
in the quantity of hickory lumber produced, yet the
makers of athletic goods in the state are sending
outside for 98 per cent of their supply of this wood.
The reason for it is that some of the largest users
are near the state line, and it happens that the most
convenient supply of the wood is across the border.

cut dogwood in small lots and haul it to the towns
where it is sold to dealers who in turn ship and
sell to manufacturers when the collection amounts
to a carload or more. The getting together of the
wood in this manner is usually done hy negroes who
are willing to handle small quantities and are con-
tent with moderate returns. Often a few sticks,
maybe only two or three, are carried to town in
small wagons along with farm articles for sale.
This custom prevails also in Southern States other
than Tennessee. It is not possible to obtain sta-
tistics of amounts so many and small, except in

Shuttles, Spools and Bobbins.
The three classes of commodities heading Table
16 are usually grouped as one industry because
they are purchased by factories which spin and
weave; but as far as Tennessee is concerned, shut-
tles constitute nearly the whole output of the in-
dustry. Two woods are employed, dogwood and
persimmon. These have long been considered the
best available material in this country for shut-
tles, though search for others has been wide and
thorough since the advance in cost of Turkish box-
wood took it from the American shuttlewoojl mar-
ket. Dogwood and persimmon possess all the de-
sired properties, though some of them in a less
degree than boxwood. But when the Tennessee
woods can be bought at less than three cents a
foot, and boxwood costs nearly a dollar a foot,
it is evident that the supply will be met by woods
from Tennessee and surrounding regions. The
the aggregate after they reach the manufacturers.
The table shows that most of the persimmon used
grew outside the state.
Shuttle blocks are about 17 inches long and
somewhat more than two and a quarter inches
square. The blocks from which golf stick heads
are made are not as long, but are larger in cross
section. Dogwood and persimmon are used for both
articles. Their hardness and the small liability of
the wood to become abraded are their most im-
portant properties.
Boat and Ship Building.
Without an explanation the heading for this in-
dustry would be misleading because no ships and
few boats are built in Tennessee. This heading is
used for uniformity's sake in all state wood-using
reports such as this, and all material employed in
the industry is listed in the accompanying table.

preceding industry, Table 15, shows the use of per-
simmon for gold heads. The heartwood is re-
jected as it is in shuttle making. The waste of
the dark-colored heart would be complete were it
not so well adapted to other uses. The persimmon
is a species of ebony, and the heart is the portion
which shows the color. It is bought by manufac-
turers of parquet flooring and by some furniture
makers.
The persimmon tree grows to large size and
passes through saw mills like other saw-logs. Sta-
tistics have not "been compiled in a way to show
the quantity of persimmon cut, nor the states which
lead in production. It is known, however, that the
amount is not large, and the persimmon is justly

Table 15 represents, in Tennessee, what is prop
erly termed a one-wood industry. That wood is
hickory. Two others are listed, but they constitute
less than three per cent of the whole. Golf sticks
are the principal commodity. The shaft is hickory
and the head persimmon. No explanation has been
offered why dogwood is absent from Table 15, for
it is one of the best materials for solf heads, and
it is abundant in Tennessee. The head of a golf
club must fulfill exacting requirements. It must
be elastic and of sufficient hardness and toughness
to wear smooth. Some wooc's which possess part
of the requisite qualities lack the essential they
burst under the impact of the blow. That is the
fault of hickory as the head of a golf stick, though
as a shaft it has no equal. The two parts head
and shaft call for different properties, and no
wood, as far as present knowledge goes, possesses
both of them in a high degree. That is why a golf
stick is always of two kinds of wood. English
beech, which differs somewhat from the American
tree, was once the favorite wood for golf heads in
this country as well as abroad; but it has lost its
place to dogwood and persimmon.
More use is made of persimmon's white sapwood
than of the heart which is dark. Shuttlemakers
also want the sapwood. and the combined demand is
met at the expense of the persimmon's dark heart-
wood which must find a market elsewhere.
The white ash listed in Table 15 was bought by
makers of ball bats, The low price of hickory jg
listed among the minor species. It is well known,
also, that the principal supply comes from North
Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas and the regions im-
mediately north and south of those states. The
tree reproduces vigorously and grows with fair
rapidity, hut a long time is required to produce a
trunk large enough to be of much value to the
manufacturer. For that reason, the thickets of
young persimmon trees which have made their ap-
pearance in abandoned fields have not yet contrib-
uted much wood for shuttles, golf stick heads or
parquet flooring. They may influence the market
in years to come.
Dogwood is a more important shuttle wood than
persimmon, but the tree is smaller. A trunk as
much as a foot in diameter and six or eight feet in
length is an exception to the rule. The trunk is
usually nearly all sapwood of light color, the small
core of heartwood being brown. It is not a timber
tree and is never cut as saw-logs for the mills. It
is too small. For that reason it does not figure in
ordinary lumber operations, but is handled in spe-
cial ways. It is customary for country people to
In Tennessee practically all of the wood reported
is white ash, and it is manufactured into oars. The
white oak was used for boat repairs, and the
cypress is so small in quantity as to be negligible
No other wood is equal to ash in the amount going
into oars in the Southern and Middle States, and
the product is sold in all parts of this country and
in some foreign countries. In certain regions ash
comes in competition with other woods for some
kinds of oars. Paddles for canoes are of spruce
oftener than of ash, for spruce is lighter and is
strong enough. The yew tree that grows on the
Pacific Coast might compete successfully with ash
for oars if it were as abundant and accessible.
Table 17 probably does not do Tennessee justice
as an exhibit of its boat building. Large numbers
of skiffs and other small boats are made there and
are found by thousands on the rivers and creeks;
but they are not turned out of large factories and
are not shown in the table. They are the output
of small shops and of individual workmen in all
regions of the- state. The fact that they are so
made is well known, but it has been impossible to
compile figures to be used as statistics. This con-
dition obtains in many regions of the United States.
A wagonload of lumber and a few tools suffice for
manufacturing small boats, and it is done every-
where and no report is made of it. This explana-
tion is made to correct any wrong impression that
might follow from an examination of Table 17. On
the face of it Tennessee makes no boats, yet the
fact is large numbers are made along the rivers of
the state, but not in boat factories. Canoes hewn
from trunks of yellow pop'ar are still occasionally
seen on the rivers, though the high value of this
wood in the market in recent years has diminished
its use for dugouts. Historically yellow poplar has
been the greatest boat wood of Tennessee. Refer-
ence has already teen made to its early use for
canoes in war and peace. That use continued for
a century or more and has not wholly ceased. The
wood was employed in a wasteful manner, for a
trunk measuring from two to four thousand feet
was often hewed into a single canoe; but yellow
poplars of that dimension were plentiful then and
it was right that the people should cut them for
canoes if they needed them.
