little disposition to check and warp. The scrubbing
parts of brushes may consist of bristles from Tur-
key, Russia, China, or from this country; rice root
from Italy, palm from the South, or wooden splints
made in nearly any locality.
The manufacturers of bakers' tools and appliances
use yellow poplar exclusively, because bakers will
take no other. Increase in cost in recent years does
not apear to have lessened the demand for wood in
that industry. The well-known properties of yel-
low poplar, which create and maintain the demand
for it, are whiteness, fineness of grain, small liabil-
ity to check and split, absence of odor and taste and
good wearing qualities. Flour scoops, mixing
troughs, dough boards and rolling pins are some of
the tools and appliances used by bakers. Between
them and certain commodities generally listed as
woodenware the line is not clearly drawn.
The small quantity of wood for gunstocks in Mis-
souri is supplied by black walnut and a little Eng-
lish walnut. The stocks for airguns are included
and they are made exclusively of black walnut, but
the more costly English walnut is worked into pis-
tol grips and the stocks of other firearms. 'Black
walnut is strong for its weight and takes fine finish,
but it is maintained by some that there is no rea-
son, beyond old custom, why it should exclude many
other woods for gunstocks. The preference often
shown for English, French, Italian and Circassian
walnut in the gunstock industry is due to the soft-
ness of colors and the fine figure of the wood. Some
of the choice pieces cost from $5 to $10 for enough
for a single stock. English, French and Italian wal-
nuts are really the same species (Junglans regia)
and it is not native of Europe, but seeds were
brought in (as is supposed) from Persia by the Ro-
mans, and were planted first in Italy and France.
Many woods are called Walnut, which are not re-
lated to it, such as red gum and prima vera. Hick-
ory was formerly known as walnut, being sometimes
distinguished as white walnut in Virginia and the
States north of the Potomac.
The shoe-last industry in Missouri has grown to
considerable importance, and all of the wood comes
from other States. Only two species are reported
sugar maple and basswood. The latter is not made
into lasts, but a related commodity, fillers or forms.
They are inserted in shoes to maintain their shape
when not being worn. "Trees" over which rubber
boots are made are often of basswood and serve as
lasts. Practically all the lasts in this country
are of sugar maple. Other woods, such as beech,
sycamore and persimmon, are often listed as last
material, but in practice they are hardly ever used.
Most of the sugar maple in this industry is cut in
Michigan. Manufacturers say that the grain and
seasoning properties of maple in that region are su-
perior to any other. The wood is split in billets,
generally large enough to make three lasts, is air-
dried two years or more, and then is seasoned sev-
eral months in a kiln. Patterns or models for lasts
are made by hand, but the lasts are made by ma-
chinery. Every change which fashion calls for in
the shape of shoes demands a new set of lasts and
the old becomes useless. An exhibit of the different
shapes of lasts in this country during the past cen-
tury would form a valuable exhibit for a museum.
St. Louis manufactures great numbers of shoes, but
most of tho lasts used there come from outside the
State. An average block from which a last is made
contains a foot and a half of wood, board measure,
and costs about 10 cents. The blo_ck from which a
filler is produced contains half a foot of wood.
The making of advertising signs of wood seems
to belong more to the small shop than the large fac-
tory. It is customary for a carpenter to cut the
board or boards in the desired shape and the village
sign painter letters them. They are seen over the
doors of blacksmith shops, shoe shops and like
places; finger boards at forks of roads, advertise-
ments to be nailed on posts and fences, and the
more pretentious bill boards which are familiar
sights along railroads. When large numbers of
wooden signs are wanted such as sewing machine
manufacturers, soap sellers and cleaning powder
makers employ they are printed by machinery. A
higher class of workmanship is demanded for signs
with raised letters. Kach letter is cut separately
and nailed in place. Redwood from California and
white pine from the Lake States are well liked
for raised letters. They are easily cut and satisfac-'
torily hold their shape. Where signs are to be
painted white pine is well suited because the spirits
of turpentine in the paint afliliates with the sur-
face of the wood. Shortleaf pine is listed for frames
In which muslin si& <j are to be displayed. Cypress
and redwood work tc advantage when extra wide
pieces are desired.
Sucker rods empk "c*. in pumping deep wells
are of hickory and ra rjnd are from 18 to 35 feet
long. The chief deman . comes from oil fields.
Saddle trees, cart trees, stitching horses and
whip stocks are grouped as part of a single indus-
try in Missouri because they are reported together.
The whip stocks are a byproduct of the saddle tree
factory and are made from wood cut out in shap-
ing the saddle tree. The making of hames is a
kindred industry. Woods so employed are white
oak, white ash, white elm and beech. Saddle-tree
woods are sugar maple, silver maple, white elm,
sycamore, white oak, red gum, hackberry, bass-
wood and white ash.
Telephone and telegraph pins are made of white

oak and locust. It is not improbable that several
other oaks contribute to the supply. The chief
requisite is that the material must be strong and
must resist decay.
The heads for rocking horses are made of red
gum, and the rockers of this toy, and likewise of
ahooflies, are made of white elm. The bodies are
principally of cypress.
The value of redwood is insisted upon in the
manufacture of ice-cream refrigerators. Next to
cork the wood is said to be the best obtainable
non-conductor of heat. It is very porous, free from
pitch, easily worked and may be obtained in any
desired dimension.
The makers of blacksmiths' bellows prefer cot-
tonwood for certain parts of the mechanism be-
cause of its lightness, to which is combined suf-
ficient strength to meet requirements.
Stems for tobacco pipes are made of paper birch
from Minnesota. It behaves well in the lathe and
turns easily and finishes with a good surface. It
is liked where accurate cutting is desired because
it does not quickly dull tools. Two hundred thou-
sand feet of this birch were reported for pipe
stems in Missouri.

to these commodities have been collected yearly
by the Bureau of the Census, co-operating with
the Forest Service, and in order to make the report
on Missouri's wood-using industries more complete,
an abridgement of the Census figures is presented
in the following paragraphs. The cut of lumber as
reported by the Census is shown on page 3 of
the report. Certain other forest products are not
elsewhere included and are shown in paragraphs
which follow.
Cooperage.
Cooperage as a whole includes three commodi-
ties staves, heading and hoops. Two classes of
cooperage are recognized, tight and slack. The
former includes barrels and kegs intended to con-
tain liquids; the latter those not meant for liquids.
The principal commodities shipped in tight coop-
erage are oils, alcoholic liquors, molasses, vinegar,
and cider. Alcoholic liquors demand the highest
grade barrels. The wood of which they are made
must be dense or the liquor will leak through the
pores. White oak is one of the most serviceable
materials for barrels of this kind. Some woods too
porous for use in transporting alcohol are satisfac-
tory for molasses and certain oils. Slack cooper-

Summary by Industries of Woods Used in Missouri.
Table XXVI is a summary of all the wood-using
industries in Missouri. It is a counterpart of Table
I, which is a summary by species. Both tables
present the same totals but interpret them in dif-
ferent ways. The first shows how much of each
wood is used, the cost, etc.; the last shows how
much wood of all kinds is demanded by each one
of the 24 industries of Missouri. Fifty-six woods
are listed in Table I and 24 industries in Table
XXVI. In this enumeration "miscellaneous" is
classed as an industry, though it is only a group-
ing of many items. It is numbered 25. The high-
est average price was paid for aeroplane woods,
the lowest for that made into excelsior. The box
and crate industry demanded the largest amount
of wood, aeroplanes the least. Excelsior and valise
makers drew the largest per cent of their material
from the State, and -five drew none laundry ap-
pliances, sporting and athletic goods, patterns,
frames and molding and aeroplanes.
age may be divided into several classes. Paints,
sugar, flour, cement and other powdery commodi-
ties require barrels almost water tight or the con-
tents will sift through; but crockery, potatoes,
fruits and articles of that kind go without loss in
barrels with large openings between the staves.
In 1909 slack cooperage was listed in Missouri
as follows:

Additional Statistics.
The foregoing statistics and discussions are
based on a study of the wood-using industries of
Missouri made by the United States Forest Serv-
ice in 1911. H was explained on a preceeding page
that this study did not include the rough lumber
cut by sawmills unless it was further manufac-
tured, nor the output of shingles, lath, cooperage,
wood-distillation, cross-ties, veneers and telegraph
and telephone poles. However, stastistics relating
