ment land, were withdrawn from sale. They con-
tained 19,000 acres, and it was estimated that 37,000
live oak trees were growing on them. Some effort
was made at practical forestry. Acorns were
planted in vacant spaces, and in other places the
promiscuous undergrowth was cleaned from among
the oaks to give the branches more room to spread
and form 'better crooks from which ship knees
might later be hewed. In 1845 three other live oak
islands in Louisiana were added to the reservation,
and much oak was cut. Such as was not immedi-
ately needed was stored for reserve supply in the
future.
The Civil War brought iron ships, and live oak
was no longer a necessity in ship yards. The Louis-
iana islands which had been reserved, were neg-
lected. Some of the land was cleared by squatters,
and in 1895 all the naval timber reserves in Louis-
iana, Alabama, and Mississippi were opened to
public entry, but some of those in Florida were re-
tained. Large quantities of live oak yet remain, but

Louisiana has 3300 square miles of water. It has
a coast line of 1250 miles, and including the coast
line of islands, the total shore line is 2250 miles.
There are 3771 miles of navigable rivers in the
state, including streams which form portions of its
boundary. At certain times of the year steamboats
reach all but a few of the parishes; and ocean-
going vessels have easy access to a number of
points in the state. Deep harbors, however, are few
in comparison with the long line of coast. The
lakes or -bays which indent the coast, or extend far
inland, are often shallow. The conditions are such
as to invite water communication both between dif-
ferent parts of the state, and between Louisiana
ports and foreign countries.
The boat builders of Louisiana sell their product
locally and in neighboring regions. A large part of
the output is for business rather than for pleasure.
Barges and freight vessels are numerous. The
sales are not confined to the United States, but
reach to Mexico and Cuba. Longleaf pine and white
ash enter into general construction and constitute
the bulk of the timber used. The ash is employed
for braces, 'but a considerable part of the million
feet listed is made into oars and is sold both in and
outside of the state. Most of the loblolly pine is
for barges, the white oak for general work, and the
cypress for door and window frames, and other
finish. Five states are drawn upon for the white
oak Louisiana, Mississippi, West Virginia, Ken-
tucky and Indiana. The small quantity of white
pine is used for patterns, the maple for flooring,
spruce for spars, red cedar for cabinet work, beech
for gearwheel teeth, mahogany for staving for
steam launches, and lignum vitae for sheaves and
bearings. The lignum vitae came from the West
Indies, red cedar from Tennessee, white pine from
Maine and Canada, spruce from Maine, beech from
Mississippi, maple from Michigan and Wisconsin,
loblolly pine from Louisiana and Texas, and mahog-
any from Mexico.
The absence of live oak from the list of woods
demanded by this industry is noteworthy. Its ab-
sence is not due to scarcity of this wood, but to
changes in methods of construction. There was a
time when Louisiana not only supplied much live
oak for shipbuilding at home, but met a large de-
mand from abroad. The United States Government,
during half a century preceding the Civil War, de-
pended upon Louisiana for live oak shipknees for
war vessels. These knees were hewed from that
part of the trunk where large limbs or roots joined
the body of the tree. The Government's search for
live oak for shipbuilding began on the coast of
Georgia before the close of the eighteenth century.
Increased supplies were demanded, and in 1817
Louisiana was turned to for assistance. In that
year several Louisiana islands, which were govern-
not one foot of it is reported used by ship builders
in Louisiana. Seventy-five years ago it would
probably have represented one-half the cost of the
wood in every large ship built in that region.
Both Wisconsin and Maryland use more cypress
for boats than is used in Louisiana. This is due to
the fact that it is a favorite material for pleasure
boats, such as Maryland and Wisconsin build, but
in Louisiana they build barges and ships for busi-
ness purposes, where strength is needed. They find
oak and hard pine best for this, and what cypress is
employed appears as finish. In this, as in many
other instances, the class of the work is the ruling
factor in determining what woods shall be em-
ployed.

high-class woods, and many of them are manu-
factured to order to fit space and to harmonize with
the furniture and finish of the office or room where
they are placed. Fixtures as here considered in-
clude counters, cabinets, shelving, and show cases,
and the like. As in the case of furniture, two
classes of wood are employed, one as inside ma-
terial which Is generally not intended for show,
and the other an outside wood, finished for dis-
play, and usually selected for its pleasing appear-
ance. Louisiana drew woods for this industry from
eight states, but one-half of the total quantity was
home grown. Two foreign woods are 'represented,
Circassian walnut from Turkey, and mahogany from
Mexico. A portion of the magnolia was finished
in imitation of mahogany and was used as such.
White oak was reported from Tennessee, Kentucky,
Indiana, Mississippi, and Louisiana; sweet birch
from Wisconsin; chestnut from North Carolina, and
longleaf pine from Alabama and Louisiana.
Although it is probable that New Orleans alone
uses more fixtures than the whole quantity re-
ported manufactured in the state, yet exports go
to Mexico, Central America, and South America, and
shipments find their way to other states in this
country.
Cypress is employed both as exposed and con-
cealed parts of fixtures, and serves equally well
in both places; sweet birch is made into show case
partitions and into finish; red oak is given place
in show case and cabinet fronts; white oak is pre-
ferred for office partition; chestnut for panels and
coping; magnolia for bar tops; and yellow poplar
as drawers for cabinets.
The waste is small. Mahogany scraps are occa-
sionally sold to automobile factories which make
inlay of them, or to brush makers who can use
very small pieces for backs and handles of certain
patterns of brushes.
No fixture manufacturer bought lumber in the log.
It generally came as rough lumber. Some was in
the form of veneer, and a little was two and three
inches thick, but most of it was undressed lumber
one inch thick. Some low grade stuff is demanded
for hidden interior work, and for crating; but for
the most part the wood is of high grade.
The average price paid for lumber in this industry
was higher than that of any other in the state, and
more than three times the average of all.

MISCELLANEOUS.
The miscellaneous table is made up of various
manufactures which do not belong with those pre-
viously tabulated, and cannot be separated into
classes, of which each one is large enough for a
table. Some woods appear here and not elsewhere
among the state's industries, and no one industry
lists as many woods. Some of those appearing in
this table are used in small quantity. That may
or may not imply that but little of the wood is de-

The quantity of wood demanded in Louisiana by
the manufacturers of store and office fixtures is
surprisingly small, when .it is considered that the
state is the second largest producer of lumber in
the whole country. Fixtures are usually made of
manded in the state. In the case of osage orange,
dogwood, persimmon, catalpa, umbrella wood, and
mulberry, the demand is probably fairly represented
by the figures in the table, while two others, willow
oak and water oak, though the amount of each ap-
