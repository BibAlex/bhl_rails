Sash and Doors
While the woods native to Montana are highly
serviceable for supplying the demand for sash
and doors, and quantities of these are manufac-
tured in the state, a large proportion of the sash
and doors made from Montana woods are made
up in other states. Within the state more than
one and one-half million feet of wood are used
annually in the production of sash and doors.
Western yellow pine locally grown furnishes 54.73
per cent of the total quantity of wood employed by
this industry. Douglas fir supplies 40.74 per cent,
and of the 667,000 feet of this wood used annually
637,000 feet are imported from Western Oregon
and Washington, where the timber is superior In
quality to the local Douglas fir.
Wood suitable for Gash and doors must be fairly
strong, straight grained and clear, and must work
easily with machine and hand tools. The wood
should retain its form permanently after season-
ing without shrinking or warping and in general
should show a pleasing grain when finished.
Where a natural grain finish is desired by stain-
ing, Douglas fir or eastern oak is employed; where
the doors are to be painted or varnished western
yellow pine or western white pine is used.
Western larch is used for sash and doors in
only small amounts, although it is well suited for
the purpose. It is considered equal to Douglas fir
in beai'tv of grain when properly finished.

Fixtures
Eight woods are used for the production of fix-
tures by factories in Montana. Of these, the only
wood grown in the state is western yellow pine.
Only two soft woods are used, Douglas fir and
western yellow pine. Douglas fir supplies 45.45
per cent of all of the wood used annually for fix-
tures, and all of it is obtained from Western
Washington and Oregon.
Eastern oak is imported at an average cost of
$77.11 per thousand feet, delivered at the factory,
and furnishes 29.3 per cent of all of the wood used
for fixtures. Cherry and walnut are used spar-
ingly and are the most expensive woods employed.
These are purchased, mixed, at a price of $130
per thousand feet, delivered at the factory. Pro-
ducers of fixtures in Montana pay $64,151 per year
for their raw material, or an average price of
$47.99 per thousand feet.
Wood used for fixtures is generally more ex-
pensive than woods used for other purposes.
Beauty of grain and finishing properties enhance
the value of fixture woods. Only clear material
of high grade is employed for exposed parts.

tries in the quantity of wood consumed annually.
Only two species contribute to supply this indus-
try and both prow within the state, although quan-
tities of each are imported from other states.
Western white pine is employed principally for
coffin boxes, while western red cedar is used for
coffins. Western white pine furnished 79.8 per
cent of the wood used for this purpose, while
western red cedar supplied 20.2 per cent. The
average cost of woods used for coffins and coffin
boxes in Montana was $18.38 per thousand feet
delivered, and the total cost of all wood used
for this purpose annually within the state was
$2,003.
Wood for coffin boxes must be light in weight,
soft and straight grained and must hold nails
well. In fact, any wood suited to the manufacture
of packing boxes can be used for coffin boxes.
For coffins, however, a higher class wood is gen-
erally employed, and western red cedar supplies
the demand for low grade coffins only. This is
generally covered with cloth after being shaped
in the form of a casket. Its principal recommenda-
tions for this use are its easy working properties,
light weight and durability. This cedar is used
in quantities throughout the Northwest for cas-
kets. White pine is also serviceable for caskets
when the finished box is to be covered with cloth.
High grade caskets made of hardwoods or other
materials are not produced locally.

Cabinets
Four woods are used in Montana for cabinet
work. Cottonwood, the only broad leaf tree em-
ployed, furnishes 62.5 per cent of all of the wood
used for this purpose. This wood is all grown
within the state. The only wood imported by
cabinet makers is Douglas fir, which supplies 2,000
feet, or 5 per cent, of the total consumption. Only
high grade material is employed for cabinet work,
as is indicated by the average price paid in Mon-
tana, which is $37 per thousand feet for all woods.
The industry is not extensive, and it is significant
that no Eastern hardwoods, such as oak, walnut,
cherry, and imported woods, such as mahogany,
are employed. This indicates the somewhat low
grade cabinets produced in the state. High class
products of this nature are imported from regions
affording a better class of wood.
Cabinet woods are generally selected because
of the beauty of their grain when stained, or their
ability to take a smooth finish. They should work
well and retain their form when finished. High
grade clear stock is generally demanded.
In addition to the cabinet woods reported in
Table VI, large amounts of local woods are used
by carpenters and other woodworkers for built-in
cabinet work in stores and houses.

Coffins and Coffin Boxes
The manufacture of coffins and coffin boxes in
Montana ranks fourth among the state's Indus-
Trunks and Cases
While most of the trunks and cases which ulti-
mately reach the consumer in the state of Montana
are imported, nevertheless trunk manufacturers in
the state consume 27,000 board feet of lumber an-
nually. Of the five species employed by trunk
makers in Montana, four are hardwoods. The
only softwood used is western white pine, which
goes into trunk boxes and trays. Elm and chert\\
are used for slats, while Cottonwood, in the form
of three-ply veneer, and bass wood are employed
for boxes and trays.
The requirements of a good box wood are es-
sential for trunk boxes and trunk trays. They
must be light in weight, straight grained and
clear, and must hold nails well. Trunk slats must
be hard and strong and resist abrasion.
Trunk boxes and trays made of white pine
grown in the state consume 74 per cent of all the
wood used by this industry. While all of the
cottonwood used for cabinet work in Montana
was grown within the state, that used by trunk-
makers all came from outside the state.
The average price of woods used for trunks and
cases in Montana was $27.74 per thousand feet.
Basswood at $60 per thousand feet f. o. b. factory
was the most expensive wood used, while white
pine at $22 per thousand feet was the cheapest.
The manufacture of trunks and cases is confined
almost entirely to the cities of Missoula, Butte
and Great Falls.

Furniture
Only 21,000 feet of wood is used annually in
Montana for furniture, and practically all of this
goes into furniture repairs rather than the manu-
facture of new stock. Practically all of the furni-
ture used in the state is manufactured in Eastern
markets.
Only two woods are used for furniture repairs,
Douglas fir and maple. The Douglas fir is ob-
tained from the west coast of Oregon and Wash-
ington, and the maple in Eastern markets. The
first of these supplies 71.4 per cent of the wood
used at an average price of $40 per thousand feet.
The second supplies 28.8 per cent at an average
price of $125 per thousand feet. The wood is ob-
tained as clear stock, as is Indicated- by the high
price.

Wagon Stock
Montana wagon makers use only 10,000 feet of
lumber annually and this is employed entirely in
the production of specific parts for repair work.
Five species of hardwoods supply the entire de-
mand for wagon stock and no softwoods are re-
ported by wagon repairers in the state. Eastern
oak, which is employed in the running gear, for
poles, felloes and single and double trees, supplies
40 per cent of the wood used. For body work on
wagons and automobiles yellow poplar and bass-
wood are employed. These furnish, respectively,
18 per cent and 7 per cent of the total consump-
tion.
All woods used for wagon stock in Montana
are imported from the East at an average cost of
$94.71 per thousand feet delivered. Hickory and
maple are used interchangeably for repairs to the
running gear of wagons. Woods used for wagon
wheels and axles, single and double trees and
poles are selected for their strength, stiffness and
toughness, while woods used for wagon beds, boxes
and the bodies of automobiles and buggies are
generally comparatively soft with good finishing
and working qualities and susceptible to bending.

Miscellaneous
The miscellaneous consumption of wood in the
state is chiefly for veneer, patterns and excelsior.
One hundred and eighty-five thousand feet, board
measure, are manufactured into these three com-
modities annually. Cottonwood, the only local
hardwood used in Montana, supplies practically the
entire demand for veneer and excelsior wood, and
180,000 board feet are used annually for these pur-
poses. White pine used for patterns is grown
outside the state, and the annual consumption
is only 5000 feet. This wood is purchased at an
average price of $40 per thousand feet, delivered
to the consumer.
Cottonwood is quite generally employed through-
out the Northwest for veneer and excelsior. In
fact, for excelsior it is used almost to the ex-
clusion of other species. Cottonwood veneer sup-
plies the berry box and basket trade, and is some-
