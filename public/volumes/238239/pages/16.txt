Secondary Wood-Using Industries.
The industries of Idaho which consume lumber
in the manufacture of their products are small in
number and with but few exceptions consume no
great quantity. All of the industries combined use
only 19,489,800 feet of lumber annually. Of this
amount 85.5 per cent is grown within the state,
and the balance, 14.5 per cent, is imported from
other states to serve the needs of local manu-
facture.
The following is a summary of the wood used
in the state of Idaho, by species, and gives data
which indicates the scope of the development of
industries in the state which consume wood in
the process of manufacture:

the kind of boxes manufactured, but is one inch

The total cost of all "woods used by Idaho in-
dustries annually as shown by Table 1 is $341,901,
based on delivered prices. The average cost is
$17.54 per thousand feet board measure, which
indicates the cheap quality of wood necessary to
sustain the wood-using industries of the state. It
is significant that the principal timber species of
Idaho, western yellow pine, furnishes 73.99 per
cent of all wood used by its industries, while
western white pine, which ranks second in the
importance of the commercial species of the state,
furnished 19.33 per cent. No other wood is used
in appreciable quantities except Douglas fir,
which furnishes 5.33 per cent of the total consump-
tion.
Only thirteen species of wood contribute raw
material for the industries of the state, and it is
significant that less than 1 per cent of the wood
consumed is represented by six species of hard-
woods. Two of these hardwoods are produced
within the state, namely, black cottonwood and
apple wood. Cottonwood itself constitutes about
one-third of the hardwoods utilized.
While western white pine is cut in larse quan-
tities by Idaho sawmills, 43.37 per cent of the
amount reported by the industries was imported
from outside the state. The Douglas fir used in
the state is obtained principally from the west
coast. The local trees of this species yield
material unsuited to the needs of such industries.
Only two and forty-one one hundredths per cent of
the Douglas fir was supplied by local saw mills,
while the state itself supplied 97.59 per cent of
the western yellow pine to its wood working
plants.
Boxes and Crates, Packing.
The manufacture of boxes ranks first in the
amount of wood consumed by wood-using indus-
tries in Idaho. The manufacture is confined largely
to fruit boxes for use in Southern Idaho and for
packing boxes, which find a local market. The
home woods are eminently suited to this purpose.
Western yellow pine constitutes 98.49 per cent
of the wood actually manufactured into boxes and
all of the wood used for this purpose grows in
Idaho. Western white pine furnishes a little less
than 1 per cent and cottonwood and western larch
the balance. No wood is imported by box manu-
facturers. The light weight and strength of west-
ern yellow pine make it most desirable for fruit
boxes. Its value prohibits its use for rough pack-
ing boxes, which demand is met mostly by western
larch.
In addition to the boxes manufactured in the
state, large quantities of box lumber are produced
in planing mills and subsequently manufactured
Into the finished form outside the state. The large
areas of Idaho and contiguous states devoted to
horticulture and the suitability of western yellow
pine and other native woods for boxes indicate
an expansion of this industry.
The requirements of a good box wood are
strength, light weight, ability to nail without
splitting, and ability to hold nails. Strength
rather than light weight is a requisite of boxes
used for shipping apples and other fruit, and west-
ern yellow pine is better suited than other avail-
able species. Lumber for box manufacture is ob-
tained in rough form or surfaced on one or two
sides. Widths vary up to 12 inches, and the box
lumber is usually one inch thick before surfacing.
of the local woods of Idaho are well adapted.
Such woods should be straight grained, fairly hard,
easily worked, and capable of taking a good fin-
ish. Western yellow pine, which leads all other
species in the amount consumed, must be thor-
oughly dried before using in order to remove the
small amount of pitch in the wood and at the
same time prevent swelling or warping after man-
ufacture. White pine, which takes second place
among the woods used, works more easily than
yellow pine, and is well adapted for this purpose.
The somewhat higher price which white pine
brings and the fact that yellow pine serves equally
as well, prevents the former from coming more
into use for this purpose.
Douglas fir obtained from the coast is used for the
higher class of doors where the beauty of its grain
can be exhibited to the best advantage by stain-
ing. Douglas fir is harder than either western
yellow or western white pine and does not work
as easily.
All of the yellow pine and about three-fourths of
the white pine used for sash and doors is obtained
from Idaho mills. The remaining white pine is
brought in from the state of Washington. The
coast fir is somewhat softer and better* for sash
and doors than that grown in Idaho, and the
entire amount used is brought in from Western
Oregon and Washington.
While sash and doors are manufactured in
quantities in this state, vast amounts of western
yellow pine and western white pine are shipped
from the state in the form of shop and factory
lumber for consumption by sash and door fac-
tories in Eastern states and Middle Western
states.

uniform and attractive grain. For window and
door frames its strength, comparative hardness
and working properties commend it.
The grain of Douglas fir commends it especially
and the non-warping and shrinking properties of
white pine give it preference where enamel paints
are to be used.
Western larch is the cheapest wood used for
this purpose. It serves as a substitute for coast
fir where natural finish and staining is desired. It
supplies framing material principally. The lum-
ber is obtained rough, except that it is surfaced
one or two sides, and sometimes surfaced two
sides and one edge. For framing, thick stock to
2 inches, and 6 inches or wider, is employed. Clear
surfaced lumber 1 inch thick is required for
window and door casing. This is obtained in
various lengths up to 16 feet, and in widths not
less than 4 inches.
Fixtures.
The line of distinction between industries using
material in the manufacture of planing mill pro-
ducts, such as finish and siding, and industries
that use material classed as fixtures, must be
drawn more or less arbitrarily. Many planing
mills produce forms which are made into fixtures
by house builders and carpenters. These are not
included in the table for this industry, which
represents only the manufacture of fixtures by
wood-working plants.
This industry ranks third in the amount of
material consumed, and manufacturers report six
different woods. The three principal ones, Doug-
las fir, redwood and eastern oak, are not grown in
this state. These constitute 85 per cent of all
the wood used for fixtures. Douglas fir is employed
in much greater amounts than any other wood.
The high price paid for it indicates that the best
grades alone are serviceable. The beauty of the
grain of Douglas fir, especially when finished by
staining; its hardness, and the fact that it works
fairly well and takes varnish, paint and stains
well, make it a very desirable wood for this pur-
pose. Where a wood cheaper than eastern hard-
woods is required for finish or fixtures, Douglas fir
finds preference.
California redwood is rapidly coming into favor
in the state and ranks second in the amount used
for fixtures. Where a dark, rich wood, similar to
mahogany, is desired, redwood is utilized and is
generally employed for bar and store fixtures. It
is soft and works easily and when seasoned be
fore shaping, holds its form permanently.
Eastern oak is used to a large extent where
high-class work is wanted. Oak has always been

Sash and door stock is usually received at the
factory in rough form of any length, but not less
than 6 inches wide. The thickness varies from
1 to 2% inches and the stock must be clear in
lengths suitable for rails, mullions and stiles.
The grade of the stock is judged by the door or
sash cuttings it will yield. Shop or factory lum-
ber is some times obtained surfaced on two sides.
For door and window casings and framing, local
woods and Douglas fir from the west coast are
employed. The use is very similar to planing mill
products used for sash and doors. Practically the
same species and grades are employed. Western

pose and where a modest, rich and very attractive
grain is desired, it is hard to find a more desirable
material.
Western white pine finds service for the cheaper
grades of fixtures and in parts that are not easily
seen. Western yellow pine is used in lesser
quantities, especially where a cheap but attractive
wood is wanted.
The state has no native woods which can supply
the demand for high-class fixtures and finish, al-

for this purpose when better understood. No
