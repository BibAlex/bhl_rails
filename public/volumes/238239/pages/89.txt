pears small in the table, are woods in pretty general
use, though almost invariably under other names.
This is more fully set forth, with reasons for it,
in the discussion following table 1 of this report.
Ten states and one foreign country supply the
wood listed in this table, which Louisiana does
not procure from its own forests. Some hickory Is
reported from Alabama and Indiana; sugar maple
from Maine; mahogany from Mexico; white pine
from Michigan; red oak from Indiana and Wiscon-
sin; cottonwood from Mississippi and Missouri; red
cedar from Tennessee; persimmon, dogwood, and
yellow poplar from Alabama, and chestnut from
North Carolina and Kentucky.
The articles made are sold in many parts of the
world. Wooden water pipe of banded cypress staves
finds a large market in Mexico where it is used
in draining mines, or in leading water to them,
or in supplying it for municipal or manufacturing
purposes. Trunks have their principal foreign mar-
ket in the several countries of Central America.
The wood of which the trunks are made is chiefly
cottonwood, cypress, red cedar and ash. Some of
this is three-ply veneer. The red cedar is made
into trunk trays, it being in demand for that pur-
pose because of its odor, which is supposed to be
obnoxious to moths and other injurious insects which
are liable to infest stored clothing.
One of the most widely sold products of Louisi-
ana wood manufacturers is cotton ginning machin-
ery. Practically every cotton-growing country of
the world buys some of it. India and Egypt are
particularly good customers. The machinery con-
sists of feeders, presses, condensers, and eleva-
tors, with necessary appliances. Four woods are
reported for these commodities, longleaf pine, red
gum, tupelo, and cypress.
Much longleaf pine is sent to the distilling plants
and is converted into various commercial commo-
dities, among them being tar, turpentine, char-
coal, pine oil, tar oil, and pyroligneous acid. Most
of the wood for distillation is procured from old
stumps. It is therefore a utilization of waste.
Limbs and defective logs unfit for lumber are also
used. The extent to which this industry may be
developed depends upon the market for the pro-
ducts and the cost of manufacture; for the supply
of waste is without limit at this time. The cost
of cutting the pine stumps at the level of the ground
is an item of some consequence.
Cypress is the chief wood entering into refrigera-
tor construction, and outside of the state, the prin-
ciple market for refrigerators is in Central America.
Only one wood was reported for ladders, shortleaf
pine. Cypress is the most important wood for wash-
ing machines, and the product is sold in Canada,
West Indies, and Europe, as well as in the United
States. Some of the output is shipped in the form
of cut and fitted parts, to be assembled and finished
when they reach their factory destination.
Coffins and caskets are made of several woods.
The cheaper grades are of tupelo and red gum. More
expensive woods enter into the better grades. Among
them are yellow poplar, cypress, red cedar, chest-
nut, and mahogany. The lasting properties of cy-
press have made ii a favorite casket wood since the
first settlements by Europeans in Louisiana. Ex-
pensive caskets are in more demand in some parts
of the state now than formerly, particularly in New
Orleans. When the towns and cities were poorly
drained, vaults above ground were preferred by
those who could afford the additional expense; but
with good drainage, the manner of burial has un-
dergone a change, and high grade caskets are grow-
ing in demand. Much mahogany is used. In some
instances casket shells and burial boxes are made
of wormy mahogany, .because it is cheaper. It an-
swers as well for the purpose intended as the high
grade wood. Wormy mahogany is as sound as
any, so far as decay is concerned, but is perforated
by small holes varying in size from a pin point
to a lead pencil. The holes are the work of the
teredo or shipworm, and represent a period in the
mahogany log's history, on its way from forest to
factory, when it was submerged in salt water for a
considerable time. Most of the logs are cut in
Mexico, and by various methods of transportation,
by land and water, reach New Orleans. It is evi-
dent that some of the logs, somewhere on their
journey, are occasionally left a little too long in
briny water, and the teredo gets in its work. The
perforated mahogany is very similar in appearance
to "sound wormy" chestnut, which Is a very com-
mon form of that wood, regularly carried by most
lumber yards. In the manufacture of coffins and
caskets in Louisiana, chestnut and wormy mahogany
are used for the same purpose. Yellow poplar and
red cedar are employed in the manufacture of fine
caskets. A large part of the trade is with foreign
countries. High grade caskets are sold in Mexico,
Central America, Panama, West Indies, and South
America.
Longleaf pine is manufactured into paving blocks,
which are creosoted, and sold in different parts of
the United States and in Mexico. Shortleaf and
loblolly pines are not objectionable for paving-
blocks, if trees are selected with narrow annual
rings. As a usual thing, the yearly rings of the
longleaf pine are closer together than are those of
other southern pines.
The river birch which is listed in the table was
all made into ox yokes. It is considered one of tha
best woods for that purpose, because it is
strong, wears smooth, is moderately light, and re-
sists decay. Three other woods are occasionally
made into ox yokes, evergreen magnolia, black gum,
and tupelo. The ox yolte industry is of considerable
importance In Louisiana where large numbers of
oxen are worked in logging operations.
Most of the white pine and some of the cypress
represented In table 17, were made into patterns.
The cypress Is cheaper, and where it will answer,
it has replaced white pine, but for exacting work,
no other wood equal to white pine for patterns has
been found.
, The brush industry in Louisiana is not large, but
trade in the finished product is both domestic and
foreign. Eight woods are used, mahogany, white
oak, white ash, sugar maple, yellow poplar, tupelo,
red gum, and evergreen magnolia. No other indus-
try paid as high a price for white oak. Following
are the kinds of brushes made: Asphalt brushes with
steel teeth for sweeping asphalt pavement; cast-
ing brushes with steel teeth for painting ships;
spiral flue brushes; spiral bottle brushes; ant paste
brushes used by confectioners to keep ants out of
cake and candy boxes; deck scrubs for cleaning
the woodwork of ships; house scrubs; street brooms;
tar brushes for spreading tar on roofs; car wash-
ers for cleaning the exteriors of Pullman cars;
clothes brushes; hair brushes; paint and whitewash
brushes of many kinds. The magnolia reported
has taken the place of holly for fine brush backs.
It is sometimes made up strip and strip about with
mahogany, a back with alternate dark and light
stripes resulting. The mahogany used Is Chiefly
scraps from other factories. Very small pieces
can be used. At the present time, Panama buys
a good many brushes made In Louisiana.
The absence of a table in this report showing
the handle industry in Louisiana is due to the fact
that very little such manufacturing was reported
Some thousands of split hickory cant hook handles
are made, and there are a few handles of other
kinds. The absence of an extensive handle indus-
try in the state is remarkable, because Louisiana
is a large producer of such hickory as handles are
made of. All that was reported is included ia
Table 17. The annual use of wood for handles in
several states follows: Massachusetts 770,500 feet,
Wisconsin 1,650,000, Oregon 1,854,400, North Caro-
lina 3,595,000, Illinois 12,582,000 and Kentucky 35,-
670,000.

others, and totals can be given for the groups only.
In but one instance did Louisiana manufacture a
larger quantity of a wood than its saw mills cut
yellow poplar. Table 19 shows the amounts and
percentages.
