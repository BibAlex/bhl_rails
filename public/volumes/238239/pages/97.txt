The Wood Using Industries of Texas
Exhaustive Investigation by United States Forest Service Gives Details of Lumber Consuming
Plants Already Established and Tells of Great Forest Resources Available for New Establish-
ments in the Future Increasing Number of Woodworking Industries Is Shown by Report-
Diversified Interests Involved in Present Plants, but Need for a Larger Utilization of the State's
Lumber Production Is Evidenced by the Investigations.

PREFACE.
Texas is the largest State and has more forested
area than any other, though the total stand of its
timber is much below some of the rest. The area
of its woodland has been placed at about 40,000,000
acres; but it is difficult to draw the line between
forested and unforested land in the State. There
are all grades and degrees from the heavily tim-
bered pine belts of the east to the thinly covered
brus'h land in some of the central, southern and
western parts. Much land is covered with tree
growth and yet is incapable of producing a large
amount of merchantable lumber, because the trees
are too small for milling purposes. There is room
for difference of opinion as to where the lines should
be properly drawn between the timbered and un-
timbered portions of Texas. The estimate of 40,-
000,000 acres of forest land includes only that which
now is capable of yielding a reasonable amount of
saw timber per acre, and does not include -wide ex-
panses of brush.
Texas is 825 miles long and 780 wide and varies
in altitude from sea level to 8,382 feet at the sum-
mit of Baldy Peak in Jeff Davis County. The sur-
face varies greatly ,as might be expected in an area
so large. Flat plains of deep, fertile soil are suc-
ceeded by rolling hills and limestone ridges; steep
rocky slopes with practically no soil, and mountains
rugged and sterile. In the low plains of the south
frost is seldom seen. In the high plateaus of the
northwest the mercury sometimes falls below zero.
In the eastern part rains are abundant; in some of
the western regions there is not enough to support
much vegetation.
It might be expected that a region so large, and
varying so greatly in its climatic and physiographic
features, would support forests both valuable and
interesting. Such is the case. Practically the
whole range of forest trees known to the temperate
zone are represented here by species, genera or fam-
ilis. The cypress and tupelo which flourish with
their roots buried in water most of the time reach
fine dimensions along the rivers or within reach
of the brackish water which the winds or tire tides
force inland from the arms of the Gulf of Mexico.
The other extreme in the scale of vegetation also
flourishes in Texas, the xerophytic cacti of the
high and dry western plateaus. Between these
extremes there are perhaps 150 species of trees,
ranging from the tallest pines and the largest red
gums to the small, hard and beautiful acacias which
are found in the thorny jungles along the Rio
Grande. All weights of wood are represented, from
the almost iron-like density of lignum vitae and
koeberlinia to the lattice-like stems of the opuntias
on the western mountains.
No careful estimate has ever been made of the
standing commercial timber of Texas. Figures
have been published giving such estimates for a
few of the best-known species. The longleaf pine
area has been placed at a little less than 3,000,000
acres, with a stand of about 30,000,000,000 feet.
That would average 10,000 feet to the acre, and
some might regard it a pretty high average for so
large an area. The oaks are found in extensive re-
gions, but not in stands as pure as the pines.
In taking up this study of the wood-using indus-
tries of Texas the Forest Service purposed to sup-
ply information not available in any public or pri-
vate report. The Bureau of the Census, co-operat-
ing with the Forest Service, collects and compiles
annually statistics showing what the country's total
sawmill output is; what the output in each State
is; -what. is the mill value for each kind of wood
in the several States; what kinds of wood and how
much of each one are manufactured into lumber in
each State, and in all the States. But this stops
short of giving all needed information on the sub-
ject. It does not go beyond the rough lumber, and
presents no statistics to show what becomes of
the lumber after the sawmills turn it out in the
rough state. The present report takes up the sub-
ject where the census leaves off; that is, it consid-
ers rough lumber as raw material for further man-
ufacture, and shows what becomes of it, what it is
used for, and what products are manufactured from
it. For instance, the census statistics give figures
showing how much red gum the sawmills cut into
rough lumber, but that is all. This report follows
that lumber until it has been made into finished
commodities, such as furniture, vehicles, finish for
houses, ships and boats, musical instruments, and
whatever it goes into. It is thus shown what be-
comes of the wood which sawmills convert into
lumber and stacK in their yards. This report, how-
ever, does not take up the wood which is not fur-
ther manufactured after it leaves the sawmills. If
oak or any other wood goes into rough construc-
tion, or railroad ties, or bridge timbers, or is taken
for any other purpose which uses it in the rough,
it is not considered as raw material for further
manufacture. A State's sawmills may turn out a
large quantity of a certain wood, and little of it
may be further manufactured. In that case, if no
explanation were offered, it might appear that the
difference between what the mills cut and what the
factories account for is unreasonable.
