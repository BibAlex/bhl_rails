ber. There rings are occasionally three-fourths of
an inch wide, though usually much narrower. So
vigorously does the willow oak increase in size that
a man might live to cut large saw-logs from trees
he had planted in his youth.
Black Jack (Quercus marilandica) and Blue Jack
(Quercus brevifolia).
These two species are well established among
the Mississippi oaks, the latter in the southern part,
and the former in all parts where the soil is suit-
able; but they are more frequently looked upon as
weed trees than as resources with which to aug-
ment the state's wealth. They are >seldom found
large enough for saw-logs, and the grain of the wood
is flgureless and dull. In point of usefulness they
are doubtless lowest in the scale of all the oaks of
Mississippi, yet there are a few places which they
fill very well. Though neither is large, the black
jack is the larger and more abundant. Its exceed-
ingly rough bark, and its broad, round-cornered fan-
shaped leaves, 'modeled somewhat after a pear, usu-
ally are sufficient to identify this tree wherever
seen.
The Hickories.
It is not unusual for persons to speak of hickory
as though there were only one kind. Timbermen
are aware of the fact that the trees are not all the
same, and sometimes the differences are duly con-
sidered; but sawmills which cut hickory seldom list
more than one kind of species. Yet there is more
apparent difference between species of hickory than
between some of the species of oak. Mississippi
has seven kinds of hickory in its forests, if pecan is
counted as one, and yet it has no forest of hickory,
for it never produces pure forests, tout the trees are
scattered singly among other species, a few occa-
sionally standing near together. Operators who
make a 'business of logging hickory must pick out
the trees where they are found here and there. In
favorable regions the stand of hickory seldom aver-
ages more than 200 feet per acre. Following are the
species of hickory native to Mississippi.
Pecan (Hicoria pecan).
Pecan is usually considered the least valuable of
the hickories where strength, elasticity, and tough-
ness are essential. It gives satisfactory service only
where it is not required to sustain great loads or
stand sudden twists and strains.
Bitternut Hickory (Hicoria minima) and Pignut
(Hicoria glabra).
These two hickories are pretty generally recog-
nized as distinct from the hickories whose nuts are
edible. The wood is high class for handles and
parts of small vehicles.
Nutmeg Hickory (Hicoria myristicaeformis).
'Nutmeg hickory is rather scarce, and next to pe-
can is probably of less importance as a forest pro-
duct in Mississippi than any other of the seven
species.
Water Hickory (Hicoria aquatica).
Water hickory reaches its best development in
western Mississippi and the neighboring regions of
Louisiana and Arkansas. As its name indicates, it
is a water tree and flourishes on ground subject to
frequent overflow.
Mockernut Hickory (Hicoria alba).
The powerful and pleasant resinous odor of the
leaves of this species assists in its identification.
The tree is not usually large, but the wood is of ex-
cellent quality.
Shagbark Hickory (Hicoria ovata).
Probably most persons have this tree in mind
when they speak of hickory, and its fruit is the
common hickory nut of commerce. The wood is of
the highest class.
The sapwood of hickory is usually considered su-
perior to the heartwood. The sap is white, the
heart red or dark. Tests have shown, however, that
for certain purposes the red wood serves as well as
the white.
The Gums.
Three gum trees in Mississippi contribute to the
lumber supply, but one of them is of rather small
importance. It is the black gum (Nyssa sylvatica),
and should not be confused with tupelo which is
sometimes also called 'black gum. The true black
gum is quite a different tree and stands alone among
American trees because of its remarkably inter-
locked fibers which render the wood almost un-
wedgeaible, except when frozen, in which state the
fibers break across and seem to split. The black
gum is less a swamp tree than the tupelo; its fruit
which is dark 'blue, is about half an inch long, while
tupelo's is dark purple, and is at least twice as
large. When black gum lumber goes to market it
prdbably never carries its true name with it; hut
tupelo keeps its name, except when it passes as bay
or bay poplar. It grows like cypress on ground
flooded 'much of the year.
Red Gum (Liquidambar styraciflua).
This species bears some general resemiblance to
the others, -but it stands on its own merits, al-
though it often loses its identity in factories and
passes for Circassian walnut, cherry, birch, or oak.
The claim was made nearly a century ago that the
largest body of red gum timber in the world was in
the Yazoo delta in Mississippi. At that time the
timiber was made way with in the usual manner
the ax and fire. The land was so valuable that the
timber was considered an incumbrance. The long-
staple cotton grown there attracted attention in
most parts of the world where cotton was an article
of trade, and every planter who could clear more of
the extraordinary soil for cotton did so. Though
much red gum was sacrificed, a large quantity was
spared and has become an important source of
wealth. Some lumbermen specify two kinds of red
gum, the heart and the sap. It is all the same tree,
but the wood appears different some of it white,
other red. The sapwood of a gum, as in trees of
other kinds, gradually turns dark and changes to
heart as the trunk grows older. Some red gums
change from sap to heart much more rapidly than
others; and sometimes a large trunk is nearly all
sap. The "sap" gum of commerce is cut from such
trees. If the same tree is permitted to stand half
a century longer it is not improbable that most of
the sapwood will become heart.
Red gum is more used for veneer than any other
American wood, and much of it is rotary cut from
what is known as sap gum logs. If the material is
selected for its figure, sap veneer closely resembles
Circassian walnut, and some of it is made into fine
furniture and interior finish, musical instruments,
sewing-machine tables, and other articles where
beauty of the wood is essential. The seasoning of
red gum stood for a long time in its way, but better
methods are now employed and early troubles are
being forgotten.
The Elms.
Four elms constitute a group in Mississippi, and
in the lumber business little effort is made to dis-
tinguish one species from another. They are known
by various names, and not infrequently the same
name does service in pointing out different species.
The name "rock elm" is given in one locality to one
species, in another region it is applied to another.
This is true in other states than Mississippi, where
the term "rock elm" is applied without regard to
any particular species.
The most important elm in Mississippi, and like-
wise the most important in nearly all parts of the
United States where elm grows, is the common
white elm (Ulmus americana). The tree assumes
appearances somewhat different, depending upon
the soil where it grows, but it is usually an easy
matter to distinguish it from other trees of the
same genus associated with it.
Slippery Elm (Ulmus pubescens).
This tree is not often mistaken for any other, be-
cause the mucilaginous inner bark furnishes a ready
means of identification. No other elm possesses
this peculiar bark. Slippery elm is frequently call-
ed red elm, but the name is no guide to identifica-
tion, because two other elms in Mississippi are often
called by that name.
Cedar Elm (Ulmus crassifolia).
This elm is not abundant, but is occasionally
found in lumber yards. It grows on Sunflower river
and at other points in the state. The small twigs
may or may not be equipped with flat, corky brown
wings, one on either side, and about a quarter of
an inch wide.
Wing Elm (Ulmus alata).
That which occasionally occurs In the cedar elm,
wings on the twigs, is a characteristic of this spe-
cies, and the wings are much broader. It is usually
not difficult to identify this elm by its winged twigs,
though certain other characteristics should be taken
into consideration. It thrives best on gravelly soil.
Other Woods.
It is not the purpose to give in this place a list
of all the woods which may become of commercial
importance in Mississippi. On preceding pagee
groups are presented of several species which are
often spoken of as if they were a single one, or only
two or three species. On page 75 of this report will
be found a list of all woods reported in use by man-
ufacturers in Mississippi. Doubtless many others
are in use but were not reported in a way to bring
them into this report.
INDUSTRIES.
Manufacturers in Mississippi consume yearly
about 618 million feet of wood, consisting of twenty-
five species which are shown in Table I, following.
It is worthy of remark that not one foot of foreign
wood is reported used in Mississippi. The Forest
Service has already carried out studies of wood
uses in nearly half of the States, and in no other
than Mississippi are foreign woods absulutely lack-
ing. Every other State thus far investigated uses
mahogany at least, and some of them have lists of
a dozeni or more foreign woods employed in manu-
facturing. It is, therefore, remarkable that Missis-
sippi, which demand more wood than is demanded
by North Carolina, Maryland, Massachusetts, Oregon,
Missouri, or Washington, should import no foreign
wood. The State depends almost wholly upon its
own forests to supply its manufacturers, for it draws
very little from neighboring States, though regions
abounding in forest whealth lie on every side. Of
the twenty-five woods reported by the manufac-
turers, white pine is the only one which is not
native to the State, and only ten thousand feet of
that was brought in. Less than one per cent of all
the wood came from the outside, while twelve spec-
ies were entirely supplied from within, and only
four from other States.
It is of interest to note what proportion of the
wood further manufactured in Mississippi was pine.
The five pines which supplied it made up eighty-
nine per cent of the whole, and twenty other woods,
nineteen of them being hardwoods, furnished eleven
per cent. It is evident that Mississippi is yet a pine
State, not only in the output of its sawmills but
also in the demands of its manufacturers who use
wood. Nine industries are recognized. Table I
which follows is intended to show at a glance the
woods demanded, the quantity of each, the average
price of each, the proportion grown in the State,
and that which came in from elesewhere. The
other 'babies which follow show one industry each
and give details necessary to proper understand-
ing of the relative rank of the industries in the
State. The average cost of the wood used, as shown
in Table I, makes it apparent that cheap material
lies at the hand of the manufacturer in the State.
An average of only $12.22 per thousand for all kinds
of woods is shown.
