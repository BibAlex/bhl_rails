THE ST. LOUIS LUMBERMAN.
supplied three million feet to this industry, and
much of it was made into beds for farm wagons
and the tops of business wagons. Beech is very
strong and stiff, and serves as automobile frames.
It serves likewise as felloes for very heavy wagons,
some preferring it to white oak because it shrivels
and swells less under seasonal changes, and tire*
are less likely to work loose. When extra large
spokes are required, white elm is sometimes used.
The hackberry reported was probably substituted
for ash, and the pecan for hickory. Sycamore is
made into shelving for bakers' wagons, because it
is easy to keep clean. Red gum was used for
sides and panels of coal wagons. Ash is occasion-
ally employed for the same purpose. Red gum
sideboards for farm wagons were reported, and the
small quantity of black spruce in the table was
used in the same way. Some of the manufactur-
ers made wagon tongues of red oak. Basswood
bends well and is valuable for panels. Hearse and
undertaker wagon manufacturers prefer this wood.
Furniture.
Although twenty woods contribute to the supply
of furniture material in Missouri, four-fifths of all
is supplied by four woods red gum, white oak, sil-
ver maple and red oak. Red gum is nearly half.
In no other industry is this wood so largely em-
ployed in imitation. When carefully selected it
passes without much staining for Circassian wal-
nut, and it may be printed to resemble maple and
oak. Silver maple also is printed to imitate oak;
and sweet birch passes for other woods, while yel-
low poplar takes the color of birch and is substi-
tuted for it. The art of finishing and staining wood
has been so perfected that almost any effect can
be produced to order, and the purchaser's tastes
can be satisfied. Some imitations are apparent
and deceive no one who examines them carefully;
but others are so skillfully executed that none but
an expert can separate the true from the false.
Furniture makers have made a close study of
different woods and understand what each is best
suited for. Some give their best service as outside
material; others seldom so appear, but make the
inside, hidden parts. Where strength or hardness
is desirable, it is possible to select woods to fulfill
the conditions; if smoothness is wanted, rather
than figure or grain, there are woods of that kind.
There are white, sanitary woods, attractive in ap-
pearance and easily kept clean. Such material is
popular for kitchen and pantry furniture; and-
among woods of that kind are basswood, cotton-
wood, maple, ash, sycamore and yellow poplar.
Woods which wear smooth by sliding, one upon an-
other, are demanded by furniture manufacturers
for drawers and drawer slides, and for the slides
of extension tables. A wood which serves that
purpose well must be hard and have a fine grain.
Sugar maple, beech and birch fulfill the conditions.
Furniture of solid oak, mahogany, birch, walnut,
cherry or other handsome, costly woods is now
seldom made. The cost would be excessive, and
unless the material were long and carefully sea-
soned and the joining and fitting executed in the
most skillful manner, the heavy pieces of furni-
ture would be likely to warp out of shape, and pull
apart at the joinings. This danger is avoided by
using cores or backing of built-up veneers of soft-
woods or of the softer kinds of hardwoods. The
article of furniture, such as a chair, table, or chif-
fonier, is thus made of two parts, the inner frame
of cheap woods, and the outer visible part of thin
sheets of costly veneers glued upon the frame
work. Such a piece of furniture has the appear-
ance of being solid oak, walnut, or some other
handsome material, and the core of cheaper wood
nowhere appears. When deep carving is desired,
the outer wood must be thick enough to receive the
cutting. Occasionally a buyer insists on furniture
of solid oak, mahogany, or some other cabinet wood.
The manufacturer gives him what he wants, but
even then, in most cases, the furniture is built up
of veneers and overlays. In that case, if for ex-
ample, the wood is to be mahogany, the whole ar-
ticle, core as well as outside, is of the specified
wood and there is no deception as to material.
The manufacturer takes the extra trouble of build-
ing up the furniture instead of making it of thick,
solid pieces, because his reputation is at stake
and he knows that the built-up article is better. A
table top three inches thick of solid wood almost
invariably warps and checks, but if built of trans-
verse sheets of veneer, it stands time and weather,
changes, and retains its shape. Good backing or
cores for veneers should have but small tendency
to warp and twist. White pine is by many con-
sidered the ideal wOod for that purpose, but bass-
wood, cottonwood, chestnut, soft maple, and sev-
eral of the pines are satisfactory.
One factory seldom makes all kinds of furni-
ture. The business is highly specialized. The
making of chairs is so distinct from furniture manu-
facturing in general that it is often regarded as a
separate industry. Further than that, chair fac-
tories are specialized. Some produce dining-room
chairs; opera and hall chairs are the exclusive
output of some; others manufacture pulpit chairs,
dentists chairs, barber chairs, or perhaps cheap
camp stools. The same practice obtains among
makers of other kinds of furniture. That which
is upholstered falls into a class; davenports,
lounges, and couches are sometimes the special
HANDLES.

product of a factory; bedroom suites, or even bed-
steads only, may constitute the output; and some
large establishments make only kitchen, dining-
room or porch furniture. All of these are brought
together in statistics shown for Missouri in Ta-
ble VII.
It can be readily understood that all furniture
factories do not demand the same kinds of wood.
The maker of cheap camp stools has no use for
cherry, walnut, or mahogany; the manufacturer of
parlor pieces needs little elm, cottonwood, or pine,
except possibly as backing for veneer. In Missouri
the tops of kitchen tables are usually of basswood,
cottonwood, or soft maple. These are known as
sanitary woods; .they are easily kept clean. The
sapwood of red gum is liked for the bottoms and
backs of drawers, and elm and soft maple are also
so employed. A rather large amount of sycamore
is used, some high-class, other cheap. When quar-
ter-sawed it makes handsome table tops and carved
chair arms; the common grades go to kitchen tables
and the interiors of book cases, wardrobes, bureaus,
and cupboards. White elm is employed in carvings
for wardrobes, kitchen safes, and brackets. White
and red oak are so universally used in furniture
manufacture that almost every department of the
business owes something to them. The use of ma-
hogany for furniture in Missouri apears small; but
its place is supplied with imitation mahogany made
of birch, red gum, and yellow poplar. Red cedar
meets a demand for an aromatic wood as bottoms
for drawers in bureaus and chiffoniers, shelves and
backs of wardrobes, and as chests in which clothes
are stored. The belief is widespread, and has ex-
isted during generations, that the odor of red cedar
protects furs and clothes against moths, and other
injurious insects. At any rate, a pleasant odor is
imparted to clothing left for a considerable time in
contact with the wood. The real efficiency of cedar
in destroying insects is a matter on which opinion
differs. It does not appear that a scientific investi-
gation of the question has ever been made. The
opinion has prevailed during three hundred years
that a red cedar clothes chest is proof agaiinst
moths. The same opinion is held regarding the
incense cedar of California, the Port Orford cedar
of Oregon, and the one-seed juniper and mountain
juniper of western Texas.
FURNITURE.
little is used above the tree's butt cut. Toughness
and resiliency are the most essential properties.
There are other commodities into which the re-
mainder of the hickory tree may be worked, and
the waste is not necessarily excessive, though some
times it is not small. Articles made from hickory,
other than handles, are buggy spokes and rims,
shafts, poles, axles, sucker rods for pumping deep
wells, dowels, shewers, athletic goods, and many
more. Meat packers buy hickory cordwood for
smoking meat. If as much of a hickory tree is
worked up as is fit for one or more of these com-
modities, there will be little left to rot in the
woods. Sometimes, however, the hickory lumber-
ing is carried on in districts so far from transpor-
tation that only the choice parts of trees can be
taken out with profit. The principal hickory region
of Missouri is the southeastern part of the State,
and several large and many small operators are
located there. Not half of the hickory cut in Mis-
souri is converted into the finished products in the
State, but much is shipped elsewhere either in the
rough or in the partly manufactured form.
Though hickory is the most important it is not
the only wood valuable to Missouri handle manu-
facturers. Two and a half million feet of white ash
are used. This wood is highly satisfactory as hand-
les for certain farm tools, particularly pitchforks,
rakes, hoes, and shovels. It is stiff, strong, and
moderately light.
White oak is occasionally substituted for hickory
in railroad pick handles, and even for ax handles,
but for ax handles it lacks much of measuring up
to hickory.
Much of the sugar maple and cypress in the table
was made into broom handles, and a small part of
the red gum was so used.
Large numbers of small handles of various pat-
terns are turned out, and for some of them there is
not much choice of wood. Among handles of that
class are hand grips on bucket pails and on boxes
and packages. Red gum is largely used for that
commodity, and red oak and ash contribute to the
supply. There are gimlet, awl, auger, chisel, saw,
and other tool handles. Some are made from waste.
Whip handles are reported as a by-product of sad-
dle-tree factories, cut from pieces sawed out to give

The statistics in Table VIII, relative to the manu-
facture of handles, include many sizes, from han-
dles for gimlets and awls to those for cant hooks.
Seven woods figure in this business and nearly
twenty million feet are consumed. Hickory is the
most important, and white ash next. Most handles
require fairly high grades of wood, yet the average
prices paid are low. The apparent inconsistency is
easily explained by the fact that most handle woods
are bought in the log or billet form, and little work
has been done on them when they reach the fac-
tory. Some of the material does not pass through a
sawmill, and no sawyer's bill is included in the
cost. Billets are sometimes split in the woods and
go in the rough form to the handle maker or go in
the form of bolts. Sometimes they are rough-turned
before they go to the finishing factory. This holds
good for hickory chiefly, but some white oak and
white ash go through the splitting and rough-turn-
ing process.
The bulk of the 14 million feet of hickory is made
into ax, pick, and sledge handles. Such handles
are 36 inches long, but the bolts are cut 40 inches
to allow for trimming the ends to rid them of sea-
Boning checks. Wood of that kind is measured by
the cord or rank and this is good for about 300
handles. A lathe makes 400 handles a day. In
selecting material for ax, pick, and hammer handles,
shape to the saddle tree. They are of ash, maple,
oak, and hackberry.
A by-product of handle factories is the dust from
the sanding belts. This is very fine particles of
wood, like flour, and it is bought by manufacturers
of floor-cleaning compounds, and dynamite. Some
of the finest dust is used for polishing silver ware.
Fixtures.
Fixtures are closely related to furniture. The
line separating the two industries is often difficult
of definition. Fixtures are generally made for a
particular room or place, while furniture is not so
restricted. Fixtures are adjuncts of banks, offices,
stores, saloons, balls, and hotels. They consist of
showcases, counters, presses, and cabinets, window
seats, wall benches, soda fountains, exhibition racks,
bars, fixed desks, shelving, and many others of
similar kind. They differ from interior finish which
is made fast to walls, ceiling, or floor, and can not
be removed without considerable injury to the finish
and the room.
Fixtures are made in much the same way as furni-
ture; similar materials are used, and similar effects
are produced by selecting and grouping woods.
Veneers are as largely employed as in furniture, and
shelving and panels hold the relative place which
they occupy in furniture. In Missouri 28 woods
are reported in this industry, and four of them
