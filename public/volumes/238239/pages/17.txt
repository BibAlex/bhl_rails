hardwoods are available for replacing those now
imported from the East.
Rough and surfaced lumber is employed by
manufacturers of fixtures. Practically all boards
and pieces are surfaced before final placing. Most
of the lumber is obtained in the form of boards
1 inch thick, of various lengths. Only high-grade
stock is purchased.
Fixture woods are obtained in plank form gen-
erally surfaced on two sides. Various widths up
to 20 or -24 inches are employed and these are
from % to 2 inches thick. Clear lumber, or lum-
ber yielding large quantities of clear cuttings,
is demanded by the industry.
Boats.
In the manufacture and repair of boats in this
state as large a variety of woods is used as in
more important industries. The center of con-
sumption of wood for boats is at Coeur d'Alene
on Lake Coeur d'Alene, which is one of the largest
bodies of water in Idaho and carries a large
amount of traffic. Farther to the north along the
Pend d'Oreille River and on the Priest and Pend
d'Oreille Lakes a few small boats are needed for
towing logs to the saw mills from logging opera-
tions in that vicinity. Douglas fir leads the list
in the amount consumed and serves for frames
and ribs, planking and for keels and decking
where cheap but strong, tough wood is needed.
Larch is used for the same purpose as fir, and
compares favorably with it for these purposes.
Wagons.
The use of wood for wagons in Idaho is confined
to repair work rather than to actual construction.
It is cheaper to ship in the finished product than
to import from Eastern states the raw material
necessary in wagon construction. Woods suitable
for the principal parts of wagons do not grow in
the state.
material is obtained out of the state, Eastern
Washington being the source of supply.

In repairing vehicles oak, Douglas fir, ash and
hickory are employed and all are imported into
the state. The hardwoods are obtained in the
Mississippi Valley and the Douglas fir from the
west coast of Oregon and Washington. The east-
ern hardwoods average $130 per thousand feet de-
livered to Idaho vehicle repairers, but as they are
essential in specific parts, they cannot be replaced
by any of the cheaper local woods. The entire
amount of wood consumed for wagons in Idaho,
5,000 feet, is not of great importance.
Hickory, ash and oak used for vehicle repair
work are received either in the manufactured

The western red cedar and Sitka spruce are used
for small row boats where light weight is an im-
portant factor, and for this reason these woods
are employed almost entirely for the lining of
such boats. They are likewise employed for in-
terior work and finish on larger boats. Sitka
spruce is also used for spars.
Western white pine and western yellow pine are
used in small amounts for planking, lining and
decking. The higher priced imported woods, such
as eastern oak and mahogany, go into finish for
the better boats. Some of the oak is used for
keels and strakes where a strong, tough, bendable
wood serves best.
While the manufacture of boats will never be
extensive because of the very local demand, the
industry will continue to be an outlet for some
part of the local woods.
Rough and surfaced lumber in dimension and
plank form, and in large and small sizes, is em-
ployed in boat building. Dimension sizes are used
in framing, and thin boards for finish.
Furniture.
No factories manufacturing furniture are repre-
sented in Idaho and the consumption of wood for
furniture is confined mostly to repair work. For
this purpose only 20,100 board feet of lumber are
consumed annually and of this amount one-half is
grown outside the state.
Douglas fir brought from Oregon and Washing-
ton is the principal furniture wood, while the
native western yellow pine is second in impor-
tance. Of the higher priced eastern woods oak
is the only species used and this is employed
sparingly. Western white pine is approximately
equal to the western yellow pine In the amount
consumed for furniture.
Due to the lack of suitable woods for high-class
furniture, the future of this industry in the state
must depend on the manufacture of a cheaper
class of goods in which western larch, Douglas
fir, western yellow pine and western white pine
can be used to advantage.
Only clear lumber, rough or surfaced one or
two sides, is employed for furniture repairs. Turn-
ing squares of Douglas fir 1 by ] inch, 2 by 2
inches, and 3 by 3 inches, in short lengths are
used in small quantities. Lumber with defects but
allowing reasonable amounts of short clear pieces
can be used.
Table VI
form or rough. Only rough lumber which is later
shaped for final use is reported in the table. This
is obtained in the form of thick plank of various
widths and lengths. Oak is used for reaches,
axles and gears: ash for wagon tongues and
felloes, and hickory serves general purposes.
Douglas fir is obtained in the form of dressed
boards and is employed for wagon beds, racks
and as thick stock for tongues.
Miscellaneous.
Under this heading are grouped the small in-
dustries that cannot conveniently be placed under
the major wood-using industries. Also in case
only one or two firms reported being engaged in
the manufacture of some commodity, it was neces-
sary to place them under this industry.
Table VIII Miscellaneous.
lumber is $13.40. Wagon repairs require the most
expensive woods at an average price of $114.40,
although they use only .03 of one per cent of all.
The average cost of material for industries
grouped under miscellaneous is $19.07 per thou-
sand feet and material for this purpose constitutes
15.49 per cent of the wood consumed by industries
in the state.
Apportionment of the Kinds of Wood.
The building of boats in Idaho affords utiliza-
tion for eight different woods, as shown in Table X.
However, the total consumption for boat building
is only .32 of one per cent of all the woods used.
This industry employs a greater variety of woods
than any other. Four species are used for boxes,
and western yellow pine supplies 70 per cent of it.
Black cottonwood, the only hardwood used for
boxes, is not reported used by any other industry.
Only 2.6 per cent of the western white pine is
employed in the manufacture of boxes. Western
red cedar is used only for boat building, ash and
hickory for wagons alone, and applewood in small
amounts for pipe plugs. Fixtures consume 89.05
per cent of the eastern oak reported, while oak
also supplies material for cabinet work, boats,
furniture and wagons.
Western white pine serves a larger number of
industries than any other wood and is the only
wood used for match blocks. Douglas fir furnishes
raw material for five industries, and 77.19 per cent
of it goes into fixtures. Practically all of the
Douglas fir used by Idaho industries is imported
from west of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon
and Washington. Western larch, the native soft-
wood most closely approximating Douglas fir in its
properties, finds a very limited use for boxes,
casing and framing, and for boats. The properties
of this wood should make it suitable for substitu-
tion for imported Douglas fir for fixtures, cabinet
work and other purposes.

In the amount of wood consumed, this group is
well to the front, standing fourth on the list.
Western white pine and western yellow pine are
the two principal species used, white pine furnish-
ing 99.5 per cent and yellow pine the remainder.
A negligible amount of applewood is used for

wood used in Idaho is the white oak employed
for furniture repairs at $203.30 per thousand feet.
Mahogany used in boat building costs $200 per
thousand, while eastern oak for millwork costs
$180, and for wagons $121.65. Eastern ash used
only for wagons costs $175, and hickory, likewise

wood reported by any industry is western larch
employed both in boat building and as sash and
coors and mill work, which is reported at $10

from $13.31 for boxes to $52.40 per thousand feet
for boat building. The highest price paid for
western white pine by the industries of the state
is $50 per thousand feet by cabinet makers. The
black cottonwood employed in box manufacture
