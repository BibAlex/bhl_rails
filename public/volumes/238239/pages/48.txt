any other wood reported in Missouri and the piano
makers find place for the most of It.
Patterns.
The making of patterns, models and flasks is
a comparatively small industry in Missouri, less
than half a million feet being required to meet its
demands for lumber. Foundry flasks are rough
boxes in which the sand is placed preparatory to
receiving the molten metal in making the casting.
Nearly any wood will answer this purpose. The
foundry pattern, however, is a more carefully made
article, and most of the white pine listed in Table
XX went to the shops where such patterns are cut
out. The pattern is shaped exactly like the article
to be cast. A soft, even-grained wood is demanded
and it is necessary that it hold its shape because
warping and twisting, after the pattern has been
cut out, would destroy its usefulness. Experience
has shown that white pine has no superior for pat-
terns. The wood's high price sometimes lessens
its use and another wood is pressed into service.
The fact that 94 per cent of all the pattern mate-
rial in Missouri is white pine is evidence that no
other has made serious inroads on its use there.
All the white pine listed in Table XX was not em-
ployed for foundry patterns, though most of it
was. Model makers draw supplies from that
source. A model is usually an exact representa-
tion of a part of a machine or some other article,
such as a wheel, valve, boat, column or something
that is to be made in specified shape. The models
are sometimes called machine-shop patterns to dis-
tinguish them from foundry patterns. Hat blocks
are occasionally spoken of as patterns, and there
are several kinds, each having its special use. Hat
flanges are used in shaping the brims of felt hats;
curling boards for brims of silk hats, stretchers
for widening hats and hat sets to lengthen or widen.
Yellow poplar is the best wood for hat blocks. It
is seasoned a long time in dry air, then placed in
artificial heat until the wood ceases to lose weight.
Expensive hardwoods, like cherry and mahogany,
are materials for models or shop patterns.

Printing Material.
Most of the wood listed in Table XXIII is used
as base blocks for stereotypes, electrotypes, half-
tone and zinc plates. Printers tack thin metal plates
upon blocks of wood in printing. Such blocks are
beech, sweet birch and cherry. The wood should
be hard, straight-grained and smooth. It is liable
to come in frequent contact with water and it
should resist a tendency to shrink and swell quick-
ly. The three woods named are put to some use
in Missouri in the manufacture of commodities of
another kind used by printers, such as cases for
type, cabinets and "furniture." The word furni-
ture as the printer understands it means small
blocks and strips of wood used in locking up forms
of type preparatory to putting them on the press.
Much of it is made of metal, but some prefer wood
PRINTING MATERIAL.
actual amount of wood in an aeroplane is small, but
it is selected with much care and the waste is com-
paratively large. Scarcely any mechanism demands
greater perfection in material which enters into its
construction, for a defect is liable not only to ruin
the machine, but to result fatally to the operator as
well.
The frames are made of spruce. It is necessary
that the wood be straight-grained and free from
knots and other defects. The strain on an airship
is at times sudden and severe, and the machine is so
constructed that it distributes the strain equally on
all parts or as nearly so as possible; and the wood
is selected with the purpose that every inch of it
must stand its part of the strain in critical mo-
ments. Much care is bestowed on the propellers. It
is absolutely essential that they shall have the
strength necessary to stand the strain and at the
same time no superfluous weight is allowed. They
are sometimes made wholly of spruce, and at other

Weighing Apparatus.
Three woods demanded in Missouri by manufac-
turers of .weighing apparatus are listed in Table
XXI. The' total amount is not much above a quar-
ter of a million feet, and about two-thirds of it is
shortleaf pine. Cypress is employed in making
scale boxes and the reason assigned for its use is
that it resists dry rot. The same reason is given
for employing Douglas fir for a similar purpose,
but this wood answers many other purposes in the
manufacture of weighing machines. Such machines
are often exposed to dampness in situations pecu-
liarly liable to induce decay, and the woods em-
ployed must meet that condition.

because it is lighter than metal. The quantity of
boxwood used in this industry in Missouri is so
small that it would not deserve mention were it
not that it is the most expensive wood listed in
any industry. The price is $1000 per thousand feet.
Even that is below rather than above the usual
cost of this wood, which is imported from Russia
and Turkey and is employed in making high-class
wood engravings. It sometimes costs three or four
dollars a foot, and, of course, is not employed
where a cheaper material will answer. It is in de-
mand for rollers for skates and was formerly bought
by shuttle makers, but of late years dogwood and
persimmon have been substituted for shuttles. En-
gravers employ substitutes also and sugar maple

Frames and Molding.
Planing mills manufacture molding intended for
interior finish of houses and other intended for
picture and mirror frames and the frames in which
advertising matter is displayed in public places.
Table XXII gives statistics of molding which goes
into frames. The figures are supplied by the mak-
ers of such frames. The industry is small in com-
parison with some others which use many times
as much wood, but it is well defined and many
shops make the commodity. Perhaps more wood
goes into advertising frames than into the frames
of pictures and mirrors. Much of the cypress and
oak of the table was worked into advertising frames
and the basswood for picture frames. It finishes
nicely and nails well, and when the article is to
be gilded or covered with goldleaf basswood proves
satisfactory; it likewise gives good service if the
frame is enameled. Red oak readily takes am-
monia fumes in giving mission finish and it does
well also when polish is desired. White elm is
said to finish nearly as well as red oak, but its
grain is not as handsome as that of oak. The black-
walnut and white pine listed in the table were used
in the form of thin lumber or veneer, as backing
for mirrors. The walnut was cheaper than the
white and red oak, but little was used. Missouri
and apple and pearwood are among the best, but
no substitute was reported in Missouri. For coarse
engraving many woods are employed. Formerly
wood type was cut from boxwood, but its high
cost now stands in the way of that use. West In-
dies boxwood is a different species and much
cheaper than that from Turkey.
Aeroplanes.
The making of aeroplanes is a new industry in
this country, and Missouri is the first State to sup-
ply statistics of their manufacture. A few
dozen were turned out in 1910, and only three woods
were reported as to amounts, though others were
made use of, at least for experimental purposes.
Locust and red gum are mentioned, but the exact
uses are not given. Sitka spruce supplied 84 per
cent of all, mahogany and white ash the rest. The
AEROPLANES.,
times are built up of different woods. A built-up
propeller may consist of a strip of ash in the middle
of each blade, with spruce on each side; then layers
of mahogany outside the spruce and thin pieces
of ash outside the hub. A propeller constructed in
that way is believed to be stronger than one of solid
wood. It at least offers the advantage of a more
careful inspection of the material. One larger piece
may have defects within which cannot be seen; but
a propeller made of small pieces offers less chance
for hidden defects. The pieces are held together
with glue. It is claimed that if high-grade glue is
used and is well applied it joins the pieces of wood
so firmly that before the joints will pull apart the
wood will break elsewhere. Mahogany is usually
employed in making the steering wheels of aero-
planes.
Miscellaneous.
Missouri manufacturers annually make use of
over eight million feet of wood outside of the indus-
tries described on former pages of this report. It
goes into various commodities, the making of none
of which is of sufficient importance in the State to
be classed as an industry, but when considered in
the aggregate they hold a prominent place. Twenty-
three woods are listed, red gum being used in
largest and mahogany and black cherry in the small-
est quantities. Black willow is highest in price and
red gum the cheapest.
The high cost of willow calls for explanation, for
it is generally a cheap wood. It was reported for
artificial limbs, and was bought partly manufac-
tured. There appears to be some doubt as to the
exact species of willow used. One of the manufac-
turers reported red willow, apparently meaning
longleaf willow (Salix fluviatilis), which in most
parts of its range is too small for artificial limbs,
but it reaches its best development about the mouth
of the Ohio River, and there sometimes attains a
height of 70 feet and a diameter of two. Some re-
ported black willow, and others received willow from
New York and supposed it was imported from Eu-
rope. In Table XXV all that was reported was list-
ed as black willow, though some of it was question-
able.
Most of the cost of artificial limbs is in the labor.
The material is scarcely more than one-tenth of it.
Much of the wood is cut away and the waste is pro-
portionately large. Only wood of straight grain can
be used and it must be tough, light, strong and dur-
able. Though all visible wood is willow, a little
hickory, sugar maple or some of the hardwood finds
place in the interior mechanism. In making brush-
backs sugar maple, red gum and yellow poplar were
employed. Woods intended for brush-backs must
meet hard usage, particularly some kinds of scrub
brushes. They must wear well when alternately wet
and dry, in both hot and cold water, and must show
