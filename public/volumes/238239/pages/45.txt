cost more than one hundred dollars per 1,000 feet,
and four others cost fifty or more. The average
cost of the furniture woods In Missouri was $27.05,
but the fixtures woods was $37.24. Generally, the
manufacturer of fixtures demands pieces of larger
size than those going to the furniture factory; and
it holds true in most cases that the larger the piece
of wood demanded the higher the price will be per
1,000 feet. To this fact more than to any other is
due the greater cost of fixture material. Nearly
nine-tenths of the wood consumed by this industry
grew outside of Missouri. That was scarcely to
have been expected. Only twelve of the twenty-eight
species grew even in part in the State. Douglas fir
and redwood came from the Pacific Coast; three
species, Circassian walnut, satinwood, and mahog-
any were imported from foreign countries; and not
one was furnished entirely by Missouri.
The use of sassafras as backing, or core wood, for
veneers is particularly mentioned with approval by
a manufacturer. It is light and retains its form
in a satisfactory manner under climatic changes.
Soft maple likewise receives commendation as a core
material when employed in fixtures of large size
where wood is put to severe test. Another place
where soft maple comes up to expectation is in
shelving where tendency to warp or twist would
be a serious defect. Sycamore and cottonwood
serve with it and with equal satisfaction.
Results are rather disappointing in the utiliza-
tion of waste in this industry. One manufacturer
works sweet birch scraps into flatiron handles, and
another makes fish bobs of small pieces of redwood.

Caskets and Coffins.
The mahogany used in Missouri in the manu-
facture of coffins and caskets is of lower price
than that demanded by any other industry in the
State. Some of it is choice material, but in the
making of caskets it is practicable to use what is
known Commercially as "wormy mahogany." This
is employed in the manufacture of casket shells
and burial boxes. It is as sound as any, so far as
decay is concerned, but it is perforated with small
holes ranging from the size of a pin to a lead
pencil. The holes are the work of the teredo or
ship worm, and represent a period in the mahogany
log's history, on its way from forest to factory,
during which it was submerged for a consider-
able time in brackish water somewhere in the
tropics and was subject to the attack of the de-
structive teredo. The mahogany is often cut into
logs somewhere in the interior of Mexico or Cen-
tral America, floated down the rivers to the sea
and is there loaded on ships for northern markets.
The worm gets in its work while the logs lie in
salt water. The perforated mahogany is similar in
appearance to "sound wormy" chestnut, which is
a common form of that wood which is used for
many purposes. The wormy mahogany is cheaper
than sound wood, but for certain purposes it is as
good.
Cypress is used in Missouri for coffins to a
greater extent than any other wood. It is hand-
some, long-lasting, and cheap. California redwood,
which is also of remarkable lasting properties,
is working its way into this industry, though at
the present time it is in less demand than any
other of the ten species shown in Table X. Red
cedar holds a place of considerable importance
and next to mahogany it is the costliest wood de-
manded by the casket makers in the State. It
has always been a favorite material for this pur-
pose and formerly, when it was less expensive, the
demand was greater. It resists moisture, is light,
and is handsome in appearance. The red cedar
coffin material in Missouri is imported from Ten-
nessee, though cedar grows in Missouri. Red gum
is more prominent in cheap coffins than in ex-
pensive kinds. A large amount of pine is listed
In the table which shows statistics of the indus-
try. Most of this is manufactured into burial
boxes in which the coffins are placed. The same
article serves, on occasion, for a shipping box.
The wood demanded in second largest amount is
chestnut. It is not produced in Missouri, but is
imported from West Virginia and eastern Ken-
tucky. There is no special reason why chestnut
should be so largely employed in this industry.
It is serviceable and satisfactory, but so are many
other woods. Custom has adopted chestnut and
manufacturers meet this demand. It is made into
burial boxes as well as caskets, and the same
is true of cypress, red cedar and several other
woods. Only two of the woods listed are pro-
duced in part in Missouri red oak and short-leaf
pine and they in small quantity.
CASKETS AND COFFINS.
seldom exceeding a quarter of an inch, and the
veneer is glued upon it before the box is made
up. Sometimes the box is lined with veneer and
the outside is left uncovered. In that case the
cedar veneer is placed to give odor, called "bou-
quet," to the cigars. If the veneer is on the out-
side of the box also, the purpose is to give the
box the appearance of being solid cedar. In many
instances the surface of the box, sometimes the
outside, sometimes the inside, or both out and
in, is covered with handsomely colored litho-
graphs. In that case the cedar veneer may be
dispensed with.

the two used in largest amounts being red gum
and yellow poplar, two and a half million feet
each. Next in quantity to them is Spanish cedar.
The chief reason for considering the manufacture
of cigar boxes as an industry distinct from boxes
in general is that those who make cigar boxes
seldom make any other kind, and they are manu-
factured in a particular way. To be sure, there
are different kinds and sizes of cigar boxes and
different woods are employed, but there is a same-
ness in the methods everywhere.
Most boxes in which high-class cigars and cigar-

is imported from Mexico, Central America or the
West Indies. It costs from one-third to one-fourth
as much as mahogany, and is rather cheap for an
imported wood. Its value for cigar boxes is due
to its odor. It is handsome in appearance, but
that alone would not give it the important place
it holds in this industry; and it is not in much
demand by any other industry in this country.
It has been imitated by other woods, but instances
o! such imitation have not been reported in Mis-
souri. Yellow poplar has served as an imitation.
One process of preparing it has been to pass thin
sheets of poplar veneer between rollers furnished
with minute teeth by which the wood is indented
to give the appearance of the pores character-
istic of the cedar. The veneer is then stained to
impart the proper color and the odor is artificially
given by treating the veneer with a decoction of
cedar shavings and sawdust.
The cedar veneer is cut very thin, scarcely
thicker than sheets of writing paper, and a few
thousand feet, log measure, produce large amounts
of veneer surface. It is sliced and the waste is
reduced to a minimum.
All cigar and cigarette boxes are not veneered.
Many of yellow poplar, cypress and red gum are
solid, and are used plain or the wood is covered
with litho paper. The presence of black gum In
this industry should be noted, for that wood is
pretty backward in finding places where it can be
of service and any enlargement of its uses are
welcome.
Except red gum, Missouri produces little of the
raw material for its cigar boxes.
Trunks and Valises.
Of the nine woods listed by trunk manufacturers
in Missouri, red gum was cheapest, white pine most
expensive, and the average for all was under $25
per thousand feet. Much of the wood is bought
in the form of veneer. Some of it is in single sheets
as it comes from the machine, and other is built-up,
three or more ply, ready for use. Generally the wood
demanded by trunk and suit-case makers reaches
the factory in the form of slats or veneer. The slats

ettes are packed are constructed of two woods, are for the outside to strengthen the trunk. The
one constituting the core and the other the thin
veneer overlying the core. The veneer is nearly
always Spanish ceda.r. In Missouri no other wood
is reported for that use. The core or backing
may be any one of several woods. Those listed
for that purpose in Table XI are cypress, black
gum, red gum, tupelo, white elm and yellow pop-
lar. The preference for the gum woods will be
noted, three of the six species used as cores being
gum and constituting half of all. The wood on
metal knobs and reinforcements are usually at-
tached to the slats. The box, forming the body of
the trunk, is of veneer, three ply or more in thick-
ness. The inner sheet is laid with the grain cross-
ing that of the sheets on either side. This prevents
splitting and lessens warping. Such a sheet may
break under sufficient pressure, but will not split. A
sheet of veneer built up in that way is much strong-
er than a solid piece of equal thickness. Formerly
trunks were simply boxes made by nailing boards
which the veneer is laid is cut into thin lumber together and covering them with cloth, leather or
