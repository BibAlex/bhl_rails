Notes on a Collection of MAMMALS from Arizona.
BY ELLIOTT COTJES, M. D., U. S. A.
Circumstances have unavoidably delayed, until now, the preparation of the
present article, needed to complete the record of the zoological collections
made by the writer in Arizona daring 1864 and 1865. Articles upon the
Coleoptera, by Dr. J. L. Le Conte ; upon the Batrachia and Reptilia, by Prof.
E. D. Cope ; upon the Cheiroptera, by Dr. H. Allen ; and upon the Birds, by
the present writer, have already appeared in these Proceedings. The few fishes
collected were unfortunately destroyed in transitu. The plants, collected
jointly by Dr. E. Palmer and the writer, still remain in the hands of Dr. Geo.
Engelraann, of St. Louis, to whom they were transmitted for examination and
identification. These collections, taken together, may be considered to repre-
sent, in a measure, the more prominent features of the fauna and flora of the
Territory.
The classification and nomenclature here adopted is that of Prof. Baird's
" Mammals of North America " (Pacific Railroad Report, vol. viii.) A general
sketch of the Quadrupeds of Arizona, by the present writer, has already ap-
peared in the " American Naturalist," vol. i., Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 10.
