124 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACXDEMY OF
" Avis est Psittaci magnitudine et forma, ac pene tota viridis, insertis tamen
nonnullis pennis rubescentibus, pauoninisque aliis; verum crura, pedesque
nigra sunt et tenuia ; rostrum incuruum, qaaternas pene vncias logum, serra-
tumque, vnde aomen, et luteo, ac nigro varium colore; calidarum regionum
atque maritimarum Incola est, neque alium (quod nouerim) quam plumae pra-
estat rsum." Hernandez, as above.
This description has been done into various languages by competent hands,
but remains the sole authority for the species. It seems to be more like a
Trogon than a Toucan.
3. Ramphastos flavits. Mull. Syst. Nat. Supp. p. 84 (1776).
Ramphastos luteus, Gm. Syst. Nat. i. p. 353 (1788).
Tucana lutea, Briss. Orn. iv. p. 432.
"Tucana dilute lutea ; taenia utrinque longitudinali a rostro ad pectus usque
nigra ; tectricibus alarum superioribus minimis luteis ; rectricibus albo et nigro
variis."
"Habitat in Mexico." Brisson, as above.
Probably not a bird of this family. Brisson seems to abridge from " Ens.
Nieremb. pag. 209," which author is not included in my circle of antique ac-
quaintances.
4. Ramphastos glaucds, Mull. Syst. Nat. Supp. p. 84 (1776).
Ramphastos caeruleus, Gm. Syst Nat. i. p. 357 (1788).
Tucana caerulea, Briss. Orn. iv. p. 433.
" Tucana in toto corpore coeruleo et cinereo varia."
li Habitat in Mexico." Brisson, as above.
This is another of the descriptions which Brisson apparently copies from
"Eus. Nieremb. pag. 209," anil perhaps also somewhat from " Aldrovandus,
Orn. 1 p. 803, in qua hujus icon a Nierembergio mutuata." The figure in
Aldrovandus probably is intended to represent a bird of this family, but
neither it nor his description applies to any known species.
5. Ramphastos nuiuus, Gm. Syst. Nat. i. p. 35? (1788).
Blue-throated Toucan, Lath. Syn. i. p. 357.
'In a list of birds in the Museum of Baron de Faugeret of Monfpi-Iier, I find
one by the name of Toucan h gorge bleue, with this addition, ' Ce Toucan n'est
decrit par aucun auteur.' 1 do not find a Toucan with a blue throat mentioned
by any writer, and must therefore, with him, conclude it to be a new species.
As it is but very lately that I have known this circumstance, it lias not been
in my power to say further on this head, resting the whole, for the present, on
his opinion." Latham, as above, and in (Jen. Hist. ii. p. 294, gives the Bame
account of it, in substance. I agree in allowing it to rest for the present, but
should the original Baron or other be disposed to stir in the matter he can
now lie better accommodated.
6. Ramphastos Bybon, Mull. Syst. Nat. Supp. p. 82 (177G).
Buceros albus, Gm. Sysi Nat i. p. 301.
' Captus inter insulas Tinian et Pulotimeon, anseris magnitudine."
A white Toucan, the size of a Goose! I guess not.
7. Ramphastos indicts, Miller, Cimelia Physica p. 102 (1796).
Mill. Cym. 1'hys. pi. 57.
"Ramphastos gula remigibus caudaque nigris, genis pectoreque albis, ab-
domine femorisque Luteis, rertice rubro-aurantio, uropygio phoeniceo." Miller,
as alio\ e.
Usually cited doubtfully as a synonymc for R. Torn, hut the plate represents
no Bpecies al presenl known, and has the appearance of having been drawn
from a made-up or fictitious Specimen, the head rather especially.
