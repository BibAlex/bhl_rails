Resembling the preceding in colors, but easily distinguished by the large
occipital band of pale blue, and has the longer tail feathers tipped with chest-
nut (which is not the case in the preceding, A. sulcatus). The under mandible
is not grooved, as in the preceding.
Of this species, specimens from Peru seem to have the bills darker than in
others labelled as from " Columbie " in Mr. Jules Verreaux's hand-writing,
though otherwise quite similar. In the Acad. Mus. there are specimens in
very fine plumage from the "Province of Curco, Peru," in the valuable col-
lections presented by Dr W. S. W. Ruschenberger, of the United States Navy.

Gould, Mon. Ramph. 2d ed. pi. 44.
Larger. Bill fine chestnut-red, culmen usually black ; large space in middle of under
mandible usually black; line of white at base of bill wide and very distinct, especially on
under mandible. Rump scarlet; longer feathers of the tail widely tipped with brownish-
chestnut. Entire plumage grass-green, with a golden tinge on the neck behind and back,
paler and strongly tinged with blue on the under parts, especially the breast ; middle tail
feathers strongly tinged with blue; cheeks and small spot over the eye blue.
Total length about 17 to L9 inches.
Hub. Northern South America, New Grenada, "Bogota." Spec, in Mus. Acad. Philada.
The largest species of this group. Much resembling the preceding, A. Derbi-
anus, but with the rump scarlet. In three specimens now before me in Acad.
Mus., no two are exactly similar in the colors of the bill, and one only corres-
ponds in that respect with Mr. Gould's beautiful plate of this species. In two
others a band of black is strong and well-defined on the culmen and on the
middle of the lower mandible. In the one specimen the black of the culmeo
is much more restricted and less clearly defined, and the under mandible al-
most entirely black.
Easily distinguished from either of the preceding by its scarlet rump and
larger size. Specimens in Acad. Mus. from Bogota.

Like the preceding, .1. castaneorhynchus, hut smaller, and with a shorter and stouter bill-
Total length 14 inches (Mr. Gould).
Bab. Ecuador. Spec, in coll. Mr. John Gould, and Dr. P. L. Sclater, London.
In the large collection now under examination I have no specimen which
exactly corresponds with Mr. Gould's plate and description, hut I do not find
any characters which might not readily be found in the young of the prece-
ding, A. castaneorhynchus, especially in view of the liability to variation which
seems to prevail in this group. One specimen only known to Mr. Gould, but
this species is given bj r Dr. Sclater in List of Birds from Pallatanga, Ecuador.

Large; bill dark bluish horn-color, with the tip and edges of both mandibles yellowish-
white. Wide transverse band on the breast pale blue. Rump red; ti), s of longer tail
feathers brownish-chestnut ; throat bluish-white ; cheeks blue; line over the eye bluish-
white. Entire other plumage grass-green, tinged with yellow mi the abdomen and under
tail coverts.
Total length from 14 to l(i inches.
Hdb. Western South America, Bolivia, "Columbie." Spec, in Mus. Acad. Philada. and
Mus. Smiths. Washington.
The bluish or horn color of the bill is peculiar, and immediately available in
the recognition of this species. Five specimens in Mus. Acad, differ in size
