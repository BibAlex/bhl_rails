A singular and anomalous form, not related specifically to any other. Head and entire
under parts saffron-yellow. Rump crimson; upper parts of body, wings and tail yellowish-
green. SeXes alike.
Total length about 15 to 16 inches.
Hab.-~ Central and Eastern South America, Brazil. Spec, in Bins. Acad. Philada. and
Mus. Smiths. Washington.
Quite common in collections from Brazil. This peculiar and oddly-colored
species seems to be most properly arranged here, though usually rated as an
Andigena. It does not intimately resemble any other species of Toucan.
Th" following may be an additional species of Pteroglossus, but is doubtful,
and unknown to modern naturalists.

Albin's Birds, ii. pi. 25.
" This bird is little bigger than the common Magpie; the head, neck, and
upper part of the back towards the neck, are black ; the rest of the back and
wings show something of a cinereous whiteness. The breast shines with a
most bright and lovely gold or saffron color, with a certain redness near the
beginning ; the belly and thighs of a most beautiful vermillion or scarlet
color. The red color reaches almost half-way of the tail, and is intercepted
by a broad bar of black, and ending in a beautiful red ; the legs, feet and
claws are black."
" Its bill is very large, considering the bigness of the bird ; its length was
six inches, breadth at the upper part towards the head two inches and a quar-
ter, the circumference at the same place five inches and a half; the upper
chap is large and somewhat hooked, with a cavity exactly fitting the under
chap, both serate (sic) or toothed, and of a thin bony substance, and a cover-
ing over that of a horny-like scale, both very thin and light, weighing but
eight drachms. It was of a yellowish color, clouded with a darkish green,
towards the end or point reddish ; its nostrils were situate just above the
horny substance of the bill, adjoining to the head, which is large and thick,
as is suitable and requisite to sustain a bill of that length and. bigness." A
Natural History of Birds, illustrated with two hundred and five copper plates
curiously engraven from life, and exactly colored by the author, Eleazer
Albin. To which are added Notes and Observations by W. Derhani, D. D.,
Fellow of the Royal Society. London, 1738 (vol. ii. p. 24).
The peculiarities of the bird here described are the abdomen and thighs
being scarlet, aud the tail being scarlet at base and tipped with "beautiful
red." The plate, " exactly colored," seems to represent a Pteroglossus, but of
a species quite unknown, and, in fact, has much the appearance of a fictitious
specimen, though Albin, as above (ii. p. 24), intimates that he has seen it
living. It is the sole authority for the species.
