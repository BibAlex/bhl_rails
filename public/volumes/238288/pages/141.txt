The description of this species is taken from specimens which are not fully
grown ; the proportions are, however, much those of the A. microstomum at the
same age ; this with the large number of costal grooves renders it almost
certain that the full grown individuals are much like those of the latter
species, and very probably of near the same size.
Skin everywhere quite smooth, no trace of pores on the head or parotoid
region in many specimens. Costal folds fourteen, distinct; head folds slightly
marked, the gular Blight. A mediitn dorsal groove.
Head oval, lather flattened and broad, cantlms rostralis somewhat marked.
Month large, canthus behind eye, anterior cantlms of latter marking middle
of margin. Nostril a little nearer eye fissure than length of latter, proba-
bly equal iu older specimens. Width between anterior canthus of eye double
