Easily recognized by its large size, and thick, straight bill. This fine species
is one of the largest and most robust of the group. Numerous specimens in
the Smiths. Mus. from Mexico. " Mirador, near Vera Cruz," "Salvador/'
" Barcio," " San Jeronimo, Vera Paz," and other localities, and iu the Acad.
Mus. from the city of Mexico, from San Juan de Nicaragua, and others labelled
only " Mexico."
Specimens of this bird from San Juan de Nicaragua, undoubtedly authentic
in locality, arc quite as large as others from Mexico. This species is certainly
Icterus menlalis, Less., as above, upon the examination of the description of
which it will be found that a large specimen is required, instead of smaller, as
stated by eminent Ornithologists. Well represented in Des Murs' plate, above
cited ; Lesson's plates are not entirely correct.
