We now enter upon another well defined sub-group, presenting brilliant
colors, and with a wide belt of scarlet on the breast in all of the five species
at present known. Very handsome, and distinguished from each other mainly
by the colors of the bills.
Adnlt $. Bill with the upper mandible yellow, under mandible white at base, with its
terminal half black. Head above black; throat and sides of the neck chestnut ; a narrow
crescent of pale yellow on the neck in front, succeeded by a wide transverse band of scar-
let; abdomen pale yellow; tibia? dull green. Wide space on the neck behind scarlet;
back, wings and tail dark green ; rump scarlet Legs greenish-blue. Sexes alike?
Total length about 14 inches; wing 4 to 5, tail 51, bill (chord) 3k to Z\ inches.
Hub. Northern South America, " Para," "Guiana." Spec, in Mus. Acad. Philada.
Of this gayly colored species four specimens are in the Acad. Mus., which
are all that I have seen. It is easily distinguished by its white and black
under mandible, and is accurately and very handsomely figured by Mr. Gould
as above. Specimens in Acad. Mus. are labelled " Para " and " Guiana," and
occasionally brought also in collections from New Grenada.

Similar to the preceding, but smaller, and with the under mandible entirely black.
Hal). Northern South America, " Rio Madeira " (Natterer). Spec, in Imp. Mus. Vienna
This species I have not seen. Its point of distinction from P. bitorquatus is
mainly its black under mandible, but a few ojaier characters are pointed out
in Sturm's edition of Goulii's Ramphastidae, as above, and in Mr. Gould's
second edition.
