Peteroglossus pluricintcus, Gould Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1835, p. 157.
Gould, Monogr. Ramph. 1st ed. pi. 15, 2d ed. pi. 17.
About the size of P. Aracarf, or rather larger. With two bands on the under parts of the
body; one is black across the breast, the other is mixed black and scarlet across the abdo-
men. Head and neck black, with a rich bluish lustre ; back, wings and tail dark green ;
rump scarlet. Under parts of body (except the bands) fine greenish-yellow or straw-color,
much mixed with scarlet; lower band almost entirely scarlet and expanded on the sides;
tibiae greenish-chestnut.
Upper mandible rich yellow, nearly orange on the basal half of the bill, a wide stripe of
brownish-black on the culmen, under mandible brownish-black, bill enclosed at base by a
raised line of yellow. Female and young male with the ears fine chestnut.
Total length about 18 to 20 inches ; wing to ti 1 ^, tail 7, bill (chord, from corner of mouth
direct to point) 4 to i]4 inches. "Iris yellow" (Lieut. Herndon, in Smiths. Mus.)
Hab. Northern South America, ' Rio Negro," "Rio Orenoque" (Acad. Mils.), "Petas,
Amazon River" (Lieut. Herndon). Spec, in Mus. Acad. Philada. and Mus. Smiths. Wash-
ington.
A beautiful and strongly characterized species, easily distinguished from
either of the preceding by its two bands on the under parts. It is, however,
singularly afflicted with relatives (as follows immediately) and to avoid dis-
couraging entanglements, it is necessary to remember that in this species and
the$next succeeding only, P. pcecilosternus, the upper band (on the breast) is
complete and well defined and black. In all others the upper_band is imper-
fect or rudimentary, or not at all.
5. Pteroglossus poscilosternus, Gould.
Pteroglossus poecilosternus, Gould, Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1843, p. 147.
Gould, Monogr. Ramph. 2d ed. pi. 18. Le Vaill. Ois. Parad. pi. 11.
Only differing from the preceding in having the lower band (on the abdomen) nearly
fine scarlet, or but slightly mixed with black, and the yellow of the under parts less mixed
with scarlet.
Total length 18 to 20 inches.
Hab. Western South America, Peru. Spec, in ^Mus. Acad. Philada. and Mus. Smiths.
Washington.
This species, if such it is, inhabits a more western range of locality than
the next preceding, P. pluricinctus, which it exceedingly resembles. One
specimen in Smiths. Mus. is in Lieut Herndon's collection from the Western
tributaries of the Rio Amazon. One other in the Acad. Mus. bears Mr.
Gould's label, but without locality.
6. Pteroglossus erythropygius, Gould.
Pteroglossus erythropygius, Gould, Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1843, p. 15.
Voy. Sulphur, Birds pi. 28. Gould, Monogr. Ramph. 2d ed. pi. 21 (lower
figure).
Under mandible yellow, tipped with black (the under mandible is black in all others of
this connection). Upper mandible with a wide longitudinal band parallel with its cutting
edge (which the preceding two species have not). Otherwise much resembling P. pluri-
cinctus and pcecilostemus.
Total length 18 inches (Gould).
Hab. Realejo, Western Nicaragua (Mr. Gould).
This species I have not seen. It appears to be much like the various allies
of P. pluricinctus, but has the under mandible yellow in its basal two thirds.
Nearly allied also to the next succeeding [P. sanguineus) but that species has
the uuder mandible black.
7. Pteroglossus sanguineus, Gould.
Pteroglossus sanguineus, Gould, Monogr. Ramph. 2d ed. p. (in text of
P. erythropygius), (1854).
Pteroglossus erythropygius, Cassin, Cat. Michler's collection, Proc.
Acad. Philada., 1860, p. 136.
Gould, Monogr. Ramph. 2d ed. pi. 21 (upper figure).
Resembling the immediately preceding, but with the under mandible black (which is
yellow in that species P. erythnqnjuiiis). A longitudinal band of black near tin' cutting
edge of the upper mandible, as in the preceding (but not in any other of the allies of P.
1867.]
