I have accepted for the genus the name given by De Blainville in his lec-
tures, 1839, and quoted by Seneschal (Dictionare pict. de Hist. Nat., article
Quadrumana, 1839; Hollard, Elem. de Zool., 1839 ; Pouchet, Zool. Class.,
vol. i. p. 39, 1841, et al, ) as not only being much more appropriate for a genus
of animals living among the branches of trees, but also as the name Troglo-
dytes is preoccupied, having been given to a genus of birds by Vieillot (Oisraux
de l'Amerique Septentrionale, p. 52, 1807) five years previous to its having
been bestowed upon this genus of mammalia by Etienne Geoffrey St. Hilaire
(Tableau des Quadrumanes, Annales du Mus., 1812).

From materials in the collection of the Academy I am enabled to present
the following table of measurements of the skulls of the allied species of the
genus Anthropopithecua :
The method of measurement adopted is that suggested by Dr. J. A. Meigs,
in his paper "on the Measurements of the Human Skull."
