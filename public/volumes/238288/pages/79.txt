Gould, Mon. Ramph. 2d ed. pi. 9. Gray, Gen. B. ii. pi. 100.
Like the preceding audi?. Cuvierii, but smaller, and with the pale yellow space on the
throat nearly encircled with white. Bill black, with the culmen and wide transverse band
at base yellowish-green. The yellow on the neck in front dearer defined, and ofa darker
shade than in either of its preceding allies. Upper tail coverts pale yellow.
A wide pectoral hand of scarlet, under tail coverts scarlet, all other parts of the plum -
black. Scarlet of theundertail coverts extending upwards, and appearing somewhat in
the upper tail coverts (which are yellow). Legs bluish-black.
Total length about 'Ji inchesj win;; s'. t . tail 7J, bill ">'._> inches.
Hub. Northern South America, Bogota. Spec in Mas. Acad. Philada.
Smaller than R. Cuvieri, but about the size of R. culminatus. Differs from
the former in having the white space on the throat strongly tinged with yellow
in its lower part only, and in having the upper tail coverts pale yellow, (in
both R. Cuvieri and R. culminatus the upper tail coverts arc orange). In R.
culminatus the throat is pure white and scarlet, pectoral band narrow ; in this
species, R. citreolaemus, the white space is strongly tinged with yellow in its
lower part and the pectoral band, wide, and of a different shade of scarlet.
The only specimens that I have seen of this species are Mr. Gould's types
in the Acad. Mus., both of which were received in the Massena collection, pre-
sented to the Academy by Dr. Thomas B. Wilson.
14. Ramphastos osculans, Gould.
Ramphastos osculans, Gould, Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1835, p. 156.
Gould Mon. Ramph. 1st ed. pi. 5, 2d ed. pi. 10.
Very much like the preceding, JR. citreolaemus, but with the upper tail coverts orange,
and the neck in front orange. Bill black, culmen and wide transverse band at base yellow-
ish-green. Plumage of other parts as in R. citreolaemus.
Total length about 19 inches.
Bab. Northern South America, Guiana, Rio Negro (Mr. Gould).
This species I have not seen. Judging from Mr. Gould's description and
from his superb figure, it differs from R. citreolaemus sufficiently, in the
orange of the neck in front, and upper tail coverts as above, (both of which
are yellow in R. citreolaemus).

Mo-, lead. Philada. and Mus. Smiths. Washington.
This is the first of several species in which the tipper tail coverts are
scarlet. In this species the bill is uniformly clear black, including the cul-
men, and having only a transverse band, at base, of yellowish white. So far
as can be determined from dried specimens the bill in this species is more
flattened than usual in this group and with a wide but shallow groove, leav-
ing the culmen very distinct.
