huila, Mexico, and from Texas. Specimens in the Acad. Mus. are from Mexico,
and from Brownsville and "Ringgold Barracks," Texas. Numerous specimens
in the Smiths. Mus., also, are from Capt. John Xantus' collection in Lower
California, and Colima, Western Mexico.

Small; bill slightly curved; wing moderate; third quill usua'ly longest; tail rather long,
rounded or slightly graduated. Adult male. Head and upper part ot back, wings and tail
black. All other parts dark chestnut. Greater wing coverts tipped with white, quills
edged with grayish white; shoulders chestnut; bill bluish black, lighter at base of under
mandible; legs dark brown. Female. Upper parts of head and body uniform olive green,
under parts pale greenish yellow, smaller and greater wing coverts tipped with white,
quills dark brown edged with grayish white, tail yellowish green. Young male. Like the
female, but with the throat black, and (in adolescence] the chestnut of the adult beginning
to appear on the breast and sides of the neck. Total length about V>y 2 to 7 inches ; wing
S}4, tail 3 inches.
Hab, Eastern North America; Mexico; Central America; New Grenada. Spec, in Mus.
Acad., Philada., and Mus. Smiths., Washington.
An abundant species throughout temperate North America, east of the Rocky
Mountains, and extending its winter migration into Mexico and Central
America. One specimen in the collection of my friend Mr. Lawrence, of New
York, is from Savanilla, New Grenada. Numerous specimens in the Smiths.
Mus., from widely distant localities, but showing no specific variation, whether
from Nebraska or Guatemala. Numerous specimens also in Mus. Acad., from
an equally extensive range of localities.
On this little species the genus Pendulinus is founded by Vieillot, but, in my
opinion, erroneously, the type or most perfect form being very probably P.
boruna, or'perhaps P. Wagleri. The present species is but an humble member
of this highly respectable group, and one which shows its characteristics but
indifferently indeed, I am not without a suspicion that it more properly
belongs to the group Ilyphantes as an aberrant form.
18. Pexdulinus affinis (Lawrence).
Xanthomas affinis, Lawr Ann. Lye, New York, 1851, p. 113.
Like the preceding (P. spurius) in form and colors, but smaller, and restricted to South-
ern North America. Adnlt male. Chestnut, with the head, back, wings and tail black.
Female. Olive green above, pale greenish yellow on the under parts. Total length about
0^4 inches; wing 3, tail 2-& inches.
Hab. Texas; Mexico. Spec, in Mus. Acad., Philada., and Mus. Smiths., Washington.
Appears to be uniformly smaller than P. spurius, and not yet found north of
Texas. It is, however, only to be distinguished from that species by this char-
acter, the shorter wing being the most obvious character in prepared skins.
Specimens from Texas and Mexico in Smiths. Mus., and Acad. Mus., and in the
collection of Mr. Lawrence, New York. This little bird seems to be the resi-
dent species of Texas, and perhaps Mexico ; but its near relative, P. spurius, is
also found in those countries abundantly in the winter, or during the season of
migration.
Ill Genus HYPHANTES, Vieillot.
(Genus Yphantes, Vieill. Analyse, p. 33 (1816).
This is a group of smaller or medium-sized species, characterized by straight,
sharp and rather strong bills, well-developed and somewhat pointed wings,
1867.]
