paying this fine species with the next succeeding in this memoir (P. prostheme-
as the most immediately available character. It resembles and is nearly
allied to that species. Numerous specimens in Acad. Mus. and Smiths. Mus.
from .Mexico and Guatemala, in both of which countries this handsome bird
seems to be abundant.

Wings and tail black. Total length ~ x h to 8 inches. Adolescent, with the black of the
adult beginning to appear mi the back and scapulars, and presenting a mottled yellowish-
green and black, in which plumage this bird i> P.Lessoni, Bonap:, a- above.
/////. Guatemala; <'nsta Rica; southern Mexico. Spec, in Mus. Acad. Philada., and
Mus. Smiths. Washington.
This bird resembles the preceding (P. Wagleri), but t is smaller, and lias the
under tail coverts yellow instead of black. It is undoubtedly P. Lessoni of
Uoiiaparle, as suggested by that distinguished author in Compt. Rend. 1853, p.
834. Numerous specimens in the Smiths. Mus. are from countries above given ;
the type described by Strickland in the Acad. Mus. is labelled " Central
America.''
The young of this bird bears a strong resemblance in colors only to the
adult Icterus melanocephalus and 1. Auduboni. Specimens in this young plu-
mage, and others with the black color beginning to appear on the back, are in
Smiths. Mus. Indifferently figured by Strickland, as above, but better than
Halm's figures, and recognizable with some exertion.
6. Pendulinus macxli-alatus (Cassin).
Icterus maculi-alatus, Cass. Proc. Acad. Philada. 1847, p. 332.
Jour. Acad. Philada., quarto, i. pi. 10, fig. 1.
Resembling the two species immediately preceding, but smaller than either, and having
iho greater wing coverts with ovate spots ofwhite at their tips. Primaries narrowly edged
with white in'their terminal third. Head, neck and back, black : shoulders, lower part oi
back, rump and under parts orange-yellow : under wing coverts yellow. Bill bluish-black,
pale blue at base of under mandible ; legs dark brown. Bill moderate, curved, rather thick
atbase; wing rather long, third and fourth quills longest; tail rather long, somewhat
graduated. Adult. Total length about T 1 .; inches; wing '' ' ,. tail ".!_, inches.
Bab. Guatemala ; "Vera Paz" (Mus. Massena). S] in Mus. Acad. Philada.
The type of this species, described by me as above, remains the only speci-
men thai 1 have seen, though it has been obtained at various localities in
Guatemala by late European naturalists and travellers. This species is of the
same sub-group as the two immediately preceding j P. Wagleri and P.prottke-
melat), bul is easily distinguished by the white spots on the wing coverts.
which are peculiar, and a strong character. The type of this species in the
Acad. Mus.. from the Massena collection, is labelled Cohan. Vera Paz. "which
latter was printed erroneously " Vera Cruz" in my original description.
