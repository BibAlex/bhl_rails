traced in all of them. Specimens of this fine species are in the Smiths. Mus.
from Mexico and Central America, as above given, and in Acad. Mus. from
Mexico.

Ramphastos approximans, Cab., Jour. Orn. 1862, p. 333.
Like the preceding, but with the scarlet band on the lower edge of the yellow space of
the throat conspicuous wad much wider. About the size of the preceding. Mil large. Colors
of bill and of plumage as in the preceding, 1{. earinatus. "Iris yellow" (Mr. .1. Carmiol).
Total length about 21 to 24 inches. Female smaller ; total length about 20 inches.
Bob. Costa Rica, Dota, Grecia, Angostura, San Carlos (Mr. J. Carmiol), San Jose ( Dr. A.
von Frantzius), Nicaragua, San Juan (Mr. De Bareuil), New Grenada, Panama (Mr. J. Mc-
Leannan). Spec, in Mus. Smiths. Washington, and Mus. Acad. Philada.
About the size of the preceding, and with the bill fully as large. Only to
be distinguished from that species, R. earinatus, by the wide and conspicu-
ous scarlet band as above described. Thirteen specimens in the Smithsonian
collections from Costa Rica, and one specimen from Panama, are clearly this
species. Others in Acad. Mus., from San Juan de Nicaragua, are also certainly
this species, and just as certainly correct in locality.
Only differing in size from the next succeeding, R. brevicarinatus. both having
the wide pectoral band of scarlet. It is possible that the yellow of the throat
in R. brevicarinatus is darker, or with a tinge of orange, but at present I could
distinguish between the female of one and the male of the other, with difficulty,
if at all !

Gould, Mon. Ramph. 2d ed. pi. 3.
Much resembling the immediately preceding E. approximans, and with the scarlet pec-
toral band wide and conspicuous, but much smaller, and with the bill shorter. Colors of
bill and of plumage as in the two preceding. R. earinatus and R. approximans (but probably
with the yellow of the throat of a darker shade than in either).
Total length about 16 to IT inches ; wing 7J^, tail GJ^, bill (chord) 4 inches.
Hab. Costa Rica, Chiriqui (Dr. John Evans), " western side of Isthmus of Panama " (Mr.
John Gould), " Mexique " (Bfassena Coll.) Spec, in Mus. Acad. Philadelphia.
In one very fine adult specimen of this speies the yellow of the throat is of
a darker and richer shade, than in any specimen of either of tbe two prece-
ding species. This specimen came in a very interesting collection presented
to the Academy by Dr. John Evans, and collected by him at Chiriqui, East-
ern Costa Rica, thereby confusing somewhat the idea of this species being of
the western coast, exclusively. The type of Mr. Gould is also in Acad. Mus.
but bears no label stating locality.

Colors of the upper mandible divided by a diagonal line from near the nostril to the
edge, within the terminal one-third of its length. Upper portion yellow, lower portion
dark reddish-chestnut, lower mandible dark reddish-chestnut, terminal one-third, black.
Throat yellow, with a transverse band of white and another of scarlet on its lofl er edge.
Upper tail coverts white, lower tail coverts scarlet All other parts of the plumage
black; top of the head and neck behind tinged with reddish-brown or moron, begs bluish-
brown. Young. Upper mandible entirely greenish-yellow, mottled with black at
Plumage as in adult.
Total length about 22 to 24 inches; wing !ii, tail C<i to 7, bill (chord) 6j inches
Hab. Costa Riea, Angostura. San Carlos, Turrialba (Mr. J. Carmiol), .New Grenada, Rio
Nercua(Capt. N. Miehler), "Columbie" (Mr. J. Yerreaux). Spec, in Mus. Acad. Philada.
and Mus. Smith. Washington.
This is the first of three species in which the colors of the upper inaudible
are separated by an oblong or diagonal line from near the nostril to the edge
within its terminal one-third. In this species the bill is large and tumid
