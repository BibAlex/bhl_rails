and the upper mandible dark red or reddish chestnut on its lower portion,
(in R. ambiguus and R. abbreviatus this lower portion is black). Abundance
of specimens in Smiths. Mus. from localities in Costa Rica, and also from
Western New Granada in Capt. Michlers Atrato collection. In Acad. Mus.
this species is labelled New Grenada and " Columbie."

Resembling the preceding, R. Tocard, and with the colors of the npper mandible divided
in the same manner, but wiui the lower portion of the upper mandible and the lowerman-
dible black. Colors of plumage as in that species, R. Tocard, but size rather smaller.
Total length about 20 to 22 inches.

Perhaps rather smaller than the preceding, R. Tocard, but much resembling
it, and the two species have been constantly confounded. The present bird
can always be identified by its black and yellow upper mandible (brick red
or reddish chestnut and yellow in R. Tocard). Specimens in Acad. Mus. are
from Bogota and there are very fine specimens also from Bogota in the mag-
nificent collection presented to the Smithsonian Institution by the Hon. A.
A. Burton, late Minister of the United States to New Grenada.
8. Ramphastos abbreviatus, Cabanis.
Ramphastos abbreviatus, Cab. Jour. Orn. 18C2, p. 334.
Resembling R. ambiguus, but smaller, and with the red tinge (or " wash ") on the head
and neek behind, and on the black of the breast, much more distinct. Kill witb the colors
divided as in the two preceding species, upper portion of upper mandible yellow, lowei
portion and lower mandible black (as in R. ambiguus). Wide pectoral band of scarlet.
Colors of plumage as in R. Tocard and R.ambigitas.
Total length about Is inches; wing 8, tail 0, bill 4i inches.

Our specimen in the Massena collections now in Mus. Acad, is undoubtedly
this species, which, in my opinion, is entirely respectable. It is allied to the
two preceding species, but is smaller and has the bill especially smaller and
not so wide, in the lateral view. The red tinge on the head and breast is
much stronger in this specimen, as stated by Dr. Cabanis in his description of
this species as above cited.

This species is undoubtedly the R. Tucanus of Linnaeus, as suggested by
thai great and philosophical naturalist, Mr. Vigors, in Zool. Jour. ii. p. 471.
It is an entirely peculiar and in some respects isolated species, strongly
characterized by its red bill. Le Vaillant's figure above cited, Ois. Par. pi. 4, is
[Sept.
