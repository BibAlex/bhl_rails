very probably, this bird, though the pectoral band is given as yellow instead
of scarlet. On this figure R. Le Vaillantii is founded as above.
In his first edition Monog Ramph. Mr. Gould describes and figures a bird
to which he gives the name R. citreopyyus, as above. Tn his second edition, he
states that the specimen figured " is made up of the head of R. vitellinus and
body of R. erythrorhynchus."

Resembling the preceding, but with the bill black, culmen yellow, and a large somewhat
triangular spot of red on each side of the culmen near the base of the bill. A wide trans-
verse band at the base of the bill yellow, with a narrow band of scarlet at its anterior edge.
Upper tail coverts rich orange, under tail coverts scarlet, all other parts of plumage black.
Total length about 20 inches.
Hab. Western South America, Bolivia (Mr. Gould.)
This species is unknown to me, though one specimen in Acad. Mus. seems
to approach it, but the upper tail coverts are not so richly colored as in Mr.
Gould's figure, though more decidedly orange than in R. Tucanus, and the
bill being dry and faded long since, does not show the peculiar markings of
the present bird. The specimen is rather shorter, and the tail especially so,
and the bill larger than in the specimens of that species now under exami-
nation. The specimen alluded to is No. 650, and is labelled only " Bresil."

Bill black. Resembling both of the preceding in colors of plumage, especially R. Tuca-
nus, but with the bill black, culmen and wide transverse band at base of bill yellow. Upper
tail coverts orange, under tail coverts scarlet, throat white, faintly tinged with yellow, a
wide pectoral band of scarlet; all other parts of the plumage black.
Total length about 22 to 23 inches ; wing 9 1 /, tail G}4, bill (chord) &A to 7 inches.
Hub. Northern South America, Rio Amazo'ns. Spec, in Mus. Acad. Philada. and Mus.
Smiths. Washington.
Distinguished from R. Tucanus by its black bill and orange upper tail
coverts and seems to be rather larger. From R Inca this species differs in
not having the large spots in the upper mandible nor the scarlet transverse
line at the base of the bill. Specimens in Acad. Mus. labelled " Upper Ama-
zon " and other very fine specimens in the Smiths. Mus. from Lieut. Hern-
don's collections on that river.
The figure in LeVaill.Ois.Par.pl. 5, maybe intended to represent this
species, but the throat is orange and the upper tail coverts scarlet. Stated to
be from Peru. R, Forsterorum, Wagler as above, is founded on this figure.

Bill black. Resembling R. Cuvierii, but smaller, with the bill more compressed, and
with the throat pure white. Bill black, with the culmen and wide transverse band at base
greenish-yellow. Upper tail coverts orange, under tail coverts scarlet, pectoral band nar-
rower and darker red than in R. Cuoierii. All other parts of plumage black. Legs bluish-
black.
Total length 10 to 20 inches ; wing 8 to S]4, tail (% to 7, bill 5 to 5% inches.
Hab. Western South America, Peru? (Hon. J. R.Clay), Upper Amazon (Mr. Gould). Spec,
in Mus. Acad. Philada.
Very much like R. Cuvieri but got up on a smaller scale and clearly
distinct. The pure white throat is a peculiar and immediately available
character, and the pectoral band is narrow and dark red, quite distinct in
shade from that of R. Cuvieri. It is an entirely respectable species.
The only specimens of this species that I have seen, are in the fine collec-
tion made by the Hon. John Randolph Clay, while minister of the United
States to Peru, and are very probably from that country.
