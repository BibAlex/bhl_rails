be only known from three specimens obtained in Bolivia by Mr. Thos. Bridges,
and now or recently in British collections. I am not without a suspicion that
this bird is the young of .4. hypoglaucus, which, judging from Mr. Gould's ex-
cellent plate and description, it closely resembles, except in the colors of the
bill.
2. Ramphomelas.
Genus Ramphomelas, Bonaparte, Ois. De Lattre, p. 84 (1854).
4. Andigena nigrirostris (Waterhouse).
Pteroglossus nigrirostris, Waterh. Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1839, p. 111.
Pteroglossus melanorhynchus, Sturm, ed. Gould's Mon. Ramph.
Gould, Mon. Ramph. 2d ed. pi. 39.
Bill black. Head above and neck behind black; bank and wing coverls sienna-brown;
upper tail coverts pale yellow. Throat and sides of the neck bluish-white ; under parts of
body pale blue; under tail coverts scarlet; tibise dark chestnut; quills greenish-black,
edged externally with brown; tail bluish or greenish-black, the longer leathers tipped
with chestnut; legs greenish-black.
Total length 18 to 19 inches ; wing 6^ to 7, tail S, bill -1 to i}4 inches.
Hub. Northern South America, Bogota. "Columbie." Spec, in Mas. Acid. Philada.
Easily recognized by its entirely black bill, and not intimately resembling
either of its preceding congeners. Specimens in Mus. Acad, were received from
Europe, and are labelled "Bogota" and " Columbie."
5. Andigena spilorhynchds, Gould.
Andigena spilorhynchus, Gould, Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1858, p. 149.
" Crown of the head and back of the neck glossy black ; back, wing coverts
and margins of the primaries dull sienna brown, secondaries bluish-brown ;
upper tail coverts blue, strongly tinged with green ; tail slaty-blue, tinged
with green, the four central feathers largely tipped with chestnut ; band
across the rump sulphur-yellow. Throat and cheeks white, blending into
the light blue of the breast and abdomen; thighs rich chestnut ; under tail
coverts blood-red ; feet greenish-blue, with a lilac tinge on their under sur-
face ; bill black, with a mark of obscure brownish-red at the base of the upper
mandible, which, when viewed in front, much resembles the letter W : this
color advancing for a short distance on each side of the culmen, and extend-
ing down the sides of the base."
"Total length 18 inches; bill 3|, wing 7, tail 7.}, tarsi If."
"Hab. Forests of Beza, on the eastern side of the Cordillera, in Ecuador."
" Differs from .4. nigrirostris in the bill being shorter, broader and much
more robust, and colored with obscure brownish-red at tbe base of the upper
mandible."
One specimen in Acad. Mus. seems to approach this description, but not
sufficiently. It may be the young of A. nigrirostris. Dr. Sclater possesses
specimens from the Rio Napo, Ecuador, and says: "scarcely different from .4.
nigrirostris." (Cat. Am. B. p. 327.)
The following have been described as species of Ramphastos, but are either
not so, or the descriptions are not sufficient :
1. Ramphastos albus, Gm. Syst. Nat. i. p. 357 (1788).
White Toucan, Lath. Syn. i. p. 336.
" All that we know of this species is that the bird is wholly of a pure white,
and that it is now, or was very lately, alive in the menagerie of the King oi
Naples." Which small matter of information has in nowise increased that I
know of. Not given by Latham in Gen. Hist., subsequently published.
2. Ramphastos pulcher, Mull. Syst. Nat. Supp. p. 84 (1776).
Ramphastos pavoninus, Gm. Syst. Nat i. p. 353 (1788).
