This is another strange and peculiar form in the generic group Icterus, and
belongs almost as properly to Cassicus. The colors, too, are quite peculiar,
and approximate to the same group. It may be termed an analogue of Cussi-
culus, in the genus Cassicus, if not more nearly related, but I am' by no means
confident that this bird does not represent a peculiar generic division. Nu-
merous specimens in Smiths. Mus. from Northern Mexico and Lower Califor-

given in Prof. Baird's plates, as cited.
II. Genus PENDULINUS, Vieillot.
Genus Pendulums, Vieill. Analyse, p. 33 (1816).
This group is composed of birds characterized by having more slender,
lengthened, and weaker forms than in Icterus, with more slender, curved, and
gradually tapering bills, and long tails, either rounded at the ends or gradua-
ted. It is, in my opinion, a distinct and strongly marked generic group, of
which the species here given as P. bonana is perhaps to be regarded as typical.
The type of the genus, according to Vieillot, is the North American P. spuri-
M.?, but in this respect he is probably in error, thai species being, very probably,
one of the most aberrant. Fifteen species of this genus are in the .Museum of
the Philadelphia Academy and the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution,
Washington. Three others given in the succeeding pages ( /'. rufig aster, P. ru-
faxillus, and P. chUensis) are not contained in either of the two collections
mentioned. In this group, as in the preceding, I have given short descriptions
of all the species of which I have any knowledge, and have copied the original
descriptions of the three species to me unknown, above mentioned.
