NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 213
Who the editors were, in charge of the department of Ornithology, is more
than I know ; but perhaps some of the more intelligent of the English orni-
thologists can find out, if they think it worth while. An inquiry in "Notes
and Queries " would bring it. John Wilkes, of the County of Sussex, Esquire,
is printed on every title-page as the responsible editor throughout, and for the
present, as he was presumably an entirely respectable person, I take him at his
word, and hold him accordingly, preferring, however, that it be distinctly un-
derstood and remembered that there was anotherof the same name (who did not
concern himself with Encyclopae lire, so far as I ever heard, but was in a much
less creditable business). In a preface to Vol. I of the octavo work it is stated
that "This comprehensive system of Natural History was begun by the late E.
Sibly, M. D. , who made considerable progress in it before his decease;" but
it is not stated that be was at all engaged in the Encyclopaedia. Nor is the
exact amount of headway made by him discernible at present, I think, in
either book.
In the octavo work, the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth volumes con-
tain the ornithology, in the first four of which all the birds of Ginelin's edition
of the Syst. Nat. are given, with some additions from Pallas, Turton, Pennant
and others, with copious notes and translations well written and readable.
The last, that is the eighth volume, is exclusively devoted to Le Vaillaut, and
c mtains a translation of nearly the whole of his Ois. d'Afrique and numer-
ous copies of his plates. The latter were given previously in the Encyclopae-
dia, but the text is much enlarged, and apparently nearly a literal translation,
while in the Encyclopaedia, where the species are named, usually only a short
abstract of Le Vaillant's text is given. There are not many better popular
Ornithologies, yet extant, than these same volumes of this "Genuine and
Universal System of Natural History," and they deserve favorable mention,
at least, alongside of anything in that line in the English language yet pro-
duced.
The following is a list of the species of birds named and described in the
Encyclopaedia Loudiuends, those names having priority and consequent claim,
valid in equity, being given in small capitals. The numbers of the species
are the same as given in numerical order in the Linnaeau genera to which they
belong (in the Encyclopaedia) :
List of Birds named and described as new (but often erroneously) in the Encyclo-
paedia Lmdinensis, with synonyms and references to plates, and straightened
out, in general, according to the ability of the present editor.
