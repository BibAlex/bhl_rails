POINTS TO CONSIDER
Factors in Farm Stand Success
PAUL REES
Changes in both agriculture and the mari<etplace
have forced today's producer to redirect his efforts
from a totally production-oriented enterprise to one
that includes a strong marketing component Most
farmers are accomplished producers and excel at
growing quality products Unfortunately, many forget
that they must now be accomplished marketers as
well.
Farm stands are just one of several different types
of direct sale opportunities that todays producer can
use to get their product from the field to the
consumers table In order to minimize labor and costs
and to get the most from marketing efforts, farm stand
operators should take some time to consider the cus-
tomer and what can be done to better meet his/her
needs and expectations. As I come to the end of my
first year as an Extension Educator for Agricultural Re-
sources, I recall the numerous occasions I've met with
agricultural producers and consumers throughout
Sullivan County Personal observations, reinforced by
discussions with both farm stand operators and their
customers, have identified several key factors that
contribute to the success of local farm stands
APPCARANCE
How does the farm stand look to the customer? The
appearance of the farm stand is one of the most influ-
ential factors for attracting and keeping the customer
The farm stand frontage, parking area, and signage are
the first and last things the customer will see. Many of
today's consumers have become accustomed to shop-
ping at large commercial outlets with acres of waxed
floors, miles of steel shelving, well-labeled products,
and colorful displays Farm stand operators should
consider this fact when planning the floor layout and
display area This does not mean that the farm stand
should be polished or "antiseptic" in appearance
What it does mean is that customers have come to ex-
pect a clear floor space, open aisles, accessible prod-
uct displays, and visible, easy-to-read signage. Proper
lighting is also important as consumers tend to shy
away from dark areas even in supermarkets!
HOSPITALITY
Hospitality is all-important in building and maintain-
ing your customer base Good service, a friendly
smile, and that extra little bit of attention to detail
will go a long way to keeping repeat customers
Within a year, the farm stand operator can look for-
ward to hundreds and perhaps thousands of indi-
vidual transactions with customers. Operators should
treat each and every transaction as if it was a major
product sale Anticipate the repeat sale and treat the
customer with genuine attention. The old adage that
""the customer is always right" holds pretty true in
most instances
QUALITY PRODUCT
The chance to buy a higher quality product draws con-
sumers to the local farm stand. Most prefer produce
with a "just-picked freshness" to that which is waxed,
shrink-wrapped, or made available only after
long-term storage. Farm stand operators should also
realize that their responsibility for the quality of their
product doesn't necessarily end when the consumer
leaves the stand Quick, friendly advice about prod-
uct handling can prevent transport and storage prob-
lems for the customer Leaflets and other printed ma-
terial covering handling, storage, and processing are
used and appreciated as well
VARIETY
Successful marketing means giving the customer what
he/she wants â€” and todays consumers are used to the
convenience of "one-stop-shopping "" This can place
the farm stand in a difficult situation unless it is able
to provide not only quality products, but a broad se-
lection as well Customers are attracted by opportuni-
ties to select from a variety of choices, they enjoy
""companion products" such as herbs used in process-
ing or other products that enhance flavor or create a
variety of uses If a farm stand has built a reputation
for a certain product, the operator should consider of-
fering more than one variety or finding alternatives in
the way the product is packaged or processed Many
traditional farm stands that have offered only veg-
etables or fruit are now offering ornamentals, bedding
plants, or seasonals such as pumpkins or holiday
wreaths These products are excellent for minimizing
overhead during slower months while at the same
time taking advantage of the "unique"' opportunity to
provide an infrequently available product
ACCESSIBILITY AND CONVENIENCE
Accessibility and convenience are also highly valued
by the consumer Distance from home to the market is
