FROM THE
Cut Flowers
Tarnrmj Hathaway
Growing cut flowers is new for
me My focus in tfie nursery
business has been on growing pe-
rennials in containers, so it's been
cfiallenging to try my hand at field-
growing both annuals and perenni-
als We offer a pick-your-own
cutting garden along with fresh
bouquets which I make up daily
We use the honor system, which I
think makes people feel good,
trustworthy
All my knowledge about growing
perennials has come from practical
experience, reading, listening to
others, and of course, making mis-
takes Im learning about cut flow-
ers the same way While reading
the book Cut Flowers lor Sale (which
inspired me to try this venturel. I
read about the Association of Spe-
cialty Cut Flower Growers lASCFGl
I wrote to the ASCFG and they sent
me two of their most recent issues
of "The Cut Flower Quarterly '
What excited me most was to
find out that this national organiza-
tion was broken down into eight
regions, each with its own director
And information on crops from
other growers in the Northeast was
great!
"The Cut Flower Quarterly" is
full of information on pricing, pro-
duction and post-harvest proce-
dures, and trial results of new
varieties A culture profile of one
specific variety is in each issue
Marketing strategies are also fo-
cused upon Members can learn of
upcoming seminars--regional and
national, new books and publica-
tions, and upcoming legislation
And a classified ad section is free
to all members
A second publication, which the
ASCFG distributes yearly, is its
membership directory It provides
a state-by-state listing of growers
of both fresh and dried crops It in-
cludes a brief description of their
operations — size (both field and
greenhouse), major crops and.
when available, phone and fax
numbers, addresses and contact
people This directory also has a
listing of major crops from "Achil-
lea" to ■"Zinnia." These are in table
format and includes each grower
Iby state! and the type of crop
produced (fresh, dried, or both) I
find this format, with the informa-
tion indicating what varieties are
being grown where and how theyre
produced, very helpful
The directory also has sections
for growers interested in contrac-
tual arrangements, buyers and
wholesalers of both fresh and dried
floral material, suppliers, retailers,
and designers
The ASCFG also holds an annual
national conference offering semi-
nars, a trade show, floral design
displays, and informal regional
meetings where members can dis-
cuss specific growing and marketing
strategies
Ive found this organization to
be extremely helpful in planning
our own operation. It has made a
difference in my crop choices and
will help me in finding a niche in
the cut flower industry
I feel that everyone, from a per-
son with a small roadside stand
like our own to the owners of larger
operations — both field and green-
house, can benefit from the ASCFG
As stated in its directory, "our es-
sential goal, simply put. is to help
growers of specialty cut flowers
produce and sell a better crop "
