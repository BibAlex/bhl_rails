NEW HAMPSH
Research Fund Begun
At its October 1 1 Meeting, the Board
(Ann, Bob, Chris, Henry, Peter, and
Tammyl listened to a presentation
by Mm Truncellito, a member of
Davis, Towie, Gearan & Truncellito,
a Concord insurance and financial
services firm, who spoke briefly on
investment possibilities for a
NHPGA fund, the interest from
which would be used to support
research and projects (not neces-
sarily in New Hampshire) that would
benefit NHPGA members and the
states green industry
After jim left, and after much
vigorous and animated discussion,
the board voted on a motion made
by Henry and seconded by Peter
to authorize the investment of
$10,000, $5000 in I OOS and the re-
maining $5000 — minus expenses-in
The Board hopes to continue
adding to the fund through contin-
ued profitability of its current ros-
ter of events and perhaps some
specific fund-raising
It feels that continued research
is vital to the health of the indus-
try and that as government funding
declines, organizations such as the
NHPGA must fund the new work
(An omission; in the list of people
donating time and effort to the
Summer Meeting, we forgot to
mention that Rick Perillo, the orga-
nizer of the all-you-can-eat barbe-
cue of our last few years, contrib-
utes an amount based on the num-
ber of people he feeds back to the
NHPGA for use in its scholarship
fund or other membership-oriented
activities This years amount was
$12^ 00 and will be added to the
NHPGA Research Fund We thank
Rick and appreciate his support of
the NHPGA I
