canadensis 'Hussi') grows only two
inches a year — that these figures
seem more useful for landscapers
than final mature sizes.
Weeping conifers include cuitivars
of Norway spruce, white pine, Scotch
pine, American arborvitae, hem-
lock...
Some deciduous stock is grown as
well: the native Canoe Birch {Betula
papyrifera), the bark of which doesn't
turn white until the tree is about six
years old — "most nurserymen grow
■White Spire,' which gets its white
trunk at an earlier age, but isn't as
hardy;" Katsura [Cercidipkyllum ja-
ponicum). with its foliage scent after
frost reminiscent of cotton candy...
Weeping deciduous varieties in-
clude a Weeping Birch (B. pendula
'Youngii') Camperdown Elm (U/mus
glabra 'Camperdowni')--which is
Scotch Elm grafted onto American
Elm stock, and two varieties of
Weeping Siberian Pea [Caragana
arborescens 'Pendula'l, one ("Pendula
Walker'l a threadleaf.
EQUIPMENT is a major investment
("good equipment saves money")
and includes a Knuckleboom loader
(with two hydraulic extensions); a
Skidsteer Loader, a crawler excava-
tor, a tree spade ("anyone digging
large trees by hand is not doing it
efficiently"), a Kinkelder cultivator:
made in Denmark, it has "vibratine
teeth" (basically, each tooth is actu-
ally the end of a coiled spring fas-
tened to the frame; the frame can
be adjusted with a hand crank to
any width from five to eight feet.
His tractor is a four-wheel drive
25-hp Pasquali — articulated-with a
pivot point at its center — for greater
maneuverability.
Some of the best equipment is of
his own invention: a scout leep has
metal frames welded both over the
hood and behind the seat; a 7x5'
piece of plywood fits into each. The
scout — moveable, with these two
large flat surfaces — is used for as-
sembling orders and hauling (the
frames have lips so plants don't
slide). It works well.
Koelb also landscapes ("most
landscapers use a surprisingly lim-
ited pallet; I try to give more choice")
— mostly for summer people in the
Waterville Valley and Lakes areas
He works up designs from polaroids
taken at preliminary visits. Cur-
rently, one of his more unusual de-
signs (for a local Mexican restaurant)
includes two Snake Spruce IPicea
abies vergata) and cold-hardy opuntia
cacti. His trademark is his familiar-
ity with and use of these more un-
usual conifers ("Bristlecone Pine —
Pinus aristata not a bad foundation
plant because it's so slow-grow-
ing"); but he works within the natu-
ral landscape ("usually a lot of
rock"), trying "to compliment the
area with something that isn't going
to throttle the customer with main-
tenance." Customers come to the
nursery and choose the material —
often the specific tree — they want
in their personal landscapes.
Advertising is word of mouth. He
guarantees "plants I install if pay-
ments are adhered to"
In winter he runs a ski area on
Campton Mountain for a private
community in Waterville Valley.
The area is small (about 800 feet
vertical drop), but its serious: a
double chair lift, a rope tow,
six downhill trails ("one challeng-
ing"), cross-country skiing — but
there's no snow-making, so snow
is important.
HIS HOME is on a rise overlooking
16 acres of pasture where his beef
cattle graze; beyond that is the road,
then the nursery, the river, the ridge
line. . beside his house, on a rocky
hillside, he's built a garden that's
both pleasure and a place to learn
about the plants he offers. He's
found that A&ies concolor 'Candicans'
(Candicans Concolor
Fir) grows well on this high spot,
far better than in the nursery below.
("Late frosts in the valley seem to
kill the early growth--the trees hang
on, but never prosper") The three
Mugo Pine in the garden are two
feet across; some in the nursery are
three times the size. He's sur-
prised — all were started from seed
("the best are from seed") at the
same time — and sees the difference
in size as "the surprising amount of
genetic variation."
Other surprises? Yes — two fine
Weeping Coast Cedars IChamaecyparis
noolkatensis Pendula) — zone 6 or 7
trees — are thriving — and should not
be; and a threadleaf Japanese Maple
survives — at least the portion that's
covered by snow.
The garden includes ground cov-
ers and opuntia. but it's mostly
trees — an exceptional Larix eurolepis
'Varied Directions' — 18 feet wide — is
genuinely spectacular.
RIGHT NOW, dwarf conifers and
weeping species are in fashion — gar-
den centers around the state have
seen increased interest in both. But
after the fads have receded, the
once-fashionable material can be
seen for its genuine merit. And there
would seem to be no better place to
do this than here in this northern
valley insulated by distance and
snow (B.P.)
