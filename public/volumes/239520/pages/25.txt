UPDATE
The month of September held
true to my predictions: sam-
ples continued to arrive throughout
the month, resulting in the greatest
number of samples for the month
of September in the nine years I've
been here Thankfully, the num-
bers dropped by half during Octo-
ber and I can finally direct some
time to computerizing the PDL
records
The majority of the diseases di-
agnosed during September and Oc-
tober were also problems that were
also seen during the month of Au-
gust Thanks to the warm weather,
brown patch and Pythium contin-
ued to plague home lawns and a
few golf course putting greens
The moisture and somewhat cooler
temperatures during early Septem-
ber created ideal conditions for
mushroom growth As a result, I re-
ceived several telephone calls from
worried home owners concerned
with ridding their lawns of the
troublesome fungi I usually sug-
gested mowing or having patience
and waiting for drier weather Pow-
dery mildew was also a common
problem on home lawns during
September and October A few in-
dividual cases of anthracnose on
deciduous trees, Botrytis on
various flowering plants, and mis-
cellaneous fruit rots were also di-
agnosed
There were a few interesting or
important diseases that were diag-
nosed in the last two months
iSept -Oct I Five samples of fir
seedlings (balsam and fraserl with
basal Phomopsis canker were diag-
nosed The disease appears to be
more of a problem on plants that
have been stressed Drought stress
(l<593 and |une 1004), cold injury
before a good snow cover was es-
tablished, and a late frost in (Vlay
|004 all contributed to predispos-
ing the tissues at the base of the
stems to infection by Phomopsis
Similar problems on fir seedlings
were reported by most of the diag
nosticians at a recent Northeast pa
thology meeting in Ithaca. NY
Phyllosticta needle blight was diag
nosed on balsam, fraser. and
concolor firs This needle blight
has been increasing in frequency
over the last few years Very little
is known about the life cycle of the
fungus, but the general consensus
among tree pathologists is that in-
fections first occur around the time
of bud break and may continue for
three weeks or more Three hem-
lock samples with Fabrella needle
blight were received in September
This is a disease that occurs spo-
radically, usually after periods of
stress caused by drought or winter
injury Symptoms of Rhizosphaera
needlecast on spruce began to
show up in mid-October The
symptoms were most likely the re-
sult of infections that occurred dur-
ing late-August or early-September
The most notable problems on
greenhouse crops were Fusarium
wilt and impatiens necrotic spot vi-
rus IINSVI on cyclamen Fusarium
wilt seems to be a significant prob-
lem in the cyclamen crop this year
Symptoms include yellowing and
wilting of the older, outer leaves,
stunting, and eventual collapse of
the entire plant Another diagnos-
tic feature of the disease is a black
streaking or discoloration of the
vascular system that is evident
when a cross-sectional cut is made
through the corm Infected plants
should be destroyed and the re-
mainder of the crop should be
drenched with an appropriate fun-
gicide At the recent Northeast pa-
thology meetings, Rob Wick |U
fVlass I reported the occurrence of
another disease called Cryptocline
that has symptoms similar to
Fusarium wilt. The discoloration is
limited primarily to the upper
portions of the corm, however,
and streaking also occurs in the
petioles Pythium root rot has shown
up on a few poinsettias, but doesn't
seem to be a major problem
During the next month, be sure
to protect shrubs and against snow
and ice damage and winter desic-
cation If the Old Farmers Almanac
is correct, we should have snow
cover by the end of November!
Poinsettias should continue to be
monitored for powdery mildew (to
the best of my knowledge, only
four cases have been reported na-
tionally! If mildew is suspected,
please submit samples to the PDL
for confirmation As I mentioned in
the last issue, geraniums should be
carefully inspected and monitored
for bacterial blight (see the |une/
luly issue of The Plantsman for a de-
scription of symptoms) And re-
member, nothing beats good SANI-
TATION and careful monitoring for
preventing disease problems
There is one additional note I'd
like to mention and that is that a
fee system will be instituted for
samples submitted to the Plant Di-
agnostic Lab by late spring. 1005
The exact fee and final details will
be reported in one of the upcom-
ing issues of The Plantsman
If uou wish lo suhmil plant material to
the PDL for diagnosis, send samples to
Dr Cheryl Smith. Plant Diagnosti( Lab.
Nesmith Hall. UNH, Durham. NH
03824 Samples should he a(companied
by an idenlili(ation form {available from
ifour county Cooperative Extension office]
There is no fee [at this time) Cheryl
