AG DEVELOPMENT UPDATE
Gail McWilliam
Did you know?
New Hampshire agriculture contributes nearly $300 million
to our state s economy each year and almost a third of this amount
can be attributed to the ornamental horticulture industry.
(SPREAD THE WORD!)
This is the type of information that the New Hamp-
shire Department of Agriculture's Division of Agricul-
tural Development has been compiling and distribut-
ing during the past year Determining estimates for
the value of New Hampshire agriculture has been an
Important step in creating awareness The informa-
tion has since been presented at every opportu-
nity — to the media, to consumer groups, agricultural
groups, schools, legislators, etc. The more everyone
knows and understands about the kind of contribu-
tion agriculture makes to New Hampshire, the better
for all aspects of the Industry, now and in the future.
It s critical for producers to also know and under-
stand not only their segment of the industry, but
how it fits into the big picture and take an active
role in telling the uninformed about New Hampshire
agriculture
The mission of the Division of Agricultural Devel-
opment is to enhance and expand market opportuni-
ties for New Hampshire agricultural businesses The
Division also provides consumer information relative
to the industry and New Hampshire products and
handles media inquiries as well as other administra-
tive tasks
Resources are limited for agricultural development
activities, so that means developing partnerships
with other agencies and organizations to develop a
team effort on behalf of the industry and share costs
The Division tries to focus on the "big picture" of
New Hampshire agriculture while encouraging and as-
sisting the individual commodity associations to mar-
ket their own segment of the industry and work
jointly for the benefit of all agriculture
