HOW ABOUT HERBS
Promote 'Native ' Here are some
herbs — all native — that were be-
ing used in North America long be-
fore the first European colonists came
lack in the Pulpit [krisaema tri-
phyllum], sometimes called Indian tur-
nip, is a woodland perennial wild-
flower and a fine shade garden herb
that was once used as a headache
treatment The root, which contains
the poison calcium oxalate, was
pounded with water into a pulp and
then allowed to dry, rendering it
harmless. In this state, it was used
as snuff and a medicinal tea About
two feet tall when mature, a clump
of 'lacks' is a fine accent plant
Mountain Mint [Pycnanlhemum piio-
sum] has a pungent mint-like odor
and an interesting pinkish-white
cluster of flower heads that dry well
Unlike many mints, this one is
not rampantly invasive, but grows
steadily into a larger clump Native
to the eastern United States, it was
used by Native Americans It can
take shade or sun. moist or drier soil
Bearberry or Upland Cranberry
{Arctoslaphyhs wva-urs/l, a member of
the heath family, was once used as
an "herbal tobacco" and the dried
leaves as an astringent tea consid-
ered soothing for indigestion It's a
fine herbal ground cover, a trailing
perennial shrub with deep green,
odorless, leathery foliage and bland
red berries that can be cooked and
mixed with other berries. They are
a favorite food of bears in spring
Bergamont or Bee Balm {Monarda
didyma) is a well-known herb — and
it's a native The leaves, stems, and
blossoms of this vigorous herb
makes a tasty natural tea used (or
soothing sore throats and settling
upset stomachs The newer varieties
of Monarda are less prone to mildew
and will grow in a partially shaded
or sunny garden This herb also
combines well with regular tea Ac-
cording to legend, this was the tea
that was drunk in place of the tea
that was thrown into Boston Harbor
at the beginning of the Revolution-
ary War
Borage iBorago oflidnalis] is a com-
mon native herb, the leaves of which
make a tea rich in calcium and po-
tassium. Native Americans used bor-
age to promote healing and relieve
cold discomforts It's a rather sprawl-
ing herb, but the clear blue flowers
are delicate and lovely It grows
readily from seed
Hepatica or Liverieaf {Hepalka
amerkana] is a small wildflower whose
leaves appear after its white, blue,
or pinkish flowers It makes a lovely
ground cover, growing about six
inches high. It does best in partial
shade and rich neutral soil and was
used medicinally for liver problems

Finally. Filipendula ulmaria. a native
North American plant commonly
called Queen of the Meadow, is a
dramatic perennial for the sunny
moist herb garden I have seen it in
gardens in Ohio, but have not found
it in a nursery here It grows six feet
tall and has yellow flowers It's used
as a dye plant, making a greenish-
yellow dye. and is fragrant
These are just a few of the native
plants that have herbal uses that
are not commonly seen within the
boundaries of area herb gardens,
although they certainly would be
attractive there

BOOK REVIEW
The editor was recently given an
opportunity to review Grcwcr-laltis on
Retailing edited by |ohn Saxtan pub-
lished by Ball Publishing, containing l«2
pages of highlights from articles pub-
lished in GrowciTalfn magazine from Sep-
tember, IQ88 through |une IQO^
The book is divided into seven chap-
ter headings (Marketing. Customer Ser-
vice Employee Management etc I un-
der which are anywhere from eight to 2'^
related selections These range in size
from a couple paragraphs to six or seven
pages Twenty-two black and white
photographs illustrate points made in
the text
This book is basically about what has
been done — these are the solutions in-
terviewers observed when visiting retail
greenhouses and garden centers across
the continent Most aren't as surprising
as they are sensible strategies based on
the basics of service efficiency quality
Some variations on these themes were
clever — even funny i "Moose Bucks" was
one), and people were aware of the im-
portance of trends but when you read
this you realize the industry is run by
very praaical. no-nonsense people
At first I wanted to know (ww these
people did these things Then, as I was
reading about a florist who grew tired of
the fake country facades on the busi-
nesses around her and decided to "go
Victorian" and was wondering just how
she went about creating this transforma-
tion, I began to see that maybe the
point of the piece was a message — "Be
Different than your Competition "" The
book is not a how-to-do manual but
more of an inspirational tract — a series
of small stories — most with an underly-
ing message which--if appropriate and
followed correctly — could lead to the
readers self- improvement (i e more

Rather than wonder how Bob
Madduxs "Delphi Way," an intriguing list
of 14 rules on which to base employer/
employee relationships, came about
( "Did these evolve"' Or all happen at
once in the midst of a crisis"'), you real-
ize that the article is giving you the mes-
sage "'Prevent high turnover by treating
employees well "" along with 14 guide-
posts to help you do just that
It works — you'll get lots of ideas And
some will be genuinely helpful It's a
book in which to browse — but to maxi-
mize its usefulness you might begin by
reading two of the longer selections
("Marketing — What It Is and How to Do
It "■ and "Practical Ways to Discover and
Serve Your Niche Market." both in the
middle of Chapter Sixl and use these as
a reference point from which to see both
your own business and the many ideas
offered
The only mention of New Hampshire
I noticed is of a Vermont firm filling the
bedding plant contract with "the
Balsam's Grand Resort Hotel in Dixville
Notch, site of the first open poll in the
presidential primary" — which seems to
suggest that we may not be at
marketings cutting edge — which might
be another reason to read the book
It's compact efficient — it's nice having
all these ideas (probably hundreds, both
stated and impliedl in one place And
its upbeat — it might feel good in late
lanuary to have something on your desk
thats filled with nothing but success
