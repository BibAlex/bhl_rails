"THE CLIMBER played his
line out slowly as he cdccd
toward the end of the almost horiEon-
tal oak leader. His cliinbinÂ« rope was
looped over a high crotch on the main
trunk. He kept his weight on his rope
to help maintain his balance. The
bark of the leader was smooth and
cluttered with suckers and deadwood.
The stinging hair of old gypsy moth
larvae irritated his bare arms as he
inched out the limb to do his pruning.
Uaing the rope again, he returned to
the trunk, repeating these hazardous
journeys several times before the
tree was pruned properly."
Such are the daily tasks of a professional tree
climber, as he becomes more trusting of his
si<ills and gear, his competency quotient rises
In modern arboriculture, the scenario has be
come less frequent
Today, many tree companies have varied pieces of
equipment to move a climber around the tree automati-
cally Aerial lifts, cranes, brush chippers, stump grinders,
spray rigs, and loaders are some of the entrees on the
arborists' menu Climbing aids, cabling equipment, chain
saws, fertilizing needles, pole pruners and so forth are
just some of the endless desserts
As in many fields, the improvements in equipment
have been achieved through constant modifications. For
a practicing arborist with over twenty-five years of expe-
rience tucked under his climbing belt, each change usu-
ally is greeted with heavy skepticism, followed by great
wonderment that the new thing works so
well
At the beginning of my work career,
aerial lifts, or bucket trucks, were quite new
in our industry These were developed and
used primarily for the utility end of our
business Most utility poles were shorter
and trimming specifications were narrower,
so many buckets only had a working height
of about 45 feet Poles have gotten higher,
trimming specifications wider, creating a
need for more sophisticated lift devices.
Buckets reach higher and can work at
greater angles to be able to reach laterally
for greater distances
Today also has seen a much greater use
of lift trucks in the private sector of our
trade Buckets are being mounted on the
rear of many trucks to enable an operator
to back to a tree, getting more height and
keeping away from the cab
Operation of many of these new lifts is
quite simple and mastering their manipula-
tion is much easier than hooking up a VCR Conse-
quently, our vocabulary is even changing: instead of tree
surgeons and climbers, we seem to have more techni-
cians and operators
Brush chippers of the past were definitely beasts to
use They were what we called "drum chippers." which
had whirring knives that ripped the brush from an un-
suspecting hand Generally, you had to throw the brush
at the chipper mouth, one stem at a time and exit in a
hurry, before you were whipped to death by its end
Today's modern chipper is mostly of the disc-type,
which pulls the brush from you in a much more civilized
manner The chipper has two rollers, which enables the
operator to feed whole armfuls of brush into the chipper
mouth The drum chippers used to spit wood back at
the operator, but today's chippers can chew a very large
diameter piece of wood Remembering those old drum
chippers make me shudder in several ways They not
