VI. MIXED BREEDS.
MIKE SULLIVAN, a very intelligent bar clerk at
Johnsonburg, Elk County, called the writer's at-
tention to the length of the tail of a mounted cat in
the hotel at that prosperous lumber town. "A great
many wild cat hides, taken in Elk, McKean, and Forest
Counties are shipped to a fur dealer in town," said
Sullivan, "and I have been struck by the length of their
tails. I put a foot rule on this one, and it measured
exactly twelve inches. That cat, I am told, weighed
forty-one pounds. We have quite a few varieties of
cats in these parts. First of all, there is the Canada
Lynx, grey in color, with tabs on his ears and hair on
the soles of his feet; a big, fierce fellow, often weigh-
ing fifty pounds. He has always been a scarce cat,
even the Indians say he was never plentiful. Secondly,
there is the true wild cat, or 'Bob' cat, reddish in color,
mottled like a fawn, smaller than the Canadian Lynx,
but with a longer tail. Thirdly, there is the tame cat
gone wild — escaped from lumber camps and the like.
Some of these grow very big, and in one or two gen-
erations are brindled and bushy tailed. Many people
call them 'coon cats.' Then we have the fourth kind,
the mixture, hybrid or mongrel, whatever you call it,
between the Canada Lynx and the Wild Cat, or Bay
Lynx. In my opinion, that cat on yonder shelf is a
cross between a lynx and a Bob Cat. Old hunters tell
me that the product of that cross has a longer tail than
either lynx or Bob Cat — a throw back to the type of
long ago. There may also be crosses between lynxes
