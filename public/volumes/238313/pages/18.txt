PENNSYLVANIA WILD CATS. 13
mens of animals and birds. If the present bounty law,
giving $6 for every wild cat's scalp, is continued, few
cats will be left in the State by 1921. They are wholly
absent from many localities where they were fairly
numerous five years ago. They are practically extinct
in the Blue Mountains, the Bald Eagle Alountains, and
the main chain of the Alleghenies. In Northeastern
Pennsylvania a few are taken annually at Blooming
Grove Preserve, in Pike County; in Clinton County
some are trapped every year in Otzinachson Park —
drawn thither by the rabbits and entrails of deer — but
these preserves will be responsible for the destruction
of all the cats in their respective localities; thev will
last longest in parts of McKean, and Cameron Coun-
ties, away from settlements, in the Seven Mountains in
Centre and Mifilin Counties, and in Eastern Clinton
County, in the Zimmerman country, unless destroyed
by the increasingly frequent forest fires. There is a
great diversity of coloring in specimens of Pennsyl-
vania wild cats. They are mostly of a cinnamon brown
color, black striped or spotted on the legs and shading
into a white or marbled on the belly. Some are of a
rich chestnut brown in color, beautifully spotted
with black, while a few are of a grey-drab in color, the
black markings resembling bars rather than dots.
They usually have a white patch on the ears.
