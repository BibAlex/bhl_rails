16 PENNSYLVANIA WILD CATS.
driven into Clinton and ]\Iifflin Counties by forest fires
from their northern range, but never remained long.
I think that the Canada Lynx is now totally extinct in
Pennsylvania. It was a fierce fighter, but I have heard
of Seneca Indians who tamed it to follow them about
like dogs. Among the Pennsylvania Dutch it was sup-
posed to be endowed with the power to look through
opaque bodies, hence the old expression of a person
with keen sight being 'lynx eyed.' " Rhoads records
instances of catamounts taken in Cameron, Potter,
Columbia, Forest, Lackawanna, Lycoming, IMcKean,
Monroe, Pike, Wayne, Somerset and Tioga Counties.
Jesse Harman and son Ed., accompanied by Sam
Hotter, "California Sam," a noted trapper, took a cat-
amount at the head of McElhattan Run, in Clinton
County, early in 1003. Out of a dozen cats caught by
these hunters that winter it was the only Canada Lynx.
It weighed sixty-five pounds and measured exactly five
feet from tip to tip.
