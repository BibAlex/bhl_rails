PENNSYLVANIA WILD CATS.
At the close of this dissertation, the words of wiiich
became indellibly impressed on the writer's mind. Her-
lacher pointed to a second stuffed animal, on a shelf
above another of the mirrors. "There." he said, "is a
true wild cat — Lynx Rufus — a fine specimen ; it
weighed thirty-five pounds wdien I killed it two

Keystone Commonwealth. As curios they were in
great demand, but he regretted not having taken them

wild cat of today is the bay lynx, the real catamount is
the Canada lynx. P.ut the next few chapters will go
