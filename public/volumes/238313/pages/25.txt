20 PENNSYLVANIA WILD CATS.
and Bob Cats and tame cats gone wild ; it happened in
the old country, why not here?" The above observa-
tions, which have also been advanced by C. W. Dickin-
son, of Smethport, have a considerable element of
common-sense to them. In deer breeding there is a
tendency to throw back to good-headed, or poor headed
ancestors, as the case may be. In South Carolina there
are frequent cases of palmation in the deer, due to
some English fallow bucks liberated by planters in the
Eighteenth Century. A cross between two varieties of
short-tailed lynxes might provide a longer tailed type.
In other respects the cat in the Johnsonburg house
showed an accentuation of characters. Its hind legs
were apparently twice the thickness of the front legs,
and very much longer. It was an unsymmetrical ani-
mal. Perhaps much of this was due to faulty taxi-
dermy, but that would not account for the length of
the tail. Its color, a darker grey than the true lynx,
was almost of a drab hue. It was darker about the
head, but there were no regular spots. The Canada
Lynx early succumbed to changed conditions in his
faunal zone, the forest fire, the clearing, the drained
swamp, the passing of the northern hare, but for a
time his blood will live on in the crossbreed with the
more adaptable Bay Lynx. As these long tailed cats
are said to be plentiful in the wilder sections of North-
western Pennsylvania, it may be that this new race will
possess the power to best endure existing conditions â€”
though S. N. Rhoads says that such a cross would be
infertile.
