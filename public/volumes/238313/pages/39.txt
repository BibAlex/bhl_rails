30 PENNSYLVANIA WILD CATS.
Jefiferson and Clearfield Counties, who died in 1880, is
mentioned by Dr. McKnight as having killed in Penn-
sylvania five himdred catamounts and two hundred
wild cats. His son, Jack Long, who died at his home,
two miles from DuBois in 1900, killed, according to a
statement made by him to Dr. McKnight, "wild cats
and catamounts without number." E. H. Dickinson,
pioneer hunter of McKean County, killed a number of
Canada Lynxes, or catamounts, during his early days
in the Northern Pennsylvania wilderness. He died in
188.5, aged 75 years. With his son, C. W. Dickinson,
he helped kill his last catamount in November, 18G7.
In commenting upon the Canada Lynx, Dickinson is
quoted thus by S. N. Rhoads : "We have a cat in
JNIcKean County yet that is called a lynx, because of its
size and color. Some of them will weigh as high as
forty-four pounds. But they are a darker grey than
the lynx. I believe they are a cross between the lynx
and the common wild cat." The true lynx is a silent
animal, not given to whining or screaming like the wild
cat, except when badly wounded. Rhoads states that
the early Swedish settlers on the Delaware called the
lynx the "Warglo," or wolf-lynx, and the wild cat the
"Kattlo," or cat lynx. Among the Pennsylvania Ger-
mans the lynx was called the "Harsh Katz," and the
wild cat the "Wild Katz." The French in Clearfield
County, in the Loup Run Country, now corrupted into
"Loop" Run, who came miostly from Picardy, called
the lynx or catamount the Chet Ccrvier and the wild
cat the Chet Savage. No list of Pennsylvania cat hunt-
