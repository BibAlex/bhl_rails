and cruel, a sop thrown by crafty politicians to keep the
mountaineer vote in line. If there were no rabbits in
the mountains there would be no wild cats. Note
carefully the sections of the State where cats are
rare, all for the same cause â€” lack of food supply,
when not wiped out by the mercenary bounty hunters.
Those who slaughter wild cats wantonly are false to
posterity, unacquainted with natural history, ignorant
of the scheme of nature. There is some excuse to
hunt wild cats for the sport, if no attempt is made to
annihilate the species. It provides a grand chase for
men and dogs, gives city men a love of the open, and
when the cat escapes, furnishes fun for the cat. The
wild cat is fairly valuable as a fur-bearer ; its relative,
the Canada Lynx, was much more so, but it is now
totally extinct in Pennsylvania, at least the pure race.
Therefore, as an aid to sylviculture, as a means of
sport, and for its fur, the wild cat deserves protection.
Its meat is considered very good. Such men as Dr. C.
Hart Merriam and Prof. E. Emmons pronounce it
most excellent. It was a favorite relish for the old
pioneers in the Pennsylvania mountains and the In-
dians. Another cause for the protection of Lynx
Riifiis. And then there is the sentimental side, which
side appeals only to the few. But it is real; animals
have rights ; they add to the sum total of the beauty
and picturesqueness of this world of ours. We have
no right to condemn a species to extermination that a
Wise Power saw fit to create. It is presumption on
our part. Who gave us such authority?
GIVE THE WILD CATS A CHANCE.
