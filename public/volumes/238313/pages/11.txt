II. THE WILD CAT.
WHEN, as a young boy, in 1897, the writer first
paid a visit to Loganton, "the hunting capital"
of Sugar Valley, Clinton County, and was invited to
inspect the barber-shop trophy room of that prince of
Pennsylvania wild cat hunters, Clem. F. Herlacher, the
most noticeable object in the collection was a long-
tailed, cat-like specimen which occupied the place of
honor over the central mirror. "That is," said Her-
lacher, pointing to the trophy, "what the first settlers
called a 'wild cat'; in reality it is the cub of the pan-
ther, fclis coiigiiar. The old-timers ofter ran across
these huge kittens in the woods ; they were always
blundering into the traps, or their dogs were killing
them, and they did resemble 'cats,' with their fluffy fur,
Ijroad faces, and long tails. But gradually the truth
dawned on them when they found these 'wild cats'
trailing along with mature pantheresses, or smaller-
sized ones were taken from panther nests on rocky
ledges. They were not wild cats at all, but half-grown
or cub panthers. During the time when our fore-
fathers were calling the cub panthers 'wild cats,' they
were calling the true, stump-tailed wild cats 'cata-
mounts,' making in that designation another absurd
mistake. The true wild cat is the bay lynx, whereas
the catamount is really the Northern or Canada lynx,
always a rare animal in Pennsylvania, and unknown in
most of the counties except in the 'Northern Tier.' "
