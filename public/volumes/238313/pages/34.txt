VIII. CAT HUNTERS.
HUNTERS specializing on wild cats were never
numerous, consequently the roster of celebrated
Pennsylvania cat hunters is not a long one. Most cats,
as before stated, have been taken in traps, depriving
the sport of its real zest. Except in winter time, when
the country is open, the wild cat is difficult to locate.
Its coloring blends with rocks and branches ; it is quiet
and unobtrusive in the extreme. Dr. B. H. Warren,
now Director of the Everhart Museum at Scranton, in
his valuable treatise, "Enemies of Poultry," published
at Harrisburg in 1897, thus describes the "favorite
haunts" of the cats. These consist, he says, of "for-
ests, rocky ledges, briary thickets, slashings and bark
peelings strewn with decaying logs, fallen trees and
brush piles, grown up with rhododendron (buck
laurel)." At night the wild cat, like the panther, is
much in evidence. A. R. Shelter, a young hunter of
Weikert, Union County, describes the nocturnal cries
of wild cats answering one another â€” one on Paddy's
Mountain and the other on the White Mountain, the
valley of the Karoondinha reverberating with the
savage love notes. Professor Emmons, in de-
scribing the panther, says: "Though it will not
venture to attack man, yef it will follow his track
a great distance; if it is near the evening, it
frequently utters a scream which can be heard
