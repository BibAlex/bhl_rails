I. INTRODUCTION.
HEN, through villamous bounty laws, the exist-
ence of one of the most useful animals in Penn-
sylvania is threatened, it seems high time for a voice
of protest to be raised. Immediately the question will
be asked, what is the use of the wild cat? Its values
are manifold. In the mountainous districts, where
hunters are few and far between, ra1)bits, unless kept
in check by wild cats, would become so numerous
that they would destroy vast numbers of growing
trees by eating off their bark. As it is the aim of all
crood Pennsylvanians to aid in the reforestation of
Uie desolated areas in the State-after the forest fire
menace has been checked, the wild cat should be pre-
served to help along the arboreal millennium. In the
settled neighborhoods, where farmer boys and city
hunters keep rabbits killed off, there is httle need for
wild cats. And the cats have the common sense to
stay away from such localities, though they have on
rare occasions come near barnyards or hen-houses.
Such cats are renegades to their race and should be
killed. But the vast majority of wild cats follow out
their lives hunting rabbits, rats, mice, shrews and other
vermin. They prey on the rats and mice which destroy
the eggs of game birds. They eat much carrion, and as
such are invaluable forest scavengers. They are per-
forming faithfully the duties for which the same God
who created us made them to do. If rabbits become
scarce, wild cats decrease, just as does the Canada Lynx
of the North ; bounty laws are unnecessary, wasteful
