PREFACE.
AFTER the widespread researches of S. N. Rhoads
it might be said that there is little left to write t)n
concerning Pennsylvania wild cats. However, there
have been changes in the numbers and the future pros-
pects of these most persecuted animals since "Alam-
mals of Pennsylvania and New Jersey" appeared in
1!)03. In addition to offering a brief for the protection
of the lynxes, space will be devoted in the following
pages to the noble sport of cat hunting, and the bold
spirits who took a leading part in the chase in Penn-
sylvania, past and present. But tlie main idea of this
book is to obtain for the wild cats, now on the verge of
extinction, a re-hearing on the trumped-up evidence
against them â€” so that they may get another chance.
Let us preserve this picturesque and useful mammal
for future generations.
