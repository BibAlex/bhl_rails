24 PENNSYLVANIA WILD CATS.
Logue's experience he found only one case where a
(leer had been killed by wild cats. In this instance it
was a very old deer, and may have been found dead by
the cats, wliich dragged it a hundred feet down a hill
over the snow and devoured parts of the carcass.
Logue has never found evidence that fawns have been
molested by the cats. Fawns have no scent, hence
cannot be trailed by cats ; the mother deer are well able
to care for them. He classes the wild cats as "game
hogs" as regards rabbits and rats, but capable of caus-

methods of the gamekeepers of the Middle Ages,
ordering Logue to trap wild cats, foxes, and other use-
ful mammals incessantly. We have progress in every
other branch of human activity except game propaga-
tion, and the results show it. Dr. Warren mentions a
cat which followed a young swain in Southwestern
Pennsylvania, going home from courting his "best girl,"
finally "treeing" him on a fence, and keeping him there
until daylight. "Link" Conser, of Clinton County, had
an almost similar experience during his courting days
on the ridges south of the "Sugar Valley Hill;" in his
case the cat kept crossing and recrossing the road in
front of him, sometimes lying down and purring at
liim. This kept up until daylight, when the cat van-
ished. A. R. Sholter reports another case from
Weikert, Union County. One night, some years ago,
when returning from a call, he had occasion to walk
along the tracks of the Tv. & T. Railroad. When oppo-
