PENNSYLVANIA WILD CATS.
to say to the younger sportsmen that my breed of cats
do not attack men under any circumstances when we
can get away. In fact, we do not like men at all, and
I have heard old hunters say, when talking over their
campfire, that as many years as they had been in the
hdls they never had seen a mean, quarrelsome cat.
and they wondered where they kept themselves. We
wild cats have no special range, but come from the
highest peaks to the lowest bottoms in the day time
and sleep in some dense thicket or in some cave or
under some rock where the sun does not penetrate.
As cool dusk comes on we prowl softly about, looking
for lazy snowshoe rabbits or some grouse or field
mice. Many an unsuspecting brood or aged drum-
ming cock have I devoured as the light grew dim in
the spring evening. It is very amusing to sit and
watch an old cock grouse, as he swells and walks along
his log. And when he has his thoughts full of his
sweetheart and begins to drum, I just make three
jumps and then with one stroke I crush the life and
conceit out of him. Of course squirrels, small birds
and even fish are all acceptable when they are foolish
enough to come my way. I am also very fond of the
remains of deer or other dead animals when killed by
hunters. When I am angry I don't stand with my
ears pitched forward like a horse, neither do I show my
teeth and growl. When I get mad I lay my ears well
back, just as any other cat does, and the madder I get
the lower I lay them, producing a snaky expression.
