PENNSYLVANIA WILt) CATS. • 23
Jake Zimmerman, tlie celebrated guide and hunter of
the "Zimmerman Country," in Eastern CHnton County,
was followed by a wild cat four miles one night, while
driving from White Deer Hole Valley to his home in
the mountains. It bounded along by the side of his horse
•and wagon, every few leaps uttering a piercing cry.
Others who have been followed at night by wild cats
are Lincoln Conser and W. J. Phillips, of McElhattan,
Clinton County, and Reuben Stover and daughter, of
Livonia (Stover's), Centre County. Rev. D. A.
Sowers, of Lock Haven, met a finely spotted wild cat
standing on a log in the forest near DuBois, during the
deer hunting season in 1914. As it appeared to be
unafraid the young hunter promptly ended its life with
a well-directed bullet. According to C. W. Dickinson
the skin of an average Pennsylvania wild cat (if
prime) is worth about $L25. Finely mottled hides
bring much higher prices. Mounted specimens sell for
about $10 apiece. In the form of rugs they bring from
five to eight dollars, according to size and markings.
C. H. Eldon, the gifted Williamsport taxidermist, has
mounted several thousand Pennsylvania wild cat hides
during the past thirty years. The alleged destructive-
ness of wild cats, at most a specious argument, is
crushed like an egg-shell by the testimony .of C. E.
Logue, gamekeeper at the extensive Otzinachson Park
Preserve in Northern Clinton County, the "type local-
ity" of the Bay Lynx in Pennsylvania. Within the
enclosure of this preserve, which embraces over three
thousand acres, several hundred deer are kept. In i\Ir.
