IV. THE BIG GREY WILD CAT, OR CANADA
LYNX.
JOHN G. DA\'IS, old-time woodsman of ^IcElliat-
tan, Clinton County, gives the best description of
a mammoth Canada Lynx (Lynx Canadensis ) killed

was at supper,' he heard a commotion in his barnyard.
Taking down his ritle he hurried out, only to notice a
shagg}' animal moving about among the feet of his
young cattle. Courageously driving the steers into the
barn, he came face to face with a gigantic Canada
Lynx, or what was called, in Northern Pennsylvania, a
"Big Grey Wild Cat," or catamount, to distinguish it
from the smaller and ruddier Bay Lynx. Taking aim
at the monster's jugular, Pluff fired, killing the big
cat with a single ball. The shot attracted the neigh-
bors, among them Davis, and they gazed with amaze-
ment at the giant carcass, the biggest cat killed in
those parts since Sam Snyder slew his 10-foot panther
on Young Woman's Creek in 1858. The Canada Lynx
measured four feet ten inches from tip of nose to root
of tail (the tail measured four inches) and weighed
seventy-five pounds. The next day being Thanksgiv-
ing, it was supplemented to the turkey feast, and all
enjoyed the dcliciously flavored white meat more than
