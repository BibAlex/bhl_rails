Hating the different quantities with respect to h and taking into
consideration that p l has a constant value, we obtain :
dM,' = d Pt + dMJ = dp f dM'.
Omitting the constant we can write for the energy at the height h
c, d^Q o 4 d*Q
' aQ ~2dlt*~4!dh*""'

where q = — . Splitting this energy into a part e', corresponding to
v
the homogeneous phase and a part s", we may write
e = V + s"
Now the stationary equilibrium demands that both in the homo-
geneous phase and in the passage layers fluid- vapour and fluid-
solid wall
s — XI] + p^v = \iM
has a constant value. Here p^ represents therefore the pressure in
the direction of the passage layer; in the homogeneous phase it has
the same value as the constant pressure in the vessel. The equation
expresses that layers lying in each other's neighbourhood will exchange
the same number of particles in the same time.
The change of the attraction (molecular pressure) in the direction
of h from point to point is :
dM,' = -2ydez=z— 2q (ds' + de") = 2uq d Q —2Q ds".
This follows from the value of
d*Q c, fdu
v T ^ dh* 2 \dh
in connection with
c, d'Q

dp -\- dM 1 = dp -\- 2ao dQ
and so — 2Qch"=zdp or — 2ds"=vdp, whence p — p l =^ — I 2()de".
For s — ri] -|- p 2 v = it M we may write s ' -(- e" — r x] -\- p v -f-
~\~iPi — p)v = (jiM. By differentiation we find vdp-\-de"-\-d(p, — p)v=0,
as dt' — xdri + pdv = \ this is evident when we regard the unit
of mass (as homogeneous phase) as having first had the volume v
at the height h and afterwards the volume v -\- dv at the height
h -j- dh. For the passage from one state into the other we have:
rdx] = de' -J- pdv.
As further vdp= — 2dt", we have — de"-\-d{p t — p)v = and so
