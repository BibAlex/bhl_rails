for the deflection of the middle part of the totally relaxed string,
E being the elasticity modulus.
Comparing the expressions 2) and 3) we see that variation of the
diameter d — and as a matter of fact also of the length / — appears
to have another influence with relation to the weight of the string
than with relation to its elasticity. Halving the diameter should
cause the sensitiveness to increase 4 times according to 2) and 16
times according to 3). The significance of this is, that the two for-
mulas should be combined in some way. Also we see that with
thick strings the sensitiveness is principally limited by the elasticity
of the material, whereas with very thin strings elasticity has little
or no influence at all but it is the weight that counts. Finally there
should be for any material a definite length and diameter with
which the limiting influence of weight and elasticity are equal. This
critical diameter can easily be calculated by equating 2) and 3).
We find then :

With this formula table 1 can be calculated giving the critical
value of the diameter (with a length of 10 and 5.6 centimeters) with
which the influence of weight equals that of the elasticity.

The value for E used for silvered quartz does not take the
silvering into account, which anyhow cannot possibly be of much
importance. The figure given for the density is calculated from the
weight divided by the volume in case of a silvering of a thickness
which gives the highest possible normal sensitiveness (v. Theoretisches
und Praktisches Zum Saitengalvanometer, Pfliigers's Archiv. f.
Physiologie V. 158 p, 107 1914).
