of the c-axis the angular values are mostly oscillating, the reflexes
being multiple; with very thin individuals, however, exact measure-
ments could be made. The aspect of the crystals is that of prisms
elongated in the direction of the c-axis. No .distinct cleavage was
found. The prism-faces (110) and (TTO) were much _more lustrous
and yielded much sharper images than the faces (110) and (110),
which ordinarily were somewhat curved and duller.

The crystals are positively birefringent.
The optical axial plane is { 001 1 ; on the
prism-faces, just at the bolder of the field,
the emergence of an optical axis is obser-
vable. The dispersion has a rhombic charac-
ter, with Q^>v. The aspect of the crystals
is very much like that of the ^-derivative.

(mpt. : 108° C.) crystallizes from benzene
in the shape of large, clear, very lustrous
and short prismatic crystals, which with
exception of their smaller development in
the direction of' the c-axis, show an un-
deniable analogy with the crystals of the
«-compound.
Big, colourless crystals, yielding, however, ordinarily multiple
reflections, and imperfectly built.
Bhombic-bisphenoïdical.
n:b:C = 1,7478: 1 : 0,7112.
Forms observed: a = {100| and ??j = |110}, well developed and
giving sharp images; r = { 101 j, large, eminently reflecting; once a
positive bisphenoid, probably {523!. and very subordinate, was
observed, difficultly measurable.
