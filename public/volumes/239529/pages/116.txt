Prof. F. E. C. Scheffer, whom I showed the above calculation,.
drew my attention to the fact that a formula as {III') will not be
lb
valid as long as it does not contain a term of the form 777.. More-
kl
over he felt inclined to suppose that often two atoms, when they
approach each other arid impinge, do not always combine to a mole-
cule, but only under certain conditions e. g. when the relative velocity
of the particles surpasses a certain value.
The image needs only a few alterations to fit the opinion of Mr.
Scheffer and to give us more general formulae than (/ƒ') and (///').
In order to make that an atom will only then enter the sphere
of attraction of another atom when the relative velocity sur-
passes a certain amount, we have simply to assume just at the
outside of the attraction layer still a thin layer in which the
forces between the atoms are repulsive ones. An atom coming from
the outside, approaching another atom and having passed the out-
ward layer will have gained an energy ib l . It will however only
be able to pass this layer when its kinetic energy was great enough.
On its further way after having passed the inner layer, it will have
gained a negative amount if', of energy.
Now we can repeat the above calculation.
(/) and (/') remain valid when only we put ty = q\ -f~ if',.
To find the fraction of the molecules dissociating per unit of time
and of volume, we have only to extend the integration in (2) with
respect to a from a value of « satisfying h hma* -f- 2Atf>, = to a — 00 .
The result is a formula like II when we replace in this ip by if',.
The third formula may be obtained either again by division or directly.
The three formulae thus found are
