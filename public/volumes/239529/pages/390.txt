The theorem of Picard on the conduct of a uniform analytical
function in the neighbourhood of an isolated essentially singular
point was proved in 1896 by Borel without the use of the modular
function. l ) By this a series of elementary proofs was opened for
the celebrated theorem. In 1904 Schottky made the demonstration
of Borel considerably stricter. 2 ) He found an important theorem
on holomorphic and meromorphic functions which are nowhere
zero and nowhere 1, and on this he founded the elementary proof
for the theorem of Picard. 3 ) After this Landau discovered an ex-
tension of the theorem used by Schottky *). The remarkable result
is as follows : if f{z) is holomorphic for \ z j <[ R, if it is there
nowhere zero or J, if further |/(0)|<f», then for \z\<$R, in which
0<1, toe have \f(z)\<<P{n,6), where only depends on 6 and (i.
As Schottky did not possess this proposition, his reason-
ing is here and there subtile. Elegant proofs of the theorem of
Picard were given in 19J2 and 1913 by Montel, but they are
founded on the consideration of the so-called normal families of
functions.*) Bernays, who in 1911 quite simply brought forth the
theorem of Landau out of that of Schottky 8 ), gave in 1913 new
derivations of Landau's theorem, and investigated at the same time
the function q> («), the upper limit for the radius of a circle, where
the series ƒ = a -\- z -}- a^z* -f- . . . . converges and nowhere becomes
zero or 1 7 ).

Montel gives here at the same time a simple proof of the theorem of Landau

Levy made this derivation still more simple in the Bulletin de la Soc. Math, de
Fr., part 40 (1912) p. 25—39. It deserves to be mentioned that in 1907 Schottky
(Sitz Ber. der K. Pr. Ak. d. Wiss. p. 823 — 840) gave two new proofs of the
theorem of Picabd. They are, however, no more simple than the one of 1904.
