a surface m of the fourth order ($ 7); in the same way a surface
0'/ of the fourth order will be the locus of the points P' the paths
of which in the inverse motion have a contact, of the fourth order
with the spheres of curvature in P' .
The former of these surfaces was determined by joining to (8)
the equation (Sd), which results from (8c) through differentiation,
dx' dy' dz'
when for — -, -^—, — — the values are substituted following from

Now we do not require 0' /, but the locus of the points P that
are the centres of the spheres of curvature which have with the
path of a point P' of Of in (he inverse motion a contact of the
fourth order.
The normal plane of the path of P' has for equation :
]VC0= (X-x) v% + ( Y-i?) v% -f (Z-z') v%> =0 . (10)
the centre of the sphere of curvature is found from :

the condition that this sphere has with the path of P' a contact
of the fourth order is expressed by

The locus in question is then found by eliminating x', y', z' from
(11) and (12).
In the same way however -- for the first member of (10) is
identical with that of (8) — we have produced the surface O m ; the
locus in question is therefore O m .
In the direct motion a surface O m of the fourth order is the locus
of the points fixed to l) n the paths of which have five points in
common with the spheres of curvature ; in the same ivay in the inverse
motion a surface O' '/■ of the fourth order is the locus of the points
fixed to Tf the paths of which have five points in common with the
spheres of curvature; the points of O m and O'/ correspond in the
two cubical correspondences, so that e.g. in the direct motion a point
