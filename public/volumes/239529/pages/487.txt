furnishes an indication : the fantastically twisted and ramified shapes
of the dark regions in their various gradations of blackness, which
present themselves on the chart of Dyson and Melotte, and are
even more marked on the photographs by Barnard '), are a strong
indication to the existence of absorbing nebulae in these Taurus
regions. This indication is corroborated, if we calculate the influence
of actual star-voids in space on the number of stars of different
magnitudes.
We assume that in the line of sight the space from r t to i\ = l,585/-
is completely empty (over a region from q to o -\- 1 therefore).
In the integral, representing the number of stars A m of the magnitude
m, the part between the limits q and q -\- 1 is lacking, thus

in which x has the same signification as in the previous communi-
cation. If we calculate these values for a certain value of Q t (e.g.
q = 6,95, whereby the falling-off of stars • becomes a maximum

With a void, extending over a unity in q, there is therefore a

such a strong defect as observed in the Taurus regions, the void
must extend over many unities in <>. If such holes do not extend
