In 1912 the transition point of tetrogonal tin into rhombic tin
was determined by means of very lengthy and laborious determina-
tions. Small quantities of mercury accelerated this transformation,
but at the same time brought about a lowering of the transition
point. Through extrapolation up to the quantity of mercury =
200°. 5 was found as transition temperature, the subsequent experi-
ments with pure tin, which gave a great deal of difficulty, yielding
± 202°. 8 in the end. 1 ) Though it has appeared that also in other
cases mercury is a catalyst for the transition from one metal modi-
fication to another, so that this expedient may often be successfully
applied, it seemed very desirable to try and find another reliable
and quicker method.
That thermo-elements can only be used over a range of tempe-
rature, within which no points of transition of the metals used
occur, is known, and likewise the conclusion of the existence of a
transition point was drawn before from a discontinuity of the change
of the electomotive force with the temperature.
Thus among others in the examination of the thermo-elements
Nickel-Copper') and Nickel-Lead 8 ) a discontinuity was found between
350° and 360°, which points to a transition point of Nickel, with
which also the study of the magnetic and mechanic properties and
also the investigation of the change of length carried out by Janecke, 4 )
is in agreement. Further Bridgman 5 ) investigated the thermo-electric
force of thermo-elements under pressure; we may, accordingly, say
that the thermo-element has been used already several times to
discover a point of transition in one of the metals of the thermo-element.
That, however, on rational application the thermo-electric method
