as the harvest of the eggs of the year 1915 — 1916 took place in the
spring- and the summer, and (hat of the succeeding year in the autumn
and the winter. The room was heated, it is true, and, with a single
exception, the cultures were transferred into the incubator, but both
the former and the latter were done only when the cold became
unpleasant. In the experiment year 1917 — 1918 the winter was
severe, with long continued frosty weather. The following experience
was obtained.
A small series of cultures, which could not be accommodated in
the incubator, stood free in the laboratory. In the daytime the room
was heated, and during the frost it was heated slightly at night
too, so that the minimum temperature was never below 7° C. This
is known with perfect certainty as the temperature of the room and
the incubators was regularly noted down 3 times a day. From these
notes it appeared that the temperature in the early morning and
late at night never sank below 7° C.
If one assumes, to be certain, that the temperature, at a given
moment may have gone down to 5° C. before the thermometer
indicated this sinking, it may be stated as a fact that this tempera-
ture is already deadly to the eggs. In the above-mentioned series of
cultures the mortality was so high that only a few eggs were hatched.
From two jars, each of which contained 1250 eggs, not a single
larva was got from one of them, and only two larvae from the other,
even after the eggs, which still looked rather normal, had been kept
in the incubator for a long time. This great sensitiveness of the eggs
to low temperatures, was not further studied. On another occasion
this circumstance will be reverted to. These observations have been
recorded only to point out that the abnormal mortality of the year
1916 — 1917 may possibly be connected with temperature influences.
The 66517 eggs experimented on in that year were distributed
over 5 series of 101 separate cultures in total.
In one series of 7 cultures 24500 eggs had been put, and in 4
series 42017 eggs in 94 cultures.
The average mortality of the first series with 7 cultures amounted
to 53.7 °/ Q - For that of the 4 other series the figures were
