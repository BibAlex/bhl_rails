temperatures (higher than the critical transition temperature 7 , ,, = 47'
in Hg). The same thing is also the case with great values of v,
for then a /„s has only slight influence by the side of p.
As regards the values of' v near b, here too dx /da will always be
positive, because *; cannot become smaller than b, and x not smaller
than 0. In consequence of the increase of a the volume will
indeed become somewhat smaller; but this decrease can only be
exceedingly small, as v is already almost = b.
Remark. In the equation (c) the constant C will contain the
term ( J / s {e,)— [e 1 ) ) : RT= —Q ; RT (on account of (V, C — C t ) : RT),
in which Q represents the — always positive — heat of dissocia-
tion (see § 9), while 6 contains the term (7/9 — \) log \v — b) (for
v—b=:(v — b ) P b /bo)> hence .t' : ^1 — x 1 will have the form
( Qo + ^^) :/ </'
/• ( v — ])) '«.a \ ^ v ' , in which * will contain ex-
ponentially neither v — b nor 7'. If, therefore, the term with A |/a
is smaller than ^ , then x will approach exponentially at 7 = 0,
v = b. (If the term with A |/« should be larger than Q Q , 1 — #
approaches exponentially). Hence according to (J) the differential
quotient dx /dv will approach exponentially to at any rate at 7=0,
v = b, as it contains the factor x (1 — #) : (v — 6). If, however, T is
]> 0, everything depends at v = b on the exponent of v — b, which
will evidently be Vs,* — 1- In "ideal" substances, where 0=1, this
exponent is negative, hence da 7du approaches to oo. But for "ordinary"
substances, in which 7/3 ranges between a little more than 2 and
a little more than 4 (according as, in view of the factor 1 : a oc-
curring in /?, the temperature is higher or lower), the exponent in
question will be positive, and dx /dv will thus approach 0.
