that have been examined experimentally, the conduction of heat
through the wall is very great, however, because the wall is not
very thick, and consists of a substance (mostly glass) that conducts
heat pretty well. Consequently the influence of the resistance to heat
of the wall of the tube is slight, and the following approximation
may be used. When the current of heat in the wall is supposed to
be radial, and when ó and A 3 represent the thickness resp. the
conductivity of this wall, a quantity of heat given by ;
flows through the wall per unit of time and surface.
In this 6 is the temperature of the substance on the inner side
of the wall of the tube.
When a is the radius of the interior width of the tube, we get
the boundary conditions :
Both members of this equation express the current of heat per
unit of time and surface.
In order to solve the differential equation (6) with the conditions
(8), (9) and (10), we seek a particular solution, which is a product
of two factors, one that depends on x x (A\), and one that depends
on /• (R x ). When we substitute:
X = X, R x
in (6), we may write for this equation :
d'R x dR x Vl dX x d*X x
dr* dr a x dx x dx x *
rRi X, ""
As in this relation the first member depends only on r and the
second member only on ,l\, both members are constant, e.g. — ('.
Then the following equations are obtained for X, and R x :

The solution of (11a) which remains finite for r = 0, is the Bessel
function of order zero :
