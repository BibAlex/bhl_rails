The rather small intensity found in this way for the line refer-
ring to the plane (222) seemed not irreconcilable with the obser-
vations.
§ 5. Before the calculation and the observation can be compared
we must multiply the expressions found in § 4 by the polarisation-
factor, the plane number-factor, and the modified summation-factor.
Just as well we can equalize the above expressions with the inten-
sities obtained by Debije and Scherrer corrected for the absorption
in the rod and after division by the product of the three factors.
In this way we obtain the following equations where k is a
proportionality factor

A must decrease here: firstly exponentially with H*=h 1 *-\-h i *-\-h t *
by the heat motion. As coefficient of H* in the exponent of e we
chose one of the values given by Debije and Scherrer I.e., viz. the
largest one, that which is derived on the assumption of the exist-
ence of a zero energy and which appeared to have the greatest
advantage for the assumption of binding rings. Secondly A must
decrease with i/ s because of the two remaining electrons acting as
"sphere of electrons".
For the sake of simplicity I supposed that the action of these
l ) In the table on p. 481 of the cited paper of D. and Sch. there evidently
occur some typographical errors. In column 6 2,04 must be about 4.02, 11.56
about 6 and in column 7 13 must be about 22.
