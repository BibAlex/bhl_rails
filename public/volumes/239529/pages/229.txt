frog's heart deformed ventricular systoles are generated, whereas it
never brings about fibrillation of the ventricle. This finds an expla-
nation in the fact that after digitalis poisoning (in a toxic dosis 1 ))
the refractor} 7 stage of the ventricle is lengthened instead of shortened.
Conductivity is then bad, however, so that a single deformed ventri-
cular systole can arise, but (he "Erregung" cannot pass through
the ventricle a second time.
*) When speaking of digitalis-poisoning in a toxic dosis, 1 mean a dosage that
lengthens the refractory stage and retards conductivity.
