The contrivance just described is a part of the large apparatus represented in
fig. 1, which consists of three metal vessels, mounted, together with their revol-
ving disc, on a plank that can be moved to and fro. The gut can now be trans-

ferred at will to each of the 6 vessels of the apparatus (this is also of importance
when examining the action of poisons at a different temperature).
Here, then, we have an arrangement of three vessels of 75 c.c. and three ves-
sels of 150 c.c. to which the surviving gut can be transposed. One of the three
metal vessels was displaced in some of the experiments by a large glass vessel
containing 1300 c.c. of Tyrode solution and in which also a thermoregulator was
placed and a tube through which the fluid was oxygenated. When the gut was
put into this large vessel, the action of a definite dosis of atropin could be watched
with a dilution twenty times stronger than when an equal dosis of atropin was
examined in one of- the small vessels, which contained only 65 c.c.
In a series of experiments we tried to ascertain whether the
pilocarpin-action indeed depended only on the concentration. This
appeared to be the case, so that in this respect we quite agree
with v. Lidth de Jeude and consequently our experiments pertinent
to the matter in question may readily be left out.
In another series we examined the question whether atropin can
be washed out.
This was to the following effect :
Atropin-action is completely reversible, for when the gut is put
