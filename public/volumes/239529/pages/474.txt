if the small density is caused by absorbing matter, the screen cannot
be at a great distance, say not more than 200 or 300 parsecs at
most." (1. c. page 6). However, as the P. M. of the stars up to the
9 th magnitude in the dark regions are found to be no higher than
elsewhere, so that no larger average distance is pointed out, this
conclusion again becomes uncertain. For the present investigation,
which proposes to ascertain more accurately the distance of these
absorbing nebulae, the chart of star-counts adjoined to their treatise
proved to be most useful.
$ 2. In order to deduce from the star-densities the distance of
an absorbing nebula, we must first theoretically investigate what, is
the influence of an absorbing screen on the number of stars of
different magnitude. We suppose that the luminosity-function is
known according to the formula of Kaptkyn; for the logarithm of
the star-density as function of the distance we likewise, according
to the empirical data, assume a quadratic formula. We call m the
magnitude, M the absolute magnitude of the stars, and introduce as
modulus of the distance q = 5 log r, where q = for n = 0".l is
taken 1 ): then
