merely a swollen part of a medullary cord. A rest of this cord is
still seen attached to the vesicle. Though less clear the vesicle of
fig. 3 shows such a rest, tiy these observations, I am convinced that
a great number of atypical vesicles in the preparation, described
here, originated owing to a proliferation of the epithelium in parts
of the medullary cords. Afterwards those cells are vacuolised and
a vesicle is formed. The remaining cells form a cumulus oophoriis
round the egg-cells, which originally occurred in the modified part
of the medullary cord. As there are also groups of egg-cells, as
reproduced in fig. 2, which must be looked upon as egg-balls, it is
