whole circuit (galvanometer-coil -f- solenoid) remains constant.
When now the magnetisation of the nickel-steel were perfectly con-
tinuous, the continuous approach of the magnet should give
rise to a gradual increase of the galvanometer deflection, while this
should remain approximately constant, when the field did not change
any longer. The discontinuities that occur in reality in the induction
during a continuous change of the field become manifest by the jumps
of the galvanometer deflections. With a scale-distance of 4 m. we
observed jumps from 5 to 7 m.m. (scale divisions) during perfectly
continuous changes of the field.
Between these jumps small periods were observed during which the
induction, as far as could be observed at least, increased continuously
together with the magnetic force.
When after the field had increased for some lime, which was
accompanied by the discontinuities, the field was weakened again
by taking the magnet away a certain distance (say a few m.m.)
and afterwards again increased beyond the point first reached;
then however no discontinuous changes in the magnetisation occur
neither during the weakening nor during the increase up to the
point where the field had reached the previous value.
As soon however as this point is passed, the discontinuities are
again observed with the same intensity as before. Compared with
the intensity of the field the continuous increase and the preceding-
decrease of the induction are much slower than in the discontinuous
region. The described phenomenon is represented schematically by
fig. 1, where the curve was described in the direction of the arrows.
