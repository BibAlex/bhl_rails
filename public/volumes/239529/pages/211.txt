It will be evident from the foregoing tables that the velocity
coefficients do not decrease proportionally with the decrease in the
concentration of the hydrogen ions. In the case of oxalic acid the
velocity coefficients fall off with the concentration of potassium
oxalate; whilst in the case of picric acid the addition of sodium
picrate produces at first an increase in the velocity coefficient and
then when the concentration of sodium picrate reaches the value of
0-159 N, the velocity coefficients begin to fall off. This is explicable
on the assumption that even undissociated acids are catalytically
active in the hydrolysis of esters. But in view of the work of
Walden (Jour. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1912, 35, 1649) on the measure-
ment of the di-electric constants of solutions, a different interpretation
of these results is possible. Walden has shown with non-aqueous
solutions that the di-electric constant and the ionising power of a
solvent are enormously increased when electrolyts are dissolved in
it. Naturally the degree of ionisation of the dissolved acid and along
with it the concentration of hydrogen ions are also increased. Thus
by the addition of salts of the same acids, there are two effects:
1. The diminution of hydrogen ions due to the increase of the
common negative ion.
2. The increase in the concentration of the hydrogen ions due to
the greater ionisation of the acid caused by the increase in the
di-electric constant of the solvent.
It is evident that these two effects counteract each other.
In the case of potassium oxalate the first effect preponderates
over the second and hence the velocity coefficient falls off with the
concentration of potassium oxalate, whilst in the case of picric acid
