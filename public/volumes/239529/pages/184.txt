To begin with, in the first series of his experiments, which are
meant to prove that the diazotisation reaction is bimolecular, he
uses a nitrite solution containing 0,20 gr. in 1 L., that is a 0.0029
normal solution, whereas theoretically (assuming the nitrite to be
100 °/o) i f should have been 0.0025 normal. This is too high by
about 13 °/o- As even the technically pure nitrite is 96 °/ , he alwaj'S
works with an excess of the nitrite in respect to the amine. Espe-
cially his last determinations will therefore become erroneous.
Casually we may point out that he finds after integration of
dx 1 .c

while of course this ought to be K=—— . — — . So he finds
& 100 t 100 — x
K a hundred times too great.
Further his determinations do not make the impression of being
very accurate. He can read his spectrophotometer only to 7, scale
division. For the different amines a half scale division however can
cause great divergences when we calculate in percentages. As appears
from the table below, this may give rise to errors from l 1 /, — H7o-

The reaction constant of the diazotisation is calculated by Tassilly
rather arbitrarily. For instance for p-toluidine he derives it from a
determination made after 45 minutes, however if considerably deviates
from the K's which we calculated from his determinations relating
to other periods. If he had taken the average K, the agreement
between the found percentage of inverted amine and the one cal-
culated, would have been much better.
He was more fortunate for p-anisidine. He found 0.142 for K
after 30 minutes, while the average of the first four determinations
gives K= 0.143. (See page 254).
