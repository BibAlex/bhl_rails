but into a Ringer's solution, then it will bulge between the two
points A and B on which it is hung, the apparatus being held
horizontally. It is easy to understand that the gravitation brings the
two points A and B closer to each other, but can never make them
diverge. Consequently the gravitation will act against the dilatation.
Notwithstanding this the muscle lengthens itself again. Owing to
this observation we are able to record curves without the stretching
weights, which always deform the curve, while we need not use the
poisonous chloroform-benzene mixture.
When it was once stated that a muscle is able to lengthen itself
in opposition to the gravitation, I tried if it would even be able to
raise its own weight. I succeeded actually in seeing a muscle, placed
vertically, fastened at the lower end, lengthen itself after contrac-
tion. This fact had been observed some days before, but without my
knowledge, by Dr. Bakels and Mr. Prakken, in this Laboratory.
It being proved that cross-striated muscle tissue dilates actively,
two new points of view have been opened :
1. We are able to record curves, excluding all the forces which
could deform it.
2. With the aid of this technique it will probably be possible to
find a solution to the problem, raised by the result of my experiments.
The question is: what intramuscular forces cause this dilatation and
through which are they influenced? The dilatation may be caused
by the perimysium externum, the sarcolemma, the sarcoplasma or
by the fibrils.
1 can state at all events, that the perimysium externum is not able
to cause the dilatation only by itself (by its elasticity), for even a
fragment of muscle tissue, cut out by me, actuallj' lengthened itself
again. The sarcolemma,] which is a homogeneous elastine-membrane,
has a tendency to diminish its surface, in other words: to take the
globular shape.
Consequently it will never be able to lengthen the muscle.
