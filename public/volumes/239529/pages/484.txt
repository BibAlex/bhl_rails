20 X 7) we take 10 parsecs (1 parsee is 3 X 10 13 km.), we
find, with an absorption of 2 magnitudes, 10 — 15 for tlie density of
the gas-cloud. The mass is independent of the thickness assumed;
per cm 2 diameter it is 2/0,056 X weight of air-column on Mount

.1/ = 3,5 10 40 kg. As the mass of the sun is 2 X 10 30 kg.,
the mass of the gas-cloud is equal to about 2 x 10 10 sunmasses.
This can also be found directly, by means of the formula of
Rayleigh for the absorption-coefficient k:

in which ji is the refractive index, A the wave-length, iV the number
of particles (molecules) per cc. If we assume, that the gas-cloud
consists of hydrogen, (which gives the smallest mass), with an
ordinary pressure and density therefore [i = 1,000143, JSf = 2,7 X 10 19 ,
and if we take ; = 5,5 x 10 5 cm., we get k = 2,7 >; 10~ 8 , or
2,7 X 10~ 3 for unit of thickness one km., which is equal to
2,9 X 10 3 magnitudes, whilst a column of 1 cm 2 width per km.
length has a mass of 8,3 X 10~ 3 kg. The mass of a column of
1 cm* diameter in an absorbing gas-layer is therefore 2,9 & kg.,
if e is the absorption in magnitudes (for A = 550). From this we
find for a mass of gas with an area of 150 square parsecs and 2
magnitudes absorption
M = 8 X 10 19 kg. = 4X10" sunmasses.
The difference with the former result is due to the difference
between hydrogen and air.
According to Kapteyn and van Rhyn ') the density of the stars
in the vicinity of ihe sun is V„ per cubic parsee, so that in a globe
with a radius of 2600 parsecs there are 4 X 10" stars. If we take
their average mass as equal to that of the sun, this one gas-cloud,
(one third perhaps of all absorbing gas-clouds in that region) only
140 parsecs distant, contains as much mass as all the stars within a
globe extending 20 times further. Unless therefore this Taurus-cloud
is unique for size and density, we may safely conclude that in the
fixed stars only a small part of the world-substance is condensed.
$ 2. The assumption, however, that at a distance 140 parsecs there be
a gascloud of such great mass, leads to a few most remarkable con-
sequences. The attraction of this mass on our solar system is not
