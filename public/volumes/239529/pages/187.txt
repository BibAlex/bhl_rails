ment both solutions were cooled to 0°; then they were mixed while
being well stirred. So in 0.5 L. are present one millimol of amine,
one millimol of NaNO, and about 6 millimol HC1.
After different periods 5 c.c. samples were drawn with a pipette,
which had been cooled to 0° and coupled with 5 c.c. of a Schaffer's
salt solution (3 gr. of Schaffer's salt -\- 3 gr. of NaOH per L.);
then an excess of alkali is present, so that the diazo reaction is
brought to a stand-still. We executed the coupling reaction at 0° in
order to evade every decomposition of diazonium compound.
From determinations performed in the laboratory for Physical
Chemistry of the Technical High School here at Delft, we knew,
that at 0°, even after 6 hours, w r e need not fear decomposition of
the diazonium-compounds ; this disturbance appears only at 20°.
Below we cite some affinity-constants for these reactions, in which
N, is split off:
For aniline /if 3 o° =0.0064 /C 35 o = 0.0124 K i0 o = 0.0248
p. nitraniline VT 35 ° = 0.000869 K^* =0.00136
„ sulphanilic acid AW>= 0.0033 #51.7°= 0.0078 K bl o= 0.0108
From the coloured solutions, thus obtained after coupling, again
5 c.c. were measured and diluted to 500 c.c. (with higher concen-
trations Beer's law did not hold good). Assuming the last sample
taken after about 6 hours to represent J00 /o» we compared this
standard solution in a colorimeter with the colours obtained from
the samples after 2, 4, 6, 10 etc. minutes. In this way we could
directly read the percentage of inverted amine.
Finally it should be observed that we used distilled water for all
our experiments, as water from the main possessed too much colour
of its own.
Below we give same numerical data.
