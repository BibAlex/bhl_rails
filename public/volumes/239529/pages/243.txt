$ 5. There is evidently no distinct form-analogy present between the
two isomeric chloro-tetracetyl-d- fructoses, in contradiction to what was
formerly stated in the case of both a- and ft- pentacetyl-d- fructoses.
The substitution of a Cl-atom for hydrogen, has evidently, however,
not a lowering of the degree of symmetry of the original substances
as a consequence, all four acetyl-derivalives being rhombic-bispheno-
idical. However, from the results obtained, it appears still to be
impossible to demonstrate a more intimate analogy of the crystal-
forms of the a- and ^-derivatives of this series and that studied
formerly.
