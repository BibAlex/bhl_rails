ventricle already in the middle of' the diastole, i. e. directly after
the conclusion of' the refractory stage. Instead of a premature ven-
tricular systole, an irregular fibrillation of this chamber ensues,
which is followed by a short post-undulatory pause. During this

fibrillation the auricles maintain their regular pulsation: after the
extrasystole of' the auricles followed the ordinary compensatory pause
and subsequently the auricles resumed their regular beat 1 ).
At 2 the auricles are again stimulated at the beginning of the
excitable period. After this extrasystole of the auricles the ventricle
readily resumes fibrillation after the conclusion of the a â€” v-interval.
In this experiment the relations are much more intricate than in
the experiments of' the first paper, in which the ventricle was stimu-
lated directly after the conclusion of' the refractory stage, after which
ventricular fibrillation ensued. After some trials I readily found this
point and fibrillation could easily be excited. In the experiments we
are describing now, this is not done so easily, which is readily un-
derstood.
First we have to fix the moment, when the refractory stage of
the auricles terminates. But, this done, the success of' the experiment
depends on two more factors, viz:
1 on the rate at which the excitation proceeds from the stimu-
lated spot to the ventricle.
M The auricular curves have diminished during the ventricular fibrillation. This
is on account of the altered mechanic relations of the registration consequent on
the fibrillations of the ventricle.
