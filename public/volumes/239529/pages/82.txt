Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The averages of these will be mentioned
separately, and this will give an explanation why they were excluded
from the calculation of the provincial averages.
Let us consider first the Index cephalicus. The following tables
show the value of the Index cephalicus in the different provinces.

In this table are mentioned also the numbers related to Amsterdam
and Rotterdam, these data will be referred to later on. From the
table mentioned above, it appears that taking the small geographical
extension of our country into consideration, the Index cephalicus
is rather variable, as it oscillates between the two extremes 79.6
(Z. Holland) and 81.5 (N. Brabant).
On comparing the provincial averages with each other, one cannot
help noticing a certain regularity in the variability. The three
northern provinces: Groningen, Drenthe and Overijsel form more or
less one group, in which the Index cephalicus attains the value of
81 or surpasses it even.
One might add to this north-eastern territory the so-called Achter-
hoek of Gelderland of which 313 persons are measured with an
average Index cephalicus of 81.1. This north-eastern part of our
population forms, as is generally known, linguistically and ethnolo-
