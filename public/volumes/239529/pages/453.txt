second component, i. e. when x x and x t are small, the above equa-
tion may be simplified, for in consequence of the small value of
x we may then write :
( <r$\ _ Rr
\dxSjp.T. *! (1— *i)
and when we neglect x x by the side of 1, the coefficient of dx x
becomes :

When we now consider the equilibrium between a mixed crystal
phase and a liquid, or between two mixed crystal phases at constant
pressure, we get :
(,?,— nJ dT = - RT ^~^ dx x
and T(t] 3 — tj,) being = — M x Q x , we get:
RT x.—x.
dT = ——.— dx x
M X Q x x
or
RT 9
M X Q K ' lJ
This is Rothmund's formula derived by another way. For the
molecular lowering, i. e. for the lowering caused by 1 gr. mol. of
the second component in 1000 gr. of the first the following equa-
tion is obtained :
dT RT % x.—x.

From this it is seen that when the second phase is no mixed
crystal, hence x t = O, this formula passes into that of Van 't Hoff.
When we consider the lowering of the freezing point, brought
about by addition of a second substance that forms mixed crystals
with the first, only the second phase is a mixed crystal and the
first a liquid. When we, however, direct our attention to a lowering
of a transition point, the first phase is a mixed crystal, and in
general the second will be so too, just as in the case of solidification.
(Cf. the subjoined figure).
It follows from the above relations that when we may treat
diluted mixed crystal phases thermodynamically as diluted liquid
solutions, the molecular size of the second substance present in the
second phase in small concentration with regard to the molecular
size of the same substance in the first phase, can be found from the
