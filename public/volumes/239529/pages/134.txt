and as we confine ourselves to very diluted solutions
duM ,
1 = - MRT
We find therefore the relation
v A p t = A (x M.
The value of the thermodynamic potential of the solvent at the
wall, where we take as = zero, may be represented by
8 — Xlj + p s = (X M.
For a change of the value of ^M therefore we have the relation
de — t di] -\- p 2 dv -\- v dp^ -= dp M.
When tliis explanation of the origin of the osmotic pressure is right
then vdp 2 = d[iM. And as the only change the state of the bounding
layer in the immediate neighbourhood of the wall can undergo by an
increase of the concentration of the homogeneous solution by dx x
is a change in density, we must have for any such change
ds — t di\ -j- p % dv = 0.
But this consequence is in perfect correspondence with the ther-
modynamic theory of capillarity.
Let us consider an element of the outer layer and let us expand it,
without changing its thickness, in the direction of the wall, so that
v becomes v -\- dv. The external work done at the expense of the
supplied heat is p^dv and not p^Iv. The supplied heat is xd% so
that we have :
rdr[= p t dv -\- ds.
In fact this equation is nothing but the well-known equation from
the theory of capillarity :
de — xdi] — p x dv -\- fids,
when we do not apply it to the layers as a whole, but to only
one of the layers.
As our conclusion is right, we may evidently also treat the
problem in another way viz. by assuming that we have
d\xM = vdp t
