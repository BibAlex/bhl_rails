and where z' J is the interval measured along the arc. We notice
that these parameters are the components of the unit vector A a /JL ,
translated geodesically from the origin of time along the timetrack,
with an accuracy up to the second approximation. As a geodesic
translation does not alter the mutual angles of the translated vectors,
it follows that the axes of space and time remain perpendicular.
In the same way it may be shown that every spatial radius, that
is a line z, = r, &) — X.s, *(« = X a s, z<$) — X t s, with V + //+ V= *,
is a geodesic, s being the interval along the arc from the origin.
The potentials g'y in geodesical falling coordinates.
We shall calculate the new values g'y by means of the trans-
formation formula
g'ij = 2 PaiPbj 9«b,

p a i = d,v a /dz l .
In calculating the p a { the symmetry of Q a bt „ m in the suflixes b

In the second lines of both formulae we shall replace Q n b>mn by

symmetrical in the suffices in and n.
In the first lines we find exactly the components of the vectors
A a { shifted geodesically from the origin to the point-instant denoted
by z5. Thus, as far as these parts of p a i are concerned, the trans-
