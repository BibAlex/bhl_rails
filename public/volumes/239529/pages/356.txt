ing to St. John the observed displacements tell against the exist-
ence of the Einstein effect, whereas Grebe and Bach em conclude
from their observations that the gravitational shift is in evidence
both as regards direction and magnitude. The effect of radial motion
has been taken into account in these investigations.
None of the above observers has, however, considered the possibility
that anomalous dispersion might influence the position of the lines.
The object of the present investigation is to approach the problem
from the point of view that Fraunhofer lines are in the main
dispersion lines l ).
It is realized that this interpretation of the solar spectrum differs
profoundly from the current notion that one is dealing with a mere
absorption spectrum ; we are, therefore, justified in accepting it only
if there are convincing reasons for so doing.
One of these is for instance the fact that the said interpretation
enables us to establish, without introducing additional hypotheses,
a comprehensive system of explanations of a great variety of solar
phenomena which, when explained on the basis of the ordinary
supposition as to the nature of Fraunhofer lines, lead to several
difficulties and unsatisfactory conceptions.
The strongest support, however, for the new interpretation of the
spectrum is found in certain general properties of the Fraunhofer
lines, which are readily deduced from the supposition that the lines
are in the main dispersion lines, but of which, from other points
of view, no explanation whatever has as yet been offered. Such
properties are :
1. The general displacements of the Fraunhofer lines towards
the red are very different in magnitude (ranging indeed from
o >t
-\- 0,020 A to — 0,007 A), even when comparing lines of one and
the same element, and bear no relation to the displacements by
pressure as observed in the laboratory. (Cf. especially the publications
by Evershed and his collaborators, of the Kodaikanal Observatory).
l ) Attention has first been called to the existence of dispersion bands and
dispersion lines by one of us in 1904: Proc. Acad. Amsterdam VII, 134, 140,
323; Astropb. Journ. 21. 271,278,286(1905). Further investigations, on this
special type of spectral lines are to be found a.o. in these Proc. IX, 343 (1906) ;
XII, 266 (1909); XIII, 2 (1910); Le Radium 7 (Oct. 1910); these Proc. XIII,
881, 1263 (1911); The Observatory 37, 252 (1914); Astropb. Journ. 40, 1(1914);
43, 43 (1916); Arch, néerl. Serie III A, tome IV, 51, 150 (1917); tome V,
116 (1918).
Cf. also the inaugural dissertations by Dr. B. J. van der Plaats (Utrecht, 1917,
also published in Arch, néerl. série 111 A, tome V, 132) and by Dr. P. H. van
Gittert (Utrecht, 1919).
