Therefore the number of moults, given hereafter, is one or I wo
moults more rather than less. When the larvae have grown larger
and already show a distinct brown colour, these moults are easier
to find; generally they lie on the surface of the food then.
The investigation gave the following result. During the first period
of strong growth a moult may be expected every fortnight ; afterwards
this regularity ceases.
N°. 1 gave 11 moults; larval period 400 days; died without pupation.
N°. 2 gave 12 moults; larval period 194 days; normal pupation.
N°. 3 gave 10 moults; larval period 194 days; normal pupation.
N°. 4 gave 16 moults; larval period 405 days; normal pupation.
Larva N°. 5 gave 16 moults ; larval period 376 days.
The investigation was repeated once more with 8 larvae, all of
the same mother and of the same age.
