Obviously in the last term the value for j contributes nothing
to the sum. Because of the skew-symmetry of R a b,mn in a and b,
the value can be disregarded also for i, and the skew-symmetry
im m and n allows us to write:
</ 00 = 1 + 5 R a b,mn A<\ AH A>\ A\ z" Z*.
Proceeding to g'o/j., we get
g' Q/t = + — 12" R abttnn A«,, AH (A">j A\ — A»j A m 9 ) * zi —

Taking i = Q in the first sum, this part cancels out against the
second sum (skew-symmetry of R a b,mn i" «> b). The remaining part
is taken together with the third sum, and we get
g'W = | 5 Rab,mn ^ V AH A% A\ z' z\
Finally for g'^ we find :
g'^ = — s /xv f - T \ 2 Rab t nm [A\ AH {A™* A»* - A»? A^) +

- \ 2 R abtmn (A°, A h p + Ay AH) {A>\ A\ — A\ A>\) # z\
where £„,= 1 for p = v and e /JV = for ft ^ r. Having regard to
the skew-symmetries of R a b,mn we reduce this expression to
g'^ = - £/lv + I 2 R ab>mn A% AH A>\ A\ z° z\

we at once see that without lowering the degree of approximation,
we may abridge the forms for g\j into:

It must be noticed that these gravitation potentials depend no more
on the time z n . The field in our geodesic falling coordinates is station-
ary as far as our approximation goes.
The R'ij t rs are closely associated with Riemann's measure of curvature.
If only particles are considered moving so near the centre that the
squares of the distances multiplied by the measure of curvature
may be neglected altogether, then the g'ij may be considered to be
constant and to have the homoloidal values 1, — 1, — 1, — 1.
