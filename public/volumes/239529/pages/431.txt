the zone c to d (and farther) of the G\4-curve, the atropin-dosis is

CONCLUSIONS.
I. In accordance with what has been found by v. Lidth deJeude
and others, the pilocarpin-action upon the surviving gut is entirely
dependent on the concentration of the pilocarpin in the solution in
which the gut is suspended. The pilocarpin-action is completely
reversible.
II. Contrary to van Lidth de Jeude's assumption, also the anta-
gonistic atropin-action depends entirely on the concentration and not
on the absolute dosis of the poison present.
The atropin-action is also completely reversible anyhow when the
atropin dosage is not too large. A surviving piece of gut does not
adsorb so much of the smallest active dosis of atropin present in
the 75 c.c. of Tyrode solution, as to alter the atropin-concentration
appreciably.
III. With the relatively small quanta of pilocarpin (i. e. such as
exert an action corresponding with the zone a â€” c of tlie C.-A-curve)
the amount of atropin, recjnired for the antagonism, does not depend
on the quantum of pilocarpin administered, but chiefly on the action
exerted by that quantum. The quantity of atropin, necessary to
arrest a sub-maximal pilocarpin-action is about three times larger
than the quantity of atropin, required to exert antagonism on a
pilocarpin dosis with only a slight action. With pilocarpin-doses
with a maximal action, a strong rise of the doses is still accom-
panied by a rise of the atropin-doses. The reason given above ren-
dered it impossible for us to examine this phenomenon in detail.
