These numbers are useful to a certain extent to give an approximate
answer to I lie question whether on an average the head of some
part of our population is larger or smaller than that of the
remaining part.
The results for the different provinces are laid down in the following-
table. For every province the average greatest length, breadth, and
the sum of the two values is expressed in millimeters. The data of
Amsterdam and Rotterdam are left out of consideration, because of
the fixing of the provincial average, these will be communicated
separately.

On comparing the data in the last row, we are struck first by the
fact that the difference between the highest and lowest value is
remarkably small. The lowest value was found in Noord-Holland,
where the sum of the average length and breadth of the head amounts
to 343 mm., while Groningen with 348 mm. is the highest in the
series. The largest difference amounts only to 5 mm. This difference
is so small that one would feel inclined to consider it unimportant. But
a look at the map convinces us that a certain regularity in the
differences of the provincial averages cannot be denied. On comparing
the data on the map, it is evident, that without any exception, the
eastern provinces indicate a higher sum-average than the western
provinces. To say it differently: though the increase is small, it is
yet unmistakable that in the direction of the eastern frontier of our
country the heads are larger as far as this size may be expressed
