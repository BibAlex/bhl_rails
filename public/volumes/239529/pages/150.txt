mixed with the bran and dried up into a lump. Such wounded
pupae do not develop into beetles, but die sooner or later in pro-
portion as the wound occurs on more or less vital organs.
The cause of these injuries is alike a beginning of gnawing by
the larvae, from which the young pupa has been able to withdraw,
as it always reacts to mechanic stimulation with vehement move-
ments.
The gnawing away may, especially in young pupae, be so far
advanced that only small remainders of the chitin-shell are found
back.
Between these extremes one finds many intermediate stages of
mutilation.
With this, the mortality among the pupae is not yet at an end.
The pupa has still a critical period to pass through, viz. the time
shortly before casting the pupal moult. Some unknown disturbance
or other during the metamorphosis either occasions its death, or
prevents a normal beetle from emerging.
The disturbance usually manifests itself in that the wings are
defective, or are not perfectly developed, and that the pupal moult
in the distal part of the body is not removed. The legs are mostly
developed so far that these pseudo-beetles can utilize them yet. They
are wretched animals, which crawl about needy and invalid, and
die after a short time.
They have been mentioned separately as "half beetles" in ourmorta-
lity lists. The mortality of pupae gathered in the years 1915/1916 —
1916/1917 and 1917 is shown in the table below.

More than once already I had been struck by the fact that if I
laid big pieces of rusk, soaked with water, in the larvae jar, the
larvae greedily eat of them. This fact led me to the supposition
