2. After this the trunk was moved as far as possible about its
dorso-ventral axis, towards the left eye (trunk turned to 0. S.). Here
a distinct contraction of the M. internus and a distinct relaxation
of the M. extern us is noticeable. These new contractions persist as
long as the trunk is kept in its new position.
3. Trunk back again in its normal position. This causes a relax-
ation of the M. internus and a contraction of the M. externus.
4. Turning of the trunk on a dorso-ventral axis as far as possible
towards the right eye (Trunk turned to D. 0.)- Here we observe a
fresh relaxation of the M. internus and a contraction of the M.
externus. Here also the tonic nature of the reflex is again distinctly
noticeable.
5. Trunk again in normal position ; contraction of the M. internus
and relaxation of the M. externus, so that the muscles are again in
the state of contraction of the commencement of the experiment.
About five similar experiments were carried out, with invariably
the same result. Sometimes the contraction of the muscles was more
visible than the relaxation. At other times the reverse. Sometimes
both were equally distinct as in the experiment described. In one
case only the relaxation of both muscles could be distinctly made
out. This of course depends upon the degree of tonicity of the muscles
at the beginning of the experiment.
From this we may, therefore, conclude that a reciprocal inner-
vation of the eye-muscles can also be established for the tonic cervical
reflexes, but likewise that the tonic nature of the cervical reflexes
described above, is demonstrable through registration of the contrac-
tions of antagonistic e^e-muscles.
