Tlie foregoing should give the answer to the question whether the
existence of a gravitational displacement as required by the general
relativity theory is compatible with the observations. The numerical
values deduced from that theory are indicated by d' in the table
and by the double line G in the diagram.
The ordinates of G refer to displacements of the' cores of the
solar lines with respect to the terrestrial lines. Taking into account
that the observed Fraunhofer lines are dispersion lines, and, therefore,
are generally displaced towards the red with respect to their cores,
we see that, if the Einstein effect did exist, the total displacements
of the Fraunhofer lines with respect to the terrestrial lines would
group themselves around mean values ranging from 0,008 -\- 0,004 =
0,012 A at I 4000 to 0,012 + 0,006 = 0,018 A at ;. 6000 (as shown
by the broken line at the top of the diagram).
These theoretical mean values average 0,010 A higher than those
actually observed — a difference far too great to be attributed to
accidental errors.
It is of course possible — although not probable — that there
exists an as yet entirely unknown cause of general displacement of
Fraunhofer lines towards the violet, exactly balancing the gravitational
displacement. One should also keep in mind the possibility that the
arc lines have failed as yet to make the terrestrial frequencies
known with sufficient precision, and may prove to be systematically
o
displaced towards the red by so much as 0,010 A.
On the basis of our present knowledge, however, we are forced
to conclude that the gravitational displacement does not exist.
We feel greatly obliged to Dr. M. Minnaert and Miss C. E. Blekker
for their active collaboration in analyzing the data at our disposal.
