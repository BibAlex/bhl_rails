Ny Q a b,mn w © have denoted the same form within brackets which
is found in the foregoing line. Note (he symmetry possessed by
Q a b,inn i" the suffixes b and m. If we put
£*> b,mn ^o b t mn °* b,vm '
then R n b,mn is the same as a four-index symbol of Riemann :
R a b,vm = \ f>a, mn },
and for its covariant components we have the identities which will
be used in the following:
Kab,mn —— -Zf>ba,mn -"ab,nm ^mn,nb t

We proceed to show that the above transformation actually affords
the geodesic falling coordinates alluded to in the introduction.
The axis of z° coincides ivith a particle's track. Put every z^ = 0,
and we get
±2 \ m \A<> (> A>\z' > z*-\2Q» btmn A\A>\A» z'z°z''..
.v a —x a n =A a n z t
As a second approximation, this is the equation for the geodesic
line starting from the point-instant x n with initial direction para-
meters A n t and where z° is the interval along the arc. Thus our
time-axis is along a particle's track. Denote the second member of
this equation by §".
The axes of space are everywhere geodesies, as far as the approxi-
mation goes, and perpendicular among themselves and to the axes
of time. For put z* = r and let the other coordinates vanish with
the exception of one z* 1 ; on rearranging terms we get
X a — X a t ga 3= A a H . Z?
