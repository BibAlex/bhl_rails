In fig. 2 a and the full lines have the same meaning as in tig. 1.
The nucleus Q is surrounded by 4 nuclei, one of which is P.
R is another one and S and T have not been drawn. Let QS and
QT rotate about PQ until they coincide with QR. Then the binding
rings about QR, QS and QT coincide too. The above mentioned
relation between the phases is now so, that in those coinciding
rings the pairs of electrons form a regular hexagon. The positions
of the planes b' and b" into which the planes b of fig. 1 are split
up are not changed by this rotation. In fig. 2 the phase has been
chosen in such a way that those 6 planes form pairs that coincide
and so give the three planes b' and b", the construction of which
needs no further explanation. In reality the hexagon pqrstu is
perpendicularto QR and at equal distances from Q and R. In the
fig. it has been represented as shifted downwards and clapped down
on the plane of drawing by a rotation about a diameter perpen-
dicular to QR. The hexagon ABC DEF is the projection of the
former on a plane perpendicular to the plane of drawing through
PQ and clapped down on this plane by a rotation about this line.
When now the radius of the rings has been chosen so, that
b" falls halfway between b' and a, the structure factor of (222) in
the phase represented in the figure will become zero. From the
1 1
construction it is evident that the radius must be chosen — -or— —
V/6 2,45
times the distance between two nuclei. It is found that in that
