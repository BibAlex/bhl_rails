Now 1 -f~ T (p — iy may be written for the factor (1 -\- tq (q — 2)) I

while with r==l,5 (see the first part of this Paper in these Proceedings,
§8, p. 278) S should be exactly =1. Possibly x is not small enough
to justify the above approximations and the neglect of certain values,
and then it is possible that r]>*3,5 drops out. But the calculations
get very intricate then.
At any rate the formulae (4), (5), and (6) contain the full solution
of the problem put by us.
