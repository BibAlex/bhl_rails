the mean decomposition in 60 minutes (ca. 0,0445 Gr. Co) is here only
about 2 3 of that formerly observed, — which may be chiefly caused
by the fact, that the intensity of radiation of the quartzA&mp was
a smaller one than formerly, and by a somewhat modified form of the
vessels employed. All these measurements have, therefore, not an
absolute, but merely a relative significance.
§ 5. Results mutually agreeing much better, however, were obtained
in the study of the influence, which the addition of certain electro-
lytes to the solution has upon the photocatalysis under consideration.
For it had soon become evident by preliminary experiments, that,
— in contrast to Vranek's negative results of the addition of acids,
— a remarkably strong influence on the speed of reaction could be
observed, if neutral salts were added to the concentrated solutions of
the cobalti-sah used by us. An addition of alcohol had, however, no
appreciable effect; but solutions of neutral salts, if added to the
photosensitive solution, have immediately a very distinct influence,
when the salts of strong bases and acids are used for this purpose.
Such a catalytic influence of salt-solutions on photochemical reactions
lias, indeed, been found already by some other authors, e.g. by
Jokissen and Reicher 1 ) in the case of the photochemical oxydation
of solutions of oxalic acid by free oxygen, and by Roeoff a ) in the
case of Eder's solution: the last mentioned investigator found even
one case which seems to be of the same type as those described here.
Subsequently the influence was studied by us, which resulted from
the addition of varying quantities of potassium, sodium, and lithium
chlorides ; in a second series of determinations the analogous influence
