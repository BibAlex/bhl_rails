stripe-culture as an expression of its haemodigestive power. Even
choleravibrios that influence the blood-agar-plate exceedingly slowly,
are able to form a halo on the blood-bile plate. I tried this halo-
formation of the choleravibrio on the blood-bile-agar plate by means
of the gelatine-stripe method and compared this one with the halos
on blood plates and casein plates.
The result of these experiments which I made with several new
and old cholera strains of a very divergent haemodigestive character,
is shown half schematically in the following figures.
Fig. 1. Fig. 2.
Fig. 1. The virtual (white dotted) gelatine-liquefying halo lies
considerably beyond the halo of the haemodigestion on the blood-
agar plate.
Fig. 2. The zones approach each other very clearly on the oxy-
haemoglobin plate ; in some cases (as is shown on the figure) there
is already an indication of transformation of the oxy haemoglobin,
whose line of demarcation is congruent with the halo of the gela-
tine-liquefaction.
Fig. 3. The halos of further oxyhaemoglobin transformation and
gelatine-liquefaction are quite congruent on the blood-bile-agar plate,
a condition which agrees with that on the casein plate. (Fig. 4).
By this fact the identity of the oxyhaemoglobin- digestive, casein-
digestive and gelatine-liquefying ferment of the cholera vibrio is
confirmed.
There is this profitable difference between the blood-bile-agar plate
and the blood-agar plate, that the process of haemolysis does not
take place in the former.
