of magnesium, beryllium, and ferric chlorides was investigated. The
choice of such salts is limited by the condition, that only salts of
such cations can be used, whose oxalates are easily soluble. For in
the case of only slight solubility of those oxalates, a part of t he
cation added would gradually he removed from the solution by
precipitation with the potassium oxalate set free during the reaction.
However, these investigations may be extended eventually by the
use of ammonium, rubidium, and caesium salts, while, on the other
hand, a wide variation of all kinds of anions will be possible
here.
In all experiments the same volume of solution (50 com) was used,
containing 0,0607 grammol. of the (anhydrous) complex salt per
Liter. Moreover, the whole experimental arrangement was in all
cases accurately the same, while the time of exposure was always
