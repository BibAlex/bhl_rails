The average proper motions are enlarged in the same proportion
as the average parallaxes. For (^ = 6,05, r = 160 parsecs (this
value has been taken, because it allowed us to use the numbers of
the previously calculated tables), we get for

Dyson and Melotte in their article have already compiled the
proper motions of the stars in the darkened regions of Taurus, and
have established, that they are not greater than anywhere else. We
find, indeed, for their average 0",044, whilst stars of that magnitude
(1 of the 6 th , 1 of the 7 th , 5 of the 8 ,h , 9 of the 9 th magnitude)
at such a galactic latitude give a normal average of 0".041. For
the small number of stars the negative conclusiveness of this result
is not strong enough in itself to refute the existence of an absorbing
nebula. Of a greater average speed, however, through the effect of
a gigantic attractive mass, there is no trace.
$ 3. The difficulties, and as yet unconfirmed consequences, result-
ing from the assumption, that the star-voids in Taurus are caused
by absorbing gas-masses, give rise to the question, as to whether
no other explanation is possible. Barnard has always emphasized
the fact that not all dark spots and regions in the Galaxy are to
be attributed to absorption, but that a great number of them are
undoubtedly due to actually void space. In many cases the aspect
