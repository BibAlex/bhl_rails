sea that covers the Sahul-bank. This bank is laid bare when the
sealevel sinks Â± 70 m.
In various writings I have tried to show that this condition was
brought about in the pliocene and that the present status of' land
and water was developed in the pleistocene J ).
Also P. and F. Sarasin assume, in their wellknown work on
Celebes, a pliocene "Festlands-epoche" for the Archipelago, and
R. D. M. Verbeek wrote that at this day, and presumably ever
since the Pliocene New- Guinea was separated from Australia by a
shallow sea. Other writers (e.g. Hedley and Matthews) seem to be
satistied in referring this occurrence to the "late Tertiary".
It was generally supposed that the process consisted in more or
less local upheaval or subsidence of land or sea. Instead of these
rather unfounded surmises, born of the wish to be able to dispose
of land-connections, necessary for the zoogeographical theories, the
Croll-Penck theory gives us a general view, yielding an actual
basis. However, with this the supposed positive or negative sub-
sidence is at the same time shifted from the Pliocene to the Pleisto-
cene. This again lends support to our statement that the facts
observed by Zoology speak for the validity of the Croll-Penck
theory.

berichte d. Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften.
