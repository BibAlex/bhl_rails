for e = oo ; the figure shows that for 8 between 1 and 2 for these
corrections the amounts 0,05 and 0.10 are to be adopted.
From the limiting values thus obtained: 0,15 for m = 6,6, 0,35
for m = S,l and 0,49 for i/i = 9,4 the values of Q i can be directly
deduced; we lind for it: p t = 6,1 ; 5,5; 5, 6. If we consider that
differences of resp. 0,05 0,10 and 0,13 in these three limiting values
mean a change in q x of 0.6, we may assume that the uncertainty
of each of these values for q x remains below the unit. As the average
we then find q x = 5,7 ± 0,6, from which follows
:r = 0",0072 r = 140 parsecs
where r probably lies between the limits 100 and 200 parsecs. The
absorbing nebulae in Taurus therefore lie behind the Hyades at about
a four times greater distance. They stretch on Dyson and Melotte's
chart over an extent of 30°, which is to say about 70 parsecs. The
dimension of the oblong, strongly absorbing region A are about 9°
by 3°, or 20 by 7 parsecs. Barnard in his catalogue describes small
black objects lying therein (and in the other region B) of 1° (nr. 5
and 18), 8' (nr. 24) and 4' (nr. 28) dimension; their linear dimens-
ions are then 500000, 40000 and 30000 astronomical units.
