We can therefore also write (7):
{x-x')v%-\-{y-y)v% r +(z-z')v%,= Q ... (9)
that means, in the inverse motion P lies in the normal plane of the
path of the point P' fixed to Tf.
If at any moment in the direct motion P' lies in the normal plane
of the path of the point P fixed to T m then in the inverse motion
P lies in the normal plane of the path of the point P' fixed to Tf.
We have already seen that the condition for P' to be the centre
of the sphere of curvature of the path of P in the direct motion,
is expressed by the equations (7) or (8); what are then the conditions
for P to be the centre of the sphere of curvature of the path of
P' in the inverse motion?
The equation of the normal plane of the path of P' in the inverse
motion is
(X-V) «g* + (Y-y') v% r + (Z-z) v® z > = 0; . . (10)
the centre of the sphere of curvature of the path of P' is therefore
defined by this equation and two more derived from it by differ-

which follow from
for instance

In order to express that P(x,y,z) is the centre in question, we
must substitute
X = x, Y=.y, Z=zz.
But then (10) is transformed into (8a), and we have already seen
that in the way indicated before the equations (Sb) and (8c) appear
from (Ha) (§ 7). Hence:
If P' is the centre of the sphere of curvature of the path of P
in the direct motion, P is the centre of the sphere of curvature of
the path of P' in the inverse motion, in other words the cubical
transformation is reversed together with the motion.
We can go one step further.
The locus of the points P fixed to T m the paths of which relative
to Tf — hence in the direct motion — have a contact of the fourth
order ($ 7) with the spheres of curvature in P, is at any moment
