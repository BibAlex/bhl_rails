the tube used. Hence an error in the temperature of the thermostat
has little influence on the rise of temperature in the solidifying
substance.
The rise of temperature is measured as function of the time. The
velocity of crystallisation being known, the temperature in the tube
is easy to find as function of the position because the distribution of
temperature prevailing at one moment moves uniformly past the
thermo-element.

Fig. 3.
Every ten seconds a time signal is given in the registered curve.
The temperature has been calculated at the moment of these signals,
and this has been done besides at the intermediate moments, so that
the temperature is known every five seconds. The values thus
obtained are drawn on four curves (fig. 3) with different symbols.
Also the calculated curve is reproduced in the same figure. The
ordinate represents the rise of temperature, and the abscissa the
distance in cm. to the boundary plane of the phases. The agreement
of the measurements with the theoretical curve confirms the correct-
ness of theory and observation.
Even without a complete calculation of the theoretical distribution
of the temperature, a few particularities met with in the measurement
of the temperature, can be explained from the theory.
