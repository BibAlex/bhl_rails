Every registered curve can serve for the determination of a point
of the curve that indicates the relation between rate of crystallisa-
tion and boundary temperature. The sum of the temperature of the
thermostat and the rise of temperature following from the curve,
gives the boundary temperature. The temperature of the thermostat
and the dimensions of the tube determine the velocity of crystalli-
sation, which can be derived from the results of the measurements
carried out with this purpose (p. 698).
In tig. 4 the abscissa is the temperature of the boundary plane
of the phases and the ordinate the velocity of crystallisation. As
appears from the tigure, the temperature does not reach the melting-
point (42°) in any of the measurements, but always remains far
below it l ). The observations yielding temperatures of the boundary
above 29° are of no value in consequence of the phenomenon
mentioned on p. 698, hence they have not been reproduecd in tig. 4.
When one wants to determine the portion of the curve above 29°,
another experimental method must be followed, in which the process
of solidification has a mathematically defined course also near the
melting-point, and does not depend on accidental disturbances.
I am greatly indebted to the instrument maker of the Physical
Laboratory, Mr. G. Koolschijn, for the trouble he has taken boring
the holes in the tubes used by me.
