P(x, y, z) — i. e. a point with the coordinates x, y, z, relative to T m —
is called the absolute velocity of P, the one relative to T m the rela-
tive velocity of P, the absolute velocity of a point coinciding with
P and fixed to T m the convection-velocity of P; they are resp.
represented by v a , v r , v m .

If P is fixed to T m , we have

In the following we shall as a rule indicate the absolute velocity
of a point fixed to T m by v m .
If J n is the absolute acceleration of P(.v, y, z), we can express
Jajc, Ja,y, Ja,z in the following way.
We choose an arbitrary /fcwd point P (#„ y , z ) i. e. fixed to T/ f
and consider the segment P P l which is equal and parallel to and
equally directed with the vector v a representing the absolute velocity
of P; then according to its definition the absolute acceleration of P
is equal in amount and direction to the absolute velocity of P lt
