For a point fixed to Tf

If we understand by J a the absolute acceleration of the second
order of P{x, y, z), i.e. the vector of which the projections on the
fixed axes are :

We call attention to the fact that for each value of n the ex-

Remark. The preceding formulae may be simplified by making
the axis OZ coincide with the instantaneous screw-axis ; in this case

$ 3. If we call the motion of T m relative to Tf the direct motion,
we understand by the "inverse motion" the motion of Tf relative
to T m -, here the convection-velocity is therefore the velocity relative
to T m of a point fixed to Tf, we shall represent this velocity
by 3?.
Let P{x, y, z) be fixed to Tf, then according to (l a )
