Chemistry. — "On the Grystalforms of some Substituted Amides
of Para-Toluenesulphonic Acid." By Prof. F. M. Jaeger.
(Communicated at the meeting of June 26, 1920).
$ 1. In the following the results are communicated of an inves-
tigation concerning the crystallographical properties of a series of
substituted amides derived from p-toluene-sul phonic acid 1 ), already
prepared by Prof. Van Romburgh in J 902. These preparations, which
in general occur in beautiful crystals, were ceded to me a long-
time ago by the said chemist for the purpose indicated ; but the
results of these measurements have not been published hitherto.
To colleague van Romburgh's benevolence 1 am indebted also for
some still lacking data on the specific weight of several of these
substances.
In the text occasionally attention has been drawn to some regu-
larities of the cnstalforms of these derivatives, which, from a che-
mical standpoint, are closely related to each other; a review of the
numerical data is, moreover, added to this paper at the end. Distinct
relations in the crystal forms of these derivatives have, however, not
been found in great number, notwithstanding their close chemical
relationship.

This substance, which melts at 141° C, crystallizes from ethyl-
alcohol in big, very transparent crystals, which often possess curved
