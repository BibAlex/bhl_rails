Physics. — "The so-called cyanogen-bands" . By G. Holst and
E. Oostehhuis. (Communicated by Prof. H. Kamerlingh Onnes).
(Communicated at the meeting of May 29, 1920).
In photographing the nitrogen-spectrum one usually observes a
number of bands, which were formerly ascribed to cyanogen 1 ).
The most prominent of these bands lie between 3855 and 3883 A.
and between 4158 and 4216 A. In J 914 Grotrian and Runge 5 )
made some experiments, from which they concluded, that these
bands are due to nitrogen and should not be ascribed to cyanogen.
Many later observers 3 ) have considered this view to be the right one.
We have made a new investigation on this point and came to
the conclusion that these bands are not due to nitrogen, but to one
of its compounds which condenses at a much higher temperature.
In our experiment the discharge tube was a cylindrical glass tube
with one electrode connected to a Tesla-transformator. The gas in
the tube was an argon-nitrogen-
mixture containing about 15%
of nitrogen. The gaspressure was
1- about 55 cm. Under these cir-
cumstances the spectrum shows
no argon lines, only the nitro-
2. genbands and the so-called
"cyanogen-bands". (Fig. 1).
The bands 3855 — 3883 A
3 can be seen at A, the bands
4158-4216 A at B.
In order to discriminate
whether these bands are due to
nitrogen or to cyanogen, we immerged the lower half of the discharge
tube into a glass filled with liquid oxygen and so obtained the
spectrum fig. 2.
