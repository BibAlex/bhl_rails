Follicles with more than one eggcell are not unknown in man,
however. The limit seems to be three. In some animals vesicles are
found with numerous eggcells, this is
even a normal phenomenon. The human
ovary described here is already important
owing to the rather large number of
eggcells ; it gains in importance on tracing
l| the origin of the abnormal vesicles.
The former conception of the genesis
of the ovary was (briefly) the following:
From the germinal epithelium cellular
cords penetrate into the ovary (occasion-
ally they have rather the character of
tubes or wedges). These so-called/'Strange"
or"Schlauche"ofVALENTiNPFLÃ¼GERContain
the primordial eggs and the future follicle
cells. Gradually, connective tissue penetrates through these cords,
destroys their connection with the germinal epithelium and divides
them into cell-groups.
These cellgroups (Eggballs, Waldeyeh) contain a number of egg-
cells and many follicle cells. Afterwards, every eggcell is surrounded
by a single coat of folliclecells and the eggnests divide into a number
