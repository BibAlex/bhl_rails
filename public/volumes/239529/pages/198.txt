Hence dx /dv is always negative at
the critical temperature itself, when
A [/a has such a high value as in
mercury and similar substances. Then
the degree of dissociation of the double
molecules Hg, decreases when the
volume becomes greater, instead of
increasing — as it generally does.
As a (v— b) : v* {a and /; assumed
constant) has its maximum value at
v=2b, the transition temperature for
v->oo values of v both about < 26 and
> 2b will be lower than that (7\) at
v = 2b, which latter will be only little higher than that at v = v c
(about 4 Tr) 1 ). See fig. 1.
The decrease of x with increasing volume is of course accounted
for in this way, that on increase of the degree of dissociation x with
increasing volume also a becomes greater. But this causes the volume
to decrease again, in which the decrease in the end exceeds the
original increase.
At high temperature the pressure will be comparatively great,
so that then, in consequence of an increase of a, p -\- n /,v will be
increased little; v — b, hence also v, will then be lowered compara-
tively little. For this reason dx /d v will always be positive at high
/VCr. /
i) The righthand branch of the transition curve (dotted in the figure) will get
more to the left, and 1\ possibly slightly lower than would follow from the above
calculation, because then x can no more be assumed near 0. The intersection with the
vapour branch of the saturation curve takes place at T = about 0,8 T c - For
