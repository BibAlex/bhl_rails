systole thus excited, the ventricle presents a premature systole. The

experiment will succeed better when at the fourth deflection of the
signal the shock is repeated during a post compensatory systole at
an earlier moment. Now an extra-systole of the auricles originates
in the beginning of the excitable period. The excitation reaching the
ventricle after this, comes early enough to evoke a brief fibrillation.
As before, the auricles exhibit some anomalies. At the sixth deflection
of the signal the auricles are once more stimulated during a post-
compensatory systole. This time this stimulus affects the auricles a
little earlier still than the preceding time. After this extra systole
of' the auricles the ventricle begins to fibrillate for a longer period
under the influence of the excitation. During this fibrillation the
auricles present anomalies similar to the preceding.
In Fig. 3 the curves show that the contractility of the ventricle
was still intense 1 ), although through indirect stimulation the ventricle
could be made to fibrillate. At 1 the auricles receive an induction
shock, which gives rise to an extrasystole of the auricles.
This is followed by a premature ventricular systole with the ordinary
a â€” v-interval. At 2 the extra-stimulus is repeated directly after the
postcompensatory sytole, which is succeeded by a small extra-systole
l ) With all curves taken with double suspension, the ventricular curves were
registered with a fivefold magnification.
