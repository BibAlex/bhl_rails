besides at the points of inflexion there, where the tortuosity is equal

We calculate the projections jf\ jf, J { * } of the acceleration of
the second order on the tangent, the principal normal and the binormal.
If a, a x , a, are the cosines of the angles which these make with the
fixed X t -axis, we find from :

In the motion relative to 'J'/ of a fixed system connected with
T m ,Jm]b is therefore equal to zero in those points where the plane
of osculation is stationary and inversely, because — at least in the
general case — no points appear where v m is equal to zero.
The velocity being directed along the tangent and the acceleration
(of the first order) lying in the plane of osculation, this plane is
stationary at those points and at those points only where the velo-
