60 minutes. The temperature was 21° ± 1° C. ; the concentrations
of the solutions of salts used were consecutively varied from 0,1
normal to full saturation. The complex salt used was carefully
purified and did not. contain any appreciable amount of cob alto -oxalate;
moreover, the solutions were stirred by the aid of a current of
carbondioxhle, after it had been demonstrated, that this gas had no
influence upon the speed of reaction.
Above we have given a review of the results obtained, while in fig. 1
these data are reproduced in graphs, in which the equivalent-con-
centrations of the electrolytes added are used as abscissae, while
the percentages of the original salt transformed, are taken as
ordinates in it.
The determinations with BeCl 2 and Fe t Cl n are somewhat less
accurate, as a consequence of secondary influences, as e.g. the strong
hydrolysis of the berylliumsa\t, and perhaps the formation of complex
compounds in the case of the ferric salt; by these factors the image may
be somewhat less definite. The data obtained in these cases follow here :

§ 6. In these series of observations evidently we cannot speak of
real reaction-constants : the data available do agree neither with the
supposition of a monomolecular, nor of a bimolecular reaction-form.
