component and a component tangent to the circular orbit; in such
a manner that these four directions will be all perpendicular to each
other. Now, if (he planet with the geodesical falling axes comes across
some particular set of local axes, the axes of time, both the falling
and the local, will coincide, and therefore the spaces of the falling
and of the local axes too will be the same. Thus the position of
the falling axes relative to the local ones can be stated and the
positions before and after a revolution compared.
The gravitational tield of the sun is given by the form of the
infinitesimal interval :
dr*
ds' = (1 — tt/r) dt* — r* dO* — r* sin* O d<p\
1 — a/r
In this field a circular motion is possible in the plane 6 = ^jt,
with "radius" R and with angular velocity

It will be seen that these vectors are all of unit length and
perpendicular to one another. They define the local axes.
A set of these vectors in one particular point-instant can be taken
as the starting vectors of the geodesic falling coordinates. To find
the directions of the falling axes after a lapse of interval ds (com-
ponents A n 9 ds) we need the values of Christoffel's symbols. These are,
