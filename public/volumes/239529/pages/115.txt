The layer will however not be able lo resist a strong normal
impulse. When the radial relative component a is great enough, the
two internally colliding particles may leave each other's sphere of
attraction. Here also the tangential velocity component will not
change. The normal component on the contrary will.
The quantity 4 w« 2 -f- 2 \p will therefore have the same value
before and after the impulse.
We thus must take for fi and y the integration limits — oo and
-\- oo and for « a positive value that satisfies \ ma* -\- 2if> = 0, and -f- oo.
With these limits the integration with respect to «, /? and y gives
in (2) a factor

Let us write £ for the surface of the layer. The surface in (21)
gives a factor S.

Thus we finally find for the number of molecules dissociating
per unit of time and per unit of volume
n ( 2 \ V n \'l*
Dividing this by the number of molecules (1) per unit of volume,
we find the following value for the velocity constant

Of course the /;, can be found in the same way as h x .
Thus far we have supposed, that every impulse is followed by
a combination. The meaning of h % v, 2 is therefore the number of
collisions per unit of time and volume. We find for it 1 )

This gives therefore a verification of the equation K = —
