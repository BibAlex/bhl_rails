The larvae were, indeed, counted only about a month after they had
been transferred from the egg-patches to the food, and being very
small, some might have been overlooked.
To verify this method of spreading, the egg-patches, in four
other trials, were deposited in empty dishes (not provided with
food), and the newly hatched larvae counted and removed. Any
overlooking of the larvae was precluded in this manner. The result
of these four experiments was as follows.

Here, too, there is little if any agreement among the mortality
figures: The result of these experiments gave no occasion forgiving
up as unreliable the previous method of carefully spreading the
bran in small quantities. This is why this proceeding has always
been followed in the subsequent fixing of the mortality figures; also
because one acquires such a dexterity in it that an overlooking of
the larvae becomes all but impossible.
In the first two years the mortality of the eggs of nearly all cul-
tures was determined. The following averages were then obtained.

The abnormally high mortality figure of the experimental year
1916—1917 as compared with 1915—1916, is striking. For this no
definite cause can be assigned, except perhaps temperature influences,
