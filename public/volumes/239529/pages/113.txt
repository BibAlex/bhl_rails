Introducing the coordinates of the centre of mass and the relative
coordinates for a pair, viz:
Xjs = 4 (* + .'•') etc. X r = x' — x etc.
$ = \ (u + u) etc. a = u' — u etc.
and putting

The number of atoms per unit of volume is found by integration
of n over u,v,w and by division by dx dy dz. As always further
on we think namely of a diluted gas and thus find :
The number of molecules per unit of volume is found in the
same way from M a , namely
, i==M . e -. W (|/^-J(^J«o. . . . (1)
where <o has been written for the volume of the sphere of attraction.
We thus find for the dissociation constant K the formula
K = ~ = Lioe-W = ±<oe~kT (/)
Passing to the velocity constants we may use the following con-
siderations. A number of iodine molecules per unit of volume will
dissociate spontaneously with a velocity proportional to the number
of molecules, thus
dt x *
The atoms will associate spontaneously with a velocity proportional
to the number of pair of atoms. By this the number of molecules
will increase, thus
dt ■ '
In the stationary state we must have therefore
k l v t = k t v l ' or -± = -±=K.
The value of K has been found above.
Accepting the image of the dissociation we evidently can also
