town average. That was the reason why I did not (ake these citizens
into consideration, in fixing the provincial average.
The difference between the indices of the population of the two
towns and of the province in which these towns are situated, are
apparent from the foregoing and from the following table.
Noord-Hollaud
Zuid-Holland
\ in the country 80.5
( Amsterdam 79. â€”
in the country 79.6
Rotterdam 79.2
A comparison of these indices teaches us that the people of both
these big towns have a relatively narrower head than the people
living in the country, surrounding these towns. This fact is not new,
it has been well-known for a long time that in general the population
ol' a town belongs to a more long-headed type than the people
living in the country, this rule holds good also for the towns of
Amsterdam and Rotterdam.
As far as I had a sufficient number of data at my disposal, I
sought, in how far this rule could be applied to towns of a smaller
size. This fact is proved by the following data for the towns of
Utrecht, Arnhem and Haarlem.
Utrecht (province) 80.5
Utrecht (town) 79.1
Gelderland 80.4
Arnhem 79.4
N. Holland 80.5
Haarlem 79.4
Adding to these data those, mentioned above for Amsterdam and
Rotterdam, it is obvious that in the towns mentioned above, the
Index cephalicus oscillates between 79 and 79.4, and this is com-
paratively far below the provincial averages. The citizen has, as
regards the proportions of his head, a type of his own, opposed to
the rural people and this type occurs already in towns of a relatively
small extent. We only state this fact without going farther into the
importance or into the theories, based on this fact.
Let us consider now the second group of numbers, which are
marked in the provinces on the map added to this article and which
refer to the absolute measurements of the head. The number indicates
the sum of the greatest length and greatest breadth of the head.
