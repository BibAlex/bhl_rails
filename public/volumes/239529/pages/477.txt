the unobscuied stars before the screen only), as represented in the
drawing by the heavy line (e = oo).
d. For the bright magnitudes the value of the logarithmic defect
depends mainly on the distance q x , for the faint magnitudes it depends
in the first place on the absorption-coefficient e of the dark nebula.
For increasing (>, the effect of one and the same absorption on the
logarithmic defect decreases..
From this follows in the first place, that it will be difficult to
apply this method in general. In the case of small black spots (like
the trifid hole near 7 Aquilae) the defect can be ascertained over
some magnitudes (e.g. from the 11 th to the 16 th magnitude),
but this range is too small to separate the two unknowns Q t and e
and to find both ; the number of brighter stars is too small to allow
of anj r deductions. As we require data over the most divergent
magnitudes, this method can only be profitably applied to regions
of such extent, that it gives us t he disposal also over a sufficient
material of bright stars. This is the case with the dark nebulae in
Taurus.
