more fat, in the form of rusk, Avas added by way of trial. According
to the number of larvae one or more whole rusks were put in the
larvae jars. The creatures took them with eagerness. For comparison
some other jars were provided with some slices of peat. Also under
these, the larvae gather up and they make large passages in the
peat. It is not probable that the peat should serve them for food.
After this experience the following comparative experiments were made.
Six jars were provided with :
NV 1 only bran (B.)
N°. 2 bran on a layer of peat (B.P.).
N'. 3 only meal (flour) (M.).
N°. 4 meal (flour) on a layer of peat (M.P.).
N°. 5 bran with rusk (B.R.).
N°. 6 meal (flour) with rusk (M.R.).
In each jar 300 eggs were placed in the same period (May 27 —
June 21 191o). Down to February 10, 1916 included, the following
numbers of pupae were collected :

From the foregoing figures, though provisional, the following
conclusions may be drawn.
1. An exclusive nutrition of bran is inadequate to a normal growth
of the larvae.
2. An exclusive nutrition of meal is better than bran alone.
3. An addition of rusk to meal or bran promotes the development
of the larvae considerably.
4. An addition of rusk gives a better result to bran than to meal ;
the pupation is 4 per cent higher.
This provisional result was again tested in the following manner.
