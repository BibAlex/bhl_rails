Now, if we calculate the geodesic increment along ds of the
vector components:

dA a l = — i^a/2R' . A a \ ds, or = — to A a t ds,
dA° s = + * / a/2R l . A a x ds, or = + w A a t da.
From this we infer that the falling axes of Z^ l \ Z(' ó \ after the
lapse of interval ds, as compared with the local axes reached after
the interval, show a retrograde rotation of amount cuds in the plane
of these axes. Meantime the planet's anomaly has increased by wdt.
Thus, the two angular velocities are the same if the one is measured
in ds and the other in dt. The ratio is
ds = \/(l-3a/2R).dt.
In the circular planetary motion this will continue uniformly, and
it follows that when the planet has completed a revolution, the
falling axes will not yet have completed theirs if compared with
the local axes passed by during their motion. At the instant the falling
axes will have completed a revolution, the radius vector will make
an angle of

with the radius from which they started. Relative to this new radius
everything will be in exactly the same position as it was in the
beginning of the revolution,
Neglecting higher powers of a/R we conclude that there is a
precession which, per annum, amounts to the excess of the angle
between the two radii over 2ji, i.e.
