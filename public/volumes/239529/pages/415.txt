§ 1. Introduction. The equilibrium between two phases has been
fully investigated experimentally and theoretically. Little, however,
is known about the cases in which there is no equilibrium, but
one phase is converted into another. In the first case the thermo-
dynamic laws may serve as basis of all considerations ; in the second
case, however, such leading principles are entirely wanting. The
researches on the dynamics of the conversion of phases are quite
detached, and are often restricted to the collecting of empirical data
the meaning of which is not quite clear.
It would be very desirable to develop a general theory of
dynamics, which will have to include "thermodynamics" as the
special case of its statics. Whether this is possible from a purely
phenomenological point of view, further experiment will have to
teach.
In what follows I have worked out a general method for the
treatment of the special case of the solidification of a chemically
simple substance.
On transition of a supercooled melt into the solid condition the
following processes should be sharply distinguished:
1. The formation of particles of the solid phase in the supercooled
liquid l ).
2. The further growth of each of these particles, and also the
growth of a particle of the solid substance put into the liquid
purposely *).
Only the second point will be treated in this communication. In
this the particularities which are in connection with the anisotropy
of the solid substance will not be taken into account. In this way
the problem is simplified, but at the same time the idea of accounting
for the formation of the crystalline form is abandoned.
