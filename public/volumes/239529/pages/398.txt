The locus of the points the paths of which have at the considered
moment a stationary plane of osculation, is a surface of the third
order.
In the same way we show that the locus of the points the paths
of which have at the considered moment a contact of the fourth
order with the plane of osculation, is represented by

i.e. to this locus belong the common points of the four surfaces of
the third order of which the equations appear by successively omit-
ting a ray out of the above-mentioned matrix. The required locus
is therefore according to a well known theorem of the determinants

i.e. the cubic we found before as the locus of the points of inflexion.
The common points of the four cubical surfaces form therefore a
twisted curve of the sixth order.
The locus of the points of which the paths at the considered moment
have a contact of the fourth order with the plane of osculation, is
a twisted curve of the sixth order.
$ 6. Let P(x,y,z) be a point of the fixed system connected to
T m and P' (x\ y' , z') the centre of the sphere of curvature of the
path of P; in this case P' has the characteristic property that the
