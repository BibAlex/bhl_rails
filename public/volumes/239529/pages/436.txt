The detailed structure of the discontinuities in the induction as they
have been observed with the galvanometer, is roughly indicated
in fig. 2. It is seen that as a rule the value of' B before making a
jump, remains constant a little while. The smallness of the jumps
and the insufficient damping of the galvanometer, however, rendered
the observations very difficult.
By connecting the solenoid round the nickel-steel rod both with
the galvanometer and with the triode-amplifier, the stronger claps
could be indeutified with the greater jumps in the galvanometer
detlections. The weaker claps however could not be observed
galvanometrically.
Finally the order of magnitude of the discontinuities in the induction
was determined for nickel-steel.
To that purpose a second coil (diameter 8,65 mm., one layer of
50 windings of length 45 mm.) was placed inside the first solenoid.
A pulse of the current of 40 milli-ampère was necessary to obtain
a leap in the galvanometer deflection of the same order of
magnitude as those observed during the magnetisation of the nickel-
steel. The intensity of the field in the coil was therefore :
50
H = 0.4 Jt 7i, i amv = 0.4 jt — 0,04 = 0,56 Gauss.
'' 4.5
We thus find for the change of the flux through a winding of
the solenoid
dN= n j — '— — ) 0,56 = 0,33 lines of force.
When therefore we assume the conception above described of the
change of sign of magnetisation of long filaments to be correct, we
should find for the order of magnitude of the cross-section of such
a fibre of the ferro- magnetic nickel-steel :
iS =1 ' 8310 - 5cm "
on the assumption of a maximum induction 18000 as for iron.
Assuming finally a cylindrical form we find for the diameter:
0,05 mm.,
a not quite improbable value. These calculations are however to be
regarded as preliminary; further investigations being indispensable
to bring more clearness in this complicated phenomenon.
