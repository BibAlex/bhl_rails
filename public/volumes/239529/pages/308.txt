of the soil and the sedimentation was still in progress. The belt G t
generalij has been upheaved, folded and compressed to a stronger
degree than the belt Q x .
The folding of the belt G, is not seldom accompanied by volcanic
activity causing the sediments in this area to be for the greater
part composed of volcanic material. This area G t might, in contra-
distinction to L, also be called the secondary area of denudation.

Our object in writing this paper is to discuss how far the position
of the oil-fields of the Dutch East-Indies, fits in with the scheme
sketched above.
The location of these oil-fields is marked on the accompanying
sketchmap 1 ) (Fig. 2). They are situated along the north-east coast of
Sumatra, along the north coast of Java and along the east coast of
Borneo. The sediments of which those oil-fields consist, have been
deposited in the geosynclines in Tertiary, especially in Neogene time.
i) In compiling this sketchmap two authorities on the Australasian oil-fields
Klein and Rutten kindly have procured me some valuable data.
