When (5) is substituted in the equations (3) and (4), and when
in these equations the following form is written :
v — Vj ; — v =£=»,,

Besides there are still the limit conditions (2^) and (2b), which
are in this case:
(0^=0= (tf.W^ (8a)
---(?) -■'•(?) = «*' < 86)
The liquid having a normal velocity V at the boundary surface,
it is not self-evident that (2b) may be applied unmodified. A closer
examination, however, teaches that this is, indeed, the case, and
that therefore (8b) is correct l ).
Besides the relations (6), (7), and (8) the temperatures must satisfy
other conditions which hold at infinite distance and on the wall of
the tube. The tube being in surroundings of constant temperature,
this temperature in both phases must exist at infinite distance from
the boundary surface, where the influence of the generated heat of
melting is not felt. The zero-point of the temperature being arbitrary,
the temperature of the surroundings is chosen for it, and thus the
following conditions are obtained :
(Ö.U =0 ; (0 a )* a =«,=O (9)
It is less simple to take the influence of the wall of the tube
into account. When one wants to solve the problem accurately, also
a differential equation must be drawn up for the temperature in
the wall of the tube, and this temperature must be brought in connec-
tion with the temperature of the solid and the liquid substance in the
tube by means of boundary conditions corresponding to (2a) and (2ft).
At the outer surface of the wall the temperature must be zero, i.e
equal to that of the surrounding space.
To put this train of reasoning into practice, though not impossible
in principle, would lead to very elaborate calculations. In the cases
