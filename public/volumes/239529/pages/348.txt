in pure ventral position of the animal, with horizontal mouth-fissure
and symmetrical position of the head relative to the trunk.
Now, when the trunk is moved on its dorso-ventral axis towards
the left eye, this eye will move in the direction of the palpebral aperture
towards the nose; the M. intern us contracts and, as will be seen
later on, at the same time a relaxation of the M. externus appears.
This and a movement in the direction of the arrow educes a new
position illustrated in Fig. \b. Now the head is brought into another

position with the muzzle vertically downwards. When the position
of the trunk is symmetrical with the head, we find, however, quite
another position of the eye in theorbita. The tonic labyrinth-reflexes
caused the eye to perform a marked rotatory movement with the
upper pole in a direction towards the ear. (Fig. lc). This, however,
has also brought about a shifting of the insertions of the Mm inter-
ims and externus in the orbita. Now when precisely the same move-
ment with the trunk is performed as previously, again a contraction
of the M. interims and a relaxation of the M. externus will obtain;
the result from the movement of the eye relative to the orbita how-
ever has become quite different. Now the eye does not move in the
direction of the palpebral aperture (Fig. Id), but about vertically to
it; the left eye attains its new position by a movement anteriorly
upwards (the right eye by one posteriorly downward).
As said above, also other differences in the cervical reflexes with
different position of the head in space, observed by Barany, could
be accounted for by a superposition of labyrinth- and cervical reflexes.
Since the tonic labyrinth reflexes act now in one way, now in an
opposite way, or sometimes, as in the above example, act rather in
conjunction with the tonic cervical reflexes, a seemingly irregular
complex of reflexes is produced, which at first sight is difficult to
disentangle.
