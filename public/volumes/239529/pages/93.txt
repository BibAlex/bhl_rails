In tli is way 1 was able to compare haemodigestion and gelatine-
liqnefaclion within the group of Proteus-bacteria.
All the Proteusstrains which I have at my disposal (e.g. some
indol-producing representatives of Bacterium vulgaire Hauseri, Pro-
Fig. 3.
Fig. 4.
teus X l9 of Weil and Felix producing indol as well and several
representatives of the Bacterium anindologenes distinguished by me
as a separate species) are haemolytic, that is to say, they form a
halo of blood-agar and cause the oxyhaemoglobin to come out from
the blood-broth.
They do not all liquefy gelatine. The an-indologenic strain Pneu-
maturia, which liquefied gelatine strongly 16 years ago, lost this
power long ago. This strain is the only one forming no halo on the
blood-bile agar plate. Other facts may be added to this argument
for the conception that also within the Proteus group, oxy haemo-
globin-digestion and gelatine-liquefacting are caused by the same
ferment: only the non-haemodigestive Proteus-strain does not digest
the casein, as the others do and the liquefaction halos, constructed
by means of the gelatine-stripe method are congruent with the halos
of haemodigestion on the blood-bile plate.
Moreover I mention the experiments on B. prodigiosus, a gelatine-
liquefying coccus from the air, B. anthracis, Vibrio dunbar, all of
them haemodigestive and liquefying the gelatine, opposed to B. typhi,
coli, B. paratyphi A. and B., B. pseudo-tuberculosis rodentiwn,
B. dysenteriae Shiga and Flexnkr, which do not form a halo on the
