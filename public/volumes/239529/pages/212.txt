the second effect predominates over the first and the velocity coeffi-
cient instead of decreasing, increases with the concentration of
sodium picrate.
Moreover Walden has shown that there are two types of salts
with regard to their effects on the di-electric constant of the solvent.
He has observed that N(CH 3 ) 4 C1 markedly increases the di-electric
constant of the solvent, whilst CH g NH a HCl affects this constant to
a very slight extent. It is quite possible that even in aqueous solution
salts like potassium oxalate, sodium acetate, etc. do not increase
appreciably the ionising power of the solvent and the velocity of
the reaction in its presence does not increase. In this way we can
explain the negative effect of potassium oxalate and positive effect
of sodium picrate on ester hydrolysis from the point of view of the
change of the di-electric constant of the solvent due to the dissolution
of electrolytes.
SUMMARY.
a. The hydrolysis of methyl acetafe was investigated in presence
of oxalic acid and picric acid and sodium picrate. In the former case,
the velocity coefficient falls off, whilst in the case of picric acid,
the velocity coefficient increases with the concentration of sodium
picrate up to a certain extent and then decreases with the increase
of the concentration of sodium picrate.
b. An explanation of these results is suggested on the basis of the
increase of the di-electric constant and ionising power of the solvent
observed by Walden when salts are dissolved in it.
