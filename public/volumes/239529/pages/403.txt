P' of Of is the centre of the sphere of curvature which has five
points in common with the path of a point P of O m .
CONCLUDING REMARK.
In § 7 we remarked:
If a point P describes a twisted curve y and the point P' the
curve which is the locus of the centres of the spheres of curvature
of y in P, the condition that such a sphere has with y a contact
of the fourth order is expressed by putting the velocity of P' equal
to zero.
We shall briefly indicate the proof of this proposition.
If we represent y by the equation developed in $ 5 (footnote),
and the sphere of curvature by
d 1
a* -f y » 4. z ' — 2 Ry — 2 R* T =0,
dt R
we find for the condition for a contact of the fourth order
1 i R d / dR\ |
and for the arc described by P' (see e.g. Bianchi-Lukat : Vorlesun-
gen über Differential-Geometrie, I, zweite Auflage, p. 25)
R d ( dR
1
From v ax ' = follows <f 4 = as -^7^ = 00 is excluded. Inversely
R 1
1
<f 4 is only equal to zero, when v az ' is equal to zero, as for -— =
R 1
v a ,x' becomes generally infinite and d, differs from zero. It would
lead us too far if we entered further into this.
