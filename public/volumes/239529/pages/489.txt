The so-called cyan ogen -ban ds have completely disappeared ; it
follows that these bands do not belong to nitrogen, but to a much
more easily condensable substance, probably cyanogen. 1 )
This is in accordance with Steubing's observations; the latter found
no trace of the cyanogenbands in his experiments^ where the presence
of any carbon was excluded. *)
Probably Grotrian and Runge's nitrogen was not completely Ã¯ree
from carbon. This may be due to the fact that they purified their
nitrogen by pyrogallicacid-solution ; during this operation small
quantities of carbon monoxide are usually developed.

') In some of our experiments we completely immersed the discharge-tube in
liquid oxygen, the spectrogram being taken through the walls of the Dewarvessel.
During the operation of the Tesla transformer the walls of the Dewarglass show
the green fluorescence of cathode rays. In one of our experiments however some
gas was liberated in the space between the walls of the Dewarvessel. so that a
red glow appeared, the radiation of which is superposed on that of the discharge-
tube. The so-obtained spectrogram is shown in fig. 3. A peculiar phenomenon may
o
be observed. Some of the cyanogen-bands, namely 3855, 3883 and 4168 A. come
out very strongly, whereas the other ones are absent. So it is not impossible,
that the cyanogen-bands are due to two different carriers.
J ) Simular results have been obtained by L. Hamburger, who also found no
trace of the cyanogenbands in extremely pure nitrogen. Ghem. Weekblad (15)931
