Here follows a proof for the theorem of Picard, which is founded
on the theorem of Landau and which is for the rest elementary.
1. Let f{z) be holomorphic for z < R and let it there become
1
nowhere or 1, while -< U/(0) | <\i. Then according; to the theorem
of Landau :
|r/)(u)j-i< |/(*)| <<p((i), for \z\<kR.
By ffiii) we can understand the upper limit of ] /{z)\, when
I z I < \ R, for the functions which satisfy the conditions mentioned.
Then (p (p) is a monotonely increasing function of (x. We shall prove
that rp (p) increases at a slower rate than a certain power of [i. Let
in the first place n = e 2k ~, where k is a positive integer, and con-
sider the function

v ' (2k + 2)ni
in which for z = the numerator is equal to the principal value
of Logf[0). X(z) is uniform and holomorphic for ] z \ <^ R and
there nowhere zero or 1, because ƒ 0) 7^ and 7^1. Further
I Log) /"(<>) I I 4- 71

From <r- zhl < \ f (0) < e 2k * follows Lotj ƒ (0ï| | < 2&jr, so that I (0j <1 .
Now the theorem of Landau gives
X(z)\<q(l^)=p, for I *
R
so that
and
Logf(z) i <(2* + 2).t 7 >, for z <-,
We have therefore :
<£> (e 2fcr )<[ e( 2 ^+ 2 ^ for X: = a positive integer.
If fi be an arbitrary number >j, we can find a positive integer
k for which
Then
y (fx) < 7: (e 24rr ) < e( 2 H-2Vp < e^P pp.
For fx ^> 1 we have therefore
y(n)<atiP (1)
in which a=e in r and p = qp (1, 4).
2. Let us now consider a function i^(f), holomorphic in a certain
neighbourhood i2 of O (z = 0) with the exception of (9. Let there
exist a neigbourhood of 0, Si' < i2 in which F(z)^0 and 7e 1.
We describe a circle inside Li' with radius 2 p.
