for some distance. If the temperature was then kept constant, the
E. F. decreased till the stable branch was reached (see the points

In the second place tin was combined with copper, in which the
following result was reached.
When these results are again represented graphically, the transi-
tion point of tin again makes its appearance at 200°. 5, in agreement
with what precedes, but less clearly here. This is seen in fig. 2.

When in this way the reliability of this sensitive and rapid
method had been proved, we applied it to ascertain whether
in copper indications for a transition point could be observed in
the neighbourhood of 70°. As is known, the dilatometric investi-
gation *) gave no indication at all, no more than Bridgman's researches.
The result of this investigation will be discussed in a following paper.
