values lliat fall on curve III with satisfactory accuracy; the bar-
shaped crystals of y too proved to be present in the state of equi-
librium. Consequently § has been hydrated and converted into y.
In pure water this hydration takes place only very slowly; in the
lye-solutions however much more quickly. The cause of this is
probably that in the latter solutions the Al a 3 dissolves primarily
and the hydroxide separates from this solution.
The determinations with the products <) and f are about situated
on the curves 1 and II; this too shows that the hydration takes
place very rapidly in proportion to the stabilisation to product y.
Besides it shows that the differences between the product a, /•? and
y have not disappeared after the heating-, in other words that also
Al„0, exists in various forms. All however are metastable at 30°
as regards the trihydrate.
