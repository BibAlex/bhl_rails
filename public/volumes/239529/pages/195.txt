With regard to the quantity «, the following equation may he
given :
l/a=a l/a, + 7,(1 —a?) j/a 1 =7, l/a, f «O^a, - V, l/a,)^ 1 /, l/a,+ *A|/a,
when \/a x refers to one single molecule and l/^ s to one double
molecule, and L\ a represents the Increase of the attraction, when
7, double molecule passes into J single molecule (atom). As for
mercury 7» V a °. ' s about = 10.. 10 -8 and \/a x about = 40 . If)-' 2 ,
Aj/a has there the exceedingly high value 30. 10~ 2 , i.e. L\/a three
times the value of [/a,.
Hence from a = (]/a)' follows dn / c i i: = 2\ / a. L\/a, and thus the

It is now this last equation that serves as basis for the determi-
nation of the degree of dissociation x of the double molecules, i. e.

Lb will probably be always exceedingly small, and may be neglect-
ed in most cases, whereas on the contrary in this special case,
where the dissociation of the double molecules Hg t leads to isolated
atoms Hg, L\/a will possess a very large value, which quite governs
the modification of the critical quantities.
