direction. The excitations clash against each other and are annihi-

sinus impulse and partly from the extra stimulus. ') It is also clear
that this auricular systole cannot in this case be followed by a
ventricular systole. In the lower curves, registered a little later,
this experiment is repeated with the same result at the first and
the third upward deflection of the signal. At the second upward
deflection of the signal the stimulus is given a little later, so that
then an extrasystole of the ventricle appears. In fig. 4 are illustrated
the suspensioncurves and the electrograms of a frog's heart after
antiarin poisoning. Initially the ventricle pulsated in halved rhythm,
which at the first upward deflection of the signal was changed into
the normal rhythm of twice the velocity. At the second upward
deflection of the signal another inductionshock is administered in
the auriculo- ventricular groove. 2 ) We see from the stringcurve that
this stimulus is administered a short time after the /^-deflection. At
this moment the ventricle is apparently still refractory, so that an
') It goes without saying that it depends on the moment, at which the extra-
stimulus is administered to which impulse the greater part of the auricular systole
owes its origin. So, for instance, in Fig. 6 the two auricular systoles will arise
for the greater part from the extra stimulus.
! ) The moment at which the extra stimulus is applied, is marked by the signal
and may also be seerf from the stringcurve, which shows a small gap owing to
a short swerving of the string.
