Zoology. — "Technical experiences in the breeding of Tenebrio
molitor". By S. A. Arendsen Hein. (Communicated by Prof.
J. W. Moll).
(Communicated at the meeting of April 23, 1920).
Studies on variation in Tenebrio molitor, of which the results are
published in the Journal of Genetics, gave occasion to make some
observations with respect to the practice of the breeding of this
insect. Though these facts are not very suitable for being treated in
a genetical periodical, as they deal especially with technical particulars,
1 thought their publication to be of some value for those who wish
to experiment with this beetle.

Larvae. For the culture of larvae, glass crystallizing jars are
preferable to any other kind. From these jars with their perpendi-
cular slippery wall the larvae cannot escape.
Porcelain pots with perpendicular smooth walls also give satis-
faction. Tin boxes with lids not fitting too close (for the air circulation")
are serviceable only when the inner wall is perfectly smooth (not
varnished or painted), without any rust-stains, solder or rough con-
necting seam, so that the larvae lack any support in crawling up
the wall.
The fulfilment of these conditions is of great importance when the
perfect purity of the cultures is aimed at. Close attention should
