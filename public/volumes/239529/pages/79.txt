h. A concentrated violet solution turns blue on addition of a dilute
acid ; but after neutralizing with a base, the red-violet colour is
restored ; etc.
SUMMARY.
In the above we were able to demonstrate, that the product
of the precipitation of a salt of tetravalent ruthenium by
ammonium sulphide differs with the temperature: at 100° C,
brownish black RuS^ is formed besides free sulphur, but at 0° C.
greenish black Ra8 8 is formed, which has the character of an
irreversible colloidal substance, and which in the presence of
ammonium sulphide in excess, gives a beautiful green, but unstable
colloidal solution. At intermediate temperatures mixtures of both
sulphides are formed besides free sulphur.
The dark green sulphide and the green colloidal solution of RuS 6 ,
the particles of which are negatively charged, rapidly absorbs free
oxygen, and is transformed into a reddish violet solution of the
reversible colloidal ruthenium-pyrosulpldte: RuS t ltf the particles
of which bear a positive electrostatic charge. This salt is, in its turn,
changed by oxygen (air, nitric acid, permanganate) into ruthenium
sulphate and free sulphuric acid. The properlies and reactions of
these different products were investigated on general lines.
