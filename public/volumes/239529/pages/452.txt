actually found, and there thus appeared to exist a very close
agreement between the equilibria of a solid with a liquid phase on
one side, and two solid phases on the other side.
Already a few years after these publications Fock *) undertook
an investigation on the partition of a third substance between mixed
crystals and solutions, but there was not found a constant value
for the coefficient of partition in a single case. If, therefore, this
investigation had not been open to criticism, the conclusion might
have been drawn from it, that the law of partition cannot be
applied here.
Fock's results did not carry conviction, however; 1. because he
omitted to examine the equilibria in which the substance to which
he wanted to apply the law of partition was present in small concen-
trations; 2. as he underrated the difficulties to obtain a homogeneous
mixed crystal phase.
Bellati and Lusanna 2 ) and also Rothmund tried to determine the
molecular size of the dissolved substance from the lowering of the
transition point of KNO, by the application of Van 't Hoff's well-
known formula for the lowering of the freezing point, in which
the heat of transition was then substituted for Q.
Rothmund "), however, soon saw, that this formula is not valid
when mixed crystals are deposited, and for this case arrived at the
formula :
RT'
AT= (#— a.) (1)
in which :
Mj = mol. weight of a solvent.
x 1 = concentration of the first phase.
x, = ,, ,, ,, second ,,
This formula is valid, and follows immediately from Van der
Waals's general equation for two-phase coexistence:
