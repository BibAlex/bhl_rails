Holland (190 resp. 153) it appears that the population of Amsterdam
has longer and narrower heads than the rural population.
This is the cause of the Index cephalicus of the population of
the town being so much lower (79) than the Index cephalicus of
the rural people (80.5).
In Rotterdam I found the following averages : Length 190, breadth
150.5. On comparing these measurements with those of the country,
it appears that both breadth and length are smaller.
The same peculiarity may be applied to the people living in the
towns of Utrecht and Arnhem, as is evident from the following data :
Utrecht Length Breadth

As regards the towns of Rotterdam, Utrecht and Arnhem, the
head is shorter and narrower, in fact smaller, than that of the
people living in the country, surrounding these towns. As the diffe-
rences between the breadth-dimensions are larger than those between
the length-dimensions, the Index cephalicus of the inhabitants of the
town is smaller than the Index cephalicus of the rural people.
