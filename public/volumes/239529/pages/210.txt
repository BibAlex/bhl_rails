does not change appreciably in presence of the strong negative
catalyst hydroqninone.
d. The phenomenon of negative catalysis is very common in
oxidation reactions. Luther's view which emphasises that negative
catalysis cannot take place in a reaction which is entirely free from
positive catalysts, is not substantiated by experimental evidence.
e. The organic substances act as negative catalysts by diminishing
the concentration of the sulphite ion, which is the active agent in
this oxidation; the diminution in concentration of sulphite ion is
caused by the formation of a stable complex of the sulfite and the
organic substance; this complex is not oxidized as readily as the
sulphite ion.
c. Catalytic activity of the undissociated acid.
In recent years the question of acid catalysis has entered into a
new period; and as a result of the accumulation of new observa-
tions and of increased exactitude in the measurement of the velocity
of reactions, evidence has been obtained in support of the view that
the catalysing power of an acid is not entirely due to the hydrogen
ion, but that the undissociated acid also contributes to the observed effect.
This investigation had for its object the determination of the
function of the undissociated parts of oxalic and picric acids in the
hydrolysis of methyl acetate.
The experiments were all conducted at 45°. Dry pure potassium
oxalate and sodium picrate were added in different quantities to
diminish the ionisation of the respective acids. The former salt was
crystallised from Merck's pure sample, and the latter was prepared
from pure materials and purified by repeated crystallisations.
