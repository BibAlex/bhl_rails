Let us first consider the equilibriums of' the gelatinous hydroxide

bility that is considerably greater than that of the other forms of
the hydroxide. Although in diluted solutions crystallization to product
y arises very slowly, the rapidity of this transition is so slight, that
after one or two months we still entirely measure the solubility of
the gelatinous particles «. Most of the determinations performed with
product « therefore form together the curve I; some that greatly
deviate from this curve (see Nos. 10 and 11) have not been analysed
till after a considerably longer time than the others. A consideiable
percentage of a had consequently been converted into y. Yet these
points 10 and 11 are still situated far above curve HI, which
represents the solubility of y. This phenomenon requires our special
attention, for if between the solid phases to which curves I and III
refer, no continuous transition was possible, we then might expect
to remain on curve I as long as the gelatinous phase was present
and a subsequent sudden decline to curve III. ■ The phenomenon
observed here may have various causes :
a. There is a continuous transition between the solid phases of
curves I and III; between these curves we must imagine quite a
