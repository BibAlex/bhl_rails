account of the inequality and uncertainty of the limiting - magnitude).
The normal density N m was adopted from the lists "Groningen
Publications 18"; the argument, the limiting magnitude after the
scale of Groningen 18, was taken, according to Seeliger, dependent
on the star-density, and was for the lowest limit still corrected
by 0,11, ') which gave
6,56— 0,023 (D— 0,7); 8,12— 0,068 (D— 0,7); 9,36— 0,246 {D— 0,7).
On the average these limits in photometric scale are 6.6, 8.1
and 9.4.
b. Two of Kapteyn's "Selected Areas" come within this region:
N°. 47 and N°. 48; N°. 48 is situated closer to the centre, but according to
the chart of Dyson and Melotte just outside a region with strong-
absorption ; N°. 47, though more distant, comes just within the dark
field S.W. from £ Persei. In the "Durchmusterung of Selected
Areas"") the numbers of stars were counted up to 12,0,13,0,14,0,
15,0, and on Area 47 up to 16,0 (faintest stars 15,96 resp. 16,49).
c. From the Dyson and Melotte chart, for every part of the
legion from 3 h to 5 ,l 30 ,n and 20° up to 35° we could draw the
star-density per 100 square minutes on the Franklin-Adams plates,
already reduced to a common system. Regarding the limiting mag-
nitude, for which these densities count, the authors say: "The
limiting magnitude is not accurately fixed, but may be taken at
about 15,8 and should be within m ,25 of this figure" 8 ). I have
tried to control these data by making use of the three "Selected Areas"
(47, 48, 49) falling within this region. To this end the log 1ST' for
these places, as deduced from the Dyson and Melotte chart, was
compared to that of Kapteyn for m = '13, 14, 15 (and 16) and
thus, through interpolation or extrapolation of the deviations from
the normal log iV" the limiting magnitude was deduced, The values
thus obtained are 16,02, 15,83 and 15,90: their average 15,9 has
been adopted. For the rest a mistake of 0,1 in this value gives a
mistake in the log N of 0.03 only.
d. The data of the photographic "Carte du Ciel" cannot in gene-
ral be used here. The great accidental irregularities in the limiting
magnitude of the separate plates does not prevent the fixing of
average densities and an average limiting magnitude, it is true, but
in this case it is the separate plates that count, and these can be
