§ 4. We now assume T m to be connected with a fixed system.
It is required in the first place:
to find "the locus of the points describing a point of inflexion in
their paths — i.e. their paths relative to Tf"
The projection of the acceleration of a movable point on the
binormal of its path is always equal to zero ; if also the projection
on the principal normal is to be zero, it is necessary and sufficient
that the radius of curvature of the path be infinite 1 ), in other words
that the point describe a point of inflexion in its path. A point
describes therefore a point of inflexion when the velocity and the
acceleration are equally directed, hence when A can be determined,
so that
Ja.x — * V a ,x = Ja,y — * v a, y = J a, z — A V a , t = 0,
or, because we consider only points fixed to T m , so that

where A, (X), A 2 {X), A, (X) and A (X) are functions of the third
degree in X.
The locus is therefore a hoisted cubic.
If we make OZ coincide with the instantaneous screw-axis,
we have

consideration either the whole fixed system or a line of points is at rest, might
be treated separately (with little difficulty).
