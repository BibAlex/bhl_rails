When from a culture a sufficient number of eggs had been
gathered the egg- pat e hes were still kept in the incubator 20 days
after the last gathering. One is quite certain then that all the eggs
capable of development have been hatched. The egg-patches are
removed, some fresh food added in the larvae jar and this is left
to itself in the incubator for some time.
Like the pupae, the eggs were gathered only once a week.
When a large number of beetles is kept together in one box, the
harvest of eggs is often too small in proportion to the number of
beetles. If those same beetles are distributed over a series of small
pots, the harvest of eggs increases considerably.
This fact is illustrated by the following case.
In a box of 21 X 10 cm. were 88 beetles; from these were
obtained respectively 131— 148— J 81 and 121 eggs in the last 4
gatherings. After distributing these 88 beetles over 8 little pots, the
next harvest of eggs increased to 468, the 2 nd to 560 eggs, i.e.
more than four times the last harvest of the preceding series.
7. Mortality.
The mortality among the eggs, larvae and pupae is as a rule
considerable; low mortality figures are exceptions.
a. Among the eggs. In the 6 nutrition experiments mentioned on
page 195 there were in each jar an ecpial number of eggs (viz. 300),
all of the same origin. The difference between this figure and the
number of young larvae (living -|- dead) which were counted at a
definite point of time, denotes the number of not-hatched eggs.
To each 100 eggs laid out, the mortality in those 6 cultures
amounted.

The figures diverge rather much, whereas a special cause cannot
be pointed out. At first arose the thought of errors in the counting
which was carried out by spreading the bran very carefully, bit
by bit.
