similar to that of citras natricus (in this experiment we also
ascertained whether hen's eggwhite adsorbs atropin). In fig. 4a
0,01 mgr. of pilocarpin is added to the gut and after three minutes
0,0006 mgr. of atropin, which annuls the pilocarpin-action almost
completely. In fig. 46 0.01 mgr. of pilocarpin is added and after
this 0.0006 mgr. of atropin, which has been in contact with hen's
eggwhite. Here there is no inhibition, as is shown clearly in the
