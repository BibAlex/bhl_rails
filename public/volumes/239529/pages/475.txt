then from the more remote stars we do not see those with M = m — q,
but those with M = m — * — q as stars of the magnitude m. The

While the number A m is obtained from the combination of stars
at all distances, by means of integration between ± co of a function,
proceeding according to t be probability-curve, the number A' m is
found from two such curves, belonging to m and m — *; from the
first is taken a part between — oo and .r, indicated by the fraction
y x (the stars in front of the absorbing screen); of the second the
part between ,i\ and -\- go , indicated by the fraction y, (the stars
behind the nebula). From the above numbers we find

By means of these formulae and a list of values of A m , corre-
sponding to it, the values of A' m , for different suppositions concerning
q 1 and s were computed. To compare them more easily with the
results of starcounts, we calculated from the A' m the N'm+h the
total numbers of stars brighter than m -\- \, and these were compared
with the normal number Nm+h- The values log N — log N' t the
logarithmic defect in starnumber, then forms the best measure for
the influence of the absorbing nebula. These values have been united
in the following table.
From these values, which are graphically represented in our figure
it appears:
a. The influence of the absorption extends, slowly varying, over
almost all magnitudes that are open to our investigation. This is
especially a result of the great spreading of the luminosity-function.
