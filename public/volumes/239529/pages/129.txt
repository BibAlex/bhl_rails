Physics. — "The osmotic pressure, regarded as a capillary pheno-
menon". By H. Hulshof. (Communicated by Prof. H. A.Lorentz).
(Communicated at the meeting of March 27, 1920).
In this paper an attempt will be made to give an explanation of the
osmotic pressure by regarding this pressure as the consequence of
capillary actions. Though some difficulties remain, in my opinion
a trial in this direction might lie made. In a former communication
(these Proceedings January 1900) the surface tension has been defined.
To that end we supposed at a point of the passage layer fluid-
vapour the influence of the attraction in different directions to have
different values. Now we shall base our considerations on the same
suppositions. For a plane m the direction of the passage layer p x is
the whole force per unit of surface (pressure) exerted by the matter
on one side of' the plane on that on the other side. It consists of
the attraction q x and what may be called the thermic pressure ,
so that
Px = — <7i + #■
For a surface element perpendicular to the passage layer we can
also speak of the total force exerted by the part of the system on
one side on the part on the other side. Let us call this p 3 and let
us write q t for the attraction between the two parts and # for the
thermic pressure. Then we have:
p* = — q> + #•
Instead of the attraction q x and q 2 we may also consider the
molecular pressure M/ and M 2 ' ; q x = M x ' and q t = MJ ; in homo-
geneous phases q = M' = ao* — — . The thermic pressure =

, will be supposed to have in all directions a value equal to
that in a homogeneous phase of the density at the point in question.
p 1 -f m x ' = Pi -t- m; —p f M' = &.
The index 1 refers to the direction perpendicular to the passage
layer, the index 2 to a direction in this layer; as to gravity we
assume that it only causes the layers to be horizontal; the height
h is measured upward perpendicular to the passage layer. Difleren-
