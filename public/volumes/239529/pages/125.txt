Similar ketofbrmulae for the 2.3 oxynaphtoïc-acid are already
found in the literature 1 ).
Further we investigated still :

and also
sodium p. phenol sulphonate.

The sodium 2.6. naplitol sulphonate has been investigated as
technical ScHAFFER-salt and also as a purified one prepared in the
laboratory by sulphonation of /?-naphtol.
To determine the percentage of the technical product this was
titrated by means of diazotated p. nitraniline according to the
method in use in the technical control-stations of the dye-manufac-
turies *). In this way we found the percentage 76.4. The purified
preparation when dried gave a loss in weight of 11,4 °/ t . In the
dried substance we made a sulphate-ash-determination. Having made
the calcutation for Na, we found from this 9,1 %. (Theor. 9.35 %).
From the observations combined in table VII we see, that 4
milligram-molecules of the pure ScHAFFER-salt bind just as much
alkali as the corresponding quantity of the technical product.

If the pure salt behaved as a monobasic-acid, just . 4 = 3,5 cm'

N. KOH would have been found. In reality we find 3,7 cm* 0,93
N. KOH = 3,4 cm' N. As the titration gave for the percentage of
the technical product 76,4, it is probable, that the technical product
in question is made impure by substances which can bind alkali - ,
but which under the circumstances of the titration with diazo-solu-
tions, cannot form colours. As might be expected the ScHAFFER-salt
could not bind an acid in a hydrochloric medium.
