easily calculate the velocity constant £,. To find this we have to
know which fraction of thé molecules dissociates per unit of time
or of how many of the molecules one constituent leaves the sphere
of attraction of the other one per unit of time.
Consider a surface element da of the sphere of attraction.
The number of atoms that passes this surface element of the
sphere of attraction of the other atom per unit of time in outward
direction is
i A* e -2kmC* d$ d n d$ dX z d Y z dZ z L n e-lf"» V>-W da rfj j dy da
where v n represents the component of the relative velocity in the
direction perpendicular to the surface.
Let us take for the «-direction the direction of the normal, then
we can write for the number in question
i a V -2*mC* ( /* d n d$ dX z d Y z dZ z J a er~i>™ V*-2h+ da d j dy da ( 2 )
The integration limits for a, ft and y are defined in the following-
way.
The equations of motion of the two atoms are:
d*x x' — x
m—- = — (p (r) etc.
dr r
d^x' x' — x
m = -\- cp (r) etc.
dt* r
When \p (r) represents the potential energy of the two atoms,
when their distance is r, we have
dip
cp{r) = — — .
Or
By subtraction we find the equation of the relative motion
da X r
m — z= 2 (p (r) — . etc.
dt r
Multiplying these 3 equations respectively by a, fi and y and
taking their sum, we find the equation ot energy

SO that
As to the action of the sphere of attraction we shall use the
image of a hard layer against the inside of which the atoms can
impinge. As long as the velocity is small, the impulses are elastic.
