upon as the rests of tubes of Pflüger, originating from the germinal
epithelium (Schmaltz in Ellenberger's Handbuch d. vergl. Mikrosk.
Anat. der Haustiere, Bud. 2, 1911). Consequently the name of
"Keimschlauche" is given to those ingrowths. The medullary cords
are also looked upon as rests of the proliferations of the germinal
epithelium, viz. of the eggtnbes of Pflüger. If the eggnests have
been divided into primary follicles, vesicles, containing more than
one eggcell would develop. According to Hellin (J 895) there is a
struggle between the connective tissue and the epithelium in the
ovary, which generally ends in the victory of the connective tissue.
If this is not the case, the division of eggnests into primary follicles,
does not, or insufficiently, take place and afterwards a vesicle with
more than one eggcell may originate. According to Schottlaender
(1893) there is a regular relation between the growth of the con-
nective tissue and the germinal epithelium. A disturbance in that
regularity is the cause of the origin of the atypical vesicles. In later
years, owing to a closer examination, a clearer insight was obtained
