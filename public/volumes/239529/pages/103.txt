Similar observations were made by Prescott 1 ) and Lytf. "). A long-
time afterwards an investigation was made into the value of the
molecular-weight of the sodium compound by Noyes and Withney 8 ),
on the basis of the lowering of freezing point which would occur in
dissolving Al in NaOH. As however no perceptible lowering in the
freezing-point took place and therefore the number of particles before
and after the dissolution had to be equal, they determined upon the
composition: NaAlO, ; this compound was supposed to be divided
into two ions and so to form just as many particles as the original
NaOH molecules. It need not be demonstrated any further that this
reasoning is uncommonly weak and little suitable as a powerful
argument in favour of the composition NaA10 2 .
Herz 4 j ascribes the composition: Na 3 A10 3 and K 8 A10 3 to the
' XT A1
aluminates, because in solution he found the proportion Na: —
o
equal to 1 : 1. On the ground of similar experiments Wood 5 ) on
the other hand again arrives at the composition: NaA10„ ; although
from his figures the proportion NaOH : A1,0 3 often proves much
larger than would agree with this composition.
Hantzsch ') performed some conductivity measurements in alumi-
nate solutions of various concentrations and concludes from these
that the aluminates behave like salts of mono-basic acids. With such
salts, which are even hydrolized to a great extent in fairly concen-
trated solutions forming partly colloidal Al(OH) 3 , the conductivity-
method entirely loses its value. We are not even sure of the nature
of the ions present. Hantzsch's observations therefore cannot teach
us anything of the composition of these salts.
Finally we may still mention that Slade 7 ) tried to find out the
composition by applying the law of mass action to aluminate solu-
tions that are in equilibrium with Al(OH) 3 . His reasoning does not
hold exactly, because in diluted solutions the solubility of Al (OH),
is extremely slight, so that small observation errors become of
very great influence on the final result. In the strong NaOH solutions
of comparatively large viscosity, in which the solubility can be
measured very well, it becomes inadmissible to apply the law of
