Skrabal (Monatsh. 1914, 35, 1157) has shown that the velocity
of formation of iodate from iodine and iodide in a mixture of
sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate solutions has — — — =45.
k t
When a similar reaction was effected in sodium acetate solution,
the temperature coefficient is 2.
The velocity of decomposition of iodate in a mixture of acetic
acid and sodium acetate solution has —^- — = 1.34. The same reaction
k t
in a mixture of disodium and monosodium phosphates gives a
temperature coefficient 1.26; in a mixture of KF and HF, the
temperature coefficient has the value 0.9 to 1.04 and a mixture of
sodium sulphate and sodium hydrogen sulphate leads to the value
of 0.85.
Skrabal remarks that the temperature coefficient must necessarily
undergo a change when the substances, which affect the time
equation, are transformed into complexes. The relationship between
the temperature coefficient T of the original reaction and T', that
of the reaction between the complex substances is governed by the
formula,
T'/T = e 1 °/RT(T + 10)(mQ 1 +i 1 Q 2 + + xc ll -f-yq !I + )
in which Q and q represent the heat changes of the complex
reaction and the sum (m -\- n -f- • • • • + x + y + • • • •) indicates the
order of the reaction. This formula indicates that a great variability
of T is to be expected from reactions of the higher orders.
In a foregoing paper (Annates de Chimie et de physique 1919,
t. XI, 130) 1 have definitely proved that this conclusion of Skrabal,
which states that the temperature coefficients of polymolecular
reactions are, in general, greater than those of unimolecular ones,
is not supported by experimental evidence.
Skrabal investigated these two polymolecular reactions:
3 I, -f- 6 OH' = 5 I' + I 0', + 3 H,0 and
I 0', + 5 T + 6 H = 3 I, + 3 H 3 0.
