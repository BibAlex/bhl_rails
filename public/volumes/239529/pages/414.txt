With a silver wire of 10 em. length and of a diameter of more
than 10.8 ft the sensitiveness is mainly limited by the elasticity;
with silver wires of the same length but thinner than 10.8 (i, the
weight of the wire is the most serious obstacle to increasing- the
sensitiveness of the instrument. With a wire of 21.6 ft the elasticity
is 4 times more important as a limiting factor than gravity.
If the influence of the two limiting factors is taken together, we
find for the deflection of the middle part of the string:

if the string be totally relaxed and fixed on the support without
any longitudinal or torsional tension.
With this formula we can calculate the next table giving the
deflection of a 10 cm. string of 1 ft in a field of 10.000 Gausses
with a current of 10 12 Ampere and an enlargement of 1000 times.

In the same way 1 find for an aluminium string of 2 ft and 56
mm. length in a field of 18000 gausses a theoretical deflection of
.57 mm., the magnification being 1000 fold. In my former commu-
nication I stated that such a string had given me a deflection of
. 40 mm. If we had taken the elasticity as the limiting agent we
ought to have expected a deflection of 1.20 mm.
Doubtless we get a better approximation for the liminal sensitiveness
of the string galvanometer by considering the influence of the weight
of the string without neglecting its elasticity.
