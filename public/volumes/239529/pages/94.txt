blood-bile plate and do not cause the gelatine to liquefy. Both these
results are in favour of the identity of the actions in question.
I want to make one more remark ; as 1 pointed out before, some-
times one sees in an organism, of which the casein halo and the
gelatine halo cover each other entirely on a nutrient medium, that
their congruence has disappeared on another nutrient medium.
When glycerine has been added to the casein plate, on which
the cholera vibrio is inoculated, the virtual halo of liquefaction
will remain at some distance within the halo of casein-digestion.
So I observed also that the halo of gelatine-liquefaction in a
strongly haemodigestive coccus, isolated from the air, is a little larger
than the halo of the haemodigestion (on the blood-bile plate). The
above-mentioned experimental experience teaches us that this does
not contain an argument against the identity of the haemodigestive
and collolytic bacterial action.
I conclude by remarking that these experiments teach us that
the blood-bile plate as well as the casein plate may serve for the
substitution of the broth-gelatine in determining bacteria. This is
an advantage while working in tropical littorals, where the use of
the nutrient media is subject to difficulties owing to the high tem-
perature of the air.
