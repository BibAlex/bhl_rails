described in the preceding communication for the adsorption of cocain

made up to the original volume. Now we ascertained how much
active atropin was present. The result can be seen in fig. 1 ƒ — 1 h
In fig. 1/ and lh every time 0.2 mgr. of pilocarpin is added to
the gut and afterwards 0,0006 mgr. of atropin *). As will be seen
from the figure after three minutes nearly the whole action of the
pilocarpin has been abolished by the atropin. In fig. \g again 0,2
mgr. of pilocarpin is given, and after three minutes so much of the
atropin-containing liquid (serum -f- atropin treated with alcohol and
hydrochloric acid) has been added, as corresponds to 0,001 mgr.
atropin of the original serum-atropin mixture. It will be seen that
its action is slightly stronger than that of 0,0006 mgr. of atropin,
from which we deduce that through the treatment with alcohol
if not all, yet nearly all the atropin has been recovered in full
activity.
