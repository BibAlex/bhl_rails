a. The difference between the strongly and the slightly obscured
regions is not noticeable at all with the bright D. M. stars up to
6,5, and it is hardly noticeable with those up to the 8 th magnitude;
it is only with those up to the 9 th that G and H differ considerably
from the others. By the accidental uncertainty of the numbers the
difference between the more or less obscured regions A — F is not
clearly evident.
b. The defect for the stars up to 15.9 is about as great as that
for the stars up to 9.4. This corresponds to the results obtained by
Dyson and Me lotte.
c The Paris results for the fields E and F point to the fact that
the logarithmic defect for the limiting magnitudes between 10 and
15 is greater.
If we take first the fields E and F, where the data are most
complete, we see that their averages ( — 0,28, — 0,35, — 0,34
— 0,59, — 0.40 for the 5 magnitudes), represented on our figure by
open circles, concur pretty well with a curve (dotted in the figure)
answering to £, = 5,5, £—1,5. The values of q x between 4 and 6
with an absorption g<[2 give a maximum for the logarithmic defect
for m 12 a 13, so that in this case we shall find, that the defect in
stars for the magnitudes between the 9 th and the 15 th does not
fluctuate very much.
This, however, is contradicted by the results of the "Selected
Areas' 1 . These could not be united with the former, because they
comprise separate, smaller regions. The counts give the following results:
Area 47 b = ~ 2l °
Area 4/ surf. = 3600'
b — -12°
Area48 surf. = 1600'

From the first field, falling within the region A of strong absorp-
tion, we find :
d. In the Selected Area 47 a regular, strong increase of the defect
from the 12 th to the 15 th or 16 th magnitude is shown.
