b = xb x + Va (-1 — x ) b, — when b x represents the co-volume of 1
single molecule and £> a that of 1 double molecule — which quantity
refers, therefore, to the original single-molecular quantity. But b'
refers to the molecular quantity, which on an average yields 1
molecule after the association, and which is 2 : (1 -\- x) times greater
than the single-molecular quantity, [i.e. at .r = (exclusively double
molecules) twice greater; at x = l (exclusively single molecules)
once greater; etc,]. For from the original single molecule there have
been formed Va (1 ~f~ r ) nevv molecules, so that every new molecule
corresponds averagely to 2 : (1 -f- x) original single molecules].
We can now compute — . As b is a function of v (through b l and
b,) and of x, and also v a function of x on account of the equation
of slate v=f(p, l\x,a,b), in which also a and b are functions of
x, we have :
