Now we have come to a discussion of Li is results on the influence
of an excess of acid on the diazotisation of aniline.
Tassilly couples 10 c.c. of the diazonium solution, the acidity of
which has heen mentioned above, with 10 c.c. of the Schaffer's
salt solution (containing 3 gr. of Schaffer's salt and 3 gr. of NaOH
per liter). As a second experiment he couples 10 c.c. of a diazonium
solution containing much more acid, with 10 c.c. of the same solution
of Schaffer's salt. Now this diazonium solution contains per liter:
100 c.c. of the amine solution used, makes 0.21 gr. HCI
moreover 100 c.c. 5 °/ HCI 5.— gr. HCI
Total 5.21 gr. HCI
The solution of Schaffer's salt contains 3 gr. NaOH per L., which
3 X 36.5
therefore can neutralise
40
= 2.74 gr. HCI.
So the excess of HCI amounts to 2.47 gr. and consequently the
coupling takes place in a solution, containing 1.235 gr. HCI per
Liter; the diazotisation therefore can continue and the quantity of
inverted amine will be found greater than was in fact diazotised at
the moment the sample was drawn. From this we conclude that
his experiments in regard to the influences of an excess of HCI on
that rate of the diazotisation of aniline cannot be exact.
As to his experiments on the influence of the concentrations of
nitrite and amine together, as well as of each apart, on the course
of the diazotisation of sulphanilic acid, we must call attention to
the fact that Tassili.y tries to diazotise sulphanilic acid with sodium
nitrite without the presence of HCI and that without a catalyser.
He thinks he studies a quantitative diazotisation in doing this. As we
