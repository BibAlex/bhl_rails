Nernst's theorem requires for every chemical reaction v x> i> 3 . . . vj,
which is possible the relation

which is satisfied by

Evidently the chemical constant as calculated by means of the
vapour-pressure formula and Nernst's. theorem contains similar inde-
terminate contributions by the atoms as in our deduction from the
dissociation-equilibrium.
