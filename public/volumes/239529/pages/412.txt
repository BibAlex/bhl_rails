Physics. — "The Limit of Sensitiveness of the String-galvanometer" .
(2 d communication). By Prof. J. K. A. Wertheim Salomonson.
(Communicated at the meeting of June 26, 1920).
In the meeting of June 26 th 1918 I read a paper in which I showed,
that the sensitiveness of the Einthoven-galvanometer was limited by
the elasticity of the material of the string. At the same time I stated
that the actual limit was never reached. The theoretical liminal
value in every case was much smaller than the actually observed
value, except with very thick strings. There seems to exist a simple
cause for this fact. It is not only the elasticity of the perfectly
relaxed string that causes the deviated string to resume its original
form and position of rest after stopping the current through it, but
also gravity. As the exact form of a deviating totally slackened
string is not the same in every case, and cannot be exactly repre-
sented by a formula, it is only possible to approximately calculate
the influence of gravity. We can do this in the simplest way by
assuming that the string is suspended in a homogeneous field of H
gausses; that it bends in the point of suspension without any resi-
stance or friction; that the lower current bearing connection is
equally free from resistance, friction and mass; and finally that the
string is straight and rigid and does not change its form. If the
length of the string be /, the diameter d, the density of its material
y and the gravitational constant g, the string is acted upon by a
force p = l / 4 jt <7 2 lyg. As soon as the wire be deflected, its middle
part being moved over a distance h, the force pulling the string-
back to its original position is
2h
p x =^7td l lyg— =\ nd*yhg . . . . (1)
If this force is in equilibrium with the current i, we may put:
H Izzz^TtiPyhg
or
Hi I
h — (2)
In my former communication I found the formula:
Hi I 4
h = (3)
