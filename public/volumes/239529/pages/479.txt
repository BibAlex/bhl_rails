greatly divergent from the average. This difficulty disappears, if the
accidental irregularities can be abolished by reduction to one system,
which is feasible if a great number of plates are joined so as to
partly cover one another. With chart-plates this does not happen
anywhere; but it does in the case of the Paris catalogue-plates, of
which the zones 22°, 23° and 24° have been published complete.
As in this case the centres of the one zone concur with the corners
of an adjoining zone, each plate has a quadrant in common with
each of the 4 surrounding plates. In this way it was possible to
reduce all the plates of these three zones between S'^ö" 1 and 5 h 32 m
to their average. A few particulars regarding this reduction will
be added here.
Two consecutive plates a and b of the central zone (23°) can be
joined together by a plate of the iV-zone (24°) c, which has a qua-
drant in common with both, and also by one of the *S-zone (22°) d.

every two consecutive plates of the central zone we get therefore
two values, the concurrence of which gives a measure of the aceu-
rateness obtainable. We must bear in mind that the quadrants on
the adjoining plates do not accurately concur, because of the con-
vergence of the declination-circles, and because they stretch 65'
from the centre. The results obtained, starting with log d (3 h 24 m )
— logd(3 h 16 m ) and ending with log c/(5 h 40 m ) — log rf(5 h 32 m ) (in
units of the 3rd decimal), are:

Herefrom for every plate of the middle-zone the deviations from
a medium-value were deduced and from these numbers the same was
found for the N- and the S-zone ; these values, with contrary sign,
give the logarithmic reduction for each plate, the logarithm of the
factor, by which the number of stars on that plate is to be multiplied,
in order to count for the same average limiting magnitude. They
are in the sequence of decreasing R.A.:
