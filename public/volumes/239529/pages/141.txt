It is obvious that the additional food administered in the form of
pulverised (ground) rusk has operated very favourably, and in general
no less than in I he experiments with unbroken rusks. (Table II).
So far the experiments on the influence of rusk (fat) as additional food.
Now the question bad to be settled whether bran, or bolted meal
(flour) either with or without the addition of rusk, is of equal
nutritive value to the larvae.
For this purpose it is necessary to revert to the jars N°. 4 (M.P.)
N u . 5 (B.K.) and N°. 6 (M.R.) mentioned in Table I.
From these groups the following numbers of pupae had already
been gathered on the Febr. JO, 1916 (as stated in Table I)
from N°. 4 (M.P.) 13 pupae.

The collecting of pupae was continued till July 8. Then the
experiments were closed, the collected pupae counted, the mortality
of the larvae figured out, and the remaining larvae weighed. This
yielded the following results, also including those of experiment
N°. 2a (of Table II), which may serve for comparison.

From the above figures it is evident that bran with rusk a
additional food had a much more favourable effect than meal -J- rusk;
