case the value of that factor remains small also for other phases,
especially when the radius has been chosen a little greater. This
would meet the chief objection of D. and Sch. to the binding rings
as has also been shown by Costkr with a somewhat different way
of representation.
§ 4. For the calculation of the intensities of the other reflected
beams I proceeded in the following way :
As a consequence of the smallness of the remaining inner ring of
two electrons (of one quantum probably for each electron) compared
with the binding rings (that are perhaps of two quanta for each
electron) I assumed in the calculation of the intensities of' the
other lines the radius of the first ring to be zero and that
ring to give then a "diminishing-factor", analogous to that of D.
and Sch. 1 ), while also for nucleus -f- ring a temperature-factor had
to be assumed. All this was comprised into the "diffraction-factor"
A « 2) for nucleus -f ring. In the same way the factor #«1)
referring to each of the binding electrons comprised also the tem-
perature factor of these electrons.
