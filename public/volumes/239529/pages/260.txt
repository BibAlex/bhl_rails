In many cases the point of issue given here will be preferable
to the supposition formulated in the beginning of § 5 under b.
It is, however, clear that under detinue circumstances negative
ions resp. electrons may act as attraction nuclei. We may refer e.g.
to the condensation experiments of Wilson in a nearly related case.
Then it might very well happen that through the discharge of' the
negatively charged particles a great number of molecules is liberated
at the anode.

Z\p = 2700 baryes = | 2,0 mm. | ,
which value is so many times greater than the observation in this
pressure legion, that it must be looked upon as of an entirely different
order of magnitude.
Besides, the experiments teach that it is contradictory to reality that
the pressure effect should be in inverse ratio to the gas pressure, as
would ensue from formula 8. In reality within a pressure area lying
between 0,2 and 0,5 mm. the value of tip appears experimentally
to vary little, if at all. with p, which is in harmony with formula 7.
Hence formula 8 should be rejected. Apart from the reasons set
