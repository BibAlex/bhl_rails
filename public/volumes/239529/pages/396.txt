while Aj and A, are functions of the second degree in P. and only
A, contains the third degree of I (the latter on the supposition that
neither § nor r is equal to zero).
Hence x, y and z become only infinite for 1 = oo and that in such
a way that

The locus of the points of inflexion is in general {i.e. unless £ or
r is equal to zero) a hoisted parabola, which is osculated by the plane
at infinity at the point at infinity of the screw-axis.
In case r is equal to zero, the motion at the moment in conside-
ration is a pure translation; v m . x and v lllif/ are in (his case equal to
zero; if P(x, y, z) is to describe a point of inflexion, it is necessary
and sufficient that also J m>x and J m _ y are equal to zero.
//' the motion at the moment considered is a pure translation, the
locus of the points describing a, point of inflexion is a straight line:

If at (he moment considered g = 0, the motion is at that moment
a pure rotation. The equations of the locus in question are in this
case

If the motion at the considered moment is a pure rotation, the
locus in question is a parabola in a plane parallel to the axis of
rotation; finally the following cases are excepted to this:

paths.
§ 5. Let in the second place be required :
the locus of the points the paths of which have at the moment
considered a stationary plane of osculation.
