in this case pf√∂ and p^ k ) are almost equal, and the registered curve
must consist of two almost identical curves.
As was stated before (p. 696), the velocity with which the boun-

dary of the phases moves, will depend on the temperature, prevail-
ing at that boundary plane. The aim of my investigation was,
besides testing the theory of the problem of the conductivity of
heat which we meet with in cases of solidification, the determination
of the functional relation between velocity of crystallisation and
boundary temperature. This relation is completely determined by
the nature of the substance (salol), and does not depend on the
peculiarities of the method of observation 1 ).

symbols.
