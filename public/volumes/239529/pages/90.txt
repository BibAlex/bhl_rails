Physiology. — "Identity of the blood-digestive and gelatine-liquefying
bacterial actions." By Prof. J. J. van Loghem. (Communicated
by Prof. C. Eykman.)
(Communicated at the meeting of March 27, 1920).
In investigations on the determination of the so-called specific El-
Torvibrios with regard to choleravibrios, I obtained as a result of
more general importance a sharper definition of the idea "haemo-
lysis" J ). By admitting that the changes in the blood, caused by
bacteria, may be of different nature, I suggested to understand by
haemolysis only the causing of oxy haemoglobin to come out from the
red blood corpuscles; I opposed to this the digestion of blood elements
by bacteria, which I indicated as haemo-digestion.
Investigations by others (Grieg*) Lowy') Flu 4 ), Kraus '), Sophie
Wot.lmann 8 ) have taught us the practical significance of these for
the distinction of choleravibrios. Baerthlein 7 ) pointed out the
necessity of a right distinction of these ideas, also in the case of
other bacteria, whereas Snapper 8 ) — in connection with his inves-
tigations on the decomposition of oxyhaemoglobin in the alimentary
canal — has occupied himself with the nature of the digestion.
The following illustrates the latter problem.
Some time ago already, I put the question whether the haemo-
digestive quality of the choleravibrio is identical with its collolytic
capacity and I mentioned several facts which pointed to this
possibility.
1. Both the qualities are transient and their decline runs parallel
in a certain strain.
2. The processes of the haemodigestion and of the gelatine-lique-
