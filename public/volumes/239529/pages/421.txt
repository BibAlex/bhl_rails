As 6>, must satisfy (10) for all values of m lt this is also the case
with each of the products X x R Xi of which 6 X is built up, hence
also with R x . When in (10) the value of R x given by (12) is sub-
stituted for #!, we find:
X 3 a
- A, V U J \{Cl V OJ =
When in this
- I, 1/ C J', (« I/O = ^ J (a j/C).
«1/(7 = 5,
and
^=r, (13)
is put, this equation assumes the form :
y,gi^,(5i) = ^.(«,) ....... (14)
This equation has an infinite number of roots, which ranged ac-
cording to ascending value may be called:
£ f 1 », £ ( 2 ),
» 31 1
They depend on the quantity y, defined by (13).
To every root g belongs a value of the function ƒ£,. These func-
tions become :
r£.W
J B 1 (t) = J, ^i_ , (A =1,2, . . .) (15)
Like (11a), (lib) has also two particular solutions, one of which
becomes zero for a\ = x> , and the other infinite. In connection with
(9) the former must be chosen. Apart from a constant factor, this
solution is :
X l= =e Pl Xl (16)
2?! is the positive root of the equation :

which is found by substitution of (16) in (lift), and replacement
of C by :

The value of p x W is:
^=-^ + i/f^m (17)
