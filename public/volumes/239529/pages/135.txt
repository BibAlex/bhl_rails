for an isothermic change in the outer bounding layers where we
may suppose no sugar to be present.
Let us further assume that in the homogeneous diluted solution
the quantity \iM for the water has another form but always the
same value as for the outer layer that consists of pure water (or
in the vapour phase without sugar, that is in coexistence with the
solution). This [xM in the homogeneous solution is a function of

when we increase the concentration of the sugar solution by dx x
while the pressure p^ remains constant, pM in the solution changes
by — - MRTdx x , and in the outmost sugarless layer near the wall by
vdp a . From this it follows vdp t = — MRTdx x . When we admit
that osmotic pressure appears this will have the value

Here it may be remarked, that by admitting the osmotic pressure,
the pressure will in all directions increase by the amount dp^. In
the outer bounding layer the pressure p. 2 thus gets its original value
again. The total change of p 2 because of the two changes of state
is therefore zero.
The same is therefore the case with (xM in the outer bounding
layer as d(iM=vdp t . Also for the total change of [iM in the homo-
geneous solution, so that

where A/;, = Ap s . By means of this relation Hondius Boldingh derived
the formula of the osmotic pressure from thermodynamic considerations.
The decrease of pressure in the layer at the solid wall may be
compared with the decrease of vapour pressure. When the solved
substance occurs neither in the vapour phase nor in the outmost
layer at the solid wall, there will always be a decrease of vapour pressure
and of the pressure at the wall in the direction of this wall according
to the simple laws for very diluted solutions. To a definite solved
substance in a definite solvent a wall will be semipermeable, when
the pores in this wall are so narrow that only the solvent substance
can enter into them and not the solved substance. It is evident that changes
of temperature and pressure can also have influence on thesemipermeabi-
