A stationary state will occur when through the diffusion an equal
amount is carried back from anode to cathode. Let us think the
current cut out for a moment with given difference of pressure
and all the ions re-combined to neutral molecules. Then the gas
must flow black through the capillary. Let us apply for this purpose
formula {[.), which under these circumstances 1 ) passes into:
