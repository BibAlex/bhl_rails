pose with comparatively little trouble. It is possible to develop the
functions for one region into a series of normal functions of the
other region. The following' development is then obtained :
J p- \=2a U J. p- ..... (25)
The constants aja form a twofold infinite system of values that
r
do not depend on the variables -, but on the constants y, and y,
r a
defined by (13) and (21). As we saw before, they depend on the
dimensions of the tube used, and on the conductivity of the sub-
stances that play a part in the problem.
For the determination of ajd both members of (25) are multiplied
i r t (*) 1
by r J o |_rJ — dr, and an integration is carried out with respect
a
to r from zero to a. When for this purpose use is made of the
known properties of the Bessel functions, and of the equations (14)
and (20), the following form is found :
_ 2g 1 (*>g,lP(Y > -Y,)'Mg, ( * ) i (2Q)
OW -{(g l W)--(g l (0)-|{H-.y 1 "<g 1 «)-|J 1 {g i tO}" *
By substitution of (25) in (23), we get :
A % &) = 2 a ik A^) . (27)
If this relation between the coefficients A^ k) and A^ k > is satisfied,
(23) holds for all values of r.
Also in (24) all the occurring functions of r must be developed

The coefficients fa are found by multiplication of both members

When (25) and (28) are substituted in equation (24), it appears
that this is identically satisfied when the following relations exist
between the still unknown coefficients A^ and A^ k h
