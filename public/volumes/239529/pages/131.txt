s" — (p t -p)v Of Që"= Pi P.
Now we find :
p x — Pi = — Qt" + J 2o de" = Qt" — | 2e" do.
Therefore
dp 2 = s"dQ — Qde",
for which we may always write:
dp s — edo — Qde.
Still it may be remarked, that when the condition of the thernio-
dynamic theory that I- - ah shall be a minimum, is satisfied
(the integration has here to be extended over the whole depth of
the passage layer), one element of this integral is just equal to
— Pn lh — P = Qe" and M t ' = — ye.
Suppose, we had started from the definition of the molecular
pressure in the direction of the bounding layer that it was equal
to — Qe (with omission of the constant). Then this would evidently
have led us to a value of the surface tension in agreement with
the thermodynamic theory, which is a proof of the validity of the
definition. But then we can at once write down the differential
equation for the surface tension. For from
P, -p t = MJ — M x '
it follows directly that
— dp^ = — doe -\- lode = — sdn -\- ode.
When a fluid is in contact with a solid wall, the molecular
pressure and therefore also the external pressure in the perpendicular
to the passage layer will generally be different from the pressure
in the direction of this layer. The action of the solid wall on the
fluid at the wall influences the molecular pressure of the fluid at
the wall. External forces like gravity, a magnetic or electric force
will directly influence the external pressure. As also in this case
the molecular pressure in the direction of the passage layer M/ may
be represented by — Qe and as dM^ = — 2^^, we have here likewise :
d (p x — jo 2 ) = — dp % = — dQe f 2Qde = Qde — edQ.
The calculation of the value of the molecular pressure of the fluid
at the wall presents great difficulties, because the calculation is
based upon the continuous division of the matter. In the immediate
neighbourhood of the wall e. g. the value of the molecular pressure
in the direction of the wall will be caused by the attraction
of the wall and of the fluid, but in the case of equal spheres of
action the contribution of' the two will be due to unequal volumes. The
