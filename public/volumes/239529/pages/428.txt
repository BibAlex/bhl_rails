ana when the stimulating influence of pilocarpin was distinctly
noticeable, every time 74 cc - °t il constant atropin-solution was
instilled by drops, at intervals of 20 seconds, until a distinct atropin-
action revealed itself.
We first put the gut in the vessel containing 10 mgr. of pilo-
carpin, left it there precisely 1 7 2 minutes, then transposed the gut
to a vessel that contained, beyond the 10 mgr. of pilocarpin, also
the quantity of atropin under examination, and watched for an arrest
(after a definite time mostly 1 — l 1 /, minutes) of the increase of
tonus caused by the pilocarpin. This we assumed to be the case if
the bases of the curves were again returned to the original level,
no matter whether the "oscillatory movements" of the gut were still
greater than before or were not. The criterion used by v. Lidth dk
Jeude, on the contrary was, whether or no, after the administration
of the atropin, a distinct beginning of the fall of the curve could
be observed, in other words v. Lidth dk JjeuDe watched for the
beginning of the antagonistic action, whereas we looked for the
condition reached after a certain lapse of time.
Van Lidth de Jeude had established in his publication, which we
quoted several times in this paper, that with an increase of the
pilocarpin-dosis (up to a 500-fold) the atropin-dosis required for the
commencement of the antagonism augments but very little (3 — 5-fold).
We knew from earlier investigations that the curve, indicating the
ratio between the concentration and the action of pilocarpin, runs
as is shown in tig. 2. In the beginning of the curve {a to c) small
