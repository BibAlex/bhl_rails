Chemistry. — " The influence of different substances on the decom
position of monoses by an alkali and on the inversion of cane
sugar by hydrochloric acid." By Prof. H. I. Waterman and J. Groot.

When the strength of the acid and of the alkali, from which the
salt is formed, are known as well as the nature of the ions, we
can calculate the percentage of the hydrolysis. The decomposition
of monoses by an alkali can be controlled polarimetrically, so that
this method as well as the often used inversion of cane sugar gives
us a sensitive means to determine the percentage of the hydrolysis. 1 )
Applying the law of mass-action to the electrolytic dissociation-
equilibria that occur in such a solution, we can calculate the hydro-
lysis. Using
KpHeno, = [H j, [ ° 6 ^ -= 1.3.10-" and [H'J [OH'J = 1,2.10-"
and assuming the hydrolysis to be weak and the non hydrolized
sodium-phenolate to be perfectly dissociated, we find for yL N sodium-
phenolate solution, [OH'J = rather more than 3.10 -3 . ')
When the hydrolysis of the sodium-phenolate in a ^N solution
were perfect, then [OH'J would be 10~ 1 . From this we learn, that
100
of the sodium-phenolate only ttt^t • 3.10 -3 = 3 °/ ' s hydrolized.
For more diluted solutions the percentage of this hydrolysis is higher.
For ^ N potassium-phenolate at 25° the hydrolysis is 3,1 %• a )
These results are in agreement with the experiments on phenol,
which taught that in an alkalic medium phenol practically behaves
like a monobasic acid.
In this way the hydrolysis of many of the compositions treated
up till now in the above mentioned investigations could be calculated
when only enough data were at our disposition with regard to the
strength of the respective acids and bases expressed in the well-
known units.
