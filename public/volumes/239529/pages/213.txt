Chemistry. — "Catalysis. IX. Thermal and photochemical reactions"
By Nil Ratan Dhar. (Communicated by Prof. Ernst Cohen).
(Communicated at the meeting of September 25, 1920).
In a foregoing paper (Dhar, Trans. Chem. Soc. 1917 111, 707)
it was shown (hat the temperature coefficient of the oxidation of
potassium oxalate by iodine has the value 7.2 for a 10° rise in the
dark and this reaction is extremely sensitive to light.
It occurred to me that all reactions which have high temperature
coefficients should be sensitive to light.
I have shown previously that most uni-molecular reactions have
high temperature coefficients and 1 investigated the effect of tropical
sunlight on several of these reactions, and the following results were
obtained.
Ammonium nitrite decomposes fairly readily at about 33° in
sunlight, whilst at 33° in the dark there is hardly any decomposition.
The temperature coefficient for a 10° rise in the dark is about 4.5
(Arndt, Zeit. Phys. Chem. 1901, 39, 64).
The intramolecular transformation of acetyl chloranilide to para-
chloracetanilide has the temperature coefficient 3.2 in the dark.
(Rivett, Zeit. Phys. Chem. 1913, 82, 201) and Blanksma (Rec. trav.
Pays. 1903, 22, 290) has shown that the change is sensitive to light.
Similarly the pseudo-unimolecular reactions, the hydrolysis of
cane sugar and the decomposition of potassium persulphate, are highly
influenced by light. An aqueous solution of cane sugar when exposed
for several days to tropical sunlight, becomes converted into the
invert sugars.
Green and Masson (Trans. Chem. Soc. 1910, 97, 2083) have
shown that potassium persulphate is slowly decomposed by water
according to the following equation
K, S % O e +#, O = 2 KHS 4 + O.
This reaction has the temperature coefficient 5 in the dark. I found
that the reaction is very sensitive to light and the 0x3 gen given off
in 24 hours in sunlight is practically equal to that produced in
about 15 days in the dark at 27°.
The decompositions of the sulfine bases and the tetraammonium
compounds studied by Von Halban have high temperature coefficients
