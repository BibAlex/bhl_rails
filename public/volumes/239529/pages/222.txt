It had struck me as early as 1914 that a single induction-shock
applied to the ventricle repeatedly engenders fibrillation of this
chamber of the heart. I did not study this phenomenon any further,
since at that time I was studying I lie electrograms of the extra-
systoles and of the postcompensalory systoles.
When, however, I continued my alternation-experiments with the
bled frog's heart through extra stimulation, I noticed the above
phenomenon so frequently that I felt called upon to study the rela-
tions, under which this fibrillation took place, more closely. It now
appeared that fibrillation of the ventricle occurred after a single
induction shock only when this was applied directly after the close
of the refractory stage which always accompanies the systole imme-
diately preceding. This is clearly illustrated by the curves of tig. 1,
which were registered ') half an hour after the bleeding of a sus-
pended frog's heart. In the upper row of curves an induction shock
was given to the base of the ventricle at 1 a short time after the
close of the refractory stage.
Fibrillation of (lie ventricle was the result which manifested
itself in the string-curve by totally differing deflections, whose tempo
was very irregular. Similar results were achieved at 2, 6, and 8.
We notice that the post-undulatory pause, after fibrillation excited
in 6, may also be lacking (after 2). After 3 an extra systole is
interpolated by the extra-stimulus, a phenomenon that may occur
with a slow heart-beat, as has been first show/i by Trkndklenburg.
In this case the stimulus was administered at a much later period
of the ventricle (towards the close of the T-defleclion), so that a
fully co-ordinated extra-systole was the result. In the same way a
complete extrasystole is generated at 7, because here also the stimulus
l ) In this and the following registrations a non-polarizable electrode was placed
on the auricles and one on the apex of the ventricle. The tension of the string
was in all experiments such that 1 mV. yielded a deflection of I' j2 mm.
