The general solution of the problem must be composed of special

The constants A^ can only be determined in connection with the
value of & t . The expression given by (18) satisfies the boundary condition
(10), which holds at the boundary surface of the solid substance and
the wall of the tube, and is also in agreement with (9).
The value of the temperature #, prevailing in the liquid is found
in an analogous way. It is :

In conclusion the constants A^ and A.J k ) occurring in (18) and
(19), must be determined from the conditions (8) at the boundary
surface of the solid and the liquid phase. By the aid of (18) and
(19) these conditions become :

Both equations must hold for all values of r.
The difficulty to find the constants AJ k) and A^ k > from (23) and
(24), consists in this that in these equations there occur two series
I r £,(*)) r l r §,(*)/
of normal functions, viz. </„ and t/. {- - . These series
| a j f a |
are, indeed, each in themselves orthogonal; but the functions of one
series are not orthogonal to those of the other. The most symmetrical
way would be to try and find normal functions belonging to the
whole space, and not, as had been done up to now, either to space
1 (solid substance) or to space 2 (liquid). There exists, however, a
simple — though asymmetrical — method, which leads to the pur-
