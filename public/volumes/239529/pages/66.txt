crystallised complex salt is decomposed very slowly, when preserved
in darkness, the preparation used in our first experiments contained
a very small quantity of the cobalto-s&U ; so (hat, after its quantity
had been determined accurately, (lie necessary, and only very small
correction of the results made necessary by it, was applied in the
first series of measurements. The degree of accuracy of the method
of analysis was tested beforehand by experiments with mixed solutions
of known composition, and it was found really sufficiently great.
The solutions were continually stirred by means of a current of
nitrogen, regulated at about four bubbles every second ; later-on stirring
was brought about by a current of carbon dioxide., after it was found,
that the reaction was not influenced by it in any respect. It is necessary
to perform the analysis of the solutions in darkness, and to filter
the precipitate as rapidly as possible, to wash it immediately, and
to carry out all necessary manipulations in rapid succession. As long
as the mother-liquor is adhering to the precipitate, all access of
light must be carefully prevented, as well as all considerable increase
of temperature.
In a first series of determinations, we thus obtained the following data:

Taking into account the unavoidable uncertainties, which always
remain in the study of so highly complicated a reaction as this,
and attributing only a moderate value to the small increase which
the first four numbers apparently show with respect to each other, —
it must be evident from these results, that the quantities of the
salt decomposed within identical intervals of time are approximately
^dependent of the initial concentration, and chiefly determined by
the amount of light-energy absorbed during that time. The reaction-
order is evidently zero, — a fact which may be used as an argument
on behalf of the view, that the process is of a purely photocatalytic
