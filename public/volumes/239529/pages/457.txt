supplies us with a method pre-eminently fit to discover transition
points in metals, both on account of its accuracy and quickness,
this was not yet known.
This we found in the following research, which was undertaken
with a purpose to discover the above-mentioned transition point also
by a thermo-electric way. For this purpose we first examined what
metal combined with tin promised a good result. For reasons which
will further be set forth in the theoretical discussion of this method,
iron was chosen as second metal.
The investigation of the electro-motive force of this element at
different temperatures gave the following result:
IRON-TIN.

When we represent this result graphically, we get fig. 1, from
which we see that the transition point appears very clearly, and
lies at 200°. 2, which result is in perfect harmony with the extra-
polated value which followed from the dilatometer-examination of
