If one leaves the abnormal high mortality of 53.7 °/„ of the first
series out of consideration, the average egg mortality over the two
experiment years of 58468 eggs becomes 32.4 %•
As the outcome one may therefore assume that, in general, only
2/3 of the number of eggs are hatched.
b. The mortality among the larvae.
As has been said, the cause of the egg mortality is still uncer-
tain ; that of the larvae mortality gives more positive indications.
Fortunately epidemics have not appeared up till now. So they cannot
have played a part in the mortality figures mentioned below. The
larvae gnaw at each other's bodies and perhaps they sometimes eat
each other up entirely; this cannibalism is, to be sure, the main
cause of the larvae mortality.
A small percentage not gnawed at, died of unknown causes.

Here the opposite case to that of the egg-mortality presents itself,
viz. the first experiment year shows a considerably higher mortality
figure than in the second year.
A factor that may have influenced this lies in the circumstance
that an addition of thin fresh cut slices of potato or carrot scattered
on the food (enhancing the humidity) had a specially favourable
effect, not only on the growth and development of the larvae, but
particularly on the mortality of the pupae. With regard to this,
convincing figures will be submitted when the pupae mortality will
be treated.
In consequence of the results obtained in the early part of 1917,
the addition of slices of potato was started late, when a large part
of the total number of pupae obtained of that experiment year had
been already gathered. By this the late gathered pupae (together
