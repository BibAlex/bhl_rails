recognized as E. stebbinsii subsp. septentrionalis, thereby automatically creating the
name E. stebbinsii subsp. stebbinsii for A. parishii var. parishii. No specimens of
either subspecies oiE. stebbinsii were found from San Diego County, location of the
type of A. parishii var. laeve.

Differing from subsp. stebbinsii m its longer lemma awns and almost always
glabrous lowermost culin node.
Perennial grass. Culms loosely clustered, erect or decumbent at the base, 70-130
cm tall; lower intemodes (1.4)1.7-3.6 mm thick, the lowermost node ahnost always
glabrous. Leaf sheaths ahnost always glabrous, the margins of the throat ciliate;
auricles 0.4-2.6 mm long, falcate; Ugules 0.25-1.25 mm, truncate, ciliate; blades 2.2-
6.5 mm wide, glabrous, scabrous, or pilose. Inflorescence a spike with one spikelet
per node; middle intemodes 9.5-20.3 mm; spikelets (11)13-22 mm long, with 4-6
florets. Lower glume (6.0)7.7-12.8 mm long, acute; upper glume shghdy longer;
lowest lemma 9.5-15.0 mm, terminating in an awn (6.5)11-25 mm long, longer or
slightly shorter than the lemma; palea shghtly shorter than the lemma; anthers 4. 1-7. 1
mm long.
Typical members of the two varieties of Elymus stebbinsii are robust plants with
thick, decumbent culms. Among the specimens studied, however, there were several
slender, deUcate plants that had the distant spikelets, truncate palea apices, and acute
glumes characteristic of E. stebbinsii, but the glumes that tended to be shorter in
proportion to the fu-st lemma than those of typical specimens (most fell into group B).
I considered recognizing them as a distinct taxon but decided against doing so because
