the Pdramo of Cajanuma, located in northwestern Podocarpus National Park (Figure
1). A species list is provided (Appendix 1), and I briefly discuss species composition
in relation to ecological factors and regional floristic pattems.
STUDY SITE AND METHODS
Located in the provinces of Loja and Zamora-Chinchipe, Ppdocarpus National
Park is the only major protected area in the southern tip of Ecuador (Figure 1). It
encompasses 146,280 ha of montane ecosystems, protecting the only remaining zone
of intact forest in Loja Province. The northwestern section of the park is located
immediately to the southeast of Loja, the only large city in the region.
The terrain of northwestern Podocarpus National Park is dominated by low,
rugged mountains of orogenic origin. Fieldwork was conducted near the Cordillera
Oriental de Los Andes, a high ridge that generally runs north-south between 2900 and
3424 m elevation. Numerous steep ridges adjoin the Cordillera Oriental, connecting it
to deep valleys located to the east and west. Soils are classified as either vertisols or
inceptisols (White & Maldonado 1991).
This study was conducted above the Cajanuma Park Station (2850 m), where plant
species diversity is exceptionally high even by Ecuadorian standards (see B0gh 1992;
Madsen & 011gaard 1994). Montane forests extend up to approximately 3100 m,
above which point the vegetation is characterized by a heterogeneous mixture of
timberline forest and paramo communities. The annual rainfaU above 2800 m is
between 2000 and 4000 mm (Apolo 1984). In the p^amo, diumal temperature
typically varies between 3째 and 10째 C, and winds often exceed 100 kph (Keating
1995).
The study site was located at 4째 09' S, 79째 10' W on a ridge extending to the east
of the Cordillera Oriental (Figure 1). The ridge is 60 to 100 m wide, and is flanked by
ravines to the north and south. Between the Cordillera Oriental and the timberline, the
ridge measures nearly 350 m in length. Unlike most paramos located north of the
park, this site has not experienced intense anthropogenic disturbances in the recent
past. Grazing does not occur near the study site, and the vegetation near Cajanuma
has not burned since November, 1985.
From the top of the ridge (3385 m) down to 3335 m, the site is covered with grass
paramo and patches of shrub-dominated vegetation between 5 and 15 m in diameter.
Continuous shrub paramo occurs between 3335 and 3150 m, where the treeline
occurs. Between September, 1991 and July, 1992, plant collections were made
between the top of the ridge and 3250 m. Below this point, the ridge is covered with a
complex shrub paramo/timberline ecotone; a study of this vegetation is still in
progress. Plant community pattems and vegetation structure of Cajanuma have been
analyzed by Keating (1995 and ms). This article lists all of the species that occurred in
plots utilized for this study, as well as ones that were found outside the plots. Plant
specimens were deposited primarily in the herbarium at the Pontificia Universidad
