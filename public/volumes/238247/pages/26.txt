Barkworth: Elymus stebbinsii 361
there were both awned and unawned specimens present and the distribution of these
mimicked that of the robust specimens. In addition, even when the non-stebbinsii
OTUs were removed horn the data set, the delicate specimens did not form a distinct
cluster, but occurred within the Sb and Sp clusters. I strongly recommend further
study of such plants. They may be nothing more than depauperate plants, but the lack
of continuity between them and typical representatives of the two subspecies is
disconcerting.
Representatives of the short-glumed variant include Kem County, swale at head of
Mill Creek, 27 July 1965, Ernest C. Twisselmann 11239 (AHUC 32447); Mariposa
County, above Wawona Road Tunnel, 17 July 1936, Lyman Benson 7893 (POM
295836); Placer County, along southeast bank of American River, 1.5 miles northeast
of bridge on Colfax-Iowa Road, 22 June 1952, G.L. Stebbins, Jr. 5102 (CAS
376178); Plumas County, near Lewisia rock in Feather River Canyon, 12 June 1968,
John Thomas Howell 44561 and Gordon H. True (CAS 633387); Siskiyou County,
canyon north of Willow Creek, 5 miles west of Gazelle, 31 May 1942, A.A. Beetle
3406 and G.L. Stebbins, Jr. (AHUC 7519); Yuba County, about 2 miles east of
Challenge, 25 June 1 979, Lowell Ahart 1946.
The two subspecies of Elymus stebbinsii are generally geographically separated
bvX Ahart 5887 (CAS 916837, CHSC 43290), from Butte County, was exceptional in
having the characteristics of subsp. stebbinsii despite coming from northeastern
Cahfomia. Illustrations of both subspecies of will be included in the Manual of
Grasses for the Continental United States and Canada (Barkworth et ai, in prep.).
Glume shape is the best character for distinguishing Elymus stebbinsii from
specimens of E. glaucus with solitary spikelets and long anthers. Palea shape and
basal culm thickness also appear to be helpful (Table 2). A few specimens suggest
that the two species may form partially fertile hybrids (e.g., San Antonio Mountains,
Browns Flat, dry open ground under pine, 1 July 1917, l.M. Johnston 1518 [DS
83847]; Tuolumne County; Strawberry, 5300 ft, June 1951, A. Haig s.n. [AHUC
14340]; Kem County, East fork of Upper San Emigdio Canyon, Dou^as oak-pinyon
association, 22 June 1961, Ernest C. Twisselmann 6284 [CAS 523141]).
Distinguishing Elymus trachycaulus from E. stebbinsii does not present a problem
if anthers are present. Distinguishing it from E. glaucus is often harder, even if
anthers are present. I wish I could state that I now know how to separate herbarium
specimens of the two taxa with confidence. I cannot. Some specimens are easy to
place in one species or the other, but there are a disturbingly large number with soUtary
spikelets that I fmd extremely hard to identify with any degree of confidence.
There were two specimens examined during this study that were particularly
interesting. I include information about them here in the hope that it will stimulate
others to examine them, and the sites from which they were obtained, in greater detail.
One such specimen was El Dorado County, 2.6 mi southeast of Placerville, roadcut,
shaded slope forested by yellow pine and oak, June 22, 1956, Beecher Crampton
5577 (AHUC 22601). This was a robust specimen (culm 155 cm tall, basal diameter
3.1 mm) with well-spaced, long-awned spikelets (intemodes 14 mm, spikelets 15
mm, awns to 18 mm), tmncate paleas, and long (5.7 mm) anthers. The distinctive
features were its long spikes (around 25 cm) and short (about 8 mm), stiff, ahnost
truncate glumes reminiscent of Thinopyrum intermedium. Of the Triticeae with which
