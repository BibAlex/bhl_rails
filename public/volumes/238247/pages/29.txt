discussions concerning this and other grasses. I am particularly gratefial to Dr. Jack
Maze for the numerous suggestions he made on my initial manuscript and for his
comments on the resulting second version. I am also grateful to Dr. Adolf Ceska and
Harvey Ballard who made additional suggestions for improvement. Dr. Kathleen
Capels whose eagle eyes caught inconsistencies and editorial errors that had escaped
my notice, and Dr. Mark Damen who provided a Latin description that classicists can
read without cringing. I am, of course, responsible for any remaining errors or lack of
clarity, but there would have been more had it not been for the generous assistance of
these individuals.
