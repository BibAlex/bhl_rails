ABSTRACTT
An area of seep-fed muck bogs paralleling Prairie Branch in Walker
County, Texas, has physical and vegetative features most similar to a
"baygall," a distinctive and recurring wetland community in the southeastern
United States. The Prairie Branch community is dominated by Viburnum
nudum (possum haw viburnum), Nyssa sylvatica, Myrica cerifera,
JJquidambar styraciflua, and Smilax laurifolia, but most of the other woody
(as well as herbaceous) species characteristic of baygaUs are absent. This
community is described here as a "possum haw bog," situated at the western
edge of the eastern deciduous forest, where it is speculated that decreased
precipitation, in part, has correspondingly reduced the potential species
diversity of the bog as well as other communities in the vicinity.

BaygaUs are a characteristic wetland community of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal
Plains extending into southeastem Texas (Harper 1914; Wells & Shunk 1928; Watson
1979; Christensen 1988; Bridges & OrzeU 1989; Harcombe et al. 1993; Brooks et al.
1993; Weakley et al. 1998). They are variable over their range but are generally
characterized by such woody species as Magnolia virginica (sweet bay) and Ilex
coriacea (gallberry holly), for which the community is named, Nyssa sylvatica.
Rhododendron spp., Ilex opaca, Acer rubrum, Vaccinium spp., and Persea palustris.
In western Louisiana and eastern Texas, baygalls generally occur at stream heads or on
short slopes that receive enough seepage to be p)ermanently saturated (Bridges & Orzell
1989; Harcombe et al. 1993; Brooks et al. 1993; Weakley et al. 1998). They are
recognized as a natural community in both Louisiana (Louisiana Natural Heritage
