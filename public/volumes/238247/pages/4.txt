ABSTRACT
The results of a floristic inventory are presented for the Paramo of
Cajanuma (3150-3385 m elevation), located in Podocarpus National Park,
southern Ecuador. A total of 130 species, representing 81 genera and 50
families, are reported. Species composition is discussed in relation to
environmental factors and regional-scale floristic patterns. Special emphasis is
given to the occurrence of woody species.
KEY WORDS: pdramo, floristics, Podocarpus National Park, Andes,
Neotropics, Ecuador
INTRODUCTION
Neotropical montane regions are frequently covered with paramo vegetation
between 3000 and 4700 m elevation. This ecosystem occurs discontinuously between
Costa Rica and northern Peru in areas where annual precipitation is above 1500 mm
and evenly distributed across the year (Lauer 1981; Luteyn 1992). Although pdramo
is usually dominated by herbaceous species, a zone of shrub paramo {sensu
Cuatrecasas 1968) may occur between the grass paramo and timberline. In Ecuador,
paramo covers less than 2% of the total area (Luteyn et al. 1992), but it may include
more than 3300 vascular plant species (Luteyn, in press).
Despite both the high species richness and rates of environmental degradation that
characterize Ecuador's upper montane zone {e.g., Acosta-Soh's 1984; Balslev 1988;
Luteyn 1992), relatively few floristic inventories of paramo communities have been
published for Ecuador (but see L0jtnant & Molau 1982; Ceron & Toasa 1994; Keating
1995). The floristic composition of montane conununities in southern Ecuador differs
substantially from those of adjacent regions (J0rgensen et al. 1995), but few paramo
studies of any sort have been conducted there (but see Laegaard 1992; Keating 1995;
Ramsay & Oxley 1996). In this article, I document a botanical inventory conducted in
