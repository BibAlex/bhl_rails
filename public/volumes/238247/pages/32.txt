Dematteis & Robinson: Chromosome studies in Acilepidopsis 369
Acilepidopsis may be more closely related to Mesanthophora, a monotypic genus
described for Paraguay (Robinson 1992b) and since discovered in Bolivia. Despite
the identical pollen type, the genera differ considerably in many other morphological
features. Acilepidopsis is a pubescent plant covered with reddish glands, has sessile
heads, 8-13 flowered, placed in the axils of leafy branches; meanwhile,
Mesanthophora is a glabrous plant with pedunculate, 90-100 flowered heads, located
in a supra-axillary position.
A particular feature noticed in Acilepidopsis since its description is the unusual
sclerified pointed base of the anther thecae, which is otherwise known in the more
distantly related Piptocarpha (x=17).
Additional chromosome studies, especially in genera with triporate pollen, could
provide a better understanding of the relationships between Acilepidopsis and other
American and African genera of Vemonieae.

The pollen specimens were prepared by Barbara Eastwood using facilities of the
Smithsonian Botany Department Palynological Laboratory. The pollen photographs
were taken by Brian Kahn of the National Museum of Natural History Laboratory
using a Hitachi S-570 scanning electron microscope.
