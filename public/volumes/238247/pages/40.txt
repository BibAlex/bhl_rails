distinctive that it is misleading to think of it as a baygall. We instead refer to it here as
a "possum haw bog."
In San Jacinto County, immediately adjacent to Walker County and less than 50
km (30 miles) southeastward, habitats similar to the Prairie Branch bog are populated
by large complements of typical baygall species (Hartman 1974; Nesom pers. observ.;
Turner et al. in prep.). Brooks et al. (1993) studied 20 baygall sites along a north-
south axis in eastern Texas. These ran from southern Rusk County south to Hardin
and Tyler counties and as far east as Newton County; the closest of these to the Prairie
Branch bog was in Tyler County. All are much more similar to the San Jacinto
