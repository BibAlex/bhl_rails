Surveying the specimens in each cluster, including looking at the characters not
used in the analyses, convinced me that the clusters were taxonomically interesting
entities, but that they were not identical with good taxa.
PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS. The first three principal components
accounted for 37.1%, 17.1%, and 11.1%, respectively, of the total variance. Spikelet
and floret characters contributed most to the first and second axes; basal culm diameter
was the largest contributor to the third axis (Table 3).

The projection of the OTUs onto the first three components (Figure 2) revealed no
strongly defined groups among the OTUs. The Sb group [using labels from the
cluster analysis] was the most distinct, but its intra-group distances were also relatively
large. The other three groups occupied basically different, but contiguous, portions of
the principal component space, with the Sp group between groups A and B. Minimum
spanning tree links provide an indication of the overlap among the groups. Ideally, the
maximum number of intergroup links would be two per group, with two of the groups
having only a single intergroup link, i.e., 6 links for 4 groups. There were 21
intergroup links among the OTUs in this study. Group Sb had 5 (3 to Sp, 2 to A);
group Sp had 1 1 (6 to B, 3 to Sb, and 2 to A); group A had 12 (8 to B, 2 to Sp, and 2
to Sb), and group B had 14 (8 to A, 6 to Sp).
DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS. It was hard to determine, fi-om looking at the
specimens, which characteristics contributed most to the distinction between groups A
and B, but comparison of the means for each cluster suggested that awn length was a
major factor. For this reason, and because of the instability of the clusters, I decided
to conduct two series of discriminant analyses, one in which A and B were considered
as separate groups and one in which they were combined into a single group.
