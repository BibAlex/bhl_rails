1892.] Address. 35
years has been Us. 3,840, or Rs. 330 less than during the previous four
years. As the strictest economy lias been practised whenever possible,
advantage was taken of the opportunity given by the resignation of Mr.
Ronaldson to work with a reduced staff, so that the salary bill for the
past year has been much less than at any time in the previous
ten years. The whole expenditure under this head in 1891 is Rs. 3,138,
or more than a thousand rupees less than the average for the years 1882
to 1885.
Thus during these past six years there has been, in comparison
with the previous four, a considerable saving on Part I of the Journal,
and in salaries. It appears that the low balance in 1890 was chiefly
caused by the expenditure on Part II of the Journal. Between the
years 1879 and 1885 the balance at credit of the Society varied between
Rs. 1,42,000 and Rs. 1,45,000, but since the latter year it has exceeded
Rs. 1,42,000 in 1887 only. In 1888 it was Rs. 1,38,032, and in 1890
Rs. 1,37,611. Owing to the careful economy practised by the Council
during the past year, the balance is now nearly Rs. 1,41,000, and there is
every prospect of a further increase. The opportunity should now be taken
to revert to the rule that all entrance fees should be added to
the permanent investment instead of to the cash balance ; and as there
is no longer any urgent reason for keeping the staff on its present
reduced footing, the permanent appointment of an Assistant Secretary
may now be taken into consideration.
The financial history of the Oriental Publication Fund
during the past ten years is altogether dif-
tionrSnd PubliCa " ferent from that of the Society. Up to
1884 the credit-balance was steadily increasing
by variable amounts of from two to five thousand rupees a year,
the number of fasciculi produced annually at that time being on
an average about 21. In 1884 the balance was over Rs. 21,000, and
it then became evident that the rate of publication must be
increased. A larger number of Sanskrit and Persian works was
taken up for publication, with the result that the balance diminished
by about Rs. 4,000 a year, and was practically exhausted at the end of
1890. The number of fasciculi published reached a maximum in 1888,
when it stood at 58. It became apparent, however, during the past two
years that the machinery thus set in motion would continue to work
longer than was desirable, and measures have been adopted by the
Council, especially during the past year, to limit the publication to the
normal number, that is, to the number which can be paid for from the
yearly income. Not only has no new work been undertaken, but the less
important work already in hand has been suspended. The full effect of
