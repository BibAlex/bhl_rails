I do not think tbat these lists are at all complete, nor will it be
found tbat the spellings of the Ain and of the Statistical Account
exactly agree. Indeed one of my objects is to show that they do not,
and tbat the text of the Ain wants revision. Thus Chunakhali is dis-
guised in the Ain under the name of Jonaghatti, and the old and
extensive parganas of Gowas and Gankar appear there as Kahas and
Gankarah. Some well-known parganas do not appear at all in the Ain.
For example, Ghiasabacl, which Grant places, no doubt correctly, in Sha-
rifabad, is not mentioned in the Ain. Under Sarkar Mabmudabad, we
find Babhangola and Barmapur. Can these be Bhagwangola and Ber-
bampur ?
The name Sbarffabad for tbe Sarkar comprising the Rarb is inter-
esting for it suggests tbe family of Husain Shah, the famous king
of Gaur. An ancestor of his is said to have been Sharif of Mecca, and
his father's name was Ashraf. Perhaps the latter gave his name to the
pargana of Ashraf Bhag. In the Ain this pai^gana appears under the
name of Darsan Ashrafnahal, and in Tieffenthaler as Darsan Ashrafbhal.
I ought to mention that I have been assisted in making my lists
by a valuable map in Col. Gastrell's report on Murshidabad, in which the
principal parganas are shown.
If we bad similar maps of other districts, or even with the aid of
the pargana maps in the Survey Office, a map might be made of the
19 Sarkars which would show tbe divisions of Bengal in 1582. Another
might be made showing the Sarkars of Orissa and Assam. A third
map might be made showing Jaffar Khan's 13 Chaklas corresponding
to the 34 Sarkars of Todar Mai. No doubt tbe labour would be con-
