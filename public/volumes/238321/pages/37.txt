34 Address. [Pei?.
the very necessary outlay on fclie buildings in 1SS8, which was partly
met by the purchase-money of the strip of land adjoining Park Street, the
more variable items are salaries and the expenditure on the two parts of
the Journal. The total sum spent on the second (or Natural Science)
pari of the Journal during the past six years is Rs. 20,990, which gives
a yearly average of little less than Rs. 3,500. The average for the first
(or philological | pari during the same period is Rs. 1,255, in which is in-
cluded the cost of Mr. Grierson's Vernacular Literature of Hindustan,
which was however to a large extent met by the receipts on account of
copies taken by the Imperial and Provincial Governments.
The outlay on printing the Journal has been given separately for
the two parts in the yearly accounts from 1882 only, so that the ex-
penditure during the past six years can be compared with that of
only the four preceding. The average cost for the Journal, Part I, during
the years 1882 to 1885 was Rs. 2,244, and for Part II Rs. 1,393. It
follows that the cost of Part I decreased in the second period by nearly
one-half, while that of Part II increased two-and-a-half times. This
increased expenditure on the Natural History Part of the Journal
undoubtedly represents a large amount of valuable work on the part
of the Natural History Secretary and of those members of the Society
who devote their time to science, and it has certainly increased the
value of the Journal to the scientific world. Still, we must follow the
homely maxim of cutting our coat according to our cloth. The fact
that the credit-balance of the Society was lower in 1888 by several
thousand rupees than it had ever been before, and that it was lower
still in 1890, shows that the outlay incurred during the pasi four
years has been considerably beyond the means of the Society. At the
same time it must be borne in mind thai about 1SS5 the work done for
the Oriental Publication fund was largely increased, and the effect of
this was naturally shown in the reduced cost of the first part of the
Journal. Thus in 1885 the cost of this part was Rs. 2,324 ; in 1886 it
fell to Rs. 1,075, and in 1887 to Rs. 420 ; after which it again increased,
but did not exceed Rs. 1,100 except in 1890. Now that the balance in
the Oriental Publication Fund has been exhausted, and the work, as
I shall explain directly, has been reduced to its normal dimensions, it
is to be expected thai the number of papers selected for publication in
Pari 1 of the Journal will again increase, thus furnishing an additional
OH for keeping the expenditure On Part II of the Journal within
normal Limits.
The average yearly payment for salaries from 1882 to 188S was
R^. 4,173 ; and during the past six years tin's average has been exceed-
ed twice only, in the years 1889 and L890, while the average for these
