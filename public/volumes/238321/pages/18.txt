resignation of Mr. H. Beveridgc in consequence of leaving India, and
the Hon. Sir A. W. Croft was appointed to fill the vacant place.
The other Trustees on behalf of the Society were : —

Finance.
The accounts of the Society are shown in Statement No. 1 in the
Appendix under the usual heads.
Statement No. 8 contains the Balance Sheet of the Society, and of
the different funds administered through it.
The Budget Estimate for 1891 was taken at the following figures : —
Receipts Rs. 15,570— Expenditure Rs. 14,323.
The actual results were found to be : — Receipts 16,007-0-3. Ex-
penditure Rs. 12,975-13-10.
The Receipts thus show an increase of Rs. 437-0-3 and the Expen-
diture a decrease of Rs. 1,347-2-2 on the Budget Estimate, leaving a
balance in favour of the Society of Rs. 3,031-2-5.
The increase in Receipts is under the heads of Subscriptions and
Sales of Publications. Subscriptions were estimated at Rs. 7,500,
whilst the actuals were Rs. 7,786-8-10, the excess being due to some of
the arrear subscriptions from members having been realized. Sales of
Publications show an increase of Rs. 1,004-12-11. This large increase
is due to the adjustment of Messrs. Triibner's accounts for 18 months,
and of the unexpected sale of periodicals during the period.
As only 15 new members were elected, there is a reduction of Rs.
172 under the head of receipts from admission fees; and the difference
between the estimated and actual miscellaneous receipts is due to the
refund of income tax not yet having been granted.
On the expenditure side, the items, of " Books," " Binding " and
" Printing of Circulars," &c, show an increase. Books were estimated
at Rs. 1,800 whilst the actuals were Rs. 2,372-13-3, the increase
being due to the adjustment of Messrs. Triibner's account for 18 months.
Taking into account the period the amount covers, the expenditure on
Books is within the Budget Estimate. Binding has increased by Rs.
51-15-3. This is due to the binding of some old books, which were
required by members at the close of the year.
As new labels for sending the publications to Foreign Societies had
to be printed, and a larger number of circulars than usual were required
owing to the suggested alteration of rules there is an increase under
this head of Rs. 55-2.
