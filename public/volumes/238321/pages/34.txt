Address.
The Report of the Council which has just been read supplies full
t â€¢ + f tot -K information as to the working of the Society
in 1891, and I think it may be regarded as
fairly satisfactory. Compared with the previous six years, the figures
for the last six show, it is true, a steadily downward tendency in
the number of paying members ; but this decline seems for the present

those who, feeling a general interest in what has been performed by
man or produced by nature within the continent of India, would
naturally seek admission to our Society if fuller opportunities for
stimulating that interest were afforded them in their daily life and work.

to mend.
The Society has lost several valued mem-

Raja Rajendralala Mitra, c. i. e., was a scholar of European
fame. His connexion with this Society extended over a period of nearly
half a century. Entering it, when a young man, as Assistant Secretary and

him into prominence ; and while we may congratulate ourselves that it
