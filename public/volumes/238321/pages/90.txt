The butterflies must all of necessity be examples of involuntary
immigi'ation, and though not of necessity all immigrants under the in-
fluence of winds, have probably in most cases been driven thither by
one or other of the monsoons.
Leaving out of account those of Barren Island, two of which have not
been specifically identified while a third has not had the particular local
race determined, and considering only those of Narcondam, we see that
one — Leptosia xiphia — has of necessity come from the north-east, and one
Ixias andamana — has of necessity come from the south-west ; all the
others may have arrived under the influence of either monsoon.
Meagre as our knowledge of the Fauna of these islands is, we
seem justified in concluding that the predominance of an Andamans
element in it is altogether due to the fact that they are nearer the
Andaman Group, from the direction of which a strong monsoon blows
for the greater part of each year. At the same time it is clear that
the opposite monsoon, though blowing with less force and over a
wider sea, is not altogether inactive, but on the contrary must be held
accountable for the introduction of certain species which, though they
have reached these islands from Indo-China, have not yet succeeded in
passing beyond them to the Andaman Group proper. The precise ex-
tent of either influence it would however be premature, in the present
state of our knowledge, to attempt to assess.
