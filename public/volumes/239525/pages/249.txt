* Complementary days, or Sansculottides, called Primidi, Duodi, Tridi, Quartidi,

The sonorous names given to the months by the innovators have been freely trans-
lated thus : —

Sneezy, Drippy, Flowery, Croppy,
Breezy. Nippy. Bowery. Poppy.

Six hundred and forty-first Meeting.
February 13, 1872. — Adjourned Stated Meeting.
The President in the chair.
Professor John Trowbridge remarked : —
While experimenting upon the electromotive action of fluids separ-
ated by membranes, I was led to reflect upon the surface action ob-
served by Tomlinson, and to examine it from an electrical point of
view. I made use of a bath of sulphate of zinc in which were placed
the amalgamated zinc terminals of a galvanometer. On dropping
liquids upon the surface of this bath electrical currents were produced,
but they were not due to surface action ; for, on using a drop of colored
liquid, the deflection of the galvanometer was observed before the liquid
reached the terminals. This was also proved by coating the plates of
the terminals with parafine, with the exception of a narrow strip two
inches below the surface of the bath.
