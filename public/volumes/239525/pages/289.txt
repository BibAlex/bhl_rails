Ippata, further information will doubtless make them easier of expla-
nation.
From Tables A and B it will be seen : â€”
That Kubbi's cousins are Ippai and Ippata of the same generation.
Kumbo's " " Mum " Mata " " "
Ippai's " " Kubbi " Kapota " " "
Murri's " " Kumbo " Buta " " "
Hence (from Table A) a man must marry his female cousin.
Kubbi may not have his male cousin Ippai's wife, for she is Kapota, his sister (A 1).
Kumbo " " " Murri's " " Buta, " (A 2).
Ippai " " " Kubbi's " " Ippata " (A3).
Murri " " " Kumbo's " " Mata " (A 4)
Hence a man is allowed his female cousins, but the wives of his male
cousins were forbidden to him. Thus it is also with the Fijian system,
and the Tamilian, as I pointed out in Memorandum No. 4 ; and this
explains the difference between these systems and that of the Seneca-
Iroquois as to the relationships between a man and the children of his
cousins, male and female.
Sydney, May 1, 1871.
Memorandum B.
Australian Aborigines.
T. E. Lance, Esq. (of Bungowalbyn, Lawrence, Clarence River,
N. S. W.), has favored me with an extremely interesting letter, which
fully confirms, not only the information given me by the Rev. W. Rid-
ley, but the conclusions also which 1 drew from that information. (See
Memo. A.)
Mr. Lance has had much intercourse with the natives, having lived
among them for many years on frontier cattle stations on the Darling
River, and in the Trans-Darling country.
1 . He says : " All Kubbis are brothers, and all Kapotas are their
sisters : and so also with the Ippais and Ippatas." (See Table B.
Memo. A.)
2. " If a Kubbi meets a Kapota whom he has never seen or heard
of before, they address each other as brother and sister. If he meets
a strange Ippata, they address each other as goleer = spouse."
Hence we may infer that these nations salute by the title of kinship
as do the Fijians also.
