OP ARTS AND SCIENCES: APRIL 11, 1871. olo
The details of a complete analysis are as follows : — Having filled
the perfectly dry bottle, by means of a pair of bellows, with the air to
be analyzed, 50 c. c. of the baryta water are added, and the interior
surface of the bottle kept moistened by turning the same for about half
an hour.
At the end of this time the baryta water is poured into a cylinder,
the latter tightly corked, and the carbonate of barium allowed to de-
posit, requiring about fifteen minutes. 25 c. c. of the nearly clear
liquid are now transferred to a small flask, and the oxalic acid solution
run in from a burette, until a single drop of the mixture fails to give
the alkaline reaction on turmeric paper. Taking, for example, the
first experiment made on the outer air, it was found that 20.4 c. c. of
the oxalic acid solution were required to neutralize 25 c. c. of the
baryta water after the action of the air.
The difference between 20.4 c. c. and 23 c. c, the amount required
to neutralize 25 c. c. of baryta water before the action of the air, being
multiplied by 2, — for 50 c. c. of baryta water were used in the ex-
periment, — we obtain 5.2 c. c, each c. c. of which is equivalent to
nearly one mgrm. of carbonic acid, in accordance with the proportion :
at.wt. at.wt. wt. of in
O CO, 1 c. c. of sol. wt. of C0 2 .
63 : 22 — .0028636 : .0009998
Multiplying this weight of carbonic acid by 5.2 c. c. and reducing the
product to volumes in terms of c. c. at the normal temperature and
pressure, we obtain 2.637 c. c. of carbonic acid in the volume of air
analyzed. Bottle No. 1 having been used, after reducing its volume
to the normal temp, and press., we obtain the percentage of carbonic
acid by a simple proportion, thus : —
5783.26 : 2.637 = 100 : .04560%.
In order to ascertain if the oxalic acid used in these experiments
could be depended on for purity, the strength of the baryta water was
tested with different solutions of the acid, prepared from crystals which
were obtained under various conditions.
I. A solution of oxalic acid in hot water was made and allowed to
crystallize. These crystals were dried between sheets of blotting-paper,
2.8636 grms. weighed out, dissolved in water, and the solution made
up to a litre. 25 c. c. of the baryta water required 23 c. c. of this
solution.
