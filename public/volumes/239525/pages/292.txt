The rule, that the children take the mother's second name, gives us
two instances of names not recorded in Mr. Ridley's list of the sub-
divisions, namely, sixteen Murri and Mata-Opossum, and twenty-four
Kumbo and Buta-Bandicoot. There must be something wanting here*
as we find no provision for the " privileged " marriage of these names.
I think Ave may take it for granted that there is a third subdivision
of all the classes, as follows : —
1. Murri and Mata subdivide into 1. Iguana. 2. Kangaroo. 3. Opossum.
2. Kumbo and Buta " " 1. Emu. 2. Blacksnake. 3. Bandicoot.
For, since there are Ippai-Bandicoot and Ippata-Bandicoot, the
mother of the two, that is, Buta, must also be Bandicoot, because the
children take the mother's second, or tribal name. And, there being a
Buta-Bandicoot, there must also be a Kumbo-Bandicoot, because each
of all these pairs takes the same second name for both male and
female. So also with Murri and Mata-Opossum.
Hence we get six classes, each containing four names, consisting of
two pairs of brothers and sisters.
names. Mr. Eidley tells me that some of the natives whom he questioned pro-
nounced Kapota, Kubbotha ; Mata, Matha, etc. I retain Kapota for uniformity's
sake.
