OP ARTS AND SCIENCES: JANUARY 31, 1872. 349
abolished the use of the Gregoriau Calendar and established in its
place the Republican Calendar.* A previous decree of the 22d Sep-
tember, 1792, had ordered that, after that day, all public acts should
be dated from the first year of the Republic, without, however, changing
the beginning of the year.f On the 24th of October, J a report was
accepted which resulted in the decree of the 24th of November, when
the details and nomenclature of the new calendar were adopted, and
also the division of the day into 100,000 seconds. These decrees took
effect from the 26th of November, 1793, when the new dates began
to be used in recording the sessions and public acts of the Convention.
So much as relates to the decimal division of the day was not obliga-
tory until the first day of the year III., and was suspended in its
operation, April 7, 1795. On the 8th of April, 1802, the week of seven
days and their names were restored. On the 9th of September, 1805,
an edict of Napoleon, upon the recommendation of a committee of
which Laplace was chairman, ordered the restoration of the Gregorian
Calendar on the 1st of January, 1806. It was asserted by Laplace,
that the people of France had always adhered to the Gregorian reck-
oning, in common affairs from preference, and in ecclesiastical dates
from necessity, and the expectation that any other nation would adopt
the French innovation was a chimera. ยง
The Republican Calendar divided the year into twelve months of
thirty days each. Four of these years make a Franciade, the last
being called sextile, because it contained the extra day. The year
which introduced the additional day was also called the Olympic.
At the end of this year six complementary days were intercalated,
and in other years only five. These complementary days were holi-
days, and were vulgarly called Sansculottides ; also, Epagomenes.
The' era of the new Chronology was antedated to the 22d of Sep-
tember, 1792, when the Republic was established and when the sun
entered Libra, which was hailed as the symbol of equality. Each
