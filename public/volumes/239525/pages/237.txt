318 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY
Six Hundred and fortieth Meeting.
January 31, 1872. — Stated Meeting.
The President in the chair.
Professor N. S. Shaler called the attention of the Academy
to the want of suitable rooms for their library and meetings,
and suggested that better accommodations might be obtained
in the building of the Boston Society of Natural History.
A Committee consisting of Messrs. Edmund Quincy, J. I.
Bowditch, and N. S. Shaler, was appointed to consider this
matter.
The following gentlemen were elected into the Academy : —
Charles A. Dunbar, of Cambridge, to be a Resident Fellow
in Class III., Section 3.
William A. Rogers, of Cambridge, to be a Resident Fellow in
Class I., Section 2.
Professor Crafts made some remarks on a new reaction,
involving phosphorus, iodine, and the organic radical ethyl,
in which the ethyl, contrary to the ideas held hitherto by most
chemists, shows a stronger affinity for the phosphorus than
does the iodine, setting the latter free and combining with the
former to give a compound, from which the oxide of triethyl-
phosphine can easily be obtained.
This result, which was realized by Mr. Emmerton in the
laboratory of the Institute of Technology, was foreseen in a
paper published in the " Journ. Chem. Soc." in 1871, by
Messrs. Crafts and Silva.
Dr. Charles Pickering suggested that the story of Orpheus
moving the rocks by his music might have originated from the
method in which the Egyptians moved their immense masses
of stone. Although some of them were ninety feet long and
fourteen feet square, they were drawn by men, one of whom
regulated the motions of the rest by standing on top and
clapping his hands.
