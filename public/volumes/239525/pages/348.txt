OF ARTS AND SCIENCES: MAY 13, 1873. 525
long, £-1/ wide ; raceme frequently 1-2° long ; bracts oblong-lanceo-
late, equalling or shorter than the calyx ; flowers mostly scattered,
blue, purple, or white ; pedicels 3 - 6" long ; calyx-lips subequal, en-
tire, bractlets very caducous ; petals equal, 6 - 7" long, keel naked ;
ovules 9 ; pod 1' long or more. — From Ft. Vancouver and the Lower
Fraser River to Klamath Valley and San Francisco.
8. L. Wtethii. Stem ascending, stout, \ - 2° high, sparingly
leafy ; pubescence villous, spreading ; stipules setaceous ; leaflets 8 — 12,
oblong to oblanceolate, \\-2\' long, acute, glabrous above, the lower
petioles much elongated; raceme 4-10' long, often long-peduncled ;
bracts subulate-setaceous, exceeding the calyx ; flowers blue or pink,
scattered or subverticillate ; pedicels slender, 3— A" long; calyx vil-
lous, with short setaceous bractlets, upper lip 2-toothed, the lower one
longer, subentire ; petals equal, 6 - 7" long, keel naked ; ovules 7-8.
— Flathead River, Oregon (Wyeth) ; Clear Water (Spalding).
9. L. rivularis, Dougl. Stout, erect, 2-6° high, branching,
nearly glabrous ; pubescence short and silky, close-appressed or very
rarely spreading on the calyx and pedicel ; stipules subulate or seta-
ceous ; leaflets 7 - 10, about equalling the petioles, \ - 5' long, oblanceo-
late, acute or the lower ones obtuse, glabrous above ; raceme long-
peduncled, often 1-2° long ; bracts setaceous, exceeding the calyx ;
flowers scattered or subverticillate, purple or sometimes white ; pedicels
2 - 5" long ; calyx with caducous bractlets^ the upper lip rarely entire ;
petals 6" long, equal, the keel slightly ciliate ; pod 1^' long, 8 - 10-
seeded. — From the Columbia to Southern California, common. The
species has been known only from the figure (Bot. Reg. 19, t. 1595)
and a cultivated specimen in Herb. Lindley. These seem to accord
sufficiently well with the ordinary L. cytisoides, Agh., and the older
name is retained.
Var. latifolius. Leaflets 5 - 7, 'spatulate or oblanceolate, \ - 1 y
wide, obtuse and mucronulate, or the upper acute, the pubescence on
the calyx oftener spreading.
10. L. Burkei. Resembling the last, but distinguished by broader
stipules, the lower leaves long-petioled, the raceme usually short and
dense, with pedicels mostly but 1 - 2" long, bracts villous and subper-
sistent, pubescence of the calyx somewhat villous and more or less
spreading ; pod 8-seeded. — On the east side of the Sierra ; near
Carson City (46 Anderson, 262 Stretch); "Snake country " (Burke) ;
Falls of the Yellowstone (Hayden).
