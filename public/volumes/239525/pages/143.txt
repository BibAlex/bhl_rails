New Method for facilitating the Conversion of Longitudes and Lati-
tudes of Heavenly Bodies, near the Ecliptic, into Right Ascensions
and Declinations, and vice versa.
In the computation of a Lunar Ephemeris, the conversion of the lon-
gitudes and latitudes into right ascensions and declinations forms no
inconsiderable part of the work to be done. Prof. Hansen, at the end
of his " Tables de la Lune," has given some tables, with the view of
diminishing the amount of labor required in this conversion.
But their employment seems to me to possess little, if any, advantage
over the use of the ordinary formula? of spherical trigonometry. I pro-
pose the following method, which perhaps in a slight degree is more
ready than that of Prof. Hansen.
Designating the right ascension, declination, longitude, latitude, and
the obliquity of the ecliptic respectively by a, 8, I, b and e, we have the
following equations
sin S = cos e sin b -f- sin e cos b sin I
. , . sin e . n ,. . sin e . n ,.

The first equation is well known, the second is easily derived from
the known formula, expressed in the usual notation,
A B sin (s — c)
tan — tan — = ^ -,
2 2 sin s
when we remember that, in considering the triangle, formed by the
heavenly body and the poles of the equator and ecliptic, A, B, s and
c are replaced by 90° + a, 90° — I, 90° -f e ~ ^ + 8) and e.
Suppose we were to tabulate the functions cos e sin A and ~— — sin A
for a certain value of e (as 23° 27' 20" which is nearly its value at
present), and in small side tables put the variations of these functions
for increments of 1", 2" 9" in e ; we should have the value of sin 8
by entering the first table with the argument A = b, and the second
successively with the arguments A = I -j- b and A = I — b, and
