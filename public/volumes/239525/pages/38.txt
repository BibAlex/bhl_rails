OF ARTS AND SCIENCES: JUNE 9, 1868. 39
Brewster's own prediction has the promise of fulfilment, — " I have no
doubt that, before another century is completed, a talking and a sing-
ing machine will be numbered among the conquests of science."
Born at a time when the corpuscular theory of light compelled assent,
from the influence of Newton's great name, when Laplace would nbt
tolerate any discussion of the opposing theory in the French Academy
of Science, when Lord Brougham fiercely attacked what he after-
wards cordially espoused, he lived to witness the complete triumph
of the undulatory theory in the hands of Young and Fresnel, and to
see what Lloyd has called " a mob of hypotheses " exchanged for what
Herschel characterizes as " one succession of felicities." Though
neither himself nor Biot ever deserted the lost cause, of which they
were the bold experimental champions, Brewster, in his Report on
Optics, prepared for the British Association for the Advancement of
Science, has done ample justice to the labors of Malus and others
who contributed to its overthrow ; and he congratulates mankind that
" even amid the convulsions and atrocities of that awful period
Science shot forth some of her brightest radiations, and, in the moral
and religious darkness which prevailed, her evening star was the only
surviving emblem of heaven."
Of nearly one hundred papers which Brewster published in scien-
tific journals or in the transactions of academies, there are very few
which do not touch his favorite subject, viz., Optics. Optical instru-
ments ; polarization, rectilinear, circular, and elliptical ; depolarization ;
the optical character of crystals, and the mode of producing crystalline
structure artificially ; vision, both subjective and objective ; the action
of the eye in man and other animals ; the interference, dispersion, and
absorption of light ; the spectral lines in sunlight, as produced by the
sun's atmosphere, or the earth's atmosphere, and as multiplied by
other absorbing media; — this was the burden of his long life of
research and of his voluminous writings.
Born seven years after Biot, Brewster died about seven years later,
so that the long and laborious lives of these two eminent physicists went
hand in hand for more than half a century. If Brewster did not
share the great mathematical powers of Biot, if he was without the
genius for vast and rapid generalization displayed by Fresnel in optics
and by Ampere in electro-magnetism, nevertheless he was endowed
with consummate skill in experiment, and deduced empirical laws
where Malus and Arago had failed. We may adopt the language
