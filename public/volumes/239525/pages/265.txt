518. Scoliopus Bigelovii Torr. Bot. Whippl. p. 89, t. 22. Foot-
hills of the Cascades, along mossy banks of streams. Copious speci-
mens of this most rare plant were collected, but past flowering, i. e.
the perianth and hypogynous stamens fallen : one or two specimens
fortunately have ripe fruit. The thin-walled pericarp appears to open
irregularly, not by any of the six sutural lines, but as it were between
them, or near the three stronger and seminiferous sutures ; and it would
seem that the walls at length vanish, leaving the placenta? like a re-
plum, sometimes united at apex by the persistent style, which is much
more distinct and slender than in Dr. Torrey's figure, more so indeed
than in Dr. Bigelow's specimens. The leaves also in the present spe-
cimens are smaller and narrower at base ; but there is probably no
specific difference. The characters of the fruit and seeds are ap-
pended.*
