632. Poa stenantha Trin. Probably also P. leptocoma Trin.
and certainly Festuca nervosa Hook. Fl. Bor.-Am. t. 232.
633. Poa andina Nutt. herb. ; a condensed form with larger
spikelets.
634. Poa tenutfolia Nutt. in herb. ; Watson, Bot. King, p. 387.
Poa melicoides Nutt. in herb. Durand and herb. Lowell. The proper
genus perhaps is Atropis, and indeed the present species appears to
pass into Atropis Californica (or Schlerochloa Californica) Munro.
635. Melica bulbosa Geyer in Hook. Kew Jour. Bot. (PI.
Geyer.) 8, p. 10. 31. poceoides Torr. Bot. Whippl., Bolander, &c, non
Nutt.* Geyer's name is preferred in the absence of any reason for
changing it to 31. Geyeri, as Munro proposes ; especially as the plant
described under this name by Bolander is different.!
636. Lophochl^ena refracta, n. sp. Ab affini L. Californica
insigniter differt foliis latioribus (lin. 4 latis), racemo virgato, spiculis
mox refractis angustioribus fere linearibus, floribus subdissitis, paleis
tenuioribus fere laivibus, arista palea ipsa breviore. — An interesting
accession to a remarkable genus, which, it seems to me, should stand
next to 3felica. I possess no specimen of " Melica aristata Thurber "
in Dr. Bolander's revision of the genus : but 3felica Harfordii of
Bolander is evidently an intermediate link.
637. Festuca Mturus L., the F. bromoides L. also.
638. Festuca microstachts Nutt. PI. Gamb. p. 187. 639. Var.
* Melica poceoides Nutt. PI. Gamb. p. 188, is described as from Dr. Gambell's
collection, and is said to come from the " Island of Santa Catalina," — which
Gambell visited, but NuttalL did not.- In the distributed set of Gambell's plants
acquired by Mr. Lowell, and in that for Mr. Durand (now in my possession), there
is no " Melica poceoides." There is, however, a " Poa melicoides " from " Catalina,"
which is the same as no. 634 of the present collection, namely, a plant which
Nuttall named " Poa tenuifolia."
By the kind aid of Dr. Carruthers, keeper of the herbaria of the British
Museum, I am enabled to say that the " Melica poceoides Nutt. MSS." of his own
herbarium, and apparently of his own collecting, is ticketed " San Diego." But
it is pretty clearly the plant described in PI. Gamb. It differs from the M. pani-
coides of the same paper in having (as described) two perfect flowers in most of
the spikelets, while that has commonly only one ; but both belong to Melica im-
perfecta Trin. i
t Melica Geyeri Bolander in Proc. Calif. Acad. 4, p. 102, as represented by no.
40 of his small collection, is very unlike M. bulbosa of Geyer's collection. To
obviate further confusion, it would be well, and perhaps not too late, for Dr.
Bolander to restore to it specifically his appropriate name of M. bromoides.
