sin 3 2 it -f (c 2 — 1) sin 2 /i — c 2 sin 2 = 0.
That this cubic will always give at least one real value for p, is evi-
dent on making in the left-hand member sin 2 ti successively equal to
— 1, 0, and -j- 1 ; the results obtained are
— c 2 (1 -f- sin 2 j8), always negative ;
— c 2 sin 2 0, negative or positive, according to the sign of sin 2 ;
-(- c 2 (1 — sin 2 0), always positive.
Moreover, it is plain that there is one real value of /., which makes
sin 2 n and sin 2 have like signs ; this value we shall adopt.
Making, according as e 2 is greater or less than unity,
c 2 = sec 2 , y, or c 2 = cos 2 y ',
the above cubic is solved by these formulae (see Chauveuet's Trigo-
nometry, p. 96), it being necessary to make three different cases.
