But a comparison which has been obligingly made at Kew with
the unique original specimen belonging to the Herbarium of Trinity
College, Dublin, shows that to be a different species, of more
southern habitat, to which a specimen collected by Dr. Horn in
Ovvens's Valley or at Fort Tejon seems, to belong. . As the species now
at length discriminated and characterized was probably (after Mr.
Bridges) first collected by the chief and Nestor of our science, of
whom we have just been bereaved, it may most appropriately bear his
venerated name.*

Very silky-villous : leaf-like bract near the umbel . . H. incana.
Villous-pubescent and viscid : the bract or leaf remote . H. stipularis,
Stipules scarious.
Bract much below the many-flowered umbel : calyx-teeth
very short H. crassifolia.
Bract (when present) borne at the summit of the
One -four-flowered slender peduncle.
Leaflets 5 - 9, obovate or linear : bract 3-foliolate . H. angustifolia.

Several- (5 - 10-) or only from the lowest axils 2-4-flow-
ered peduncle.
Minutely appressed-pubescent, except below : bract 1 -
foliolate : corolla yellow and purplish . . H. oblongifolia.
