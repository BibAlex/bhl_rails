Then the equations become
r sin (a — <r) = a_ v
r sin (« -|- S) = a ,
r sin (J -{- <r) = a x .
Or,

If r sin » and r cos <a are eliminated from these equations, and we
make

where c may be taken as positive and the quadrant of /3 becomes deter-
minate, or /3 may be assumed between the limits ± 90°, there will be
obtained, for the determination of <r, the equation
sin 2 a- = 2 c sin (a- -\- /3).
The computation of c and /3 may be facilitated by introducing the
auxiliary quantities k and (, such that
k sin f = -p —

then
c cos /3 = & cos (4o° — f) cos S.
c sin /3 = £ sin (45° — £) sin 8.
It is evident that the determination of o- depends on the solution of
an equation of the fourth degree ; but its value can be very readily
obtained from the above equation by the tentative process ; and then
