mostly sessile; disk not thickened; stamens 20, rarely 25 ; herba-
ceous perennials with conspicuous yellow flowers.
t Leaves pinnate (or sometimes digitate in P. Hippiana and
diver sifolia); carpels usually 10 - 30 ; bractlets shorter than the
sepals.
9. P. Hippiana, Lehm. Densely white-tomentose and silky
throughout, the upper surface of the leaves a little darker; stems
ascending, 1-1 1° high, slender, branching above into a diffuse cyme ;
stipules usually entire ; leaves occasionally digitate, especially in
reduced alpine specimens ; leaflets 5-11, cuneate-oblong, 1-2' long,
obtuse, incisely toothed at least toward the apex, margin not revolute ;
pedicels slender; bractlets narrow; petals 2^-3^" long, exceeding
the calyx. — From the Saskatchewan to Nebraska, Colorado, New
Mexico, and Northern Arizona.
Var. pulcherrima. (P. pulcherrima, Lehm. P. diffusa, Gray.
P. Pennsylvanica, var. pulcherrima, Torr. & Gray.) Stems 1-2°
high ; leaflets 5-9, approximate, crowded, or digitate, the terminal
one 1-3' long, the upper surface green and pubescent or subglabrous.
— From the Rocky Mts. of British America to New Mexico and
Northern Nevada ; Ft. Vancouver (Alvord).
10. P.effusa, Dougl. Tomentose throughout, with scattered vil-
lous hairs; stems ascending, 4- 12' high, diffusely branched above;
stipules lanceolate, entire or incised; leaflets 5-11, interruptedly pin-
nate, the alternate ones often smaller, cuneate-oblong, coarsely incised-
serrate or dentate, the smaller leaflets 3 - 5-toothed ; pedicels slender ;
sepals and the much smaller bractlets acuminate, 2-3" long, equalling
or exceeding the obcordate petals ; carpels 10. — Saskatchewan
(Douglas) ; Rocky Mts. of British America (Bourgeau), and Colorado
(Nuttall ; Porter ; Gray). Scarcely more than a form of the last.
11. P. crinita, Gray. Appressed silky- villous, not at all tomentose ;
stems decumbent, 1° long ; stipules lanceolate, entire ; leaflets 9 - 15,
mostly folded and falcately recurved, y long, cuneate-oblong, obtuse,
coarsely serrate, villous beneath, scarcely so or glabrous above ; cyme
loosely paniculate ; sepals acute, nearly 3" long, the bractlets a little
shorter ; petals obovate, retuse, exceeding the calyx ; carpels 25-30.
