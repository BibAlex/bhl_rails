propriated from the Rumford Fund for beginning the publi-
cation of Count Rurnford's works.
Mr. Charles J. Sprague was elected Treasurer.
The Treasurer's report was received from the Auditing
Committee and ordered to be entered on the Records.
On the motion of Professor Rogers it was voted, " That the
thanks of the Academy be presented to Mr. John C. Lee, for

names which in various degrees have been familiar to the world of
science and letters for nearly half a century, and of which more than

marking eras in progress and laying the foundations of new sciences.
Of the entire list of members deceased within the year, it is perhaps
worthy of note that all except three, Professor Jewett, Dr. Warren,
and Francis Peabody, had reached quite an advanced age. Two of
the number, Dr. James Jackson and President Day, had attained re-
spectively to ninety and ninety-four years ; five, viz. Brewster, Mitter-
