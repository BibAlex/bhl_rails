ing, 1-2° long, often not succulent, leafy ; pubescence silky, rather
thin, short and appressed, or villous and spreading, especially about the
linear stipules; leaflets 5-8, oblanceolate or cuneate-oblong, |— ■ 1'
long, acute, the petioles sometimes twice longer ; raceme short ; bracts
setaceous, exceeding the calyx; flowers blue or violet, with more or less
yellow, verticillate or scattered, on pedicels 2 - 3" long ; calyx large,
with small bractlets, upper lip 2-toothed ; petals equal, 6" long, keel
ciliate; ovules and seeds 10-12; pod 14/ long. — Near the coast,
from Washington Territory to San Francisco. Douglas was probably
mistaken in saying that the root is eaten by the Indians.

twice longer than the leaflets ; racemes loose ; bracts mostly de-
ciduous ; flowers large, not yellow ; ovules 6-7, rarely fewer ;
leaflets smooth above.
12. L. perennis, L. Stems 1-2° high, from subten-anean root-
stocks ; pubescence minute, appressed, with some longer hairs ; stipules
setaceous, deciduous; leaflets 7-11, obovate to oblong, 1-2' long,
obtuse and mucronulate, or obtusish ; raceme ^-1° long ; bracts subu-
late, usually shorter than the calyx ; flowers purplish or rarely white,
scattered or subverticillate ; pedicels slender, 2-4" long; bractlets
small ; upper calyx-lip shortly toothed, the lower subentire ; petals
equal or the banner shorter, % - 1" long, the keel ciliate ; pod 1^' long,
4" wide, 5 - 6-seeded. — Sandy soils ; Northern States and " Canada "
to Wisconsin, and southward to the Gulf ; Valley of the Platte (En-

Var. occidentalis. Stem and petioles more villous. — Michigan
and Wisconsin.
13. L. Nottallii. {L. gracilis, Nutt., not Agh.) Low and more

sistent, elongated, setaceous ; upper lip of the calyx more deeply
toothed ; flowers smaller, 4 - 5" long ; ovules 4 - 6 ; pod 1' long,
3" wide. — Georgia, Florida, and westward to Mississippi.
14. L. arcticus. Villous or subglabrous ; stems rather stout, 1°
high or less, erect or ascending, simple ; stipules conspicuous, acumi-
nate ; leaflets 6-8, cuneate-oblong or oblanceolate., 1 — 1^' long, acute
