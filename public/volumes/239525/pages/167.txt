240 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY
years lafer, when Niebuhr arrived there as Prussian ambassador, he
found Overbeck and other young artists, who were then laying the
foundations of the new school of painting in Germany, divided into
two parties, professing utterly opposed principles. These were the
Nazarenes, so called from their mode of life and their austerity of
demeanor, whose leaders, Overbeck, Wilhelm, Schadow, and Veit, late
converts to Romanism, looked upon art as the servant of religion,
and lived like monks in the old convent of San Isidoro, preparing then-
simple meals in the kitchen of the convent ; and the Pagans, as they
might have been denominated, who were devout adoi'ers of the antique.
This latter party numbered Thorwaldsen, Koch, and Schlick in its
ranks. Cornelius stood midway between the two parties, but his dis-
like of the proselytism which was practised by the Nazarenes rather
impelled him in the opposite direction ; and, although a Catholic,
he openly said that when they made their first convert he would
become a Protestant.
Niebuhr tells us that the Catholicism of Cornelius was at bottom
nothing more than the creed of the old Protestants, " thanks to the
training which he had received from a pious, though by no means big-
oted mother " ; but Overbeck, he adds, " is, on the contrary, an enthusi-
ast, and quite illiberal ; he is a very amiable man and endowed with a
magnificent imagination, but incapable by nature of standing alone,
and by no means so clear-headed as he is practical."
In the society of such men as Niebuhr, Bunsen, and Brandis these
artists met on the most friendly terms, though certain topics (teste
Niebuhr) were necessarily excluded from conversation on account of
the Catholicism of Overbeck and Schadow.
A few years after Overbeck had settled at Rome, the Prussian
Consul-General, Salomm Bartholdy (Mendelssohn's uncle), proposed
to him, together with Veit, Schadow, and Cornelius, to decorate with
frescos a room in the Palazzo Zuccheri, where he resided, offering
himself to meet all material expenses. Thus these young and ardent
spirits were enabled to carry out their long-cherished project of reviv-
ing an almost forgotten art in the very city where its greatest master-
pieces had been executed, nearly three centuries before, by the hands
of Raphael and Michael Angelo.
The history of Joseph was selected for treatment, and Overbeck
painted the episode of Joseph sold by his brethren to the Ishmaelites.
In this, his first important work, the young artist displayed his life-
