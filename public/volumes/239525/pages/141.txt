± 1, it indicates that the two corresponding values of tan o- are imagi-
nary. The ambiguity in the determination of o- from its tangent is to
be removed by taking it in that quadrant which permits the equation
sin 2 a = 2 c sin (o- -\- /3)
to be satisfied.
Although all these roots will satisfy the equations with which we
began this discussion, yet they do not all necessarily belong to the
problem. The reason of this is, that the three equations are not a
complete statement of all the conditions of the problem. If we denote
by A the distance of the body, whose orbit we are determining, from
the earth, we shall have
A_j = r cos ( X o — v — A_i) + -R-i cos (X_ x — L_{),
A = r cos (xo — Xo) + ^o cos (X — L ),
A x =r cos ( X o + 7 — *i) + -#i cos ( x i — A)-
The conditions of the problem demand that A_ x , A and A x shall be
essentially positive. Hence, if any system of values of r, xo and rj ren-
ders any of these quantities negative, it must be rejected. These re-
jected solutions really belong to the problem when one or more of the
quantities X_ x , X and X 2 are increased by 180°. In fact, on referring
to the equations with which we started, we see they are not altered
when any one of the quantities X is increased by 180°. The geometri-
cal statement of the problem is more comprehensive than the applica-
tion of it to the discovery of the elements of circular orbits. Instead
of the above criteria for the rejection of solutions not applicable, the
following, which is simpler, may be used, viz. that x always must lie
in the angle between L -\- 180° and X which is less than 180°.
This example is added for the sake of illustration : —
