When $ is impossible in Case II., the formulas of Case III. must
be used; and the upper or lower member of the double sign in the
second equation must be taken according as sin 2 /3 is positive or nega-
tive ; in order that sin 2 /x may have the same sign with sin 2 fi. All
the auxiliary angles (f>, \^, and fi may be taken between the limits
± 90°. Since sin 2 fi sin 2 /x is always positive, tan fi tan fi and tan
fi cot fi are so likewise, since they are respectively equivalent to
sin 2 fi sin 2 /u sin 2 /3 sin 2 /a

Let us take two auxiliary angles 6 and ff, determined by the equa-
tions

or by the equations

and 2 5 and 2 ff may also be taken within the limits ± 90°. The four
values of x or tan a are then
tan a = tan* /3 tan' ^ tan #,
tan a = tan* /3 tan* /x cot 0,
tan o- = tan* fi cot* /x tan ff,
tan o- = tan* fi cot* /i cot ff.
