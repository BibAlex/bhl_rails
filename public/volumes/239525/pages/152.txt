Professor Joseph Winlock exhibited a photograph of the
sun taken with a lens of forty feet focus, and four inches
aperture. As it is difficult to place a tube of this length in
an inclined position, it is laid horizontally, and an image of the
sun is reflected into it by a plane mirror of unsilvered glass.
When this mirror was blackened on one side, it became heated
to such an extent as to shorten the focus of the lens nearly
three feet. The image obtained is about four inches in diame-
ter, and is free from the distortion produced by an eye-piece.
The exposure is instantaneous, and is effected by passing a
diaphragm with a slit in it between the lens and mirror. A
better effect is thus obtained than by the usual method of
placing it near the plate-holder. The lens, which was made by
Messrs. Clark and Sons, is not achromatic, as its slight curva-
ture rendered this unnecessary. It was corrected for spheri-
cal aberration by means of an artificial star, produced by a
soda flame, and a collimator, of an aperture somewhat greater
than that of the lens.
