D (z°) D (x-)
Since ^ is a function of z only, and ^ a function of x only,
Dz •" Dx ■"
while 2 and x are any two values of the independent variable (h being
arbitrary), the functional expression which constitutes either member
of equation [3] does not change its value with the independent vari-
able, hence " n — 2 x = c (a constant), [4]
or D(x 2 ) = 2x Dx + cDx. [5]
To determine the unknown constant c, we differentiate, by equation
[5], the identity
(m x) 2 == m 2 x 2 ,
obtaining 2mx-mDx-{-cmDx = m 2 2xDx-\-m 2 cDx,
or c m (1 — m) Dx = 0.
c = 0,
since m and D x have ai'bitrary values,
JD(x 2 ) = 2xDx. [a]
Equation [a] may also be deduced from [3] by the following method : —
In equation [3] not only are x and z entirely independent, since h is
D (z 2 )
arbitrary, but D x and D z are no longer restricted, for J. will not
change its value if we suppose Dz to have apy value greater or less
than D x. We may therefore put
z=z mx.
Introducing this value in [3], we obtain
D(m*x*) ' D(?*)
D (mx) D x

Whence, since m is arbitrary,
Dx
