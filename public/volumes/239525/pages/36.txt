OF ARTS AND SCIENCES : JUNE 9, 1868. 37
Hunt charges. He prized the recognition of academies and universities,
but not the insignia of rank. Without leisure for fashionable society,
he enjoyed preaching to the humble sect of Christians to which he be-
longed as much as lecturing before princes and nobles, either of birth
or of intellect, at the Royal Institution.
It is little to say of such a man that he was made a Fellow of the
Royal Society of London in 1824, a Corresponding Member of the
French Academy of Sciences in 1823, a Foreign Associate of this
Academy in 1844; that his name was eagerly sought to adorn the list
of honor of all other Academies in Europe and America ; that he re-
ceived from the Royal Society of London the Rumford, Copley, and
Royal medals ; that his simple life was made independent by a pension
of £300, conferred upon him in 1835 ; that Napoleon the exile was in-
structed by his lectures, and Napoleon the Emperor acknowledged the
obligation by naming him Commander of the Legion of Honor.
It is much to say of him that he declined all honors and rewards
which were foreign to his scientific character ; that, when he might
have amassed a fortune of £ 150,000 by applying old discoveries to
commercial uses, he preferred to concentrate his whole mind on the
discovery of new truth, dying poor, and leaving a widow dependent on
a small pension, which, in noble imitation of his example, she refused
to have increased ; that he ruled a strong nature so as to be always
gentle, and only impatient of those who unnecessarily wasted his time ;
that he was as much exalted above others in modesty as in intellectual
greatness ; that he made science honorable and attractive ; that he
ruled with an imperial sway the hearts no less than the intellects of
his generation, and that his final departure from the laboratory in the
Royal Institution of Great Britain on the 20th of June, 1862, was
followed by one universal pang of grief throughout the world of
science.
Long and loudly and perseveringly had Faraday knocked at the
secret gates of nature, and most encouraging were the responses which,
from time to time, he had received. Nevertheless, he finds it in his
heart to say : " I have never seen anything incompatible between those
things of man which can be known by the spirit of man which is
within him and those higher things concerning his future which he
cannot know by that spirit."
Faraday, with a wise precaution, which consulted the convenience
of others no less than his own reputation, made a timely collection of
