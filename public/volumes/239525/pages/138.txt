or, rejecting the useless factor \ — a,
X" 3 + a b 2 = 0,
whence
x" = - vTb 2 ,
and by interchanging a and b,
y" = - f^.
And thus the length of the normal
y/ tf - a) 2 + (/ - b) 2 = [(a + ^Tb 2 ) 2 + (b + ^b) 2 ] 1
= [a3 -j- baj2.
Consequently,
if a 3 _j_ b? <^ 1, there will be four real roots ;
" a f -4_ bf = 1, there will be four, and two will be equal ;
« a3 _|_ bs ^> 1, there will be only two real roots.
We will now show how to arrive at a direct solution of the problem
by the employment of trigonometric formulas. If tan <r is taken for
the unknown quantity, the equation, on which the solution of the prob-
lem depends, is
[c cos /3 tan <r -\- c sin /3] 2 (1 -f" ta n 2 o-) = tan 2 o-,
or if we put tan a- = x>
(x + tan^( x 2 +l)=^,
or, expanded,
x < + 2 tan /3. x 3 + ^=^ x 2 + 2 tan /3. x + tan 2 /3 = 0.
A quantity p may be assumed, such that this biquadratic shall be
resolved into the two quadratics
„ . _ sin a cos (/3 -4- w) , a , A
y -+- 2 — „ y -4- tan |8 tan u = 0,
x ~ cos cos 2 /i A ' M r
„ _ cos u sin (/3 — u) . _ - . A
y 2 4- 2 — — y -4- tan /3 cot u = 0.
x ~ cos /3 cos 2 /* * ' M ^
That this is possible will be evident on multiplying the left-hand
members of these equations together, for after some reductions easy to
make, all the coefficients, with the exception of that of y 2 , will be found
