presently a little liquid lava would ooze forth, and the flow would
detach itself, sinking at its outer margin, or seeming to be hurried
obliquely downwards under the molten mass. In this manner floe after
floe was hurried out of sight, until the molten portion had all around
gained the bank.
Professor N. S. Shaler spoke of tlie effect of changes in the
temperature of the moon's surface. Mr. Harrison has shown
that this amounts to about 960° F., or from — 100° to 840°,
assuming the specific heat equal to that of quartz. The effect
of such a change on a level plain like the Mare Humorum would
be to alter its length half a mile. He proposed to detect such
changes by accurate measurements of known points on the
moon's surface. So great a variation in temperature would
account for the observed alterations of color which have been
ascribed to a rapid growth of vegetation.
Professor Benjamin Peirce suggested that these changes in
position could be best measured on Mr. Rutherford's photo-
graphs of the moon, points near the centre of the disk being
selected and measured during the first and last quarter.
Professor E. C. Pickering expressed a doubt whether this
method would possess sufficient delicacy, as a variation of one
mile would equal only about a second of arc, and the measure-
ments would be complicated by libration, and all the consider-
ations which render so uncertain the moon's diameter.
Professor Benjamin Peirce referred to the Coast Survey
steamer now preparing to go to the Pacific for scientific pur-
poses. With a capacity of 350 tons it can make 200 miles a
day, while burning less than three tons of coal. Therefore, it
can carry enough of the latter for a voyage of 8000 miles.
The statement of Dr. Lardner, that no steamer under 500 tons
could cross the Atlantic by steam alone, is thus completely dis-
proved, as this vessel could easily make the trip and return
without recoaling.
