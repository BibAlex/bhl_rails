430 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY
Among the Moreton Bay aborigines the names in use are for the
males Derwain, Bandur, Barang, Bundur, with the additional syllable
gun or un for the females.
At Wide Bay five names are in use, namely, —
Bundar. Derwain. Balkoin. Tandor. Barang.
But it is not clear from Mr. Ridley's paper whether these names are
written in their proper order ; nor are we informed whether any two
of them are common to one class. If they be all distinct from one an-
other, there must be a fifth class.
This is the substance of the information supplied to me by Mr.
Ridley.
Note. — Reasoning from the analysis furnished by the systems
prevailing among other savage races, which systems have been thor-
oughly examined and ascertained, we may fairly conclude that the
various names given in Mr. Ridley's paper are classificatory, and that
they represent certain degrees of kinship. Thus, that
Kubbi is in theory the brother of every Kubbi of the same generation.
Kapota " " sister " « Kubbi " " "
Taking this for granted, and ignoring for the present the privilege
granted to Ippai of marrying Ippata as well as Kapota, — the varia-
tions caused thereby being kept for subsequent investigation, — the
characteristic peculiarities of the Tamilian system, which is the Fijian
also, are proved to exist among the Australian aborigines.
For the sake of convenience, I state these characteristics as seven
different propositions.
I. Tamilian Characteristic*
I being male, the children of my brothers are my sons and daugh-
ters, while the children of my sisters are my nephews and nieces ;
but the grandchildren of my sisters, as well as those of my broth-
ers, are my grandchildren.
This is so in the Australian system also.
For, take any male Kubbi.
(a) I, being male, am Kubbi. My brother is Kubbi.
His son is Kumbo (B. 2).
But Kumbo is my son (B. 3).
