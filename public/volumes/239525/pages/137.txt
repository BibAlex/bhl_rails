There is a very simple geometrical construction of the roots of the
equation in a. Making cos o- = x> and sm v = V' tne values of x and
y are the co-ordinates of the intersections of the curves whose equa-
tions are
x 2 + f=h
(x~a)(j-b) = ab
Consequently, if we construct the equilateral hyperbola whose equa-
tion is
x y=±l,
and from a point on it, whose co-ordinates are
.1 a
y l = -
V ±ab'
• iab'
as centre, we describe a circle, whose radius is , and then draw
V/±ab
radii to the points of intersection of the curves, the angles made by these
radii with the x axis °f co-ordinates are the values of or. Since the
centre of the circle is on the hyperbola, there are at least two intersec-
tions, and thus the equation in o- has at least two real roots. The geo-
metrical construction readily affords the condition which a and b must
satisfy in order that there may be four real roots. The condition is,
that the length of the straight line drawn from the point a, b, on the hy-
perbola whose equation is
xy=ab
normal to the opposite branch, shall be less than unity. The equation
to the normal which passes through the point %", y" on this curve, is
x"(x-x")-y"(y-f) = o.
The condition that it passes through the point a, b, gives
X (X - a) - y" (y" - b) = 0,
X V" = a b.
If we multiply the first of these by x"% we get
X"*(X" — a) -ab(ab — b *") = 0,
