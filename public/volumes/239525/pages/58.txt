of alcohol and sulphuric acid before the precipitate ceased to redissolve
as fast as it formed.
In two other experiments where, instead of free sulphuric acid, 10
c. c. of the standard solution of sulphate of ammonium were mixed
with 10 c. c. of the citrate-of-ammonium solution, 30 c. c. of the
standard lead solution had to be added, in each case, before an)' per-
manent precipitate formed.
Didtrate of Ammonium (C 12 H G (NH 4 ) 2 14 ) was prepared in crys-
tals, and 22.6 grms. of the salt were dissolved in 500 c. c. of the 18%
alcohol. 25 c. c. of the solution were mixed with an equal volume of
the standard sulphuric acid, and the acetate-of-lead solution was
dropped into the mixture in the usual way. After the addition of 8
c. c. of the standard acetate of lead, a permanent precipitate was pro-
duced. These 8 c. c. contained 0.3032 grm. of acetate of lead, cor-
responding to 0.2424 grm. of sulphate of lead. The 25 c. c. of
dicitrate-of-ammonium solution contained 1.13 grms. of the dry salt.
Hence, 1 part of sulphate of lead was held dissolved for every 4.6617
parts of the dicitrate.
Tricitrate of Potassium. — 25 c. c. of a standard solution of ordi-
nary crystallized citrate of potassium, mixed with an equal volume of
the standard sulphuric acid, gave no permanent precipitate until 2 c. c.
of the solution of acetate of lead had been added to it.
Sugar. — A standard solution of cane sugar, mixed with an equal
volume of the sulphuric acid, gave a permanent precipitate, on the ad-
dition of the first drop of the acetate of lead.
These experiments show clearly that very considerable quantities of
sulphate of lead can be held in solution by weak alcohol charged with
various salts. It may, therefore, reasonably be inferred that wines
sometimes retain lead in solution, in consequence of this action of the
acids and salts peculiar to wine upon lead compounds ignorantly em-
ployed to correct acidity.
