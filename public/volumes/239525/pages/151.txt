rings. Of these the light takes advantage for producing a symmetrical
effect, just as in the formation of the rainbow it selects those individual
drops of moisture which serve its purpose, while the remainder of the
drops are inoperative. A piece of very delicately ground glass accom-
plishes the same result. In the atmosphere, the place of the lycopodium
powder is filled by the particles of moisture existing in the vesicular state ;
and the smaller these particles the larger will be the diameters of the
corona? which they produce. In this way these particles are proved to
vary between the .001 and the .002 of one inch in diameter.*
Corona? indicate the presence of the cumulus cloud ; but halos imply
the cirrus cloud, floating at great heights, and within the region of per-
petual congelation. For halos are seen even in the summer and in the
tropics. By revealing the incipient gathering of the cirrus cloud, they
may foretell the approach of a storm.
