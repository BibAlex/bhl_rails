Six hundred and twenty-fourth Meeting.
October 11, 1870. — Monthly Meeting.
The Corresponding Secretary in the chair.
The Corresponding Secretary read a letter from the Ameri-
can Oriental Society, thanking the Academy for the use of
their room.
Professor Joseph Winlock exhibited a contrivance for record-
ing the position of lines in the spectrum, especially adapted to
solar eclipses. A silver plate is attached to the telescope of a
spectroscope, and a graver to its stand. By a simple motion
the position of any line may be permanently recorded and
afterwards measured. The principal lines of the solar spec-
trum are first recorded, the plate is then moved slightly back-
wards, and a number of spectra may be drawn on the same
plate and compared with one another. Since the spider-lines
may be invisible on account of the darkness, a break is made
in the one which is vertical, and a spark from a Ruhmkorff coil
passed through it, thus giving a bright spot of light. He pro-
posed to apply this method of recording to determine the decli-
nation of a star in meridian instruments.
Mr. George W. Hill presented a paper on the determination
of the mass of Jupiter from its effect on the asteroids. Those
are selected whose time of revolution is nearly one half that
of Jupiter, and the perturbation thus produced is one of the
largest in the solar system.
Professor N. S. Shaler made a communication on the figure
of the continents of Mars, compared with those of the earth.
In both there is a tendency to point towards one pole, — those
of Mars to the north, of the Earth to the south.
Remarks on this subject were made by Professors Lovering,
Whitney, and Winlock.
Dr. E. H. Clark made a communication on hydrate of chlo-
ral, supplementary to one made by him three months or more
ago. He stated that physiological experiments on man and the
lower animals with this substance had shown it to possess a
