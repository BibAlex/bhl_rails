blue, subverticillate or scattered, on slender pedicels 2 - 3" long ; bract-
lets wanting or caducous ; calyx-lips short, the upper entire or slightly
toothed, the lower a little longer; petals 6-7" long, the banner
shorter, keel naked ; ovary slightly hairy, 5-7 ovuled. — Washington
Territory (Lyall) ; Vancouver's Island (C. B. Wood) ; Bear Lake
(Richardson) ; Polar Sea (Dean and Simpson) ; and probably all the
L. perennis reported from the Arctic coast.
c Leafy and branching, the petioles not longer than the leaflets ;
flowers large, subverticillate, yellow in L. Sabinii ; bracts decidu-
ous, shorter than the calyx (except in L. Sabinii and barbiger) ;
ovules 6-7, rarely 8.
15. L. Sabinii, Dougl. Erect, 2° high; pubescence short, ap-
pressed, silky ; stipules long, setaceous; leaflets 8-11, oblanceolate,
1 - 21' long, acute, silky both sides ; raceme 6 - 10' long, rather dense
and long-peduncled ; bracts linear-setaceous ; pedicels 3 - 4" long ; calyx
minutely bracteolate, upper lip shorter and shortly toothed, the lower
entire; petals equal, 7-8" long, the banner emarginate, naked, keel
ciliate; ovules 7. — Collected only by Douglas in the Blue Mountains,
Oregon.
16. L. albicaulis, Dougl. Ascending or erect, 1 - 2° high ; pubes-
cence variable, short and appressed or more or less villous and spread-
ing; stipules linear-setaceous, long or nearly obsolete; leaflets 5-9,
oblanceolate or oblong, 1 - 2' long, acute, pubescent both sides ; raceme'
4-12' long, short-peduncled; bracts subulate; pedicels 2-3" long;
calyx large, minutely bracteolate, lips nearly equal, the upper narrowed]
shortly 2-toothed, the lower subentire ; petals equal, 5-7" long, " blue-
violet" or often apparently rose-color or whitish ; banner acute, naked,
the margins adherent at the apex ; keel strongly falcate, naked ; ovules
5-7; pod 1-2' long, 4-5" wide, 3 - 6-seeded. — From the Columbia
to the Sacramento. No. 188 of Kellogg & Harford appears to belong
here, but is unusually smooth, the leaves distant and the lower on very
long, petioles.
Var. Bridgesii. The more villous form, with largest flowers and
densest racemes. — Near San Francisco.
17. L. Sitgreavii. Tall, 2° high or more, branched, puberulent,
and more or less silky-villous with spreading hairs ; stipules setaceous ;'
leaflets 7 - 9, glabrous above, oblanceolate, acute, 1-3" long ; raceme
short-peduncled ; upper lip of the calyx short and rather broad, shortly
