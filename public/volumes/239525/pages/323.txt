Again, in [4], putting n = -, q and p being positive integers,
p C 1 = C q = q ;
p
whence O n = -. [6~\
p x
Again, in [3], making m =±= o,
C = o,
and, making m = — n, C n = — C n ,
or, making n = -, 0„ = — -• l~71
From [6] and [7] we have generally
O m = m,
and substituting this value of C m in [1],
D (x m ) =' m x" 1 - 1 D x. [c]
The Differential of the Logarithmic Function.
Let z = mx, then will Dz = m Dx, [1]
and log z = log m -\- log x, and D (log z) =Z> (log x). . [2]
Dividing [2] by [1],
D (log z) D (log x) x D (log. z)

B denotes a constant depending upon the base of the system of
logarithms. Denoting by b this base, and by log 6 a corresponding
logarithm, we have
D (log b x) = ^, [4]
and by similar notation D (log a x) = .
A relation between A and i? is found by differentiating the identical
equation log a x = log a b log b x,

thus obtaining = log a o • ,
whence A = B • log a b = log a S B ;
