It is recommended to the Academy to substitute for the first
four lines of Section 2 in Chapter IX. of the Statutes the following^
viz. : —
Candidates for election as Resident Fellows must be proposed by
two or more Resident Fellows in a recommendation signed by them,
specifying the section for which they are proposed ; which recommen-
dation shall be read at a meeting and thereupon referred to the Council
for nomination. No person recommended shall be reported by the
Council as a candidate for election unless he shall have received a
written approval authorized and signed, at a meeting of the Council,
by at least seven of its members, to be reported to the Academy at a
stated meeting. No ballot shall be held on a nomination by the Coun-
cil until the stated meeting next after such nomination has been re-
ported to the Academy.
It was moved by Mr. Edmund Quincy that the report be ac-
cepted and placed on file, in order that the amendment might
be acted upon after the proper interval.
The Academy elected Wilhelm Hofmeister, of Heidelberg, a
Foreign Honorary Member in Class II., Section 2 (Botany), in
place of the late Hugo von Mohl, of Tubingen.
On the motion of Mr. Quincy, the hall of the Academy was
tendered to the Massachusetts Historical Society for Thursday
