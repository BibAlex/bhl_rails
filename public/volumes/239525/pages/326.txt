and x and tan x, starting together from zero, tan x would be less than
x for these values, which again is impossible ;

Introducing this value of c in [4] [5] and [6] we obtain

The President communicated the following letter : —
Cordoba, November 7, 1872.
To the President of the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences.
Dear Sir, — Upon my departure from home on the undertaking in
which I am at present engaged, the Academy had the goodness to aid
my plans materially by appropriating the sum of $ 500 in gold from the
Rumford Fund for the purpose of supplying me with a star spectroscope
and astronomical photometer, — with permission to transfer them at
the same price to the Argentine government for permanent use in this
hemisphere, in case that the means for their purchase by the National
Observatory should become available.
The instruments were ordered without delay, and are now in my
possession, in good order. But the numerous delays arising from the
German war of 1870 postponed both the construction and the transpor-
tation of the apparatus ; and the instruments did not reach Cordoba
until all my energies had been so severely tasked in other directions as
to preclude me from undertaking any spectroscopic or photometric
observations for the present.
I had hoped to offer to the Academy some results obtained with
these instruments, in recognition of the valuable aid so opportunely
and ^generously afforded ; and I do not yet relinquish the hope of so
doing at some future time. Meanwhile I have the satisfaction of being
able to announce that the funds have been provided for the acqui-
sition of these instruments by the observatory, and have the honor of
transmitting them herewith to the Academy, with my cordial thanks.
It may have some interest for the Academy to know that, in the two
years which have elapsed since my arrival in Cordoba, the observa-
