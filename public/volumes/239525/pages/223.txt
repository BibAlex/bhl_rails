Professor Winlock made a communication on a method of
viewing, with the spectroscope, the whole sun at once, with the
protuberances. He used a telescope of six inches focal length,
giving an image of the sun about gV °f an mcn m diameter.
The centre of this image was eclipsed by a small brass pin in
a plate of glass, which replaced the slit. A thin annulus was
thus received into the collimator of the spectroscope. He next
tried a simple spot of silver on the glass, also silvering the
latter, and cutting a circle in it. The image thus formed
should be magnified with a telescope of considerable power
after dispersion by the prisms. By using silvered specula and
a heliostat, it would be found practicable to employ a spectro-
scope of very high dispersive power.
