Octavius Pickering was born in Wilkesbarre, Pennsylvania, Sep-
tember 2, 1791, where his father resided six years, having removed
thither from Philadelphia, to which city he returned in 1792. In 1801
his father came back to Massachusetts, and settled near Salem. Octa-

1806, and was graduated in 1810. He studied law in the office of his

his removal to Boston, in which city and in Cambridge he lived the
remainder of his life, excepting an absence of seven years in Europe,
mostly spent in England and France. He died in Boston, October
29, 1868.

eighteen years, during which time, and subsequently, he was employed
in making and publishing his reports.

Secretary of War and of State, a member of each house of Congress,
