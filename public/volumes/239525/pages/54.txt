On the Simultaneous Occurrence of a Soluble Lead Salt and
free Sulphuric Acid in Sherry Wine ; ivith Observations on
the Solvent Action of Alcoholic Saline Solutions upon Sul-
phate of Lead.
Several years since, I was called upon by a wine-merchant of this
city to examine a sample of pale sherry taken from a cask which had
been returned to him, on the certificate of a chemist that the wine con-
tained lead. The sample in question was perfectly transparent and
clear. There was nothing in the appearance or taste of the wine to in-
dicate the sophistication to which it had really been subjected.
On submitting this sherry to chemical analysis, I found not only that
it held in solution a considerable proportion of lead, but also a decided
trace of free sulphuric acid, besides an abundance of the same acid
combined with some alkaline base. When a portion of the wine was
evaporated in contact with slips of paper, the latter soon became
crumbly and friable.
Regarded merely from the chemical point of view, without reference
to its manifest bearing upon questions of hygiene and jurisprudence,
the simultaneous occurrence of a lead salt and of free sulphuric acid in
