lignite, with copper and iron sulphide. This was operated for-
copper. After these are sandstones with concretions. We have
reached the end of our coast section.
Ari«aig Fossiliferous Series;
Owing ta the difficulties connected with correlation, I have
subdivided this series alphabetically, at the same time giving
their supposed British or American equivalents. (Vide "Geology
of Arisaig, Nova Scotia,"'Quarterly Journal of Geological Society,
1864, and Papers in the Transactions of the Nova Scotian Insti-
tute of Natural Science.)
A, Mayhill sandstone, Eng. ; B, and B', Clinton, Am.; C, and
C, Aymestry limestone, Eng.; Niagara limest(jne, Am.; D, Upper
Ludlow, Eng.; E, Ludlow tilestone, Eng.
The fossiliferous strata have the greatest width, to south of
Arisaig Pier, where the west branch of Doctor's Brook enters the
"Arisaig Mountains." The width is about a mile.
In Geology of Antigonish. County, Trans. I. N. S., 1875, I have
sh.ew:n the relation af the fossiliferous series to the two non-fos-
siliferous of the Arisaig Mountains, thus, by a collatioji of four
sections at right ajigles (south) of the coast section, I will give^
the results, beginning with McNeil's and McDougall's Mountains.
The elevation of one is 1010 feet; of the other 1000. — ^Bayfield..
