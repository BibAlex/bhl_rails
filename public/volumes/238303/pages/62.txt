acquaintance. Their occurrence between two sets of granites
would doubtless be perplexing to any one but myself, who am
the only one that has investigated its true relation to the asso-
ciate granites. These are thus divided into two by their inter-
vention. The second granites in great force cross easterly, and
are beautifully exposed on the Sandford Fleming road and
property, and also in the N. W. Arm section. In the latter they
are seen in junction with the gneissoid (ferruginous) rocks, as
well as in the heights which intervene between the road and
section. In this locality pieces of gneissoid rocks are also seen
imbedded in the granite in like manner as at Nictaux. From
this one might be led to infer the existence of the gneissoid rocks
prioi' to that of the granites, as has been done in the case of the
Nictaux gneissoids. Here, as at Nictaux, we attribute the
phenomena to re-metamorphism of the granite during the meta-
morphism of the stratified rocks. In the section on the arm we
find argillites succeeding the granites and gneissoids. In these
I found numerous crystals of chiastolite. These are prismatic,
and of considerable size, larger than the Falkland and York
Redoubt andalusite crystals. The granites appear on the
side of the road, opposite Melville Island, and then retreat
into the elevated and woody region to re-appear on the St.
Margaret's Bay road, at the Water works. Here, again, they are
seen in junction with the gneissoid. They again retreat, and
after proceeding onward, advance to Birch Cove, on Bedford
Basin, where they are quarried for ornamental purposes. Their
mode of occurrence in Hammond's Plains is well described by Mr.
Hare. For information regarding their junction with the strati-
fied Cambrian rocks, I would refer to his paper. Transactions
