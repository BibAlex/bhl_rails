"Our Glacial Phoblem." By Rev. D. Honeymajt,
D. C. L., F. R. S. C, Hon. F. S. Sc.
(Paper read before the American Institiite of Mining Engineers, Halifax, Sept. 15, 1885.)
Abstract.
A con.sideiable part of the Introduction contained matter pub-
lished in the Transactions of the In.stitute of Natural Science
from 187G to 1884.
When observations were made at Rimouski, in 1883, it was
considered that we had reached the "Ne plus ultra" in that
direction. On tny woi'king chart I had extended my " Halifax
hypothetical line," which passed to the east of Rimouski, to the
northern extremity, — lat. 52 deg., 50 min.; long. 75 deg., 45 min.
The reports of the Hudson Bay expedition of 1884, by Lieut.
Gordon, R. N., commander, and Dr. Bell, geologist, with illustra-
tive charts, blue books, and reports of progress of Geological
Survey of Canada, have furnished us with important observa-
tions by which we are enabled to extend our investigations, to
existing glacial regions. Seven stations are repoi'ted as having
glaciation with a south easterly course. Two of these, — viz.
Marble Island, in the N. W. of Hudson Bay, and Nottingham
Island, at the mouth of Fox's Channel— having, respectively,
S. 20 E., and S. 30 E., (magnetic) courses attracted attention
from their resemblance to leading Nova Scotia course.s. This led
me to extend my working chart so as to include these and the
other five stations in Hudson Strait and '.he Atlantic coast. My
chart, which was used in the illustration of this paper was thus
six times the size of Lieut. Gordon's chart, being 9x6 feet.
Extending my Halifax and Rimouski, Hijpotli.etical line, which
was S. 20 E., N. 20 W., magnetic, it runs through Hud-
!5on's Bay, east of Marble Island, and west of Nottingham Island.
I also extended my Antigonish and George's Bay hypothetical
line.— (Fi(?e Trans. 1883, page 35.) This also runs S. 20 E., N.
