Dalhousie College Museum contains a very rare pair of birds,^
which have now become extinct, the Pied, or Labradoi-, Duck.
They were presented by the Rev. Dr. MacCuiloch, of Truro, with
his late brother's collection. Attached to them was this label — ■'
Family, Anatina ; Brisson, Genus ; Fulizula ; Fulizula Labradora.
Lath. Pied Duck. Male and Female. Very rare.
Audubon's description of this bird is given in Vol. 7, page 40,
as follows: " Although ^no birds of this species occurred to me"
when I was in Labrador, my son, John Woodhouse, and the
young friends who accompanied him on the 2Sth of July, 1833,
to Blanc Sablon, found, placed on the top of the low tangled fir
bushes, several deserted nests, which, from the report, of the
English clerk of the fishing establishment there, we learned to
belong to the Pied Duck. They had much the appearance of
those of the Eider Duck, b'eino- very laroe, formed externally of
Jir twigs, internally of dried grass, and lined with down. It
would thus seem that the Pied Duck breeds earlier than most of
its tribe. It is surprising that this species is not mentioned by
Dr. Richardson in the Fauna Boreali Americana, as it is a very
hardy bird, and is met with along the coasts of Nova Scotia,
Maine, and Massachusetts, durinsf the most severe cold of winter.
My friend Professor MacCuiloch, of Pictou, has procured several
in his immediate neighboui-hood ; and the Honorable Daniel
Webster, of Boston, sent me a fine pair killed by himself, on the
Vineyard Islands, on the coast of Massachusetts, from which I
made the drawing for the plate before you. The female has not,
I believe, been hitherto figured ; yet the represented was not an
old bird. '
