side there is a line of mucous sacs. The vent is two inches from
the caudal extremity. It is blind. "The eight barbels, or cirri,
are, there is no doubt, delicate organs of touch, by which the
myxine obtains cognizance of the nature and quality of the
substances with which they are in contact, and the single-hooked
tooth on the palate enables it to retain its hold until the double
row of lingual teeth are brought into action to aid the desire to
obtain a good meal. Distribution. "Polar Regions to Cape

"They are marine fishes, with a similar distribution as the
Oadidae, being most plentiful in the higher latitudes of the
temperate zones of the northern and southern hemispheres.
They are frequently found buried in the abdominal cavity of
other fishes, especially gadoids, into which they penetrate to
feed on their flesh. They secrete a thick gelatinous slime in
incredible quantities, and are therefore considered by fishermen
a great nuisance, seriously dauiaging the fisheries, and interfering
with the fishing in localities where they abound.
Myxine descends to a depth of 345 fathoms, and is generally
met with in the Norwegian Fjords at 70 fathoms, sometimes in
great abundance," — Qunther.
PAL^ONTOLOGICAL,
Some zoologists and palaeontologists consider that myxine, on
account of its low organization and habits, must have been
among the first fishes that appeared in our world, and that its
lingual teeth, as the only parts that could survive, may yet be
found in Silurian or Devonian strata.
