itself, and a phenomena so varied that there is work here for
us all.
But not only does this Island invite our attention in the
interests of science, but demands our attention in the interests
of humanity.
Situated directly in the pathway of commerce, — enshrouded
for weeks together by impenetrable fog — encircled by eddies and
currents of the most erratic character — its dangerous and ever-
shifting sand-bars, together with its terrible record of disasters,
