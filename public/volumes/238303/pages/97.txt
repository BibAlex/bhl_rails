The direction of the strike and the year when taken, were
obtained through Mr. Carman of the Public Works and Mines
Office. Some of the courses of the stride were taken by myself,
others by parties to whom I have applied in the present year.
The bearino; is magnetic.
The unmistakable traces which are so marked shew that vast
glaciers must have once existed here, or, that these markings
are due, as Dr. Dawson in his Acadian Geology seems to favour, to
the abrasion of the rocks by icebergs coming from the direction
of the sea. We have the carefully prepared and almost conclusive
reasons given by Dr. Dawson on the glaciers and icebergs of the
Post Pliocene period, published in 1868 ; but we have other
authority on glacier action by equally active observers, such as
Professor Tyndall and others. In examining the evidences which
are illustrated by markings or striation running in the same
general direction in Nova Scotia, and other phenomena which
they suggest, it is not easy to assume any definite conclusion
respecting this theory or that. Whilst quoting such authority
let us approach this subject gradually.
Professor Tyndall, after discussing snow-crystals and regelation
in his work "^ Heat as a mode of motion/' discourses from actual
observations of his own among the Alps, as well as from the
records of other writers on the glacial action now going on in the
Himalayas, the Andes and many other snow-laden mountains i
and propounds the theory that the scars, flutings and furrowings
