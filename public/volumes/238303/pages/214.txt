remarks on the above.
1. Archaean of McNeil's Mountain does not appear to the west
of the Mountain. It stretches out northerly towards the shore
section so as to approach the Archaean of the section. A singular
syenitic porphyrite which occurs in the mountain is also seen ia
sections about | of a mile to the north ; occupying the space that
2, 3, 4, 5 Cambrian ? of McDougall's Mountain would occupy is
extended eastward. The latter (Cambrian ?) extends westward
beyond the county line.
6. Lower Silurian extends eastward and is parted into two
by the associate igneous diorites. One part passes to the north
of the 1 Syenitic, terminating, apparently, on the back of the
Malignant Cove and Brook, Sugar Loaf (mountain), constituting,,
with the igneous diorites, the rocks of the mountain. The other
part comes to the front in a prominence not far from the road
to McNeil's Mountain. After being much shattered, it terminates
like a red vein. With diorites the same red argillites extend
westward, suffering displacement or being faulted and conse-
quently thrown out of line and seems to terminate in a mountain
south of Arisaig Pier, unless certain red slates that occur to the
south of MsAra's Brook on the side of a branch of Bailey's
5.rook be the termination. This may be the western tern^ination.
