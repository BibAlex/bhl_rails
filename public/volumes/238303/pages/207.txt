The construction of a line of railway, which passes through
this County, has exposed interesting series of r'ocks which were
largely obscure. Geological investigations of cognate series in
other parts of the Province have, in turn, cleared up certain
doubts in reference to series in the County which are regarded
as "Typical." The examination of coirelated series elsewhere
have contributed somewhat in this direction. The application
of the microscope and polariscope to the study of the crystalline
rocks, besides i-evealing the character and constitution of the
rocks themselves, seem also to indicate relationship and age,
and thereby serve, in a maimer, to determine the relationship
of associated non-crystalline rocks. In some cases, too, compara-
tive palaeontology, without lithology, lends its aid in confirma-
tion of certain conclusions. These considerations have induced
me to make a revision of the Geology of Antigonish County.
In no other County has the geology been so fully investigated.
Parts, however, yet remains to be examined. I have wrought
in this field as an amateur or Provincial geologist, more or less,
durino- a quarter of a century, and yet corners remain un-
touched.
