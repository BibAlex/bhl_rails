238 FRESH WATER SPONGES OF NOVA SCOTIA — MACKAY.
ly known is a lake on Mount Everett, Berkeshire Co., Mass.,
U. S. A., 1800 or 2000 feet above the sea. The flesh spicules of
this species have been observed in the diatomaceons deposits of
the lakes which supply the city of Halifax with water. (See
slides 28, 29 and 30).
Genus III. — Heteromeyenia.
Statoblast birotules of two orders, one lonu', the other short.
0. H. Rytleri, Potts.
Rather massive with lobular protuberances. Long birotules,
with scattered spines on shaft and few incurved, nearly barb-
like, rays. Sh(jrt birotules, with small shaft enlarging towards
the lai'ge lineiy-toothed discs. (For structure and spiculation
see slides 31, 32 and 33). Very abundant in MacKay's Lake,
Pictou Co.
7. H. ar gyros per'ma, Potts.
Sessile, encrusting. Large birotules more than twice the size
of those of //. Ryderi, rays more hook-like. Small birotules
about half the length ; few rays irregularly hooked ; shaft with
stout scattered spines. Li Garden of Eden Lake, Pictou Co.,
and adjacent lakes.
8. H. Pidovensis, Potts.
Sponge light green, massive, encrusting; texture ver}^ com-
pact; spicules non-fasciculated, persistent; surface mostly smooth
and firm to the touch. Statoblasts very scarce, spherical; crust
thick.
Skeleton spicules cylindrical, short, robust, rounded or abi'uptly
terminated; entirely spined, — spines conical at the centre of the
spicule, elsewhere generally curving towards each extremity;
rounded terminations of spicules covered with short spines,
though frequently a single large spine or acute termination is
seen at one or both extremities.
Birotulates of the longer class surrounding the statoblasts,
rather numerous, one-half longer than the others; shafts con-
