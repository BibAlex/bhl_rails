102 NORTHERN LIMIT OF WILD GRAPE VINES â€” LAWSON.
west to Arkansas, has a globose depressed berrj', size of a pea,
blackish when ripe.
V. indimsa grows in the swamps of the Southern States, west
to Louisiana and Arkansas, bearing a very small, usually one-
seeded berry.
V. cestivalis, the Summei" Grape, grows from Connecticut to
Florida and west to Arkansas, ripening its blue, pleasantly-
flavoured berries in October ; original of the Clinton Grape.
V. vulpina, or Fox Grape of the South, grows in Virginia,
Florida, and intervening States.
V. incisa is a Prairie Plant confined apparently to Texas and
Arkansas, and has black shining berries the size of a small pea.
V. cordifolia and V. rij^aria, which are more northein in
their range, have acid fruit, which sweetens after having been
touched by frost, hence they are commonly calh^l Winter Grapes
to distinguish them from V. cestivalis, the fruit of which be-
comes sweet as it ripens in the sun. V. riparia is said to be
the original of the Delaware and Taylor-Bullet grapes,
V. Labrusca, is one of the best known species which has very
large leaves, and is familiar to us in its garden forms as the
Isabella, Catawba, and several other well-known American
grapes. Varieties of this species are distinguished by the hairi-
ness or woolly character of the very large leaf, and comparatively
large berries.
