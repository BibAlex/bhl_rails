Glacial Distkibution in Canada.

1. Triassic Amygdaloids (A) and Carboniferous Boidders. â€”
The author's investigations of glacial distribution in Canada began
in 1873. On the beach at Cow Bay, east of Halifax Harbour,
Nova Scotia, abundance of amygdaloid boulders were seen.
These were at once referred to Cape Blomidon, whose rocks are
Triassic basalts, amygdaloids, &c. Blomidon, or some part of its
rock extension to Five Islands, N. E., and Brier Island, is the only
series of rocks in Eastern Canada which could produce these
boulders. Red Head, on the east side of Cow Bay, was seen to be
the secondary source of the boulders. From this bluft' of drift
large and small amygdaloid boulders had just fallen. Here an
agate was found, and specimens of Blomidon zeolites. Great
masses of Cambrian quartzites had recently fallen, and were still
imbedded in drift. These were strikingly grooved and striated on
varj'ing sides. Rock surfaces had also been observed on our way
showing glaciation. Action and reaction were thus suggested.
A copy of the Admiralty Chart, on which Blomidon and Halifax
both appear, was procured. A very fine and extensive glaciated
expanse of Cambrian argillites at Pleasant Park, Halifax Harbour,
was located on this map. The direction of the glaciation and
grooves, S. 20 E., N. 20 W., was extended, and found to pass in
front of Blomidon. Deep grooves were seen having a south-east
termination, where the graver had evidently been fractured by
coming in contact with hard edges of tilted and crumpled strata,
the grooves terminating in small strioe, running in different direc-
tions and disappearing. These show that the glaciating agency
had evidently come from the N. W., the direction of Blomidon.
