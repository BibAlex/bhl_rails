4G ANALYSIS OF A PICTOU COAL SEAM — GILPIN.
found the purest coal, and that it gradually^ deteriorates each
way. The presence of "barren" intervals is of importance,
for much money has been spent in examining and proving these
marginal districts, when a step further might have resulted in
the discovery of workable beds.
The coal from this seam presents a finely-laminated appear-
ance, with a fail']}' bright lustre, and breaks I'eadily along the
deposition planes, which are of a dull black colour, and hold a
good deal of mineral charcoal. It is strong and forms little dust
or slack. The coal is divided by two cleavage planes, obliquely
inclined toward each other, causing it to break into vhomboidal
pieces. It is comparatively free from iron pyrites, which is
present in small nodules in several divisions of the seam.
The following proximate analyses were made by me on the
fresh mined coal carefully sampled as it came from the face.
The seam was divided into two portions, — the top comprising
34*4 inches, the lower 89"9 inches.

The ash from both divisions is the average of two determi-
nations, and is silicious, and of a light gray colour. The specific
gravity is from the average determined for each larger layer of
coal. The coal in each division did not coke by slow heating,
that from the lower division wg,s fairly coherent by fast heating.
It may be remarked that an opinion as to the economical coking-
values of coals formed on their action in the crucible cannot be
relied upon for a guide as to their yield in practical coking.
It will be noted that the percentage of ash in the top coal
