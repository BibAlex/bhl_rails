FRESH WATER SPONGES OF NOVA SCOTIA — MACKAY. 237
8. *S^. Mackayi, Carter.
Sessile, encrusting, with many large compound statoblasts
prominent through the thin layer of fiesh. Large geramules
12 inch in diameter consisting of about IG statoblasts, apei'tures
turned inward, supported by a mass of heavily spined acerate
spicules of various sizes, interci'ossing. Spines sometimes as
long as the spicule is broad, very irregular in size and situation,
skeletal spicules longer and all parts more slender. Described
by Carter, in the " Annals and Magazine of Natural History."
London, January, 1885. The species is not uncommon in Nova
Scotia lakes. Its spicules appear to exist in the diatomaceous
deposits of the lakes which supply the water system of Halifax ;
specimens of which we have received from Professor Lawson of
Dalhousie College. Carter has described similar spicules as
abundant in the diluvial deposits of the Altmidil Valley in
Bavaria. (See slides 24 and 25.) It is very near S. igloiforinis
of Potts.
Genus II. — Meyenia.
Statoblasts suirounded by minute birotulate spicules.
4. M. jiuviaiilis, Carter.
Massive encrusting, sometimes extensively' lobular. Birotulates
small and star-like, the shaft connecting the layed discs about
equal to diameter of rays.
Varieties of this species (with some adventitious spicules)
have been desci'ibed by Di*. G. M. Dawson in the Canadian
Naturalist of Sept., 187'', as »S'. stagnalis and S. asper-
rima. This species, like its old European comrade, S. lacustris,
is one of our most common sponges. (See slides 26 and 27).
5. M. Everetti, Mills.
Sessile, encrusting. Statoblast birotules 3 to 4 times longer
axially than those of M. fluviatilis, with the more numerous
rays incui-ved. Flesh spicules present as minute slender biro-
tules with incurved barb-like rays. Discovered for the second
time in the lakes of Pictou County. The only habitat previous-
