I PROPOSE to make a few observations upon certain fishes that
have been added to our Museum Collection during- las-t summer
(1885.)
Among- thes-e are specimens of the black rudder fish,
Palinurus perciformis, or Lirus perciformis. Last session I
directed attention to the specimens that I had previously added.
At the san>e time I mentioned that I had only seen two others.
I therefore concluded that they were rare fishes. I find that
this is not the case. During^ last summer they were very plenti-

into an aquarium and kept them alive for a few hours. I had
no difficulty in identifying them as the black rudder fish,
although they were certainly not black when living. On the
following morning they were dead. Then they were black as
they now appear, preserved in alcohol. Other specimens were
secured, so that they now do not appear as rare fish. I find from
the new work issued by the U. S. Fishery Commission that they
were found in abundance — in schools — ofi" our harbour, by G.
Brown Gfoode and his associates when they were at Halifax with
the Speedwell in 1877. It attains to the si2:e of 10 to 12 inches

Silver moon fish.
Selene argentea.
A fish having this name is mentioned and figured in the
work just referred to. The young of it is said, in one or two
instances .to have been found as far north as Halifax, Nova
Scotia. The specimen now presented is allied to those referred
to. It was found in our harbour. Another was previously
