of rocks, while that on the opposite side of the Basin was derived
from the geological foimation of the Cobequids and all the inter-
vening formations. — (Vide Geological Map and Papers read
before the Institute.)
Lumber Yard.
I would add to the accumulations of the "Cow Bay type" an
elevation in the Lumber Yard. On this are the remains of one
of the "old forts."
Connecting Lines.
A passes from Navy Lsland along the east si<le of the Basin to
the Narrows, near Dartmouth Railway Bridge. It then crosses
over to Richmond to Foit Needham. Proceeding it reaches the
Queen's Dock Yai-d, at the late Observatory Hill. It then ex-
tends to the east side of the Citadel Hill. Thence it goes to the
Lumber Yard, and then it passes to the Fort at the east side of
entrance to the N. W. Arm.
B begins at the west side of George's Island, which lies in the
harbour opposite the Lumber Yard. Thence it goes southerly to
the west side of Cornwallis Island (McNab's). Proceeding along
this Island it connects Thrum Cap and Shoal.
G may commence at the drift at the corner of Preston and
Lawrencetown roads. Thence it passes to the accumulation at
the top of Dartmouth Cove It then extends along the shore to
the neighbourhood of Fort Clarence at the Eastern Passage.
D may be called the Terminal Line. This may begin at the
accumulation at the old foi't (of A line), and pass across the
mouth of harbour to Thrum Cap. Thence it proceeds N. E. to
the eastern side of the Passage. It then extends along the shore,
to Cow Bay and Osborne Point. From this it extends to Law-
rencetown Head; from this to Half Island, and then to Three
Fathom Harbour.
The Triassic Amygdaloids from Blomidon and Partridge Island
which I regard as the prime characteristic of the drift of the
accumulation, etc., which I have thus connected, have their ex-
treme easterly points of occurrence at —
