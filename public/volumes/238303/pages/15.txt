of this rock shows the existence of Biotite, Hornblende and
crystals of a white feldspar. The polariscope shows the feldspar
to be trichroic. The colours run in parallels, and the crystals
shew beautiful striation.
4. Cranberry Point Diorite, — Macroscopically examined
this rock shows abundance of Biotite and Hornblende. The
Polariscope shews triclinic feldspar. This and the Porphyrite
of Sandy Point seem to be closely related, but different from the
Jebosfue Point Dolerite. These two seem to be intrusive, but
of a Lower Silurian age.
In considering the subject of the age of the gold-bearing
rocks, it is evident that these crystalline rocks must be
eliminated,
5. Yarmouth Harbour Rock. — This singular rock furnishes
a very interesting section. It is composed of a glassy, undeter-
mined mineral and hornblende. I have not been able to ascertain
the nature of the former by the polariscope ; portions of it seem
to be a glass. One of the green hornblendic patches has a
singularly pretty inclusion. In a small glassy area, bounded by
two straight sides and two curved, is a perfectly round glassy
inclusion. Turning the polarizer the inclusion darkens, until
space and inclusion become altogether black.
Sections of other crystalline rocks are under examination.
They will be the subjects of future notes.

Our specimens appear to differ in their mode of growth.
There is seemingly a vertical and a horizontal growth. Speci-
men No. 1 exhibits both. The upward growth developes into
branches, the horizontal increases the body by layers, forming
a limestone, having a concretionary and amorphous aspect.
