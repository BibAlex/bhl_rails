The first seam met is one on the west side of the River, and
it is stated to measure about 2 ft. 6 in. of coal. The nine feet
seam, so-called, had not been opened at the time of my visit,
and the thickness is that given by the man in charge of the
boring. The seam below this is exposed on the west bank of the
river, nearly on the line of the seam just referred to as being
nine feet thick.
The six feet seam was opened last winter by a short slope, and
about 50 tons of coal were extracted. It is stated to have in the
centre a band of shaley coal about 9 inches thick. I was unable
to verify the dimensions by actual measurement, as all the
openings were full of water at the time of my visit, but the
outcrop of the bed under the waters of the river apparently
confirmed them.
The coal looked unusually well for a crop exposure, and
samples selected to form an average gave the following results : —
Coal compact. Cleavage planes very obliquely inclined to
each other. Fractures of the coal presented a conchoidal and
lustrous appearance. The deposition planes showed a good deal
of mineral charcoal. The coal is laminated with numerous
bright pitchy layers up to one-half of an inch in thickness. A
few films of calc-spar showed in the cleavage planes, and there
was very little visible pyrites. Powder dark reddish brown.
