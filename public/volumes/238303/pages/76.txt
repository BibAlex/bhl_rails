NORTHERN LIMIT OF WILD GRAPE VINES — LAWSON. 105
miles further up the East River, he found the Grape growing
wild.
My dear Professor Laiuson, — In relation to your enquiry
respecting Wild Grapes, I have a recollection of past days that
may suggest a quarter in which that enquiry may be successfully
prosecuted.
Many j'ears ago I lent the late Judge Haliburton an interest-
ing book that I in vain have often endeavoured to recover.
Reclamation of it is hopeless now ! The author was a Netherlander

enquiry to some old inhabitant of the old French capital.
Yours ever truly,

family — about the close of the last century.
The discovery of the author would antedate the beginning of
this century.

There is little doubt, I think, that a copy of the book in
question is slumbering on the shelf of some Boston library. The

probably on authority of a redman — indicated phonetically
Niagara thus : — " Nee-a-gaw-raw."

Dear Sir, — A young Norwegian Captain just left here for
Spain, told me some of their professors were to visit our land, as
