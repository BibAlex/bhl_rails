298 THE eARBONIFEROUS OF CAPE BRETON â€” GILPIN.
The problem presented by the Carboniferous of the River Inhabi-.
tants is a difficult one, and complicated by the apparent anomaly
of part of the coal horizon being connected with gypsum and
limestone. Mr. Fletcher estimates the total thickness of the
Carboniferous rocks at 21,960 feet, which probably embraces
all the divisions already described in the Eastern district, and
the 1,350 feet of strata referred to by him as o.verlying the Little
River Coal Series (8,926 feet thick) may represent part of the
Upper Coal Division (No. 1) of Sir J. W. Dawson.
The measures of the district do not present features calling for
special notice, and the description of the various subdivisions of
the Eastern district may be applied here. Some of the sandstones
and shales of the River Inliabitants are little more than compact
saml and mud, while at other points they present the normal
hardness of the carboniferous strata.
Cut little is yet known about the extent and value of the-
Rivei' Inhabitants coal fields. A very considerable area of coal-
bearing strata is indicated by the widely-separated coal crops at
the mouth of the Rivei' and around the Basin. The paucity of
outcrops, coupled with the presence of several large faults ranging
through the district, have discouraged prospecting in the face of
a dull coal trade. In the future the advantage of an all- winter
shipping port, like that of Carri bacon Cove, will no doubt stimu-
late the development of coal mines here, when the export of coal
to the United States begins again.
In order not to unduly extend this paper, I will on another
occasion give a brief description of the carboniferous districts of
the Western shore of the Island, and of their coal fields, with
analyses of the coal and other economic minerals found in then)..
