:206 LOUISBURG — PAST AND PRESENT. — HONEYMAN.
•was reported that gold had been found in them. Gold had just
heen discovered in Nova Scotia. All were seeking for gold. It
was according to reports turning up everywhere. On our way
we had to traverse bogs and swamps, as the besiegers of Louis-
tburg had to do. Reaching the shore I found rocks similar to
those of Light-house Point. I presume that now we were
south-west of Rock Point. These too were reddish syenitic rocks
with broad green bands. Going along the shore to some dis-
tance we found these rocks extending onward. A beautiful
view of Louisburg was painted by Forshaw Day, and exhibited
£bt Exposition Universelle de Paiis, 18G7.
The admiralty charts give names to prominent Points —
■different from those of our old charts. «i:
North Cape is Light House Point
Black Cape " Black Rock Point
White Point " unchanged.
Careening Place " Careening Point. (The Railway terminus).
Kennington Cove is unchanged.
The end of the tongue of land on which the city stood is
called Roekford Point in charts dating 1780.
RELICS.
If Louisburg in its zenith somewhat resembled the City of
Paris in aspect, its existing state forcibly realizes our conceptions
of the modern aspect of certain renowned cities of antiquity,
against which, as against the City of Tyre, the edict went forth,
raze it, raze it, even " To the foundations thereof." The remains
are now regarded as relics to be treasured up in museums. Of
these we have a fair share, presented by various donors.
