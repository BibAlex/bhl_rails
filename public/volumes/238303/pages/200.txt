EXAMINATION OF CRYSTALLINE ROCKS â€” HONEYMAN. 301
These in the section with polarised li^jht are beautifully pleo-
chroie with radiating structure. The i-ock seems to be a mix-
ture of hornblende and feldspar.
No. 5 is dichroic with opaque portions. Magnetite ?
Other three sections are (1) of Arisaig Pier rock ; (2) of a Saw
Mill rock, in the mountains, and of Doctor's Brook, south of
Arisaig Pier; (3) of mountains west of the Saw Mill.
No 6. (1) section, of Arisaig Pier rock, an igneous rock of
Lower Carboniferous age, shows rock unindividualized with
kei-nels of calcite and magnetite.
No. 7. (3) unindividualized with magnetite grains. This is
apparently of Devonian age.
The examination of the Nos. 4, o, G, 7, is not so satisfactory as
of 1, 2 and 3.
