Art. I. â€” Paper by Wm. Gossip, Esq.
(Read Nov. 10, 1884.)
This ts a Paper alluded to in the latter part of Mr. Gossip's Report as one of the
Delegates of the Nova Scotia Institute, at Ottawa, May, 1883, and not read at
that Meeting of the Royal Societif.
It will be a consoling reflection to many whose years, like my
own, have fallen into the sear and yellow leaf, that they have
lived to witness in this young and growing Dominion the forma-

the grand discoveries of past ages and of the present time, and
dependent thereon, the progress of nations in population, wealth
and prosperity may concentrate, as examples and incentives
towards a diligent and industrious emulation in a further
patriotic course of public inprovement.
Much, however, will depend upon the direction that is given
to the impulse thus communicated. If it serve only to inflate
the mind with exaggerated ideas of personal importance, the
Royal Society ma\' become a distinguished ornament of the
Dominion, but much good may not be expected to flow from it in
a national point of view. In fact it might as well be dead. But
if the impulse spread itself, and be made to permeate the com-
munity with the usefulness which is undoubtedly a part of its
nature, it cannot fail to awaken the dormant or latent talent of
the country, and infuse amongst its enquiring minds the energy
of robust life and active research. The benefits derived will
then be great and manifold, commensurate with the utmost hope
and expectation entertained by the friends and well-wishers of
the Institution.
Nor is there any reason, in all that has yet been done on behalf
of the Royal Society, to anticipate aught else than a happy
result of its labours. Certainly it has rarely been on this side of
