Part I. Plants collected at Bloniidon, Bay of Fundy, King's
County, Nova Scotia.
A familiar feature in the physical geography of Nova Scotia
is the North Mountain, a table-topped ridge that runs for 80 miles
in a straight, unbroken line along the south-eastern shore of the
Bay of Fundy, from Annapolis Basin on the south-west to Minas
Basin on the north-east, and thus shelters the fruitful valleys of
the Annapolis and Cornwallis Rivers. One of the most attractive
features in the scenery of Nova Scotia is the bold and strikingly
picturesque promontory of Blomidon, rising to 400 feet in height,
which forms the north-eastern termination of the North Moun-
tain, and now looks down upon the fertile stretches of
waving meadow, blossoming orchards, and scattered towns and
villages, as it did in the olden time on the less ambitious hamlets
and carefully cultivated fields of the French farmers. The
physical and geological features of Blomidon, — its red sandstone
strata, mostly covered by a debris-slope, and its continuous
summit cliff or wall of dark trap — have often been depicted by
pen and pencil, and its zeolites and other treasures of mineral
species are shown in most of the public museums of America and
Europe. It is not so well known that Blomidon is a rich pasture
for the botanist.
In July last an excursion to Blomidon was undertaken,
chiefly for the purpose of studying its ferns. The party consisted
of Colonel Collingwood, R. A., and his son Percy ; Dr. Catell,
Deput}' Surgeon General ; Mr. P. Jack, Mr, Geo. Thomson, and
myself. Having reached Canning the night before, we started early
in the morning for Blomidon, sailing down with the tide in a yacht
to a place called Big Eddy, which afibrds convenient anchorage.
