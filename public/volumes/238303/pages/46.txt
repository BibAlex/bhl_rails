TRANSITION RESISTANCE — AIACGREGOR. 47
injures its use for general purposes; it can, however, be utilized
for colliery work, to the economy of the better coal. The coal
from the lower portion is equal to the average of that mined in
Pictou County. The theoretical evaporative power compares
favorably with that of the coals from the various counties of the
Province, as will appear from the following table :
Pictou Co'y, average of 5 coals. Theoretical evaporative power 8"66
Cumberland Co., " 3 " " " " 8-32
Cape Breton " " 12 " " " " 8-56
Inverness " " 2 " " " " 7-60
The avei'age evaporative power of the lower part of the
seam under consideration is 8*47. All the evaporative powers
are calculated by Regnault's formula, for comparison with the
admiralty coal trials, although later researches have somewhat
altered the values determined by him. The table is taken from
the analysis given in my paper on " Canadian Coals," published
in the transactions of the North of England Institute of Mining
Engineers, for the year 1878.
Art. VI. — On the Resistance to the Passage of the Electric
Current between Amalgamated Zinc Electrodes and
Solutions of Zinc Sulphate. By Prof. J. G.MacGregor,

(Read April 9th, 1883.)
After attention had been directed to the measurement of
resistance by the establishment of Ohm's Law, the question was
raised whether or not there was at the surface of separation of con-
ductors of different substances a special resistance to the passage
of the current, such that the current was weakened by the mere
transition from the one conductor to the other. Poggendorff*
settled this question for metals by so arranging two circuits
