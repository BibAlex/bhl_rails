The coal field is remarkably free from disturbances, etc., and
Professor Lesley, in a report, dwells strongly on this point.
Nearly all the seams lie at easy angles, yield little water, and
owing to the generally firm character of the roof, they can be
mined with unusual cheapness and safety. So strongly marked
is the impermeable nature of the strata, that at a moderate depth
the submarine workings are perfectly dry.
Shales, arenaceous and argillaceous, with red and green marls,
make up about one-half the total thickness of this section. The
shales pass into sandstones and frequently carry ironstone
