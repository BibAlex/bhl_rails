The following experiments were made with the object of
determining whether or not weak solutions of Sodium Phos-
phate and Carbonate have volumes which are less than the
Volumes at the same temperature of the water which they con-
tain.
Professor Ewing' and 1 had found that sufficiently weak solu-
tions of sulphate of copper contain amounts of water whose
Volumes if free would be greater than those of the solutions
themselves ; and that anhydrous copper sulphate, added in small
quantities to water, produces solutions of smaller bulk than the
original water. It seemed desirable therefore to extend the
investigation to other hydrated salts.
The apparatus employed consisted of dilatometers, which were
large glass bottles (commonly called Winchester quarts), with
glass tubes fitted in their neck.s. The bottles had capacities of
about 2, GOO c.c. The glass tubes were about 25 cm. in length
and 0"4 sq. cm. in section, and were chosen so as to be as uniform
in bore as possible. They were fitted to the bottles by means of
India-rubber stoppers, and fitted so tightly that there could be
no danger of any relative displacement of tube and bottle. The
rubber stoppers were held fast to the bottle by wires. Their
inner ends were hollowed conically, and the glass tubes started
from the summits of the conical hollows, so that air bubbles
could easily be made to pass up the tubes. At their upper ends
the tubes widened into funnels. Fine scratches on the tubes
served as zero marks. The bottles stood in a large zinc bath up
to their necks in water. The dilatometers were calibrated by
