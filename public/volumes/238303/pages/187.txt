smaller volumes than their constituent water would in the free
state possess. In the case of the phosphate, this is true of all
solutions containing less than about 0.016 per cent- of the
anhydrous salt, the difference of volume being greatest in solu-
tions containing about 0.011 per cent. A solution of this
strength, containing 1000 cubic inches of water, has a volume of
999.87 cubic inches. In the case of the carbonate I found the
greatest difference of volume to occur with a solution containing
about 0.026 per cent, of anhydrous salt, a solution of this strength
which contained 1000 cubic inches of water having a volume of
.27 cubic inches.
