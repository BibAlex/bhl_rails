Two specimens were brought to the Museum some years ago
by a fisherman of Devil's Island. I identified them by consulting
DeKay. They were in a state of decay. Last autumn the same
brought me two other specimens. These are of larger size than
two preceding, and are now in pretty fair condition pre-
served in alcohol. The first were of the same size as that
described by DeKay, — 9 inches. The last are of larger size, one
being 11 inches, the other 13. They are, probably, male and
female.
I give from DeKay 's description, the leading characteristics
applicable to our specimens. " Colour black, body oblong, elliptical
compressed. Height nearly equal to one-third of length. Lat-
eral line commences at the upper angle of the branchial aper-
ture, is arched, and nearly concurrent with the back, from which
it is little distant. Head declivous somewhat rounded. Opercle
with a pointed membrane. Pre-opercle, with sub-equal short
spines, gives the bone on its outer surface a plaited appearance.
