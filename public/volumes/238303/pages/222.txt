PIED, OR LABRADOR DUCK. â€” DOWNS. 827
says they were not uncommon then. Of their particular
manners, place, or nioue oi' breeding, nothing is known. Latham
observes, that a pair in the possession of Sir Joseph Banks were
brought from Labrador in 1840. William Winton, of Halifax,
and Capt. Waderburn, of the 42nd, Highland Regt., (stationed at
Halifax,) each obtained a male in the market. Winton gave his
specimen to me; I gave it to George A. Boardman, of St. Stephen?
N. B., who had one already among his collection. Mr. Corrg, of '^
Boston, gave him S200 for them. I saw a male at the Brown '
Museum at Liverpool, England ; it belonged to the late Earl of
Derby's collection. This bird now, like the Dodo and Gi'eat
Auk, has become extinct. I think the Dalhousie Museum very
fortunate in possessing a male and feinale of this rare duck. I
do not know of another female in existence. I hope the Mac-
Culloch collection will be a foundation for a museum in the new
college. I have been a close observer of the birds of this pro-
vince for 63 years, and I have never seen this bird, other than
in the specimen given rae by Winton, in the flesh. Professor
Baird, and other American natui-alists, are now trying to
obtain all the information they can about this bird.
