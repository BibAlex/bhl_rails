•argillaceous and calcai'eous, and frequently cariying nodules o£
limestone .and iron ore. Numerous beds of limestone are met,
compact, laminated, or concretionar}', usually gray and blue,
Viometimes black and bituminous. These are frequently asso-
'ciated witb. beds of gypsum and anhydrite, sometimes over KiO
feet in thickness. Beds of red and gray Sandstone, usually
laminated, often micaceous and ripple-marked, are fiequently
•met. The limestones geneially carry the fossils characterising
the formation, and are frequently charged witli galena and copper
pyrites, eel es tine, manganese ores, etc.
The following section, taken from the report of H. Fletcher,
•Esq., of the Geological Survey, for the years 1875-70, gives a
good idea of the conditions under which the limestones and
