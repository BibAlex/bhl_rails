XVIU GLACIAL DISTRIBUTION IN CANADA — HONEYMAN.
Rimouski Gneisses {E) Avcliman — At the Railway Station on
both sides of the railway, I found and examined Archaean
boulders of large size. Some of these were granitic gneisses
identical with those that I found at Ottawa and Kingston. The'
only place where the rocks of this kind are to be found in situ
near Rimouski is on the opposite side of the River St. Laurence,
which is here 20 miles wide. Glaciation was found by Sir W.
E. Logan at Kempt Road, near Metapedia Lake, long. 67° 43',
lat. 48°. Its course was S. 80 E..
I would observe that the lines of glaciation of Pleasant Park,
Halifax, extended in a northerly direction on our Admiralty
chart, pass through Rimouski at a distance of 310 miles.
Our field of observation thus extends from Cape George, Nova
Scotia, long. 62°' .to Kingston, Canada, long. 76° 25" to 29', i.e.
through 14° 25' long., and from Halifax, lat. 44° 3.4', to Rimouski,
lat. 46" 26', i.e through 3" 52' lat.
