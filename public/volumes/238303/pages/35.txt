PICTOU COUNTY.
Last summer I extended my observations from West River
railway station, eastward as far as the Albion mines. Syenitic
boulders were observed on both sides of the i^ailway, as far as
Hopewell station. At the new workings of the Albion mines I
collected boulders from the diift — syenitic gneisses and syenites.
The position of the drift having these boulders is intermediate
between the Cobequid mountains and the Ai'chsean rocks of
East River. The source of the boulders is therefore proble-
matical. They may have been brought to their present position
by floods occurring at the close of the glacial period. One of
the boulders is a very beautiful syenite. I found a large boulder
of a similar character near Merigomish harbour in 1868. It
was composed of white and pale red orthoclase, light green
hornblende and hyaline quartz. I have not seen a sj'^enite like
it in situ.
ANTIGONISH COUNTY.
On the shore at Morristown, (Antigonish) boulders, large and
small, of Diorite of strongly-marked character, attracted my
attention upwards of twentj^ years ago. Much speculation was
indulged in regarding their source. It was concluded that they
had been transported from the Labrador coast.
When I discovered the typical "Archaean" Arisaig rocks on
Northumberland Strait shore in 1868, I was pleased to find a
rock precisely similar to the boulders in question as one of the
rocks of the series. I may remark that in all my examinations
