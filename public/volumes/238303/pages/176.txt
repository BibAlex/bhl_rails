Examination in detail reveals many interesting and important
points that have not been noticed in preceding papers. To some
of these I now propose to diiect attention.
Bedford Basin.
Having now resided a year and a half about half way up
Bedford Basin, I have had favourable opportunities for studying
the geology of this beautiful and picturesque region. Again and
again I have referred to Navy Island, on the east side of the
Basin, as having a glacial deposit of the "Cow Baj^ Type," re-
plete with triassic and archaean boulders. To the north and
south of this, from Bedford to the Narrows, expanses of drift
have been examined of similar constitution.
The greatest breadth as well as depth of the Basin is between
the Navy Island side and Birch Cove. The bi'eadth here is two
miles, and one of the Admiralty soundings, about* midway, is
84 fathoms — (Vide Chart). As might be expected, its marine
zoology is very interesting. This year its mackerel fishery has
been very productive, and manj' singular fishes, especially &coWj-^
heresox so urns, have been found in its waters.
