CURRENTS IN THE GULF OF ST. IAWrENCE â€” t*OJi. 307
piieric temperature have become more frequent. The cold is less
severe in winter, and the winds more variable and of shorter
duration in summer, which no doubt has some influence upon the
currents there. Many of the prominent land marks, laid down
in the charts and sailing directions now in use^ have also been
washed away by the action of the sea, or submerged, which is mis-
leading: to the navio^ator.
This great commercial highway is traversed annually by a large
fleet of magnitieent steam and sailing ships, laden with costly
merchandize and thousands of valuable lives, and the heavy
losses annually incurred through the ignorance of navigators, of
the force and diiection of the currents crossing their track (which
they assert are not laid down in their charts or sailing diiections),
shews the importance and necessity of a scientific survey being
made without delay, to obtain by observation the information
absolutely necessary for the safe navigation of the Gulf of St.
Lawrence. This should be undertaken by the government, as
the loss of every ship is a national loss, and falls upon the com-
munity.
