236 FRESH WATER SPONGES OF NOVA SCOTIA â€” MACKAY.
I, S. fragilis. Leidy.
Sessile, encrusting. Statoblasts in extensive basal layers,
with apertures extended into generally curved tubules, directed
outwards, or aggregated into compound spherules of three or
four or more single statoblasts in a common cellular investment
with spicules, cylindrical, roundish truncate, spined and generally
slightly curved.
Described first by Leidy, 1851 ; by Bowerbank as 8. Lordii
from British Columbia in 1863 ; by Dybowski as 8. Siberica
in Russia. The varying forms with aggregated or compound
statoblasts, were described as Var. Segregata, by Potts ; but he
says a wider experience has induced him to give it up. It is
this form which has been described from the Ottawa, by Dr. G.
M. Dawson, in 1875, as S. Ottaiuaensis. His " large irregular
ovaria" are the compound statoblasts to the structure of which
he does not allude. These forms are frequently found encrust-
ing submerged twigs, stones, &c., in the lakes of Nova Scotia.

2. S. lacustris Var. Daiusoni, Bk.
Generally branching. Besides the skeletal spicules there are
present minute, spined, fusiform dermal arcuates. Statoblast
spicules, cylindrical, spined and more or less curved.
This is a variety of the European S. laciistris. The first
Canadian species was described by Bowerbank in 1863
as 8. Dawsoni. Next we find 8. lacustroides. Then as its
specific identity with the European form become apparent, we
find 8. lacustris var. lacustroides Potts, and 8. lacustris var.
Ame7'ica7ia Carter. We suggest the propriety of retaining
Bowerbank's specific as the varietal name. We have a specimen
from Sir William Dawson, collected by H. M. Ami in the Ottawa,
which is nearly identical with the European 8. lacustris.
One of the most common of Nova Saotian fresh water sponges.
