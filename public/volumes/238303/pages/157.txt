KoHLRAUSCH* has investigated the expansion of Vulcanite
(Hartgummi, Karammasse,) and foUnd that between 16" and
^5° C the true linear coefficient of expansion (e) at the tempera^
ture t in given by the formula;
--G —8
c==- 61x10 i 76 k 10 t
If the formula hold beyond the experimental limits, it follo\v^'?
that e must have the value o, when
For higher values of t, e will be positive; for lower values
it will be negative. At this temperature, therefore, Vulcanite
must have minimum volume or maximum density, if the above
formula holds. The probability that the formula de<luced from
experiments between +16'' and +35° should be true for —80 "
is not great, but it may, nevertheless, be Worthy of notice that it
indicates vulcanite as being perhaps one of those peculiar sub-
!stances having temperatures of maximum or minimum, density.
The following substances have also laws of expansion within
the limits of experiment, which indicate temperatures of maxi-
mum or minimum density beyond these limits:
