During the 24 years that have elapsed since my visit to Louis-
burg our viev^^s on the geology of Cape Breton as well as of
Nova Scotia have undergone considerable change. The rocks on
Louisburg shore, which I regarded as of igneous origin, are now
regarded as metamorphic rocks, and instead of being considered
as of comparatively recent age, c. g. Devonian or Upper Silurian,
they are now regarded as having been formed in Pre-
cambrian or Archean time. I have compared them with
the "Middle Arisaig Series " of the Cobequid Mountain, I. C. R.
section. — Trans. Institute of Nat. Science, Vol. IV, page 475.
The formation of Mira Ridge which is associated with the
Louisburg Cr3^stalline rocks and lies between them and the
Carboniferous, already referred to in a preceding page, are of
Lower Silurian age, being approximately equivalent to the Upper
Lingula Flags of Wales. In the upper part, next to
the Carboniferous, Mr. Fletcher of the Geological Survey,
found abundance of fragments of Trilobitez, of Genera Olenus,
and Agnostus. In a position apparently lower, and next to
the Crystalline rocks of Gabarus, the Rev. Donald Sutherland
found Sandstones with numerous Lingulellce and Oholelloi. (?)
Mr. Bowser, of Halifax, collected at Scatarie specimens of beauti-
ful Jaspideous Conglomerate and Breccias, which I have regarded
as a part of the Louisburg series. — Trans., vol. iv, pages 252 and
258. These are in our museum collection. The geological
formations are therefore Archajan, Lower Silurian, and Carboni-
ferous.
RAILWAYS.
Louisburg Harbour has again come into prominence in con-
nection with the Railwa}'' development of the Dominion of
Canada. This time it appears as a rival to Halifax
