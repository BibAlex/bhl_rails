NORTHERN LIMIT OF WILD GRAPE VINES— LAWSON. 107
In a subsequent letter Mr. Karney observes that Mr. Michael
Mitchell, Scotch Settlement, York Co., New Brunswick, is owner
of the island where the grapes grow.
Liverpool, N. S., Dec. 10th, 1883.
Dear Sir, — There is a grape vine said to be a wild one growing
on the farm of a Mr. Hall, on the other side of Allen's Creek,
close to the town of Annapolis.
I have seen and was told it was a wild one, but it may be a
degenerate vine planted by the French. Seeing your letter in
the Chronicle of the 8th inst., I thought well to mention this one,
I am very intimately acquainted with the province of Nova
Scotia, but do not know of any other wild vine.
Yours, &c.,
Max D. Major.

Dear Sir, — Wild grapes are not uncommon along the St. John
River.
At Fredericton I know of several vines in gardens, which were
transplanted from the woods, and some of which have seeded
themselves. Yours,
John Ellis.
Annapolis Royal, Dec. 10th, 1883.
Dear Doctor, — Answering your enquiries in the newspapers, I
beg to inform you that I have known a wild grape vine within a
mile or more of this town. In a ravine whose steep sides pre-
vented culture, it flourished. It was surrounded by cultivated
fields, cultivated no doubt by the French, before Nicholson's
capture, a mile or more from the steep hills, now as then covered
by the forest primeval.
It was very luxuriant, and, though I do not recollect eating the
grapes, yet its flowers and half ripened berries I well remember.
It was an object of curiosity to me, especially as proving the exact-
ness of old LesCarbot, our most exact and homeliest historian.
Without knowing, I thought it the little Fox Grape so luxuriant
