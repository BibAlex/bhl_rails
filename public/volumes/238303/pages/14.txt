Art. I. — Notes on a Polariscopic Examination of Crys-
talline KocKs of the Yarmouth Gold-Bearing
Series. — By Prof. Honeyman, D.C.L., &c. Curator
of the Provincial Musewm.
(Read Nov. 13, 1882 )
The problematical character of those rocks, and their unex-
pected appearance in the gold bearing series— no similar rocks
appearing elsewhere in the band, as far as observed, — led me to
have sections prepared by A. A. Julien, New York, for micro-
scopic and polariscopic examination.
1, 2. The rock at Jehogue Point has suggested a number
of queries. (Vide Paper on " Geology of Digby and Yarmouth
Counties." Trans. 1880.) Its appearance and relations suggested
a comparison with the Igneous rocks of the Blomidon series. I
had also a section made of Blomidon Basalt. The two examined
by the polarLscope are so much alike as to be regarded identical.
The dark material of both is evidently Augite, and the clear
crystals a triclinic feldspar. The latter polarized shew three
parallel lines. Between two parallels the colour is a beau-
tiful blue-white, the colour between the other two is dusky.
Turning the polarizer the colours change place, — the dusky
becoming blue, and the blue dusky. This seems to furnish a
reply to my queries, and to refer the eruption at Jebogue Point
to the Paulo-jwst Triassic Period.
