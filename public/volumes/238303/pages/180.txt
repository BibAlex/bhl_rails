NOTES ON GLACIAL ACTION — HONEYMAN. 255
cemented together by the oxide of iron derived from the pyrite
of the argillites which chiefly constitute the Breccia. Sections
indicated the Breccia filling the hollows of the underlying argil-
lites.
Purcell's Cove.
Here we have an island at its entrance which has a very ferru-
ginous aspect. To all appearances it is composed of debris.
Its position near the entrance to the N. West Arm, suggests its
origin. It seems to have been formed from the scooped material
of the N. West Arm. Masses detached show that it is largely
conglomerate cemented with oxide of Iron.
These show that glacial agency may also form conglomerates,
and Breccias as well as marine agencies which have been chiefly
employed in this work.
In ray Paper, Session 1886-7, I gave a list of characteristic
boulders of the " Amygdaloidal Drift " exhibited at the Centen-
nial Exhibition, Philadelphia. I would now give the same with
subsequent additions,
