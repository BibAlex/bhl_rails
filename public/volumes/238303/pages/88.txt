CRYSTALINE ROCKS OF N. S. AND C. B. — HONEYMAN. 121
farther along b^ Then taking a course N. E., towards Loch Eck,
I passed through b" and into b^ going beyond Ben More, at the
beginning of Loch Eck my attention was attracted to a rock
on the right side of the road. This was furrowed by familiar
glaciation, unfortunately I did not have my compass to take the
course of the striation. It was apparently towards the S. E.
The rock itself is a micaceous schist. We followed the course
of the River Echaig, as far as its falls. The water was low at the
time and gave an excellent opportunity of examining the magni-
ficent exposure of schist. It is wonderfully worn and excavated
by the action of the water, which passes through a narrow gorge.
The rock is replete with pot holes, some have had sides worn and the
boulders have escaped. Looking at the lofty hill ridges on either
side of the valley, and beyond the falls, one is impressed with
the adaptation of the position for an Alpine glacier. Of course
other geologists have noticed this, although I have failed, on
enquiry, of learning the fact.
