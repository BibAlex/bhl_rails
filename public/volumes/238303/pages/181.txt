We propose now to go northward in the direction of our main
glacial line, N. 40" W,, to notice its Geology and to indicate the
formations that have produced the drift material already referred
to. From Halifax Harbour Mouth, a distance of 83 miles,
(Mackinlays' Map) we have the Lower Cambrian Formation
with its Quartzites and Argillites and associated Granites, west
side of the Harbour and Mount Uniacke. On our way we have
passed through the County of Halifax and entered the County
of Hants. We now enter the Carboniferous Formation with its
Sandstones, Limestones and Gypsums. The Limestones are
sometimes fossiliferous (Fauna) the Sandstones, &c., having Flora,
Passing through these 21 miles we reach the "Mines Basin,"
Reaching the other side we have gone 18 miles. The Formation
lying under the water is the Triassic. (New Red Sandstone.)
At 12 miles distance we passed Blomidon with its Basalts and
Amygdaloids and Sandstones. On the north side of the Basin
we have Partridge Island similarly constituted. We are now in
Cumberland County at the junction of the Triassic with the
Carboniferous Formation. Proceeding through Parrsboro' we
traverse its Carboniferous to a distance of 4 miles. We have
reached the Cobequid Mountains with (a) its Upper Silurian
Formation (metamorphic.) This is the band that contains the
Londonderry Iron Mines, about 40 miles to the eastward. After
going ten miles and a half we reach Crystalline, Metamor-
