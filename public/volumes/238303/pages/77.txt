106 NORTHERN LIMIT OF WILD CtRAPE VINES — LAWSON.
he put it, in search of marks made by their countrymen long since,
and a few days after I noticed in the papers that you had been
consulted on the matter. My object is to let you know that
there is a large rock sitting on three legs of stone, of the height
of 18 inches, which I believe was put up by these old cruisers. It
sits on Indian Point, near the County line between this and
Queen's County. I met with it when a child, and have taken great
interest in it; have frequently visited it as it puzzled me, till of late
years. Should you meet those people, if you think well of it,
they may easily drive to it now, but not when I used to steer my
boat to where it sits. It is plainly seen from entrance of the
port. Locality, Indian Point, Port Medway Harbour, Queen's
County.

-I have a stone axe by which one could make quite a job at big
work.
Just received a note from a friend informing of his having
three stone relics, and I have quite a number, all from the Port
Medway river, whilst nothing of the sort can I find about the
LaHave River, but have two iron axes found in old graves, one
having been buried at Wentsill's Lake, where bones and axes
were wrapped in birch-bark.
There is an old burying ground and koche for dried salmon,
&c., I expect. E. D. D.

Dear Sir, — In answer to your question about " Wild Grapes,"
•a small sized wild grape grows in abundance on some of the
islands in the St. John river, about seven miles above Fredeiicton,
N. B. I have drank the wine made from them and it is very
;good.
Any more information I can give, will only be too happy to do
so, and remain, Sincerely,
Alex. Irvine Karney,
