Xll EEPOET OF DELEGATE TO llOYAL SOCIETY.
spears, assegais, Â«Sz;c. A number of unique and valuable Indian
curiosities were displayed, consisting of sumptuous Indian gala
robes and dresses, spears, bows and arrows, collected in the North
West during His Excellency s visit to that part of the Dominion.
After deliberate inspection of these, His Excel lenc}' led the way
to the Garden Party, of which the Princess did all the honor.'^

cricket match in an adjoining field also drew the attention of th'
party, at the conclusion of which the festivities ended.
It would be premature to hazard a decided opinion on th'
permanence or otherwise of the Royal Society. Time mus-
decide that question, which is an important one. The BritisI'
Association pays a visit to Canada next year, and a good deai
will depend on the action then taken. If the people of the
Dominion can be induced, even compai-atively, to take a sinjilar
interest in scientific pursuits to that which is manifested in
England, there can be no doubt of the result. The Dominion
Government, we dare say, will do its part upon the occasion.
We fear, however, that neither numbers, nor wealth, nor inclina-
tion, nor time, can be sufficiently engaged to secure the immediate
success of the Royal Society, although we earnestly hope it may
be otherwise. There are some defects also in its organization, in
that its numbers are unwisely limited. So far, however, the
attempt is highly laudable, and ought to inspire the earnest zeal
in its behalf of every lover of his country seeking its advance-
ment among the nations.
