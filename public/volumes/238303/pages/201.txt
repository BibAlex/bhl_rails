302 CURRENTS IN THE GULF OF ST. LAWRENCE — FOX.
Art. IX. — Observations on the Currents in the Gulf of
St. Lawrence, and their danger to Naviga-
tion. — By John J. Fox.
{Bead May 10, 1886.)
The remarks in this short paper are deduced from personal
experience and observation, after a residence of thirty years at
the Magdalen Islands, in the capacity of Chief Officer of Cus-
toms.
Seldom a year passes but we have to record the loss of some
valuable .ship and cargo, with human life, by .stranding on the
Islands and coasts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which, on
official enquiry, is attributed to imperceptible currents unknown
to the shipmaster, not laid down in the charts and sailing direc-
tions now in use.
A general ignorance appears to exist among navigators
respecting the force and direction of the tides and currents in
this locality, which may in some measure be accounted for by
the fact that fifty years have now elapsed since the last survey
of the Gulf was made by officers of the British Navy. And it
would appear that their observations were confined more to the
shore tides than to the currents in mid-channel ; some additions
have since been made, but the basis is the old sui-vey.
The local currents of the Gulf are created and influenced by
various agencies, such as winds, specific gravity, changes of
atmosphere and equilibrium. Their existence, force and direction
are difficult to ascertain ; are very deceptive, and being very
irregular are consequently the more dangerous to navigation.
They appear to have periods of comparative quiescence and
activity. Those born of the winds change with it.
The ice that accumulates in the Gulf during the winter
months, combined with the immense volume of fresh water dis-
charged into it in the spring from the St. Lawience and other
rivers by thp melting of the snow, decreases its saJtness £|,nd
