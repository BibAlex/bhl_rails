TfiE CARBONIFEROUS OF CAPE BRETON — GILPIN. 291
is that of valleys between the ridges of the older rocks, and
their softer strata have been vrorn into broad river valleys and
rolling hills of inconsiderable altitude. When they rest on the
flanks of the pre-carboniferous hills they present charming and
picturesque gorges worn by the brooks which are long nourished
by the accumulated winter snows.
The Eastern or Sydney district presents unusually fine natural
^sections, and has received much attention owing to the extensive
mining operations which have been carried on during the past
'Century. Its stiuctuie has been carefully worked out, and as it
is a typically well developed carboniferous district a brief des-
cription of the various subdivisions will serve in great measure
as a guide to these in other parts of the island.
In the Sydney or Eastern district the following subdivisions
are recognised: —
Productive Coal Measures.
Millstone Grit.
Marine Limestone Formation.
Lower or Basal Coal Measures.
The upper subdivision, that of the upper Coal Measures, being
€ibsent, unless represented by the beds at Low Point, overlying
the Carr Seam.
The shore from Cape Dauphin to Mira Bay is occupied by the
productive measures, which are folded in three undulations hav-
ing a general East and West course. As the measures are inter-
rupted at the anticlinals the exact identification of the seams
has not been made out.
The followino- section, taken in the Lingan district, will serve
to show the thickness and relative positions of the best known
seams : —
