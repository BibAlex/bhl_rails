96 NOTES ON THE DEBERT COAL FIELD. — GILPIN.
ON ANALYSIS (by fast coldng.)
Hygroscopic moisture l"594r
Volatile combustible matter 33188
Fixed carbon 58-206
Ash 7012

Sulphur 2-648
Coke fairly coherent.
From this analysis it will appear that the coal, although
holding more sulphur than is usually found in the coals of Nova
Scotia proper, is of good quality, and similar in general composi-
tion to that mined at Spring Hill.
About 100 feet below the 6 feet seam is a bed of conglomerate,
having a dip to the north similar to that of the section given
above. The conglomerate appeared to be about 150 feet wide
on the river, and to grow broader to the westward. Where
exposed on a small brook about | of a mile west of the river, it
presented a double dip S 5° W and N 10° W, apparently form-
ing the saddle of an anticlinal, and was overlaid to the south by
gray shaley sandstones dipping S 5° W and at an angle of 25°.
On the north side of the conglomerate, on the brook, at about
the same distance from it as the so-called nine foot seam is on
the river, an imperfect exposure of coal is met presenting the
fgllowing section : —

About 100 feet further up the brook a four feet seam of coal
is said to have been proved by a bore hole.
About 100 yards above the bridge is an exposure of measures
holding a seam of coal about 18 inches thick, and running nearly
at right angles to the course of the seams already described.
From this it would appear that the beds exposed on the river are
