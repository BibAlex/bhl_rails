Report of M. Murphy, C. E., Delegate to the R. Society
OF Canada, May, 1883.
I HAD the honor, as delegate, to represent the Nova Sco-
tia Institute of Natural Science, at the last annual meeting of
the Royal Society of Canada.
At this first annual meeting of the N. S. I. of Natural Science
for the session, 1884-5, it is, I presume, expected that I should
submit to you, Mr. President and gentlemen, a few cursory re-
marks on my visit.
I will say, in a few words, my visit to Ottawa was both
pleasant and instructive. It was made pleasant by the members
of the Royal Society, and instructive by the papers read and
the remarks elicited in 'the discussions thereon.
A delegate from your Institute is treated with all the privi-
leges of a member during the session, he is allowed and invited
to enter into the discussion of subjects, so varied that a party
wishing to discuss any one subject will be afforded ample oppor-
tunity to do so.
I submitted a short paper giving a brief sketch of the life of
the I. N. S., Nova Scotia â€” its operations and exchanges, together
with the last printed number of the Transactions.
I have, on behalf of this Institute, as well as on my own behalf^
to thank Dr. Lawson and Dr. MacGregor for the manner in which
they so kindly treated me throughout my visit. These gentle-
men seemed to pay special attention, and in all instances saw
that your delegate was neither forgotten nor neglected.
