OF THE
Art. I. â€” Notes on the DeBert Coal Field, Colchester
Co., N. S. By Edwin Gilpin, Jr., A. M., F. G. S.,
F. K. S. C, Inspector of Mines.
(Read 12th Nov., 1883.)
During the past few months a good deal of interest has been
shown in Mining circles over the I'eported discoveries of coal
seams, of workable size, on the DeBert River, Colchester Co. In
this conclusion the following notes of a brief visit to the ground
may prove interesting to the members of the Institute, and I
only regret that the attention necessarily directed to mines in
operation has prevented me from giving more time to the
problems presented by this practically unknown disti'ict.
The presence of coal beds on the DeBert and Chiganoise
Rivers has long been known to the geologist. Gesner, one of the
pioneers of Nova Scotian Geology, writing in 1836, described the
signs of coal at various points along the north side of the Basin
of Minas, from Cape Chignecto to Truro, and remarks, page 129
of his " Geology and Mineralogy of Nova Scotia," that " About
five miles northward of the Lower DeBert bridge the coal
measures of the mountains rise above the gypseous and saliferous
sandstones, and a beautiful section of their strata is made by the
river passing over them. Two small veins of coal have been
intersected, although it is not known what quantity of that
valuable substance is still hidden in the adjacent rocks."
Dr. Dawson, in the second edition of his Acadian Geology, .
page 264, speaks of the metamorphic slates of the Cobequid
Mountains being succeeded by conglomerates, and then by " coal
measure rocks, consisting of gray sandstones and dark shales, .
