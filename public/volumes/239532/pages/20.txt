ABSTRACT
The long-used class name, Taxopsida, is validated and the class name
Podocarpopsida and subclass Podocarpidae are proposed as new. The
monogeneric family Saxegothaeaceae is validated and segregated into its
own, new order Saxegothaeales. The order is expanded to include a new
monogeneric family Microcachrydaceae based on the endemic Tasmanian
genus Microcachrys.
KEY WORDS: Pinophyta, Microcachrydaceae, Podocarpopsida,
Podocarpidae, Saxegothaeaceae, Saxegothaeales, Taxopsida, nomenclature,
gymnosperms, Podocarpaceae
In a forthcoming book by Doweld, Reproductive Morphology of Seed Plants,
several new suprageneric names in Pinophyta Cronq., Takht., et Zimmerm. ex
Reveal, are required for a modified system of classification of the division based on
new studies and data compiled on the morphology and anatomy of the male and female
reproductive structures. Two previously suggested but invalidly published names,
Taxopsida and Saxegothaeaceae, are validated herein and attributed to the first person
to have suggested the name. A new class and subclass, based on the widespread
genus Podocarpus L'Her. ex Pers., are proposed as coordinate taxa for the new
proposed Taxopsida and the already established Pinidae Cronq., Takht.. et Zimmerm.
and Taxidae Ehrend. ex Reveal. In addition to Saxegothaeaceae, we establish the
family Microcachrydaceae and place both in a new order, Saxegothaeales. We note
that Faijon & Mill (1999) have proposed conservation of the orthography Saxegothaea
over Lindley's original Saxe-Gothaea. The proposal may not be necessary as Art. 60,
