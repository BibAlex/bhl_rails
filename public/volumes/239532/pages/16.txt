METHODS
Transverse, radial, and tangential sections were cut at 20-30 |xm thickness on a
sledge microtome. All slides were stained with Safranin. Averages were based on 25
randomly selected measurements. The lAWA list of microscopic features (LAWA
Committee 1989) was used for some of the methodology.
RESULTS
The wood anatomy of Juniperus of the Western Hemisphere has the following
characteristics (see Table 1 and Figs. 1-12):
Growth rings: Distinct, as a result of a marked contrast between the final rows of
the latewood tracheids and the succeeding rows of the earlywood tracheids. The
number of growth rings per mm is very variable, from 0.1 up to 5.5, commonly
between 0.6 and 1.5 (Table 1).
