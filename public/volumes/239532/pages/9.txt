Ad Hebeclinio bullatissimo (B.L. Rob.) R.M. King & H. Rob. similis sed
in caulibus lanulatum in marginibus foliorum serratum in receptacuiis sparse
hirsutum et in floribus 12-15 in capitulo distinctum.
Weak shrub to 1 m high, sparingly branched; stems terete, brownish lanulate.
Leaves opposite; petioles 1.5-4.0 cm long; blades ovate, chartaceous, 4-11 cm long,
2.0-5.5 cm wide, base broadly obtuse to rounded, margins closely serrate, apex acute
to scarcely acuminate, upper surface slightly buUate, sparsely pilose with weak hairs,
lower surface hirtellous mostly on veins, without evident glandular dots; venation
pinnate with ca. 4 ascending secondary veins on each side. Inflorescence a small
terminal pyramidal panicle, branches lanulate, cymose, ending in small clusters of
heads; peduncles 1-3 mm long, tomentellous. Heads ca. 6 mm high; involucral bracts
ca. 35 in ca. 5 series, orbicular to narrowly oblong, 1-4 mm long, 0.7-1.0 mm wide,
apices rounded, outer surface glabrous with 3 green lines; receptacle sparsely hirsute.
Florets 12-15 in a head; corollas narrowly funnelform, white, ca. 2.8 mm long,
glabrous outside below lobes, tube ca. 1 mm long, throat ca. 1 .2 mm long, with long
hairs inside, lobes ca. 0.3 mm long, with hairs and glandular dots outside; anther
thecae ca. 1 mm long; style appendages filiform. Cypselas ca. 1.5 mm long, nearly
glabrous, with 1 or a few small setulae above; pappus of ca. 35 white bristles to 2.8
mm long, longer bristles somewhat broadened distally.
The species is known only from the type collection. The specimen was stated to
be on a rock in a very shaded place. The species is closely related to Hebeclinium
bullatissimum (B.L. Rob.) R.M. King & H. Rob. from Ecuador and northern Peru,
but the latter has consistently appressed minute puberulence on the stems, crenulate or
crenate leaf margins, a glabrous receptacle and 22-30 florets in a head.
Ophryosporus carchiensis H. Rob., spec. nov. TYPE: ECUADOR. Carchi:
Canton Montufar, Loma El Corazon (Bretana) al SE de Mariscal Sucre, Rio
Minas, 00° 35' N, 77° 42' W, 3150 m, bosque muy hiimedo Montano, 22-23 Dec

A Ophryosporo sodiroi Hieron. in cypselis setuliferis et in rami stylorum
angustioribus distinctus.
Vine with branches spreading at 90° angles; stems brownish, terete, densely
puberulous; pith solid. Leaves opposite; petioles 3-8 mm long; blades ovate, 1.8-2.8
cm long, 1.0-1.8 cm wide, base obtuse to short-acute, margins sharply and closely
serrate-dentate above widest part, apex acute, upper surface glabrous, lower surface
pilose with long hairs mostly crowded along veins, without glandular dots, not viscid,
weakly trinervate with ascending secondary veins from well above base.
Inflorescence pyramidal to broadly thyrsoid with branches spreading at 90° angles;
branches densely pilosulous to tomentellous with brown hairs, peduncles 1-6 mm
