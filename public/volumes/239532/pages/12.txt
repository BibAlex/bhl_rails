Robinson: New species and combinations in Eupatorieae 353
long. Heads ca. 4.5 mm high, ca. 2 mm wide; involucral bracts usually 5 in 1-2
series, narrowly oblong, ca. 3.0-3.5 mm long, ca. 0.8 mm wide, apex obtuse to
short-acute, sparsely puberulous outside. Florets usually 5 in a head; corollas whitish,
tinged with red distally, ca. 3 mm long, with numerous narrow-tipped stalked glands
outside on tube, throat and lobes, tube ca. 1 mm long, throat cyUndrical, ca. 1.5 mm
long, lobes ca. 0.5 mm long, smooth inside; anther thecae ca. 1.5 mm long; tips of
style branches distinctly enlarged. Cypselas (immature) ca. 1 mm long, with
numerous setulae near top and bottom, glabrous between; carpopodium shortly
stopper-shaped; pappus usually with 4-14 bristles, sometimes totally lacking, with
irregular scabrae or barbules.
Ophryosporus sagasteguii is evidently very limited in distribution in southern
Cajamarca, an area where many members of the genus occur. The variation in the
pappus nicely bridges the now abandoned distinction between Ophryosporus and the
old concept of Piqueria sect. Artemis ioides. The species may be of hybrid origin, but
it possesses at least one other distinctive feature that has been seen in no potential
parent, a narrowly fistulose stem. The slightly reddish apices of the corollas also seem
somewhat distinctive.
