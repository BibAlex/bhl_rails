The pollen is pantoporate in the tropical and subtropical genera of the
Polemomaceae and in the temperate tribe Leptodactyloneae (Stuchlik 1967a. 1967b;
Taylor & Levin 1975; Day & Moran 1986; Day unpubl.). It is pantoporate throughout
the tribe Polemonieae with the exception of some species of Collomia which have
zonocolporate pollen (Stuchlik 1967a, 1967b; Taylor & Levin 1975; Chuang et al.
1978; Day unpubl.). By contract, the pollen is zonocolporate throughout the tribe
Gilieae as presently delimited with the exception of some pantoporate species of
Eriastrum (Stuchlik 1967a, 1967b; Taylor & Levin 1975; Day unpubl.).
Taylor & Levin (1975) related pollen characters to phylogenetic relationships in the
Polemoniaceae as these two variables were understood at that time. They suggested
that the zonocolporate condition was ancestral and the pantoporate condition was
derived in the family {op. cit., p. 1 10). We have more information about pollen
characters and a better system of classification today. The systematic distribution of
pore arrangement as we now know it, clearly indicates that the pantoporate condition is
ancestral, that the zonocolporate condition is derived, and that a zonocolporate
character state is definitive of the Gilia tribe with only a few exceptions.
