ABSTRACT
The wood anatomy of twenty three taxa of Junipents of the Western
Hemisphere was analyzed and data presented for rays/mm, growth ring size,
ray cell height, tracheid lumen size, tracheid wall thickness, and tracheid pit
and border diameter. The genus was found to be very homogenous in its
wood anatomy. Species differed only quantitatively and could not be
separated due to overlapping ranges for these data. The wood anatomical
characters examined were not useful for taxonomic purposes at the species
level in Juniperus.
KEY WORDS: Cupressaceae, Juniperus, wood anatomy
The Juniperus species of the Western Hemisphere include approximately 43 taxa.
They may be divided into several groups based on morphology (Zanoni & Adams
1978; Adams 1995) and DNA (Adams 1994; Adams & Demeke 1993):
Section Juniperus (acicular leaves, articulated at the base):
J. communis L. var. saxatilis Pall, and var. depressa Pursh
Section Sabina (scale like and decurrent leaves, not articulated at the base) (see serrate
and smooth leaves below):
Serrate leaves (most taxa are associated with arid lands):
/. angosturana R.P. Adams (= J. monosperma (Engehn.) Sarg. var. gracilis
Mart.); / ashei Buch.; J. califomica Carr.; J. coahuilensis (Mart.) Gaussen
ex R.P. Adams var. coahuilensis (= J. erythrocarpa Cory, in part, see
