Robinson: New species and combinations in Eupatorieae 351
long, densely pilosulous. Heads 4.5-5.5 nun high; involucral bracts 5 or 6, drying
brown, broadly elliptical to obovate, 3.0-3.5 mm long, 1.0-1.5 mm wide, margins
thin, subscarious, apex rounded and minutely toothed, outer surface glabrous. Florets
6 or 7 in a head; corollas creamy white, ca. 3 mm long, with narrow-tipped glandular
hairs outside on tube and throat, tube ca. 1 mm long, throat broadly funnelform, ca.
1.5 mm long, lobes ca. 0.5 mm long, densely low-papillose inside, with few glands
outside; anther thecae ca. 0.8 mm long; tips of style branches slightly broadened.
Cypselas ca. 1 .7 mm long, mostly glabrous, with few setulae near top; pappus of 20-
23 bristles ca. 2.5 mm long, slightly broadened at tips, apical cells with rounded tips.
Ophryosporus carchiensis is known only from the type collection. The species is
in the scandent group of the genus which includes 0. sodiroi Hieron. of southern
Ecuador and O. ovatus B.L. Rob. of northern Peni. The present species differs by the
weaker trinervation and coarser serration of the leaves, the less enlarged tips of the
style branches and the apically setuUferous rather than glanduliferous cypselas.
The three specimens of one collection described here as Ophryosporus carchiensis
were initially determined as O. serratifolius (H.B.K.) B.L. Rob. The latter was
questionably credited to Colombia, the only member of the genus credited to that
country. The type specimen of O. serratifolius in Paris was examined by B.L.
Robinson, who in 1930 indicated it was unquestionably an Ophryosporus. The
species has not been recollected from Colombia, and it is doubtfully cited from there.
The descriptions of O. serratifolius indicate a rather distinctive plant that matches most
closely specimens seen in this study from northern Perri {Ferreyra & Chanco 20436;
Uates Quiraz 1199). The latter collections agree with the original description in having
glabrous 6-angled stems, 5 involucral bracts and 5 florets. Most members of the
genus have terete stems.
If Ophryosporus serratifolius is properly Peruvian, then the new species, O.
carchiensis is the northernmost known representative of the genus.
