TINTINABULUM TENERRIMUM
In a previous paper (Grant 1999), a small species group consisting of Gilia
campamdata A. Gray, G. filiformis Parry ex A. Gray, and G. inyoensis I.M.
Johnston was excluded from Gilia. The long dormant genus Tintinabulum of Rydberg
(1917) was revived to accommodate them. A modem characterization of Tintinabulum
has been given recendy (Grant 1999) and does not need to be repeated here.
Tintinabulum was assigned to the tribe Gilieae.
In the same paper (Grant 1999), Gilia tenerrima A. Gray was transferred to
Allophyllum. This change was based on the finding of several Allophyllum-hkc
characters in G. tenerrima: namely, rounded brown seeds, liny black-lipped glands, a
type of leaf lobing and capsule dehiscence, and what was thought to be seiru-
pantoporate pollen. Since then it has been found that the pollen of G. tenemrrui is
atypical zonocolporate (Table 1) and that liny black-tipped glands occur in
Tintinabulum inyoensis (I.M. Johnston) V. Grant as well as in Allophyllum. The.se
findings weaken the case for an Allophylhim relationship.
