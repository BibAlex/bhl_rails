Cossypha anomala maccloiinii (Shelley)
Material. Southwestern Tanzania, Mt. Rungwe, 2600 m alt —
4 ^ ad, 3 $ ad, all in breeding condition (one female with ready
egg), Nov. 1962; weight: 4^23-26.5 (24.7) g, 2 $ 24, 26.5 g;
wing: 4 c^ 74-76 (74.5) mm, 3 9 68-70 (69.3) mm.
The range of this subspecies is from northern Nyasaland
(Vipya and Nyika Plateau) to southwestern Tanzania at the north-
ern end of Lake Nyasa (Mt. Rungwe and Poroto Range). The
population from the Rungwe Massif (of which the Poroto Range
is a part) was compared with three specimens from northern
Nyasaland and also with our two series of the subspecies njombe
Benson. The color of the tail and tail coverts was found to be
much less distinctly cinnamon than in njombe and almost, though
not quite as dull as in the Nyasaland birds. The difference from
the latter in the color of tail and back is so imperceptible that a
subspecific separation seems undesirable.

Material. Northeastern Tanzania, Mt. Meru, 1200 m alt,
near Engare Nanyuki — 2 $ ad, 22 July 1962; weight: 10.4, 11.2
g; wing: 59 mm. Northern Tanzania, Lake Manyara (western side)
at the escarpment, 1200 m alt — 1 $ , 5 Aug. 1962; weight: 11 g;
wing: 58 mm.
Praed and Grant (1955, vol. 2, p. 426) give the range of this
subspecies as "Southern and eastern Uganda, to Kenya . . . and
Tanganyika . . ., but not coastal areas nor the north-western area."
The specimens listed above differ strikingly in color from the
populations from northeastern, central and southern Tanzania,
treated in this paper, by the much richer tawny coloration of the
entire ventral side. In size they agree with the pale birds from
southern Tanzania (Iringa and Chimala), which are tentatively
listed as loringi Mearns.
