to griseiceps, differing from the latter by brighter olive-green,
nearly moss-green, mantle and by the yellow on ventral side being
more extensive, reaching closer to the black chest-bar. The cap is
in females on the average lighter gray than in males. Weight: 7 6 ad
10-12 (10.8) g, 4 9 ad 10-11.5 (10.7) g. Wing: 7 c5 ad 50-53
(51) mm, 4 9 ad 46-52 (48.7) mm.
Material. 7 ,^ ad, 4 9 ad. 1 specimen unsexed (gonads of most
specimens slightly enlarged) : southern Tanzania, Uzungwa Pla-
teau, 30 miles SSE of Iringa, near Itanga, 2100 m alt, 13-19
Sept. 1962.
A pedis thoracica yoimgi Kinnear.
Material. Southwestern Tanzania, Ufipa Plateau, 12 miles
NE of Sumbawanga, Mbisi Forest, 2500 m alt — 5 c5 ad, 2 9 ad, all
in breeding condition, 25-29 Nov. 1962; weight: 5 $ 12-13.5
(12.8) g, 2 9 12.5 g; wing: 5 i 53-57 (55.4) mm, 2 9 51, 52 mm.
Praed and Grant (1963, vol. 2, p. 237) give "Ufipa Plateau,
south-western Tanganyika to Nyasaland" as the range of this
subspecies. (Nyika and Vipya plateaux.)
In the Ufipa population above, the ventral side between chest-
bar and under tail coverts is white, lacking all yellow color; the
lower flanks are a very slightly olive tinged gray. The mantle is
clearly gray, without any olive tinge, and in comparison with our
broad series from Tukuyu district (type locality of murina Reiche-
now), distinctly lighter. In addition the Ufipa birds are larger.
Praed and Grant (1955, vol. 2, p. 397) have attributed the
Ufipa population to the subspecies yoitngi, described from Nyasa-
land, distinguishing that race from murina by its darker ("slate
color") dorsal side. Our Ufipa birds are, in comparison to a large
series from the Tukuyu district, dorsally not darker but on the
contrary, lighter. This fact raises some doubt whether the Ufipa
population is indeed youngi, as we have assigned it.
