cumscribing, but in the field this species is at once distinguishable
from placid us by its harsher timbre.
In color of plumage fischeri and placidiis are deceivingly sim-
ilar. But even here however the difference in the shades of the
dorsal side is distinct and constant: olive-brown in the former,
dark olive-green in the latter. There are some other differential
characters which have eluded description based on skins; 1 ) iris in
adults of fischeri paler than in placidus, whitish or yellowish-white,
compared with gray or grayish-brown in placidus, and 2) legs
plainly gray in fischeri, light bluish-gray in placidus. In addition,
there is a rather tangible difference between the two forms in the
structure of the bill, which is distinctly longer in fischeri than in
placidus (see measurement of culmen above), the profile of the
culmen being almost straight from base to tip in fischeri, slightly
and gradually curved in placidus. The structure of the bill of
fischeri thus approaches niadagascariensis Gmelin rather than
placidus, although in the former the bill is considerably longer.
The forms fischeri (Reichenow) and placidus (Shelley) are
ecologically specialized and so sharply differentiated that they can
exist side by side without geographical separation or dividing bar-
rier. They should therefore be regarded as distinct species rather
than as associated subspecies of the same species. This hypothesis
is additionally supported by the difference in the bills. In conse-
quence of this change, placidus will be tentatively treated below as
a subspecies of cabanisi (Sharpe).
Phyllastrephus cabanisi placidus (Shelley).
