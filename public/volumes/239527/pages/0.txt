Ploceus bicolor kigomaensis (Praed and Grant),
Material. Southwestern Tanzania, Ufipa Plateau, 2400 m
alt — 1 c^ ad, 1 $ ad, 1 juv, sex?, Nov. 1962; weight: 6 39 g, 5 35 g;
wing: i 90 mm, $ 84 mm. (New record: 12 miles NE of Sum-
bawanga at 2500 m alt.)
Peters (1962, vol. 15, p. 54) gives the range of this subspecies
as "Congo region, south of about lat. 5°S.; Northern Rhodesia,
east of about long. 24°E. and north of about lat. 12°S.; extreme
western Tanganyika. . ."
This subspecies comes rather close to amaiirocephalus
(Cabanis). Although it was compared in the original description
with amaurocephahis, the difference between the sexes in the color
of chin and throat was not considered. In fact the color of the
throat plumage of the female of kigomaensis is almost identical
with the male of amaurocephahis. But if the sexes are compared
separately it is possible to separate the two subspecies, particularly
the female.
Feathers of chin and throat are black and in the female more
or less sparsely tipped with yellow toward the chest, as they are
in the male of amaurocephahis. In the females of the latter sub-
species, the feathers of chin and throat are in contrast to kigo-
maensis dark gray and on the throat usually apically yellowish
tinged. In addition the mantle of kigomaensis is slightly darker
than in amaurocephahis and the black on the nape seems to be
slightly more extended and to run more gradually into the gray of
the mantle.

1962; weight: 2 i 22, 24 g, 9 ad, 3 $ juv 20.5-25 g; wing: 2 6 64,

Peters (1962, vol. 15, p. 7) gives the range of this species as
"Southwestern Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, extreme northern Tan-
ganyika, between Lake Natron and Kilimanjaro."
Within the area of investigation (NE of Mt. Meru) this bird
was found to be ecologically confined to extended stands of widely
