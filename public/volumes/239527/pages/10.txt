Peters (1937, vol. 3, p. 94) gives the range of this subspecies
as "Kenya . . . and Tanganyika . . . (west of the coastal plain
and excepting the parts occupied by S. d. permista) from Lake
Rudolph south to central Tanganyika. . . ."
The two specimens, collected in the semiarid plain west of
Same, have pure white under tail coverts, extensive white on belly
and white thighs, the characters by which the subspecies perspicil-
lata was distinguished in the original description. They differ in
this regard rather considerably from the population from southern
Tanzania treated below as permista Reichenow and also from
griseiventris Erlanger from northern Somaliland. Contra Praed
and Grant (1952, vol. 1, p. 473), we believe that these forms
should be maintained.
Streptopelia decipiens permista (Reichenow).
Material. Southern Tanzania, near Chimala (about 58 miles
east of Mbeya), 1400 m alt — 3 $ ad in breeding condition, 12-16
Jan. 1963; wing: 155-158 (156) mm.
Peters (1937, vol. 3, p. 94) gives the range of this subspecies
as "East Africa, east of the Congo watershed and west of the
Rift Valley, northern Uganda and southwestern Ethiopia, south
through western Tanganyika ... to Nyasaland."
The habitat of this form near Chimala is similar to that re-
ported for perspicillata. It is also flat, open country with few,
scattered trees and much bare ground; but it differs by being
more moist, fertile, and extensively cultivated instead of semiarid.
The under tail coverts of these specimens are gray, apically
whitish; white on belly much less extensive than in perspicillata,
restricted to the middle, or wanting; thighs gray. The population
from Chimala thus differs distinctly from perspicillata of northern
Tanzania but resembles fairly closely specimens from Ethiopia.
From the latter these birds differ only slightly by a lighter, more
grayish-brown, color on the upper parts.
