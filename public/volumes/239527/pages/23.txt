meters above the ground; the song had a soft and very pleasant
timbre and was continuously repeated while the bird from time to
time changed its perch; the stanza was composed of three two-
syllabic notes, with the accent always on the second syllable, which
was about equally low in the first and third, much higher in the
second note: "tjeru--tjeri--tjer u." The singer was in
adult plumage but not in breeding condition and the time was
September. This thus may have been a subsong.
Pogonochichla stellata keniensis Mearns.
Material. Northern Tanzania, Mt. Meru, eastern slopes (near
Momella), 1800 m alt — 2 6 ad, 4 9 ad, Impartially in nestling,
partially in subad (olive) plumage, 16-25 June 1962; weight:
2 6 ad 18.5, 20 g, 4 ? 16-19.5 (17.6) g, 6 subad 19 g; n7/7^.- 2 S

Moreau (1951) gives the range of this subspecies as the
highlands of Kenya, both sides of the Rift, but excluding Elgon,
Marsabit, Taita and the Chyulu range; in northern Tanzania the
mountain masses of Loliondo, Oldeani, Ketumbeine, Essimingor,
Mondul and Longido. Contra Moreau loc. cit. the population of
Mt. Meru is included in this subspecies rather than giittijer (Rei-
chenow and Neumann).
This series of specimens from Mt. Meru was compared with a
series of birds from Mt. Kilimanjaro and a series from Mt. Kenya.
It was found that all specimens from Kihmanjaro were dorsally
distinctly darker than the birds of the two other populations, the
color of the back being deeper, almost brownish-oUve in Kili-
manjaro birds, rich olive-green in specimens from Mt. Kenya and
almost the same in the Meru birds. The subspecies keniensis
Mearns is therefore maintained in accordance with Moreau"s
review (1951), but contra Moreau, Mt. Meru has been included
in the range of that subspecies. The name giittijer (Reichenow and
Neumann) thus would be restricted to the Kilimanjaro population.
