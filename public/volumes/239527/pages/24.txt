pale flesh, sometimes with slight lilac or grayish tinge. The two
specimens from Uzungwa Plateau are distinctly heavier and larger
than the population from Mt. Rungwe and seemingly intermediate
between subspecies sharpei (Shelley) and usambarae (Macdonald)
(see below).
These birds inhabit thickets of low bushes covering the ground
of high mountain cloud-forests near to their fringes. Hidden and
elusive, they keep close to the ground but are rarely seen on it,
except when feeding on driver ants.
The song was never heard. The warning call is a striking,
sharp, rattling sound, which can be circumscribed imperfectly as
"terrrr."
Erithacus sharpei usambarae (Macdonald).
Material. Northern Tanzania, East Usambara Mts., near
Amani, 11 00- 1200 m alt — 2 c^ ad, 1 9 ad, 1 9 subad, 2 $ juv, April
1962; weight: 2 c^ ad 12.5, 15 g, 2 9 13, 15 g, 2 i juv 15-15.5 g;
wing: 2 i ad 67, 69 mm, 2 9 62, 63 mm, 2 i juv 66, 68 mm.
The range of this subspecies is northern Tanzania: Eastern
Usambara Mts. and Nuguru Mts.
According to the original description, (Macdonald, 1940) this
subspecies can be distinguished from sharpei (Shelley) in "having
the white area extended to the breast, not limited to the abdomen,
and in this white being purer in color. . . ." The comparison of our
series from the type locality and from southern Tanzania, which
are both prepared in exactly the same way, does not confirm the
existence of a tangible diflference in extent of white between the
two. But the white is indeed on the average (not in each specimen)
somewhat purer in the series from the type locality. Such a differ-
ence alone would perhaps scarcely justify the nomenclatoral sep-
aration of the two subspecies, if there were not in addition a slight
but seemingly constant difference in the intensity of the russet
tinge on sides of throat and on ear coverts.
