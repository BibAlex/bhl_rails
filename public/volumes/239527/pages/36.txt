Praed and Grant (1955, vol. 2, p. 393) give the range of this
species as "East-central to south-western Tanganyika . . . and
Portuguese East Africa."
The typical habitat is the dry brachystegia woods with sparsely
distributed trees and partially grassy, partially bare ground.
The description of the song as given by Praed and Grant, 1955,
is not correct. The song is composed of a trill of three syllables
with accentuated first syllable, which is repeated with short intervals
monotonously for a long time. By its monotony it strongly reminds
one of the call of a tinker bird (Pogoniulus). It can be approxi-
mately circumscribed as "dididi dididi dididi dididi. . ." in endless
sequence. There is nothing "flute-like" in the timbre of this song,
which sounds rather unmelodic. The singing male is always perched
in the crown of a tall tree, sometimes even on the top of a dead one.
Calamonastes simplex undosiis (Reichenow).

Praed and Grant (1955, vol. 2, p. 394) give the range of these
specimens as "South-western Kenya . . . and Tanganyika . . .
from southern end of Lake Victoria to Tabora, Uluguru, Iringa
and the Ufipa Plateau." (And northeastern Northern Rhodesia.)
The habitat of this form agrees with stierlingi Reichenow:
open woodland of brachystegia type, with partially bare ground
but seemingly restricted to higher altitudes than stierlingi. These
birds seem to dwell much on the ground where they were observed
several times walking around for long periods of time in search
of food.
The singing male is perched well hidden and almost invisible
in the foliage of the crown of a tall tree. It is very shy and will,
at the approach of an observer, at once stop singing and shortly
thereafter either fly away to continue its song in another, far
remote tree crown, or, more often, dive straight down to the
