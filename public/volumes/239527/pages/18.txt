Peters (1960, vol. IX, p. 270) gives the range of this sub-
species as "The highlands of Kenya .... east of the great Rift
Valley from Marsabit, Mt. Kenya and Chyulu Hills south through
Tanganyika .... Highlands (Kilimanjaro, Usambara, Nguru,
Uluguru, etc.) to Portuguese East Africa (Mt. Namuli) and south-
ern Nyasaland (Malanje)."
The weights and wing measurements of the 36 specimens
listed above separately for 6 high mountain ranges of Tanzania
show that there is little difference in weight between the sexes,
while the length of wings of females is constantly 4-9 mm shorter
than of males. There is no tangible difference in weights and wings
between all listed populations except Mt. Meru, where both sexes
are slighdy longer winged than the rest. All populations agree
exactly in color.
Almost all specimens listed are lighter in weight than Phyl-
lastrephus fischeri (Reichenow), while the wing length shows no
tangible difference between these two species.
