when Heinrich had shot a mungo (Mimgos miingo) crossing his
path. The mungo (mongoose) disappeared in the tangle of low
ground vegetation. Within seconds a number of Apalis thoracica
murina appeared, uttering continuously the call described and
hopping in great excitement around a certain spot, almost on the
ground. When the plants were cut at the place indicated by the
warblers, the dying mungo was found.

The range of this subspecies is the Uluguru Mts. only. The birds
inhabit dense ground vegetation, particularly on clearings in the
midst of montane forests, or the fern thickets contiguous to their
outer edges. They were always met in pairs, hunting for food most
of the time close to the ground and well under cover of the rank
tangle of low plants. They are not very shy and ascend occasion-
ally into bushes up to 6 m above the ground.
The usual call sounds like "tjitjitjitji." It is somewhat similar
to Sathrocercus, but more rapid in sequence, slightly higher and
softer,

Description. Belongs to the group of forms with clearly olive-
green mantle and extensively yellow colored ventral side, thus
strikingly differing from all populations occuring farther south in
Tanzania. Similar in color only to uluguru Neumann, the next
neighbor to the north, and also to griseiceps Reichenow and Neu-
mann from Mt. Kilimanjaro, but quite different from the popula-
tions between Uluguru Mts. and Kilimanjaro (Usambara and Pare
Mts.). Differs clearly from uluguru by constantly having a white
belt between the black chest-bar and the yellow on lower chest and
abdomen, by the two pairs of outer rectrices being clearly and
more extensively white and by the cap being darker. More similar
