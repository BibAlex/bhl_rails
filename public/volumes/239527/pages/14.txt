March 25, 1966 Avifauna of Tanzania I 9
From the open bush and savannah-wood country in hilly situa-
tions between 1000 and 1700 m alt, which is their habitat, these
birds like to visit adjacent plantations to feed on ripening papaya
fruits.
Lybius leucocephalus lynesi Praed and Grant.
Material. Southern Tanzania, Iringa â€” 3 6 ad, 5 2 ad; weight:
3 6 70-81 (71.7) g, 5 $ 64-71 (67.2) g; wing: 3 i 95-98 (96) mm,
5 2 95-97 (95.4) mm.
Praed and Grant (1952, vol. 1, p. 707) give the range of
this subspecies in Tanzania as Dodoma Province and Iringa Dis-
trict.
There is an amazing variability in the extent and distribution
of the black color on the tail. In fact no two specimens are exactly
alike. One specimen is predominantly white with only narrow
black bases. Another has the tail almost entirely black. In others
the median pair, or two pairs, of rectrices are entirely white, while
all others are more or less extensively black, or, on the contrary,
the outer rectrices are white and the inner pairs are partially black.
Sometimes the black extends further on one, either the inner or
outer, web of a feather toward its white apex than on the other.
Lybius leucocephalus pareensis new subspecies.
Type. 6 ad (YPM no. 84275), Collector's no. 33906, col-
lected by Gerd Heinrich, 25 May 1962, northeastern Tanzania,
northeastern slopes of Pare Mts., near Same.
Description. Agrees with subspecies senex Reichenow from
the central districts of Kenya Colony and country east of Mt.
Kenya in the lack of white markings on wing coverts, but differs
by having the belly and flanks gray, suffused with whitish. The
underside thus is similar to subspecies albicauda Shelley of south-
ern Kenya Colony and northern districts of Tanzania except flanks
and belly are, in the type, distinctly lighter than in the latter
subspecies. Differs in addition rather strongly from albicauda by
the lack of white markings on wing coverts. Weight: 1 6 ad 72 g.
Wing: 1 c5 ad 90 mm.
