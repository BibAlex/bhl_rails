problematical. At present we follow Peters' Check-List, keeping
australis separate from eugenius.
It may be mentioned that the Angolan populations of latirostris
latirosths diflfer strikingly from latirostris australis by the color of
the feet, which is light yellow in the former, olive-brown in the
latter. Perhaps the foot color can help to unravel the complex
taxonomy of this group of forms. It seems possible that two sibling
species are involved — one a high mountain bird, the other an
inhabitant of lowland jungle, the two being similar in color of
plumage but different in ecology, behavior, voice and color of feet.
Phyllastrephus fischeri fischeri? (Reichenow)

Peters (1960, vol. 9, p. 270) gives the range of this form
as 'The lowland forests of the coastal belt of East Africa from
just north of the Tana River to Portuguese East Africa (Netia)."
This form inhabits evergreen, dense and tangled, tropical jun-
gles, only at low altitudes, seemingly up to 600 m alt at the most.
In the West Usambaras this form and placidus (Shelley), at the
first glance, seem to be sympatric, In fact they are ecologically most
sharply separated from each other, fischeri being confined to the
damp lowland jungle at the foot of the mountain, with its densest
population at about 300 m alt (stray specimens occasionally com-
ing up to about 600 m), placidus inhabiting the cool high moun-
tain cloud-forests above 1000 m alt; fischeri thus does not replace
placidus geographically, but it is separated from the latter ecolog-
ically. The only reason that fischeri does not penetrate farther
westward into the territory of placidus is evidently the fact that
there are almost no tropical lowland jungles in existence between
the East Usambaras and the western districts of Tanzania.
