low thickets in the ravines of high mountain cloud-forests where
they dwell permanently on or near the ground. The breeding season
coincides with the beginning of the rainy season, as indicated by
the condition of the gonads of all specimens collected during
November and December.

This form differs distinctly from albigularis (Reichenow) in the
extended and deep black color on the sides of the neck, as de-
scribed in detail above under the latter subspecies. In this character
it agrees with the population from Mt. Rungwe. It is distinguished
from the latter as described by Benson by the much brighter cin-
namon upper and under tail coverts and by the predominantly
cinnamon color of the four outer pairs of rectrices. The darker
color shade on back and rump seems to be a less tangible dif-
ference. The population from the Uzungwa Plateau (about 300 km
NNW of the type locality) agrees exactly with topotypes.
The habitat of the subspecies corresponds generally with that
described for albigularis. On the Uzungwa Plateau it was found to
be more common in small relict patches of dense tropical jungle
in the vicinity of the continuous forest than in the latter.
At the type locality all birds collected during October were
approaching breeding condition, and males were diligently singing.
The song is rather soft and of a slightly melancholic timbre,
composed of three or four tones only, the second of which is
strongly accentuated, somewhat drawling, shghtly tremulous and
about four tones higher than the others: "tuo - t j r r i o - t u."
The singing male stays hidden in the low tangle, changing from time
to time its perching place. The alarm note is a hoarse "t j r a . . .
t j r a."
