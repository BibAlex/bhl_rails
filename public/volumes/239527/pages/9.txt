4 Postilla Yale Peabody Museum No. 96
According to Peters (1937, vol. 3, p. 64) this subspecies is
known only from the Uhehe district of Tanzania. He also hsts this
subspecies with question mark and as "very doubtfully distinct"
and Praed and Grant (1952, vol. 1, p. 490) suppressed it. The
series from the type locality at hand was compared with ample
series of guinea guinea Linne and of guinea phaeonotus G. R.
Gray. The Iringa birds are easily distinguished from these sub-
species. They differ from guinea exactly as in the original descrip-
tion by being considerably darker gray on the entire ventral side.
From the similarly dark South African subspecies phaeonotus,
they differ by much lighter lower rump and upper tail coverts, these
parts being pale gray, partially with white fringes of feathers,
giving the lower rump and upper tail coverts a nearly whitish
appearance. The subspecies uheJiensis thus combines the approxi-
mate color of underparts of piuieonotus with the approximate color
of rump and upper tail coverts of guinea and has to be considered
as a valid taxon. There are two additional differences from guinea;
1 ) the white on apices of wing coverts, particularly of the lesser
and median ones, is more restricted, and, 2) the pale gray on the
ends of the pointed neck and breast feathers is also more restricted,
giving these parts a predominantly red-brown appearance.
