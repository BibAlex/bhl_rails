Artisornis metopias (Reichenow).
Praed and Grant (1955, vol. 2, p. 420) give the range of this
species as Tanzania from the Usambara Mts. to the Uluguru Mts.,
Nguru Hills, Luwiri-Kitessi Forest, Songea district and Unangu,
Portuguese East Africa.
This is a bird of the low and dense ground-vegetation of the
humid mountain forests, to be found at altitudes from about
1600 m alt up to 2500 m alt. It is not quite so elusive and adept
at concealment as Sathrocercus, though it rarely appears higher
than one meter above the ground.
The breeding season lies between October and February.
Three nests have been found, one on 1 Dec. 1961 in the Uluguru
Mts., containing one egg. The second egg was laid 3 Dec. Another
nest, found in the Usambara Mts. by Bernd Heinrich, 21 Feb.
1962, contained two half-grown young birds; the third nest, found
but two days later, contained two fresh eggs. The eggs, so far
undescribed, are fairly large as compared to the size of the bird,
oval, scarcely narrowed toward one end. The color is white, with
dark red-brown marks spread over the entire surface, and with
some pale grayish marks in between. All three nests were only
about V2 meter above the ground and sewn between the jagged
leaves of the same species of a low plant.
The material collected by the Heinrich expedition suggests that
the Tanzania populations of this species should be divided into
three subspecies as follows:
Artisornis metopias metopias (Reichenow).
Material. Northern Tanzania, West Usambara Mts., near
Lushoto and near Shume, 1700-2100 m alt â€” 5 <^ ad, 1 9 ad, 3 9
juv (gonads of specimens from Feb. moderately enlarged; speci-
mens from March not in breeding condition), Feb. and March
1962; weight: 5 6 8.5-9.5 (9) g, 9 ad 9 g, 2 9 juv 8-8.5 g; M-ing:
5 i 47-50 (48) mm, 9 ad 44 mm, 2 9 juv 45 mm.
Western Usambara Mts. is the range of this subspecies. The
population of Nguru Mts. should probably be included in this
subspecies.
