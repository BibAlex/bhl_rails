scattered "flute -acacias"' (Acacia seyal Del. = flute acacia or
whistling tree) on very poor, almost barren ground. The species
was not seen in any other habitat. Several nesting colonies have
been observed. Although the birds were not in breeding condition
at the time of observation, they visited the nests occasionally.
A colony comprised several neighbouring trees of the strange
pygmy acacia, which as a rule is not higher than 4-6 meters. Each
tree within a colony bore about 2-5 nests.
The measurements of the series from the foot of Mt. Meru
agree with the measurements given by Friedmann, 1937, for the
subspecies kapitensis.
Pseudonigrita arnaudi iringae new subspecies.
Type. 6 ad (YPM no. 48278), Collector's no. 35025, collected
by Gerd Heinrich, 1 Sept. 1962, southern Tanzania, 15 miles
NE of Iringa.
Description. Difl'ers from arnaudi arnaudi Bonaparte and
from arnaudi australo-abyssinicus Benson rather strikingly by
considerably smaller size (lesser weight and shorter wing) and
also in the color of the cap and mantle, which is much darker,
ash-gray, and has on the mantle a distinctly scaly appearance, the
fringes of the feathers being infuscated. In small size as well as
in the color and scaly appearance of the mantle, iringae agrees
with dorsalis Reichenow from the northwestern and central part
of Tanzania from which it differs by the predominantly black tail
with only the apical quarters or less of the rectrices being grayish-
buff. Weight: 2 6 ad 16, 16.5 g, 3 9 ad 16-18 g, U juv 17 g
(average of all 7 specimens including the one with unidentified sex
16.6 g). Wing: 2 6 ad 59.5, 61.5 mm, 3 $ ad 61.5 mm, 1 i juv 61.5
mm (average of all specimens 61 mm).
Material. 2 :^ ad, 3 9 ad, 1 9 ? ad, 1 <i juv, none in breeding
condition, all from type locality.
Ecological note. The habitat of this bird is distinctly, though
not very strongly, different from the one discribed above for
arnaudi arnaudi. In contrast to the latter form, arnaudi iringae
inhabits a more humid area with heavier soil and denser grass,
a "park landscape" with scattered, large acacia trees and bush
