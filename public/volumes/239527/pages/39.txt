This bird is an inhabitant of the treeless undulating parts of
the Southern Highlands of Tanzania in altitudes around 2000
meters where it keeps to the marshy meadows of river valleys or
other marshy deepenings. The call has, in contrast to croceus
(Viellot) and aiirantigula Reichenow an unmelodic, slightly hoarse
ring; it is one-syllabic and sounds like "t j a." Flushed specimens
usually utter a three-syllabic twitter, several times repeated in rapid
sequence, like: "t j 1 1 j e 1 i p. . . . t j i t j e 1 i p. . . . t j 1 1 j e 1 i p."
The breeding season coincides with the beginning of the big rains.
According to the state of the gonads of the specimens listed above
it lies between November and January.
The subspecies occupies the Southern Highlands of Tanzania.
