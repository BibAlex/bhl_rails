coast to coast, the sympatric occurance of both forms, at least in
the southern part of the range of the former, although ecologically
separated, and the differences in voice and behavior — all suggest
that brunneiceps should be regarded as a distinct species rather
than as a subspecies of leiicophrys. The reported hybridization of
both forms at Simba (van Someren, 1922) seems doubtful and
needs confirmation based on careful research.. The apparently
vicarious distribution of the two forms may be deceiving, as it has
been in other cases where the two geographical areas involved are
fundamentally different in ecology.

to the mountains north, east and west of Lake Nyasa.
