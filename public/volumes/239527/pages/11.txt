9 juv 212, 213 mm. Southwestern Tanzania, Ufipa Plateau, 12
miles NE of Sumbawanga, 2500 m alt — 1 i ad, 1 9 ad, both with
gonads slightly enlarged; weight: 6 401 g, 9 309 g; wing: 6 229
mm, 9 207 mm.
Praed and Grant give the range of these specimens as "Angola
and Damaraland, Tanganyika .... to Northern Rhodesia and
Mashonaland, Southern Rhodesia." According to their description
(1952, vol. 1, p. 542), the forehead is "pale brick red with a
silvery wash" and "The sexes are alike." The latter statement
seems to be incorrect as the above series of specimens shows a
rather pronounced sexual dimorphism. Only in the adult female
the forehead (from base of bill to slightly beyond level with eyes)
is pinkish-red with a slight silvery wash, whereas the head of the
adult male is entirely gray. In immature females the crown, cheeks
and sides of the neck are more or less extensively mottled with
pinkish- or orange-red. That the forehead is not red in the adult
plumage of both sexes is already indicated by the color plate of this
species in their plate 35, which shows a specimen with uniformly
silvery-gray head — an adult male.
The two birds from Ufipa Plateau differ from the Uluguru
population by having the feathers of the crown and nape extensively
infused with blackish (in the i ) or blackish-olive (in the 9 ).

The bird calls mostly during the hours before sunrise, between
about 3 and 5:30 a.m., and during the day mainly if the weather
is foggy and humid. The caller is usually extremely well hidden in
the densest, low tangle of the jungle, rarely in the crown of a
smaller tree. The two very different calls, described below, are
peculiar to this species. By collecting the calling bird, we have
shown that both calls were uttered by the male. The most usually
heard call is tri-syllabic. Each syllable is sharply separated from
the following by indication of an intermission and each syllable is
