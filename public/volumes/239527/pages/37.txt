ground, taking cover in some dense low bushes or other ground
vegetation.
The song consists of only one sound of metallic timbre which
is repeated endlessly and monotonously in fairly slow sequence.
It is rather loud compared with the small size of the bird and
reminds one strongly of the calling of a tinker bird.

Praed and Grant (1955, vol. 2, p. 134) give the range of this
subspecies as "Eastern Tanganyika . . . from Mt. Kilimanjaro
and the Usambara Mts. to the Uluguru Mts. and the Pugu Hills."
The iris of this bird is white or yellowish white and the feet,
lilac or lilac-pink.
A bird of the damp, tropical lowland jungle, it is found
wherever heavy growth of lianas occurs among the bushes and
trees of lower and median height. Tangles of lianas form the true
habitat of this species. It inhabits the lower and median floor of
the liana wood, but is usually not found in the ground- thickets.
It searches the tangle of vines surrounding a tree trunk or other
clusters of hanging vegetation in the same characteristic way as
concotor Hartlaub or flavicans Cassin in West Africa, gliding skill-
fully and in a lively manner, but without hurry, through a maze of
twigs and lianas, and often climbing effortlessly up a hanging
liana stem.
Neumann (1920) has based the description of his genus
Suaheliornis on this species, separating it generically from
Macrosphenus only by the longer tail (in relation to the length
of the wing). In all other ways including plumage, bill, ecology
and behavior these forms are similar. The sole difference in the
relative length of the tail hardly merits generic distinction.
