March 25, 1966 Avifauna of Tanzania I 29
Artisornis metopias altiis (Friedmann).
Material. Northern Tanzania, Uluguru Mts., near Morogoro,
1000-1800 m alt â€” 2 6 ad, 3 9 ad, all in breeding condition, 22-30
Nov. 1961; weight: 1 6 9.5 g, 1 9 9.5 g; wing: 2 6 46, 49 mm, 3 ?
43-46 (44.3) mm.
The range of this subspecies is the Uluguru Mts. only.
This form differs in both sexes from metopias metopias (Rei-
chenow) by chestnut coloration on sides of throat and neck being
more intensive and extending farther onto the throat, making the
white longitudinal median band on throat narrower than in
metopias metopias and somewhat less bright. Upper breast and
side of body is rather strongly gray tinged, as in metopias metopias.
The name of this form has been synonymized by Praed and
Grant (1955, vol. 2, p. 518) with metopias ?}ietopias (Reiche-
now). The series of specimens recorded above from the Uluguru
Mts., type locality of Opife.x alt us Friedmann, shows enough dif-
ferentiation from metopias to maintain Friedmann's name with
subspecific status.
Artisornis metopias pallidus new subspecies.
Type. 9 ad (YPM no. 48277), Collector's no. 35171, col-
lected by Gerd Heinrich, 15 Sept. 1962, Tanzania, Itanga (ca.
30 miles SSE of Iringa) at 2100 m alt.
Description. Differs from Artisornis metopias metopias and
from metopias altns by the almost entirely white chest and belly
and also by restriction of the gray on the sides of the body. Chest-
nut on sides of throat and neck less extended than in metopias
altiis and thus agreeing with A . metopias metopias. Weight: Type,
9 9 g. Wing: Type, 9 46 mm, i from Mdando Forest 47 mm.
Material. 1 c^ ad in breeding condition from Mdando Forest,
about 30 miles south of Njombe (southwestern end of Livingstone
Mts.) seems to belong to this subspecies, the extent of gray on
chest and sides of the body is intermediate between population
from type locality of metopias metopias (Reichenow) and holotype
of this subspecies.
