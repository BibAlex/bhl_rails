March 25, 1966 Avifauna of Tanzania I 39
Macronyx ameliae winfoni Sharpe.
Material. Northern Tanzania, eastern and northeastern foot
of Mt. Meru, 1500-1600 m alt— 3 ^ ad, 3 $ ad, 5-23 July 1962;
weight: 3 6 33.4-34 (33.7) g, 3 ? 31.5-34 (33.2) g; wing: 3 6 91-
93 (92) mm, 3 $ 86-89 (87) mm. Northern Tanzania, western
shore of Lake Manyara, 1200 m alt — 1 c^ ad, 3 Aug. 1962; weight:
3 1 g; wing: 90 mm.
The range of this species is western Kenya and northern Tan-
zania. (The limits of the range need further investigation.) It
inhabits treeless grasslands on the highland downs at altitudes from
about 1000-1600 meters, seemingly preferring the vicinity of
natron-containing lakes (Lake Manyara, Maerker Lakes, NE
of Mt. Meru).
Praed and Grant describe the male of this form as having
"a broad black collar across chest and running upwards to
gape. . ." None of the 4 adult males recorded above has such a
collar. Instead they show a chest band of fairly narrow black
streaks, similar to the females, from which they differ only by the
salmon or salmon-tinged throat and by the more extensive and
richer salmon belly. According to the examination of the fresh
skull all 4 specimens have been identified as adults (although
none of them was in breeding condition.)
Neither Praed and Grant (1955, vol. 2, p. 80) (1955) nor
Mayr and Greenway (Peters, 1960, vol. 9, p. 144) nor Traylor,
(1963) have divided ameliae De Tarragon (described from Natal)
subspecifically. The birds from northern Tanzania differ rather
strikingly from specimens from South Africa in their much paler,
salmon-pink, color of throat and belly, much shorter bills and
basally more extensively black outer rectrices. The subspecific
name wintoni Sharpe is therefore applied to the East-African
population.
Macronyx julleborni julleborni Reichenow.

in breeding condition, Nov. 1962. Southwestern Tanganyika, near
