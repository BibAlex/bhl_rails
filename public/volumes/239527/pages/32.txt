A pedis thoracica pareensis new subspecies.
Type, i ad (YPM no. 84281), Collector's no. 34022, collected
by Gerd Heinrich, northeastern Tanzania, Pare Mts., Chome,
1900 m alt, 1 June 1962.
Description. Belongs to the group of forms with gray mantle
and predominantly white ventral side, thus strongly contrasting
with northern neighbor race, griseiceps Reichenow and Neumann
(Kilimanjaro). More similar to the southern neighbor murina
Reichenow (West Usambara Mts.), from which pareensis differs
by strong restriction (nearly obsolescence) of the yellow on under-
side to the very end of the belly and the end of lower flanks.
Similar also by the almost entirely white ventral side to youngi
Kinnear (Ufipa Plateau). Differs from youngi by having a little
yellow on the apex of belly and flanks and in addition by darker
mantle and olive tinged rump. Weight: 2 ,J ad 12.5, 13 g. Wing:
