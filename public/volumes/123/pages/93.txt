extreme pain being evident both in his face and from his attitude. A
cast of what is believed to be a statue of Chahhiuhtlicue, Goddess of
Water, was also shown us. The statue came from a mountain near
Tlalmenalco. This divinity was sister to the gods of water, Tlaloques.
A yoke from Orizaba is in the collection. This is made of stone and
is of a green color. At the top of the yoke is a head, like that of a
snake, and the entire yoke is polished. These were used on the occa-
sion of human sacrifices, and were placed over the heads of the victims
whose hearts were to be taken out. Next in order is the cast of a
statue of a woman who, by her costume, appears to have belonged
to the Aztec nobility. Around her waist is a rattlesnake, and this
fact leads to the supposition that the statue is that of the snake-
woman the goddess Cihnacoatl, from whom the Aztecs believe the
entire human race has descended. There are also in the collection
casts of two feathered serpents and other mythological animals ; of a
Leathered Serpent.
humpback, who is supposed to have been a son of KingTizoc, to whom
reference has been made ; of the water-goddess, etc. Conspicuous, too,
are two funeral urns, beautifully carved inside, and with skulls upon
the convex surface. A great vase or tub is in this series. From vari-
ous water-animals sculptured on the base it is supposed to be com-
memorative of the deluge, but little is known of its meaning. A large
grasshopper ( Ghapolin) stands near the tub, and is supposed to be
commemorative of the end of the wanderings of the Aztec tribe which
terminated at Chapultepec (hill of the grasshopper).
Neither time nor space will allow a detailed description of some of
the smaller casts in the collection. It is, however, safe to say that
every piece has connected with it an interesting history.
