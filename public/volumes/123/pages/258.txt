244 THE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY.
experiments and observations have necessarily to be of short duration,
and that they have insufficient data upon which to base their conclu-
sions. If, now, we can introduce the scientific method of original re-
search and experiment into our workshops ; if, instead of one experi-
menter, there may be dozens of wide-awake, observing, and energetic
men in search of scientific and mechanical truth ; if, instead of one
experiment at a time, there may be several under different circum-
stances going on at the same time ; if, instead of continuing a single
day or a single week, these experiments in the workshop may be con-
tinued through months and even years ; if, in other words, our work-
men, or a large number of them, can be taught to regard the work-
shops themselves as great laboratories for continued research, experi-
ment, and observation with a view to gaining original information for
practical purposes then there need be no more complaint in the realm
of applied science about inadequate data and uncertain conclusions.
This system would also furnish a stimulus to invention and im-
provement and to the adaptation of economical devices. The im-
portance of technical training is so well recognized among European
manufacturers that many employers are said to be in the habit of
sending to home and foreign exhibitions, at their own expense, those
of their young people most advanced in technological study and of
quickest perceptions, in order that they may study new inventions,
machinery, etc. ; while many others allow their apprentices and young
men to leave their work an hour or more before stopping-time, on
class-nights, without abatement of their wages. Many European
manufacturers and the managers of some foreign railway-works now
call the particular attention of their workmen to new designs, improve-
ments in machinery, and methods of work, and to successful inventions
that have been made by other workmen trained in technical schools.
Such workmen can not fail to become constantly on the alert for op-
portunities to accomplish something above the performance of mere
routine duty ; whereas, lacking scientific knowledge and technical
training, they would probably be contented to go on in the old paths
of routine, and might even oppose improvement.
Among other advantages of technological schools adapted to the
wants and standard of the workmen who are to attend them are, that
they will do much to prevent and overcome labor troubles, which
often arise through misunderstandings that the instruction given by
such schools and their influence w r ould anticipate ; that their effect
will be to diminish the tendency to dissipation among the w r orkmen,
and increase their efficiency ; and that, by providing useful and con-
genial employment for the leisure time of apprentices, they will, pro-
moting good habits and discouraging the formation of bad ones, have
an especially beneficial effect upon their future. Workshop-schools
have the further advantage over others that, giving easy access to
machinery, and directly applying the principles and theory learned in
