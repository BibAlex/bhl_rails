HYGIENE AS A BASIS OF MORALS. 71
houses, which secure an equal distribution of the population fixed, at
the time of building, at one hundred thousand people, domiciled in
twenty thousand houses, which are scattered over an area of four thou-
sand acres. Crowded alleys in the immediate rear of streets lined with
spacious dwellings are wholly avoided ; neither are tall structures, over-
shadowing the streets (a veritable shadow of death), anywhere per-
mitted, four stories, aggregating sixty feet in height, being the limit
with which all must comply. Every house has its foundations on solid
arches of brick, through which air freely flows, and down whose slopes
all currents of water are carried away this arrangement preventing
the entrance of ground-air into the house an unavoidable mischief in
the present style of architecture, the air of all our houses being more
or less contaminated from this source. When the soil, naturally impure
from the presence of carbonic-acid gas, is honeycombed, as in this city,
with cesspools, and saturated with leakage from sewer-pipes, gas-pipes,
and the soakings of filth-laden streets, the danger of contamination
of houses from ground-air assumes considerable importance.
The liberal extent of territory occupied by our model city allows
room for several broad boulevards, which constitute the chief thor-
oughfares, beneath each of which is a railway operated by electricity,
where the heavy traffic of the city is carried on ; while all the streets
are so broad as to be always thoroughly ventilated, and at times
flooded with sunlight. In the city of Hygeia, as described by its pro-
jector, the streets run from east to west and from north to south, as in
this, our own favored town ; but in the founding of Ethica, while
keeping to the right-angled plan (though at a considerable sacrifice of
artistic effect), I would choose the diagonals of these directions as
tending to secure a more equal distribution of sunlight to both sides
of the streets, and to all sides of the houses ; since in at least one
European city the death-rate has been found uniformly higher on the
shady side than on the sunny side of the streets. All the open spaces
in the rear of the houses are occupied as gardens, and all public build-
ings, including warehouses, stables, etc., are surrounded with gardens
or open lawns, which add no less to the beauty than to the health of the
city. The streets are paved, not exactly with gold, but with something
equally impermeable to moisture, and far more agreeable to the eye,
hence more conducive to comfort and health a material comparatively
noiseless and as susceptible of a clean sweep as Philadelphia at the last
election. At present, concrete combines these qualities in a higher de-
gree than any other material thus far employed, but even this leaves
much to be desired, and there is room for invention in this direction.
Surface-railways are not permitted in Hygeia, the underground roads
being regarded as sufficient for all purposes ; but in the proposed
city of Ethica, underground roads will be used for merchandise only ;
passenger-railways will be elevated, thus reducing to a minimum the
number of employes compelled to spend their working-hours under-
