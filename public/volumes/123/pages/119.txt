AMONG THE TRANSYLVANIAN SAXONS. 107
I set two roses in my mothers land
mo: her, dearest mother, give me again thy hand!
1 must away, I must be gone ;
When to return, God knows alone !
When to return? when the black crow
Bears on his wing plumes white as snow!
I set two roses in my brothers land
brother, dearest brother, give me again thy hand!
1 s?t two roses in my sisters land
sister, deare-t sister, give me again thy hand!
1 must away, I must be gone ;
VVIien to return, God knows alone!
When to return ? when the black crow
Bears on his wing plumes white as snow 1
I set again two roses tinder a bu*h of yew
O comrades, dearest playmates, I say my last adieu !
No roses shall I set more in this my native land
parents, brother, comrades, give me once more your hand I
1 must away, I must lie gone ;
When to return, God knows alone !
When to return ? when the black crow
Bears on his wing plumes white as snow !
And when I came to the dark fir-tree,
An iron kettle my father gave me ;
And when I came unto the willow,
My mother she gave me a cap and a pillow.
Woes me! but those who part can tell
How sharp the pain to say farewell!
And when unto the bridge I came,
I turned me round and looked back again;
I saw no father nor mother more,
And I hitterly wept, for my heart was sore.
Woes me! but those who part can tell
How sharp the pain to say farewell !
And when I came before the gate,
The bolt was drawn, and I must wait;
An 1 when I came to the wooden bench,
They said, Shes but a peevish wench!
Woes me! but those who part can tell
How sharp the pain to say farewell!
And when I came to the strangers hearth,
They whispered, She is little worth ;
And when I came before the bed,
I sighed, would I were yet a maid !
Woes me ! but those who part can tell
How sharp the pain to say farewell!
