amined, will show that the whole substance is made up of minute,
many-sided cells about -^^ of an inch in diameter, and about twice
as long, the long way of the cells being disposed radially to the
trunk. The walls of the cells are extremely thin, and yet they are

comparative darkness, showing that the cells are built on end to end in

the cells looking like a minute honey-comb. In some specimens large
numbers of crystals are found, and are readily distinguished by the
aid of polarized light. Minute though they are, they are very numer-

rapidity with which cork blunts the cutting-instruments used in shap-
