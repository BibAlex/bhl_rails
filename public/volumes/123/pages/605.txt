TEE ECONOMIC DISTURBANCES SINCE 1873. 585
in the purchasing power of the classes engaged in or connected with
British agriculture, for the single year 1885, as having amounted to
42,800,000 ($214,000,000) ; and as the losses for several preceding
years are believed to have been equal or even greater than this, an es-
timate of a thousand million dollars decline in the value of British
farming capital since 1880, from depreciation of land-values, rentals,
and prices for stock and cereals, is probably an under rather than an
over-estimate. Wheat-growing, which was formerly profitable in Great
Britain, is reported as not having been remunerative to the British
farmer since 1874 ; a fact that finds eloquent expression in the ac-
knowledged reduction in British wheat acreage from about 4,000,000
acres in 1869 to 2,528,905 in 1886. That the agricultural populations
of the interior states of Europe, which have hitherto been protected in
a degree by the barrier of distance against the tremendous cheapening
of transportation, are also at last beginning to feel the full effects of
its influence, is shown by the statement (United States consular re-
ports, 1886) that farming land in Germany, remote from large cities,
where the demand for milk and other perishable products is small, can
now be purchased for fifty per cent of the prices which prevailed at the
close of the Franco-German War in 1870-71. And yet such startling
results, in the place of being prime factors in occasioning a depression
of British trade and industry, are really four removes from the original
causes, which may be enumerated in order as follows : First, the occu-
pation and utilization of new and immense areas of cheap and fer-
tile wheat-growing land in the United States, Canada (Manitoba),
Australia, and the Argentine Republic. Second, the invention and
application of machinery for facilitating and cheapening the produc-
tion and harvesting of crops, and which on the wheat-fields of Da-
kota (as before pointed out) have made the labor of every agricultur-
ist equivalent to the annual production of five thousand five hundred
bushels of wheat. Third, the extension of the system of transporta-
tion on land through the railroad, and on sea through the steamship,
in default of which the appropriation of new land and the invention
and application of new agricultural machinery would have availed but
little. Fourth, the discovery of Bessemer, and the invention of the
compound (steamship) engine, without which transportation could not
have cheapened to the degree necessary to effect the present extent
of distribution. Now, from the conjoined result of all these different
agencies has come a reduction in the worlds price of wheat to an
extent sufficient to make its growing unprofitable on lands taken at
high rents, and under unfavorable climatic conditions ; and legisla-
tion is powerless to make it otherwise. In short, the whole secret of
the recent immense losses of the British and to a lesser extent also of
the Continental agriculturist, and the depression of British trade and
industry, so far as it has been contingent on such losses, stands re-
vealed in the simple statement that American wheat sold for export
