ASTRONOMY WITH AN OPERA-GLASS.

powerful absorptive atmosphere, and which are believed on various
grounds to be, as Lockyer has said, in the last visible stage of cool-
ing ; in other words, almost extinct. This great, red star probably
in actual size exceeds our sun, and no one can help feeling the sublime
nature of those studies which give us reason to think that here we can

actually behold almost the expiring throes of a giant brother of our
giant Sun. Only, the lifetime of a sun is many millions of years, and
its gradual extinction, even after it has reached a stage as advanced
as that of Antares is supposed to be, may occupy a longer time than
the whole duration of the human race.
The opera-glass will show a number of faint stars scattered around
Antares. Turn now to Beta (/?) in Scorpio, with the glass. A very
pretty pair of stars will be seen hanging below /3. Sweeping down,
ward from this point to the horizon you will find many beautiful star-
fields. The star marked Nu (v) is a double which you will be able to
separate with a powerful field-glass, the distance between its com-
ponents being 40.
And next let us look at a star-cluster. You will see on the map
an object marked 4 M., near Antares. Its designation means that it
is No. 4 in Messiers catalogue of nebulae. It is not a true nebula, but
a closely compacted cluster of stars. With the opera-glass, if you are
looking in a clear and moonless night, you will see it as a curious
nebulous speck. With a field-glass its real nature is more apparent, and
it is seen to blaze brighter toward the center. It is, in fact, one of
those universes within the universe where thousands of suns are asso-
ciated together by some unknown law of aggregation into assemblages
of whose splendor the slight view that we can get gives us but the
faintest conception.
