logical, therefore, to conclude that no parallel exists between power of
mind and weight of brain.
M. Nikiforoff, a Russian scientist, in an article in the Novosti,
on the weight of brains, expresses his conviction that the weight of
the encephalon has no influence whatever on the mental faculties.
But, indeed, any reflecting person who has studied the brain-weights
of eminent men as compared with ordinary intelligences must arrive
at the same conclusion that a great mind may belong to a person
who carries a very small, a medium-sized, or a very large brain, the
size and weight neither adding to the mental power nor detracting
from it, provided only that the encephalon is sufficient to give due
support to the bodily life. And this leads us to note the relation
of the size of the brain to the size of the body of which it forms
a part.
The following table is taken from the second volume of the
Science and Practice of Medicine (London, 18G8). Its object is to
show the weight of the brain relatively to the weight and height of
the body at various ages and in both sexes :

The above table, made by Dr. Boyd from sixteen hundred and seven
post-mortem examinations of sane persons, shows that the human brain
reaches its maximum of weight in proportion to the rest of the body
between the ages of fourteen and twenty in both 6exes ; and then it
continues to decrease through life. While intelligence is rapidly in-
creasing from twenty to sixty years of age, the brain is diminishing.
The time that a man knows most is from seventy to eighty ; but then
