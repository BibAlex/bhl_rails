The age of the megaliths still presents an unsolved problem. It is
probable that if the most ancient ones date from neolithic times, their
construction was continued through many generations as an ancestral
tradition ; and we find them still being built when copper, and after-
ward when bronze, took the place of stone. There are also in Alem-

formed of six flags, the bottom and lid of other flags. We reproduce
one of these tombs (Fig. 8), which is situated at Cerro del Castello, and

contains broken bones, and with them arms and utensils of stone, and

epochs ; and, as in several other countries in Europe, pure copper is
the first metal employed.

ported, doubtless, by foreign conquerors, takes the place of inhuma-
tion. Cists of a reduced size (Fig. 9), urns, covered with large stones,
receive the ashes, and the few fragments of bone that escape the
