WHAT IS EVOLUTION?*
By Professor JOSEPH LE CONTE.
EVERY one is familiar with the main facts connected with the
development of an egg. We all know that it begins as a micro-
scopic germ-cell, then grows into an egg, then organizes into a chick,
and finally grows into a cock ; and that the whole process follows some
general, well-recognized law. Now, this process is evolution. It is
more it is the type of all evolution. It is that from which we get
our idea of evolution, and without which there would be no such word.
Whenever and wherever we find a process of change more or less re-
sembling this, and following laws similar to those determining the
development of an egg, we call it evolution.
Evolution as a, process is not confined to one thing, the egg, nor as
a doctrine is it confined to one department of science biology. The
process pervades the whole universe, and the doctrine concerns alike
every department of science yea, every department of human thought.
It is literally one half of all science. Therefore, its truth or falseness,
its acceptance or rejection, is no trifling matter, affecting only one small
corner of the thought-realm. On the contrary, it affects profoundly
the foundations of philosophy, and therefore the whole domain of
thought. It determines the whole attitude of the mind toward Nature
and God.
I have said evolution constitutes one half of all science. This may
seem to some a startling proposition. I stop to make it good.
Every system of correlated parts may be studied from two points
of view, which give rise to two departments of science, one of which
and the greater and more complex is evolution. The one concerns
changes within the system by action and reaction between the parts,
