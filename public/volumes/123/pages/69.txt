ORIGIN OF COMETS AND METEORS. 59
(a three-inch telescope shows a million stars), and ten orbs of various
size depending (on the average) on each, then we have a grand total of
10 X 1,000,000 X 1,000,000,000 X 10 = 100,000 millions of millions of
meteor flights, as representing the total number of bodies ejected from
the various orbs peopling space, including those now sun-like, and also
those which, though now in the fiery stage, or further advanced still
in planetary life, were once as surely suns as the stars are now.
When we remember that with so many millions of millions of
flights of bodies, each flight to be counted probably by millions of
millions, our earth must from time to time be saluted by some of
these, while we know that during all the years over which observation
has continued, absolutely nothing has reached our earth from outside
except the various orders of meteors, while no flights of bodies can be
recognized as ever visiting us from interplanetary space except the
various orders of comets, we are justified in concluding that these
represent products of ejection. We infer this on the safe ground of
the argument that if these bodies do not, no other bodies exist which
can represent the product of the ejective processes we have certainly
recognized. It would have been a rather bold thought, yet not want-
ing in reasonableness, and certainly ingenious, to have said that there-
fore comets and meteors are but different appearances of the same
objects. This, though it might have been shown to be probable,
could not have been shown to be certain ; for the simple reason that
the ejected bodies might have been only discernible when any of them
entered our atmosphere, in which case only meteors would have been
required by the facts or accounted for by the theory of ejection. But
now that we know comets to be but flights of meteors, and meteors to
be but attendants on comets, we see that one of the prettiest discov-
eries of modern astronomy, Schiaparellis recognition of the connection
between comets and meteors,* is implicitly associated with the results
of inquiry applied to the suns power of volcanic ejection. We might
further have inferred the discoveries of Tschermak, Daubree, Sorby,
Graham, and others, as to the structure of meteorites, even though
none of these bodies had ever reached our earth from interplanetary
space seeing that our earths interior, beneath the regions now re-
lieved by volcanic outbursts, would afford good information as to the
nature of bodies ejected from such deep-seated regions of her interior,
or of the interior of other celestial orbs.
A theory which could not be true except in its most generalized
form, but which in that form (1) agrees with every one of the known
facts, (2) accounts for many of them, (3) alone accounts for some of
* I take some pleasure in noting that I was the original proposer, and an intimate
friend of mine the seconder, of the proposition that the Council of the Astronomical
Society should bestow their gold medal on Signor Schiaparelli for this discovery. If we
must have the prize-pig system of rewarding scientific research, let us at least, according
to the good old English saying, catch the right pig by the tail.
