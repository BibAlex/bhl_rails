not accustomed to the philosophical analysis of facts which argues
that the conspicuous absence of women in the field of intellectual work
is due to the artificial restraints imposed upon them by all the tradi-
tional forms of education ; that if we could suddenly make a leap of
progress in this respect, and allow women everywhere to compete on
fair and equal terms with men, then, under these altered circumstances
of social life, women would prove themselves the intellectual compeers
of man.
But the answer to this argument is almost painfully obvious. Al-
though it is usually a matter of much difficulty to distinguish between
nature and nurture, or between the results of inborn faculty and those
of acquired knowledge, in the present instance no such difficulty ob-
tains. Without again recurring to the anatomical and physiological
considerations which bar a priori any argument for the natural equality
of the sexes, and without remarking that the human female would but
illustrate her own deficiency of rational development by supposing that
any exception to the general laws of evolution can have been made in
her favor without dwelling on any such antecedent considerations,
it is enough to repeat that in many departments of intellectual work
the field has been open, and equally open, to both sexes. If to this it
is answered that the traditional usages of education lead to a higher
average of culture among men, thus furnishing them with a better
vantage-ground for the origin of individual genius, we have only to
add that the strong passion of genius is not to be restrained, by any
such minor accidents of environment. Women by tens of thousands
have enjoyed better educational as well as better social advantages
than a Burns, a Keats, or a Faraday ; and yet we have neither heard
their voices nor seen their work.
If, again, to this it be rejoined that the female mind has been un-
justly dealt with in the past, and can not now be expected all at once
to throw off the accumulated disabilities of ages that the long course
of shameful neglect to which the selfishness of man has subjected the
culture of woman, has necessarily left its mark upon the hereditary
constitution of her mind if this consideration be adduced, it obviously
does not tend to prove the equality of the sexes ; it merely accentuates
the fact of inequality by indicating one of its causes. The treatment
of women in the past may have been very wrong, very shameful, and
very much to be regretted by the present advocates of womens rights;
but proof of the ethical quality of this fact does not get rid of the
fact itself, any more than a proof of the criminal nature of assassina-
tion can avail to restore to life a murdered man. We must look the
facts in the face. How long it may take the woman of the future to
recover the ground which has been lost in the psychological race by
the woman of the past, it is impossible to say ; but we may predict
with confidence that, even under the most favorable conditions as to
culture, and even supposing the mind of man to remain stationary (and
