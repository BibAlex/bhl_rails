Heterachthes quadrimaculatus (Fabricius)
Callidium 4-macnlatum Fabricius, 1792, p. 328.
Heterachtes [sic] quadmnaculatus. — Aurivillius, 1912, p. 111.
There may be some doubt as to the correct determination of this
species. The five specimens at hand have been compared with
material in the U.S. National Museum identified as quadrimaculata.
However, either two species are involved or a striking sexual dimor-
phism exists. The males are all densely pubescent with denuded
areas containing a coarse punctiu-e enclosmg a long erect seta and
the elytral apices are truncate and unarmed. In the females the
dense pubescence is less pronounced and the elytral apices bear a
stout spine at the external angle. Records include:
