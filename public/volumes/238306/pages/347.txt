Types: 4 females and 1 male in collection L.S.J.U. (lot 499, specimen
23). Types could not be located under the above number and must
be presumed lost. Neotypes: Junction City, Oreg., Apr. 9, 1920,
from Diplolejns neglecius on Rosa species Kinsey collected. In addi-
tion, there are 22 females and 20 males in the U.S. National Museum
and in the Bugbee collection, Meadville, Pa.
Neotype locality: Junction City, Oreg.
Distribution: United States: Oregon, California. Canada: Sas-
katchewan.
Host: Diplolejns neglecius (Gillette) {=D. tuberculatrix (Cockerell)),
D. polita (Ashmead) variety and D.t. descansonis Kmsey and Ayres,
on Rosa species.
Subspecies: Description in Bugbee, 1951. Eurytoma incerta varia
Bugbee. California.
Host: Diplolepis tuberculator descansonis Kinsey and Ayres.
Remarks: Diplolepis neglecius galls are indicated as being modified
inquiline inhabited galls of D. tuberculatrix (Kinsey and Ayi'es, 1922).
The actual host then is an unknown inquiline cynipid species rather
than the true gallmaker.
Eurytoma incerta is the equivalent of E. acuta of the east. It runs
smaller in all its measurements, the propodeal median furrow is
narrower and deeper, and the scape of the antenna is most often
all black.
