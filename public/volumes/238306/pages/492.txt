REVISION OF SHARKS OF GENUS ISURUS
WITH DESCRIPTION OF A NEW SPECIES
(GALEOIDEA, LAMNIDAE) ^
By J. A. F. Garrick
The genus Isurus comprises the mako or mackerel sharks, world-
wide in distribution throughout tropical and temperate seas. Opinion
from recent accounts as to the number of extant species in the genus
ranges from two or three (Bigelow and Schroeder, 1948) to four (Smith,
1957, 1958) . In the study reported below, considerably more material
has been examined than was available to other workers, and it is
concluded that the 12 nominal species of Isurus represent only 1
world\\ide species. However, in addition, there is another very dis-
tinctive species which does not appear to have been described.^
Presentation of the evidence for these findings and description of the
new species are the purposes of this paper.
This study is based on 35 specimens from which fairly complete
measurements of external dimensions have been taken. For another
8 specimens only incomplete data are available. In addition some

3 At the time this paper was in galley, Guitart Manday (July 1966) described,
under the name Isurus paucus, a mako shark that is clearly the same as the
species which I describe as new in this account. For further details, see Addendum.
