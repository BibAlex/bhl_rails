Lake 8 had this spine less developed than in all other specimens, its
length being less than half the segment).
Taxonomy. — E. arctica is easily distinguished from other species of
the genus by the combination of characters summarized in the def-
inition. It does not appear to be closely related to any known species
but can be assigned on the basis of characters of the antennules and
female leg 5 to a broadly defined group that includes E. composita and
E. gracilicauda. Leg 5 is distinctive in both sexes — that of the female
in the unusually long extension of the inner process of exopod 1 and
that of the male in the lobes and processes of the basal segments and
the structm'e of exopod 2 of both legs.
Leg 5 of the male is also distinctive in copepodid stage V. No other
species illustrated in literatm'e or observed from North American
fresh and brackish waters has long apical spines (as shown in fig. 3^) .
The specimens from Umiat and Noatak can therefore be assigned to
this species, even though adidts were not observed. It is also possible
that the inner process of leg 5 of stage V female is longer than in other
species of Alaskan Eurytemora, but more study is required to deter-
mine this.
OCCUERENCE IN CaPE THOMPSON REGION
Lake 4 (type locality; see above, p. 554). — Only 33 individuals were
captured in both quantitative and qualitative open-water and littoral
samples taken on 17 dates between June 24 and November 7, 1960;
no specimens occurred after September 8 nor in mid- and late winter
samples in 1961. The species was present in open-v/ater samples
taken in the deepest part of the lake on 10 of the 17 dates in 1960
and in 1 littoral sample (June 24). Of the total 11 dates, only 1
specimen occiu-red on 4 dates, from 2 to 6 on 6 dates, and 9 adults,
the largest number, were taken on the remaining date. From July 21,
specimens were in copepodid stages V and VI. Stage VI (adults) first
appeared on July 14 and was the only one present in samples of late
August to mid-September. Of the 10 adult females, none carried
ovisacs or spermatophores. Three of the 6 males taken on August 27
and September 8 had spermatophores attached to the apex of left leg 5.
