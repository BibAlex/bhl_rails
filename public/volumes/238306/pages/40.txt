Ampithoe species
Figures 24, 25
Refer to: Amphitoe [sic] mea Gurjanova, 1938, pp. 361-364, fig. 53; 1951, pp.
882-885, fig. 616. Ampithoe eoa.—J. L. Barnard, 1954, pp. 27-28, pis. 25-26
(not Gurjanova 1938).
Diagnosis of present material: All pleonal epimera rounded behind
and at lower corners, no lateral ridges; article 6 of male gnathopod 1
longer than article 5, posterior edge of article 5 with a rounded,
scarcely truncated, shallow posterior lobe, article 6 narrow, sublinear,
palm transverse, finger overlapping palm by its full length; gnathopod
2 of male in a state of intermediacy compared with Ampithoe tea, new
species, finger about half as long as hind edge of article 6, palm not
distinct, the hind edge of article 6 minutely serrate, with a slight
notch near distal end, article 2 with a poorly developed distal bump;
article 2 of pereopods 1-2 strongly inflated, 1.6 times as long as broad;
article 2 of pereopod 3 broader than long; ventral edge of article 1 of
first antenna with a few distal slender spines; antenna 1 much longer
than antenna 2, the flagellum of antenna 1 about 3 times as long as
that of antenna 2, the latter flagellum short, 1 .3 times as long as article 5
of peduncle, articles stout, antenna 2 well setose, article 4 of peduncle
about 90% (aberrantly 60% as in figured male) as long as article 5;
outer apical lobule of lower lip somewhat longer than medial lobule;
coxae 1 and 2 shorter than 3 and 4 but not broadened, coxa 1 not
produced forward; peduncular process of uropod 1 long.
Female: Article 5 of gnathopod 1 shorter than article 6; gnathopod
2 with article 6 similar to that of gnathopod 1 in both sexes but stouter
and less linear, article 5 shorter than 6 and with well-developed
posterior lobe that is narrower than in A. tea, new species.
Material: Barnard station 5 (5).
Record: Corona del Mar, Calif., intertidal.
Remarks : The specimens differ from the figures of A. mea Gurj anova
(and A. eoa Gurjanova) in the female second gnathopod, having a
transverse palm with a strongly overlapping finger. In A. mea the
female second gnathopod has an oblique, excavated palm with the
finger fitting it and a longer fourth article of antenna 2. I suggest the
possibility that A. mea females shown by Gurjanova may be either
aberrant, gerontic females commencing to demonstrate male conditions
or subadult males. The correspondence of A. annenkovae Gurjanova
(see 1951) to A. mea is striking. The male and female second gnatho-
