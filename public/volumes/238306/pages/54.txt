closely similar, and 0. maculicollis (Champion) which it closely
resembles. It is separated from 0. mariae by the distance between
the eyes in dorsal view; the eyes are more widely set apart in 0.
howdeni and more placed in 0. mariae. The antennal segments of
0. howdeni are longer and narrower than those of 0. mariae. The
general color of 0. howdeni is fuscus, while that of most specimens of
0. mariae is a dark chestnut, almost piceus ; but some specimens may
be fuscus. 0. maculicollis is confined to tropical Central America and
has different genitalic characters.

Holotype: Male, Tornillo Flat, Big Bend National Park, Tex.,
3200 ft., May 12, 1959 (collected by Edward Becker and Henry F
Howden). Deposited in the U. S. National Museum (type no. 67447).
Description: Head fuscus with mandibles, labrum, and posterior
portion of vertex pale; pubescence fine, recumbent, sparse, yellow;
punctation coarse, distance between punctures less than the diameter
of the puncture, interspaces microreticulate. Antennae with apical
segments approximately foiu" times as long as broad, second segment
one-half the length of the third. Eyes large, emarginate near inser-
tion of antennae, well separated anteriorly, interocular distance to
head length (measm-ed from fine across head behind eyes to apex of
labrum) ratio 1.9473. Mandibles moderate in length, apices bifid.
Maxillary palpi with apical segment cultriform.
Thorax pale fuscus; pronotum with somewhat darker lateral areas
which occupy the space from the anterior margin nearly to the base;
