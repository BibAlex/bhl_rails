The most important clues are the lengths of the antennal flagella and
the produced points of the second and third pleonal epimera, unique
to this species.
Possibly A. stimpsoni Boeck, from San Francisco, represents a
young male of this species, although it could also represent A. japonica
Stebbing or A. djakonovi Gurjanova, two species which may occur in
northern California. Bate (1862) shows this species having uropod
3 exceeding the end of uropod 2 by a considerable degree. In these
southern specimens of smaller size, this is not the case.
Distribution: "Arctic Seas" (Bate 1862), a cold temperate species
barely penetrating to tropical limits in the warm temperate, from
Kodiak Alaska, south to the Shizueka Prefecture in Japan and to
Magdalena Bay in Baja California, with records from Oregon, Puget
Sound, and southern California.

Ampithoe femorata Kr0yer. â€” J. L. Barnard, 1952, pp. 24-28, pis. 6-7 (not Kr0yer,
1845).
Diagnosis: Second and third pleonal epimera rounded behind;
article 6 of male gnathopod 1 slightly longer than article 5, posterior
edge of article 5 with a broadly truncated posterior lobe, article 6
slender, rectangular, palm short, transverse, finger greatly overlapping
palm; gnathopod 2 of male with subrectangidar article 6, palm
oblique, slightly concave, but clearly defined, minutely crenulate at
defining area, palm shorter than hind margin of article 6, finger short,
fitting palm or slightly overlapping it, article 2 with poorly developed
distal bump; article 2 of pereopods 1-2 about 2.0 times as long as
broad; ventral edge of article 1 on antenna 1 with at least one spine;
antenna 1 longer than antenna 2, flagellum nearly four times as long
as flagellum of antenna 2; flagellum of antenna 2 very short, stout,
strongly setose, progressively decreasing in male in number of articles
from about 6 to 3; apical lobules of lower lip short, subequal in length;
coxa 1 not produced forward; peduncular process of uropod 1 long.
Female: Gnathopod 1 similar to that of male, article 5 slightly
shorter; gnathopod 2 like gnathopod 1 but article 5 even shorter and
with moderately well-developed, but rather stout hind lobe; antenna
2 generally with 1-3 more flagellar articles than in male.
