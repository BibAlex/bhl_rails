of the foretarsiis in this species is twice the length of the second seg-
ment.
Limnephiliis costalis (Banks), new combination
Asynarchus costalis Banks, 1901, p. 286.
Anisogamvs costalis, Ross, 1938b, p. 28, fig. 44. [Lectotype designated.]
This species is related closely to the preceding, and must be trans-
ferred to Limnephilus. Ross (1938b) illustrated the genitalia of the
type of this species.
Limnephilus concolor Banks
Figures 3m,n
Limnephilus concolor Banks, 1899, pp. 207-208.
Limnephilus concolor. — -Ross, 1938b, p. 35. [Lectotype designated.]
The lectotype of this species is a female without abdomen, not a
male as stated by Ross (193Sb). The accompanying figures were
prepared from the female lectoparatype. Other specimens of this
species have been seen from California and British Colombia, but no
collection has contained males. In all probability this is the female
of the species generally called assimilis Banks, but it might be the
female of L. productus Banks or L. diversus (Banks).
Limnephilus bifidus Banks
Figures 3k,l
Limnephilus bifidus Banks, 1908b, p. 263, fig. 11.
Limnephilus bifidus. — ^Ross, 1938b, p. 34. [Lectotype designated.]
Figures are presented of the lectotype female of this species in the
hope that they will permit its recognition. In coloration the species
is marked in the manner of L. moestus Banks or L. sericeus (Say).
Limnephilus pollens (Banks)
Figures 3f-h
Zaporata pollens Banks, 1920, p. 342, fig. 105.
The accompanying figures were prepared from the male type. The
second segment of the foretarsus is about % the length of the first
segment, and the eighth tergum is produced into a scabrous lobe
mesally. I have seen additional series from Southhampton, North-
west Territory, and Brooks Lake, Alaska.
Limnephilus sericeus (Say)
Phryganea sericea Say, 1824, p. 309.
Anabolia decepta Banks, 1899, pp. 208-209. [New synonymy.]
Limnephilus sericeus. — Ross, 1944, p. 192, figs. 655, 644. [Neotype designated.]
The male type of decepta was studied and found to be the same as
sericeus (Say).
