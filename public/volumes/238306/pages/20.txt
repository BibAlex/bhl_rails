11
Females: Article 5 of gnathopod 1 ranging from shorter to longer
than article 6 (the latter, see Nagata, 1960), the larger the female,
the longer is article 5. Hence, the gnathopods of young females may-
be confused with those of A. valida and indeed are like those figured

Remarks: Dexamine scitulus Harford, the type of which was re-
figured by Holmes (1904), apparently is a female of this species.
