Publications of the United States National Museum
The scientific publications of the United States National Museum include two
series, Proceedings of the United States National Museum and United States
National Museum Bulletins.
In these series are published original articles and monographs dealing with
the collections and work of the Museum and setting forth newly acquired facts
in the fields of anthropology, biology, geology, history', and technology. Copies
of each publication are distributed to libraries and scientific organizations and
to specialists and others interested in the various subjects.
The Proceedings, begun in 1878, are intended for the publication, in separate
form, of shorter i^apers. These are gathered in volumes, octavo in size, with
the publication date of each paper recorded in the table of contents of the volume.
In the Bulletin series, the first of which was issued in 1875, appear longer,
separate publications consisting of monographs (occasionally in several parts)
and volumes in which are collected works on related subjects. Bulletins are
cither octavo or quarto in size, depending on the needs of the presentation.
Since 1902, papers relating to the botanical collections of the Museum have been
published in the Bulletin series under the heading Contributions from the United
States National Herbarium.
