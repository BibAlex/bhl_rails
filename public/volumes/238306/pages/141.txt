1947, referred A. gorgonensis to A. rigida. The tubercles on the cirri
of A. gracilis, mentioned and figured by Hessle, appear to be internal
structures and not external papillae as in some other pilargids. The

splitting of the longer neurosetae; thus they are variable in occurrence
and appearance.
