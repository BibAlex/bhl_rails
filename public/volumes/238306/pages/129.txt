Key to the Species of Cabira
1. Lateral antennae lacking. Ventral cirri small, at tips of neuropodial lobes.
Hooked notosetae begin on setiger 8. Integument papillated. Proboscis
soft sac C. capensis
With pair small lateral antennae. Ventral cirri small, below neuropodial lobes.
Integument smooth or with only few scattered papillae 2
2. Neurosetae of 2 kinds, slender capillary and short, with slightly recurved tips.
Hooked notosetae begin on setigers 6-8. Proboscis with numerous, conical,
soft papillae C. brevicirris
Neurosetae all similar, slender, capillary 3
3. Hooked notosetae begin on setiger 7. Proboscis with longitudinal rows of
spines basally C. incerta
Hooked notosetae begin on setiger 6. Proboscis? C. pilargiformis

Material examined: Chesapeake Bay off Rappahanock River,
37°32'N., 76°07'W., 7 fms., mud, July 21, 1961, :Marvin Wass,
collector, 5 specimens.
Description: Length to 18 mm., width to 1.5 mm., segments to 54.
Body long, subcylindrical, flattened ventrally, arched dorsally, nar-
rowest anteriorly, with indistinct segmental bulges (more prominent
posteriorly) . Prostomium and tentacular segment fused, with paired
biarticulate palps consisting of large palpophores and small ventral
palpostyles, with numerous papillae concentrated on anterior tips
(= membranous expansions or thin plates covered with papillae of
Webster) ; with pair very short lateral antennae arising from swollen
bases or ceratophores indistinctly set off from prostomium. Tentacu-
lar segment achaetous, with 2 pairs of very short tentacular cutI.
Parapodia small, indistinct, subbiramoiis. Notopodium ( = ven-
tral ramus of Webster) represented by very small notopodial lobe or
dorsal cirrus with internal notoaciculum, with stout emergent hooked
notoseta (= strong hooked ventral seta of Webster) beginning on
setiger 7 (setiger 6, according to Webster); sometimes with additional
hooked seta in process of formation internally, indicating probable
replacement of hooked setae (figs. 12a, b). Neuropodiimi (=dorsal
ramus of Webster) short, conical, with neuroacicuhmi, tip of which
sometmies projects slightly and few (2-4) similar neurosetae (= dorsal
setae of Webster) ; neurosetae simple, slender, delicate, tapering to
capillary tips; ventral cirri (=dorsal cirri of Webster) short, digitiform,
below neuropodial lobe, beginning on setiger 3. Pygidium short,
