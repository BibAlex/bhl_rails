each elytron with eight strong costae, the intervals geminate punctate;
pale yellowish brown sometimes reddish brown, with deeper brown
elytral markings in the shape of a wide vitta from the humerus nearly

apex, a round basal spot along the side of the scutellum and a median
spot near the apex of each elytron.
Head with interocular space approximately half width of head, occi-
