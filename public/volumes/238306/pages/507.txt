First dorsal fin fairly large, its height 1.1 to 1.2 times its base, and
1.2 in distance from posterior margin of eye to first gill opening;
length of rear tip of first dorsal 3.7 to 3.6 in first dorsal height; apex
of first dorsal moderately rounded, anterior margin weakly convex,
distal margin more strongly convex along its upper two-thirds but
concave below; origin of first dorsal varying from well behind to
almost above posterior (inner) corner of pectoral fin; rear tip of first
dorsal anterior to pelvic fin origin by a distance of about IK times
length of pelvic base. Second dorsal fin very small, short based but
with a rather long rear tip; height of second dorsal 1.2 to 1.0 times
its base, and one-tenth to one-ninth of height of first dorsal; length

lower teeth, right side; c, d, first upper tooth, right side, anterior and lateral views, showing
incomplete cutting edge on lateral margin. (The jaw from which these teeth were drawn
is of comparable size to that of /. alaius in figure 8.)
of rear tip almost twice second dorsal height; origin of second dorsal
well anterior to anal origin. Caudal fin somewhat lunate in outline,
ventral lobe shorter than dorsal lobe, terminal lobe strongly developed;
length of ventraJ Jobe 1.5 to 1.4 in dorsal lobe; length of terminal
lobe measiu-ed from tip of dorsal lobe to base of subterminal notch
4.2 to 4.4 in dorsal lobe. Anal fin similar in shape to second dorsal
fin but shghtly larger; origin of anal fin shghtly behind or just below
posterior end of second dorsal base. Pelvic fins moderately large,
anterior margins equal to or a Httle longer than bases, and only
slightly shorter than distal margins; length of pelvic base 1.7 to 1.9
in first dorsal base. Pectoral fins remarkably long, only slightly
