late a whorl; distal end with shorter hairs; terminal unit of two, short,
closely fused segments separated from the fifth by a deep annidation
and about same length as fifth; hair much shorter and extends anteri-
orly or in same plane as terminal segments. Marginal vein of the fore-
wing averages .16 mm. (.15-. 20) and postmarginal vein .11 mm.
(.10-12) in length.
Types: 32 females and 9 males. Holotype female, allotype, and
paratypes in the U.S. National Museum (USNM 66056) ; paratypes
in the Bugbee collection, Meadville, Pa.
Type locality: Manhattan, Kans. Collected by R. Schwitzgebel,
Sept. 1, 1940. Paratypes collected in August and September 1940.
Distribution: U.S.: Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and Mississippi.
Host : Bred from trypetid seed maggots in seeds of Vernonia interior
Small (Ironweed).
Additional host: Tephritis (= Neotephritis) Jlnalis in sunflower (Bre-
land, 1939).
Remarks: This new species is most closely related to Eurytoma
obtusiventris Gahan. The relationship is suggested by the presence of
the raised tubercle on the outer margin of the forecoxae, the narrow
pronotum, the short, stocky female antenna, and the sharp angle
formed by the scutellum and propodeum. It can be separated from
E. obtusiventris, however, by its smaller size, the evenly punctate
propodeum in contrast to the transversely striated propodeum of
E. obtusiventris, its more oval and laterally compressed abdomen, and
the presence of males with their distinctive antennae.
Schwitzgebel and Wilbur (1943) list two species of parasites as
Eurytoma new species that were bred from trypetid seed maggots
(p. 8). The series of 56 females mentioned above, from which this
new species was described, was part of their reared material so that it
is very likely that its real host is one of the species of trjrpetid listed
in their paper. The exact relationships of host and parasite were not
determined.
