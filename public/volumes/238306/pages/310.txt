Furnaricola parvigenitalis Carriker, 1944, Bol. Ent. Venezolana, vol. 3, no. 2,
p. 88, pis. 4 (figs 3, 4), 5 (fig. 2).
Host: Synallaxis erythrogaster Sclater.
Head similar to that of punensis, new species, but narrower at
temples and with the preanteunary carinae continuous to tip of frons;
frons narrow, with anterior plate protruding almost entirely beyond
tips of preantennary carinae; bucal canal much narrower than in
■punensis; male genitalia very different (see key); (female: body,
1.59X.45;head, .435X.35).

Furnaricola laticephala Carriker, 1944, Bol. Ent. Venezolana, vol. 3, no. 2, p. 89,
pis. 4 (figs. 5, 6), 5 (fig. 3).
Host: Cranioleuca subcristata (Sclater).
Head unlike any species here figured. Sides of temples nearly
straight, with blunt posterolateral angles (not rounded) ; head nearly
as wide at clavi as at temples, converging rapidly from clavi to frons,
with sides concave. Pleurites wider and paler ventrally than dorsally;
tergites pale but sternites heavily pigmented. Male genitalia with
paramera bifurcated; paramera straight, with short, slender tips;
(female: body, 1. 73 X. 586; head, .445X.41).

pis. 4 (figs. 7, 8), 5 (fig. 4).
Host: Phleocryptes melanops schoenbaenus Cabanis and Heine.
One of the larger species and somewhat aberrant in structure of
preantennary portion of head; frons very wide (.135) and completely
encircled by a wide hyaline band. It is also one of the species in
which the male has bifurcated paramera (see keys) ; (female: body,
1. 73 X. 59; head, .445X.41).

p. 92, pi. 6 (fig. 1).
Host: Xiphorhynchus chunchotambo=X. ocellatus chunchotambo
(Tschudi).
Head triangular in shape, wide at rounded temples, with lateral
margins expanded slightly at clavi; frons narrow; anterior plate half
