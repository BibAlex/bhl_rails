York, Kansas, California. Canada: Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba.
Hosts: Magdalis armicollis Say, in elm (Ashmead, 1894). Onci-
deres cingulatus (Say), on hickory (hickory twig girdler) (Beal and
Massey, 1942). Anthribus cornutus Say (U.S. National Museum
collection). Cylindrocopturus lomjulus (LeConte) on Pinus sp. (U.S.

row propodeum, long sixth abdominal segment, and generally smaller
dimensions seems to be distinct from the preceding species. Its hosts
belong to families of beetles whose larvae bore in plant tissue.
