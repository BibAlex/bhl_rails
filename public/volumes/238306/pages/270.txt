NEARCTIC TRICHOPTERA — FLINT 379
species but unfortunately misidentified it as virginicus Banks. The
type of the latter is a female of a species of Pycnopsyche and is dis-
cussed further in that genus.
Oltgophlebodes minuta (Banks)
Halesus minidus Banks, 1897, p. 28.
Apatania pictula Banks, 1943, p. 355, figs. 3-6. [New synonymy.]
Oligophlebodcs minidus. — Ross, 1944, pp. 283-284, fig. 944.
The abdomen of the male type of pictula was cleared and found to
be typical of minuta.

Polamoriles virginicus Banks, 1900, p. 256.
In addition to the female type of this species, I have studied 2 males
that agree with the type in coloration, size, and structure. Since the
male of this species has not been figured previously, I give figures of
this sex here. The species belongs to the lepida group of the genus.
Only the type of the species from Richmond, Va., a male from Myrtle
Beach, S.C. (Oct. 25, 1943, C. T. Parsons), and another male from
Faison, N.C. (Oct. 31, 1956, light trap), are known to me.
Philocasca antennata (Banks)
Figures 2m,n
Stenophylax antennatus Banks, 1900, pp. 254-255.
The unique male type of this species which has not been illustrated
previously, is shown here.
Clostoeca disjuncta (Banks)
Anisogamus disjnnctus Banks, 1914, p. 156, fig. 22.
Anisogamus disjunctus. — Ross, 1938b, p. 28, fig. 43. [Lectotype designated.]
Clostoeca sperryi Banks, 1943, pp. 352-353, figs. 1, 4, 5. [New synonymy.]
The genitalia of the types of the two species were compared and
found to be identical. In coloration sperryi is more distinctly marked,
probably due to its comparative freshness.
Psychronia brevipennis (Banks)
Figures 3c-e
Psilopteryx brevipennis Banks, 1904, p. 108, fig. 3.
Figures are given here of the genitalia of the unique female type
with the hope that they will permit the recognition of this species.
Limnephilus sperryi (Banks)
Figures 3i,j
Rhadicoleptus sperryi Banks, 1943, pp. 346-347, figs. 2, 11, 12.
The male type of this species is illustrated here. The first segment
