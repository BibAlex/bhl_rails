hinge of gnathopod 2, and by the much more slender second gnathopod
of the female having a transverse, not oblique and slightly sinuous
palm.
From A. mea Gurjanova (1938 and 1950) this species differs by the
development of a palmar process on male gnathopod 2, the broader
second article of pereopod 3 and the more slender female gnathopod
2 with transverse palm. The present material corresponds with
A. mea in the strongly setose second male antenna; the male gnathopod
2 figured by Gurjanova could be one stage of the development in the
present material. The female gnathopod 2 shown by Gurjanova,
however, is most distinct; otherwise I should assign this material to
that species. Possibly her "female" was a young male.
From A. annenkovae this material dilBFers again by the female
second gnathopod, which in that species is quite large and well
developed, and the male gnathopod 2 of A. mea has a series of small
protuberances along its palm, not just one near the finger hinge.
The possibility exists that the three species mentioned above may
represent stages in a single growth series and that the females de-
scribed for each of the species above are stages of old age. For the
present, these materials must be segregated from those mentioned
above.
Ampithoe orientalis, as redescribed by J. L. Barnard (1955) is very
similar, but article 6 of gnathopod 1 is more slender, and the fully
developed process at the distal end of the palm is not sculptured as
fully as in A. tea.

Diagnosis: Second and third pleonal epimera with very slight
points at lower posterior corners; article 5 of male gnathopod 1
slightly longer than article 6, posterior edge of article 5 forming a
broad hind lobe with a distal projection, article 2 strongly setose, palm
oblique; gnathopod 2 with large rounded lobes on articles 2 and 3,
article 5 with narrow hind lobe, article 6 elongated, rectangular, palm
transverse, bearing a quadrate middle bimip, finger curved, fitting
palm; article 2 of pereopods 1-2 about 2.5 times as long as broad;
ventral edge of article 1 on antenna 1 bearing setae, no spines;
antennae 1 and 2 equal in length, flagellum of antenna 1 twice as long
as that of antenna 2, neither flagellum strongly setose; apical lobules
of lower lip so broad and appressed that they mask their separating
