Diagnostic description of female, — Cephalothorax (fig. 14a) con-
sisting of cephalic, maxilliped-bearing and first pedigerous segments,
narrower anteriorly than posteriorly; lateral margins flatly convex,
posterior concave, with 8 irregular denticulations medially. Frontal
region narrow, with distinct median depression. Second through
fourth pedigerous segments (figs. 146, c) free, second and third each
with single plate covering median dorsal surface, second with pair of
ovoid plates originating from lateral dorsal sm-face, extending pos-
teriorly and laterally; third pedigerous segment with pah* of small,
posteriorly rounded plates dorsally, extending posteriorly and laterally,
slightly overlapped by plates of second pedigerous segment. Fourth
pedigerous segment with single, large, apron-shaped plate dorsally,
extending posteriorly over most of genital segment.
Genital segment (figs. 146, c) wider than long, slightly narrower
posteriorly than anteriorly; lateral margins flatly convex, posterior
and anterior margins concave laterally, irregular medially, postero-
lateral projection each tipped by single denticulation. Large, rounded
anal lamina attached to dorsal surface of posterior concavity, ex-
tending posteriorly to distal end of caudal rami. Abdomen (fig, 14c)
1-segmented, extending posteriorly from posteroventral surface of
genital segment; narrower anteriorly, broadly rounded posteriorly,
bearing pair of heavily sclerotized, distally pointed caudal rami
directed posteriorly and laterally. Caudal rami attached to abdomen
by broad base formed of cuticular extension of proximal half of ramus.
Color pattern of alcohol preserved material similar to that of
Pandarus satyrus.
Antennule (figs. 14f/, 15a) 2-segmented, fu'st segment more than
twice the length of second, cui-ved posteriorly in distal region; with
approximately 23 naked setae on anterior ventral sm-face. Second
segment rounded distally, with approximately 7 fine setules on distal
surface and 1 on medial posterior surface. Antenna (figs. 14c^, 156)
3-segmented, proximal segment with oval adhesion pad, smaller than
postantennular adhesion pad, extending across ventral surface of most
of cephalic depression bearing antenna. Second antennal segment
longer than first, with heavily sclerotized, knob-shaped projection on
