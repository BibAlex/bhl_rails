Remarks: As noted by Holthuis (1952a, p. 8), the number of fused
articles in the inner antennular flagellum varies with growth. In the
St. Helena material, it increases rather regularly from 5 or 6 at a
carapace length of 4.0 mm. to 13 at a carapace length of 11.2 mm.
Distribution: Probably pantropical, littoral and sublittoral. The
St. Helena specimens identified by Bate and recorded by MelHss
(1875) as Palaemon forceps almost certainly belong to this species.
Subfamily Pontoniinae
Pontonia pinnophylax (Otto)

Palaemon pinnophylax Otto, 1821, p. 12.
Pontonia tyrrhena. — Schmitt, 1926, p. 40, fig. 66.
Material: James Bay; in Pinna rudis; Feb. 7, 1964; 1 male, 1
ovigerous female.
Measurements: Carapace length of male to posterior margin of
orbit, 11.6 mm.; of ovigerous female, 13.1 mm.
Figure 1. — Pontonia pinnophylax, male from James Bay: a, anterior part in dorsal view;
b, telson; c, dactyl of right third perelopod.
Remarks: The rostrum (fig. la) of each of these specimens is
slightly broader and more distinctly cordiform than it is in any of
the five Mediterranean and West African specimens available for
comparison. Also, the dactyls of the last three pereiopods of the
St. Helena specimens have the distal tooth somewhat more strongly
curved (fig. Ic). Both of these characters are variable, however, and
the present specimens probably fall within the limits of variation
of P. pinnophylax.
