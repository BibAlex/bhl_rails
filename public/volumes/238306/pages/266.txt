adequately figured previously. The forewing has a crescentic band
of yellowish hair subapically, a patch basally in the anal area, and
others at intermediate spots.

Genus Dicosmoecus
The taxonomic situation among the North American species of
this genus is still rather confusing, even after studying the types and
much more additional material of most of the species. Differences
exist between these specimens, especially in the armature of the
lateral sheaths of the aedeagus and in the structure of the basal ridge
of the clasper. Presently I am able to recognize 5 different kinds of
males, based mainly on these structures. Although these 5 genitahc
kinds, which are being considered species, do not intergrade in the
