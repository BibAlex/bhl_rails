AMPITHOIDAE FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA — BARNARD
39
pods are simply later growth stages if one considers that A. mea
undergoes the same terminal development seen in other Ampithoes.
If those two species prove to be the same, then the female second
gnathopod may be normal in A. mea and the present material would
have to be established nomenclaturally.
A. eoa has a broadened fifth article of pereopod 5 and longer and
more truncate article 5 of male gnathopod 1.
Figure 25. — Ampithoe species, female, 9.6 mm., Barnard sta. 5: a, gnathopod \\ b, c,
gnathopod 2; male, 8.0 mm.: d-g, uropods 1, 2, 3, 3; h, end of peduncle of uropod 3; i, j,
outer and inner rami of uropod 3; k, telson.
Ampithoe orientalis, as redescribed by J. L. Barnard (1955), has a
somewhat more slender sixth article of gnathopod 1 and an elongated,
slender, second antenna.
The second gnathopod of the female^, annenkovae (see Gurjanova,
1951) is enlarged somewhat as in the male and has an oblique palm.
The material identified by Barnard (1954) as A. eoa differs from
that species in the structure of pereopod 5 and by the equal
lobation of the lower lip. Except for the male gnathopods, that
material might be confused with A. lindbergi. Both A. mea and the
present material have the unequal lobation of the lower lip; hence A.
eoa of Barnard (1954) is unassignable to a known species, but is not
worthy of designation until more Oregonian materials can be studied.
Because only 5 specimens of the present material are known from the
coast of southern California and they have the aspect of the northern
