NEARCTIC TRICHOPTERA â€” FLINT 387
is quite distinctive in this species, in the shape of both the ninth and
tenth terga and the eighth sternum.
Material from New York and Virginia has been seen.

Because no figures of this species have been published previously,
the male type is illustrated here.

Additional figiu-es of the male type of this species are presented here.
The genitalia show a single dorsal plate flanked by a pair of slightly
ventrad plates which have a button-like cercus at their bases. The
clasper has a small mesal hook near its apex. This plan of the geni-
talia seems quite different from that of the Goerinae and it is unlike
that of any other taxon with which I am familiar. Several searches
at the type locality, Deep Creek near Bryson City, N.C., have failed
to turn up any more adidt examples or larvae likely to be those of this
species.
Pending more information, P. singularis, therefore, is retained in the
Goerinae, where originally it was placed.
