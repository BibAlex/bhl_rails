Female: Black. Length averages 3.3 mm. (2.7-4.0). Abdomen
black to deep reddish brown; oval in lateral view; averaging 1.3 mm.
(1.0-2.0) in length; lateral compression medium; segment six dorsally
equal in length to segments four and five combined; sculpturing on
lower lateral surface of sixth heavy, but it plays out dorsally so that
upper half of lateral surface and dorsal surface are smooth and
shiny; white pUe covers dorsal and lateral one-half of segment eight; a
few scattered hau-s on dorsal and lower lateral aspect of seven; ninth
tergum short, broad and stubby; averaging .12 mm. (0.7-.22) in
length; ninth with exposed ends of ventral valves projecting upward
at less than a 45° angle m relation to horizontal axis of the abdomen.
Internal genitalia average 1.3 mm. (1.0-2.0) in length; 1.0 mm.
(.82-1.5) in height, height averages about 77% of the length; dorsal
and ventral valves anteriorly turn dorsally at approximately a right
angle; expanded plate of ventral valves may bend slightly posteriorly
so that stylet arch approaches a vertical plane; dorsal valves black for
horizontal length and narrow; black may or may not contmue onto
slightly wider dorsal extension of dorsal valves. Tegula yellow.
Propodeum shallowly concave; median furrow outlined by distinct
lateral carinae, clearly indicated in dorsal third or half only, extent of
median carina same or ventrally for about three-quarters of length of
furrow; lower area crossed by irregular horizontal ridges dividing sur-
face roughly into rectangles. Scape with outer face all yellow or upper
half black to dark brown; antenna filiform; segments of the flagellum
in the larger specimens longer than wide with the fifth only a little
shorter than the first; in smaller specimens, segments become pro-
gressively shorter distally, so that five may be almost square; six
closel}^ applied to seven and separated by a shallow annidation; seven
appears to consist of two closely fused units, about equal in length to
first segment. Lower half of face covered with striae that converge
upon the clypeus. Legs chrome yellow or brownish mfuscation on
hindfemora and tibiae; front coxae may be all yellow, or medial and
anterior faces yellow only; midcoxae also variable from yellow to black;
hindcoxae black. Wmg veins yellow to yellowish brown; marginal
vem stout and wider than postmarginal; marginal averages .30 mm.
(.22-.42) and the short, stubby postmargmal vein averages .16 mm.
