NEOTROPICAL MICROLEPIDOPTERA, VII
NEW GENUS PSEUDOMERITASTIS AND ITS SPECIES
(LEPIDOPTERA: TORTRICIDAE) '
By Nicholas S. Obraztsov
Three species of the Tortricidae of the Neotropical fauna— I'o^wto
Meyrick, cordigera Walsingham, and heliadelpha Meyrick — were
placed by Edward Meyrick in the genus Meritastis Meyrick, and
cordigera was treated as a synonym of volufa. The present author
had the opportunity to reexamine these species which he accepts; his
review of the materials disclosed four undescribed species belonging
in the same relationship. His studies have shown that cordigera is a
separate species and that the entire group requires the recognition of
a new genus, having little in common with Meritastis.
In this paper the author establishes the new genus, describes four
new species, and gives information on the species formerly known.
The author acknowledges with thanks the kind assistance of Dr. J. F.
