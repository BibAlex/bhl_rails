REVISION OF CHALCID WASPS
OF GENUS EURYTOMA
IN AMERICA NORTH OF MEXICO
By Robert E. Bugbee ^
The species of the genus Eurytoma lUiger, from America north of
Mexico, have never been treated in a taxonomic study. The first
species of the genus from the United States were described by Thomas
Say in 1836, probably from specimens taken somewhere in the state
of Indiana, but the type material is lost. Additional species were
described by Francis Walker (1843 and 1846), Asa Fitch (1859), and
Benjamin D. Walsh (1870). In 1881 William Ashmead published his
first descriptions of new species of Eurytoma and continued to do so
into the early 1900's. He was a most productive worker and in 1888
issued a revised generic table of the family Eurytomidae, designated
genotypes for all genera of the family in 1894, and in 1904 published
the comprehensive "Classification of the Chalcid Flies." These
works, however, consisted primarily of brief descriptions and keys to
the genera but did not include keys to the species. Although many
of the Ashmead species are recognized today on the basis of his type
