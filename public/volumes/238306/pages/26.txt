AMPITHOIDAE FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA â€” BARNARD 19
Holotype: Allan Hancock Foundation No. 5737, male, 8.5 mm.
Type locality: Velero station 4806, Palos Verdes Headland, Los
Angeles Co., Calif., 33-44-13 N., 118-23-08 W., 8 fms., Jan. 6, 1957.
Material: Velero stations 4806 (8), 4823 (1 juv.?) 4956 (1). Camp-
bell station 5 (juv. 1?).
Records: Near Coal Oil Point, Calif., 8 fms.; Goleta, living in hold-
fast of Macrocystis pyrifera; Palos Verdes Headland, Calif. ; off Santa
Barbara, Calif., 17 m.
Relationship: This species is closely related to A. orientalis Dana,
as reviewed by J. L. Barnard (1955) but differs by the very short,
stout male second antennal flagellum and by gnathopod 1 which is
much stouter, especially article 6, its palm well developed and with
article 7 scarcely overlapping the palm. The second articles of
pereopods 1-5 are more slender in the new species.
Ampithoe mea Gurjanova (see 1951) is another relative, but again
its first gnathopod is more slender, the palm shorter, and the finger
overlappmg the palm more strongly. The second antennal flagellum
of A. mea, although tending to be short and stout, has 22 articles.
The first antenna has a stout spine on peduncular article 1. Probably
A. mea and A. eoa Gurjanova (see 1951) are synonomous despite
Gurjanova's careful analysis of then- differences in a table on p. 885.
For instance, her figure of pereopod 3 (fig. 616) is indeed pereopod
2 and so is not comparable to the third pereopod of A. eoa. Ampithoe
mea is simply a younger stage of A. eoa, the male finger on gnathopod
2 being shorter (see A. orientalis in J. L. Barnard [1955] and other
species of Ampithoe herem, where the gnathopodal development is
traced) and the disparity in thickness between articles 5 and 6 of
pereopod 5 increasing with age. The present new species differs
from both A. mea and A. eoa in the development of a process near the
finger hinge in adult male gnathopod 2.
Ampithoe lindbergi Giu-janova (see 1951) is a distinct species also
available in the present collections. Its second antenna has the
short thick flagellum, but again its first gnathopod is very slender
with the strongly overlapping finger; however, one might imagine
that its second gnathopod could develop into that of A. plea with ad-
vancing age. Perhaps there are differences in the second articles
of pereopods 3-5 because in the new species they are abnormally
slender; they have not been described for the types of A. lindbergi.
Ampithoe annenkovae Gurjanova (see 1951) is another species
with the long palm and finger of male gnathopod 2. Its second
antennal flagellum is slender although only 9-articulate and perhaps
the antenna shown is for the female. If so, and the male antenna had
been broken, it would be conceivable that A. annenkovae males are
