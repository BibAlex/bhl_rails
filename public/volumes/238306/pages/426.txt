Remarks. — -The nominate form of this subspecies has the apical
streak of the forewing continued to the upper of the tornal streaks and
connected to it. The specimens without this connection received the
name potamites Walsingham. They have the terminal streaks of the
forewing narrow, and some rotundate spots located internad of streaks.
The name geminipucta Walsingham was given to an undoubtedly
aberrative, narrow-wmged female specimen representing an extreme
of the form potamites. All these forms intergrade with each other,
and thus hardly deserve separate names. Even Walsingham him-
self, the author of potamites, was probably not quite certain of the
characters distmguishmg it, and identified some paratypes of this
"species" in the collection of the U.S. National Museum (nos. 5962,
5964, and 66229) as being rivularis. The photographs in the present
paper give an idea of the variation of the subspecies in Central
America and, besides the intergrading specimens, also include some
forms slightly deviating from the average limits of this variation.

Female. — Antenna black with scattered, whitish scales on scapus.
Labial palpus black with cream-white color starting at base laterally
* One other female specimen in the British Museum (Natural History), labeled
"Panama Crowley," belongs to the subspecies volcanica and probably originates
from South America.
