to antennae and crescent-shaped areas posterior to lateral antennae
(fig. 15a). Tentacular segment longer than following segment, with
2 pairs of tentacular cirri similar to lateral antennae. Dorsal cirri of
first setiger longer than following ones, similar to and longer than
median antenna.
Figure 13. — Sigamhra grubii (figures taken from Miiller, 1858): a, dorsal view anterior
end; h, parapodium; c, notopodial hooked seta.
Parapodia subbiramous ; notopodia low, conical, with notoaciculum
curving distally; stout, hooked, emergent notoseta beginning on
setiger 4. Dorsal cirri wide basally, tapering distally, extending be-
yond setal lobes. Neuropodia conical, with neuroaciculum and nu-
merous simple neurosetae. Neurosetae variable in length, longer ones
smooth, capillary, shorter ones spinous with fine tips. Ventral cirri
slender, subulate, shorter than setal lobes, lacking on setiger 2. Py-
gidium with 2 long anal chri. Proboscis with 14 papillae around
opening, with additional basal papUlae irregularly distributed.
Small specunens apparently of this species from Port Aransas, Tex.
(14 to 23 setigerous segments, fig. Ibe) agree generally with the larger
