Furnaricola myrmeciza, new species
Figures 12a, 25, 26
Holotype female and allotype male adults, from Myrmeciza i.
immaculata (Lafresnaye), collected by the author at Hcda. Santana,
Santander, Colombia, Oct. 10, 1949 (Carriker type no. 799).
Diagnosis: May be recognized by the shape of the head, the entire
lateral margins from base of temples to frons uniformly convex (see
fig. 25), and with the hyaline band around frons wide. Heads of
pleurites slender, pointed, and curved inward. The holotype has
three long spines on right side of segment VIII and the usual two on
left side. Have seen one other case of three spines on right side of
VIII.
Male genitalia very characteristic, there being presently no other
known species quite like it. The basal plate is small, expanded at
anterior end; paramera nearly as long as basal plate, slender, tapering,
with a reverse curve, and with a slender bifurcation at sides of endo-
mera; endomera tjrpical.
Represented by the female holotype, male allotype and one male
and one female paratypes, and by a single female from Myrmeciza
laemosticta pallida, collected at Hcda. Belen, Antioquia, which can-
not be separated from the female holotype. Measurements follow
next species.
Furnaricola pyriglena, new species
Figures 13a, 27
Holotype female adult, from Pyriglena leuconota picea Cabanis,
collected by the author at Enenas, Chanchamayo, Peru, March 4,
1930 (Carriker type no. 800).
Diagnosis: A rather large species with a conical-shaped head,
narrow frons and rounded temples. There are no outstanding
characters for this species, excepting shape of head, anterior and
gular plates and shape of segment VIII of abdomen. Legs small,
especially the coxae and second leg; median portion of pleurites black.
