I NO. 3533 CHALCID WASPS OF GENUS EURYTOMA — BUGBEE 501
slightly longer petiole that has its width about equal to its length,
the broad postmarginal vein that is usually twice the length of the
marginal, the very wealdy developed female genitalia with wide-
spread and broad dorsal valves, and the stylet arch in a horizontal
plane make this species quite distinct.
67. Eurytoma parva Phillips

Types: Female holotype and 5 female paratypes in the U.S. National
Museum, no. 23779.
Type locality: Warrenton, Va. Emerged 1917, W. J. Phillips
collection, Webster no. 9350.
Distribution: United States: New York, Virginia, Indiana, Kansas,
Ohio, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania. Canada: Alberta, Saskatch-
ewan.
Host: Harmolita tritici (Fitch) on wheat (Phillips, 1918 and 1927).
Lepidopterous galls on Solidago (Giraidt, 1920).
Additional hosts: Cephus cinctus (Department of Agriculture collec-
tion, Ottawa, Canada).
Remarks: This species has never had a full description pubHshed.
PhilHps (1918) pubUshed a picture but did not give a description
because he was using a manuscript name given the species by Girault.
Girault's paper (1920) was delayed in publication and does not
contain a description either but merely a reference to some specimens
from Youngstown, Ohio, Front Royal, Va., Holliday, Utah, and
Waterloo, N.Y., with a few notes on scape color, wing vein length,
and on variation in the median channel of the propodeum. Thus
the species is credited to Phillips. I have been unable to discover
all the specimens that Girault mentions, but the three females from
Falls Church, Va. (R. A. Cushman collection) from lepidopteran
galls on Solidago have been determined by me as Eurytoma bolteri
Riley. The type specimens in the U.S. National Museum, collected
by Philhps, are quite different from E. bolteri. On the basis stated
above, I doubt that E. parva has been bred from lepidopterous galls
on Solidago as stated in Giraidt's paper.
In the description of Eurytoma atripes, Gahan (1933) points out that
E. atripes and E. parva are very similar. He further suggests that the
two species may be one and the same. He separates the two on the
basis of the smaller size and the shorter funicle joints of E. atripes.
