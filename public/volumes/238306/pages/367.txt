p. 30; 1887, pp. 194-198 [Ashmead proposed the name, E. Mayri for E.
diastrophi of Mayr 1878].— BridweU, 1899, pp. 203-211.— Viereck 1916

Types: Walsh (1870) states that there were 2 males and 19 females
on which his description was based. In the U.S. National Museum is
a single male, bearing the type no. 1532 and the notation, "through
A. Bolter, 1890." This male speciman is probably not one of the
original types. In order to have something more definite to go by,
I have chosen a neotype female from Bloomington, Ind. The fe-
male emerged May 23, 1933, from a gall of Diastrophus nehulosm
collected by R. Bugbee on Apr. 12, 1933, on Ruhus species, Kinsey
determined. An additional neoparatype series from the same locahty,
date of collection, and host includes 49 males and 28 females that
emerged from May 23-30, 1933. Neotype female and neoparatypes
in the Bugbee collection, Allegheny College, MeadviUe, Pa. and in
the U.S. National Museum, Washington, D.C.
Type locality: Probably from the vicinity of Rock Island, 111.
where Walsh conducted much of his collecting. Neotype locahty,
Bloomington, Ind.
Distribution: United States: Connecticut, New Jersey, New York,
Vu-ginia, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C, North Carohna, Indiana,'
Illinois, Tennessee, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, or wherever
blackberry occurs.
Hosts: Distrophus cuscutoeformis (Osten Sacken). Diastrophus
nehulosus (Osten Sacken). Diastrophus niger Bassett. Galls of
Callachna gihha (Loew) (Peck, 1951).
Remarks: The host record Callachna gihha (Loew), is very doubtful
as this species seems to be restricted to gallmakers on blackberry
belonging to the cynipid genus Diastrophus.
This is a medium-sized species averaging 3.9 mm. in length. The
propodeum displays an incomplete, weakly developed median furrow
in the upper half to one-quarter, or furrow may be absent entirely.
Ninth tergum averages .26 mm. (.17-.32) in length. Female genitalia
moderately developed anteriorly, so that stylet arch is in an obhque
plane.
