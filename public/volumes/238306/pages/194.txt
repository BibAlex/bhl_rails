A REVIEW OF THE BEETLES
OF THE GENUS NEOBROTICA
AND SOME CLOSELY RELATED GENERA
By Doris H. Blake
Honorary Research Associate, Department of Entomology
The genus Neobrotica was first described by Jacoby in the "Biologia
Centrali-Americana" (Coleoptera, vol. 6, pt. 1, p. 571, 1887), who listed
under it 21 species. Only one of these, Diabrotica oberthuri Baly,
had been described previously. In the supplement published in 1892,
Jacoby added three more species from Central America. In 1889
he published two new species of Neobrotica from South America.
Weise added three, Bowditch two, and recently Bechyne ten more, all
from South America. One from the United States (Arizona) was
described by Fall. A few older species of Olivier and Fabricius have
also been added to the genus thereby doubling the original number.
In Schenkling's "Coleopterorum catalogus" (1924, pt. 78, p. 103),
Weise has taken the fii'st species described by Jacoby under Neo-
brotica — A^. variabilis — as the type of the genus, a rather unfortunate
choice as Jacoby in a later publication assigned to variabilis a South
American beetle different from the Mexican variabilis.
In his description of the genus, Jacoby (loc. cit.) gave the following
generic characters to differentiate Neobrotica from related genera:
