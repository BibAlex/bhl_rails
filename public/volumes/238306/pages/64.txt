PARASITIC COPEPOD CRUSTACEANS — LEWIS

posterior and lateral to mouth cone base, as extension of platelike
formation forming attachment and articulation surface for mandible.
Postoral process 3-segmented, first and second segments of approxi-
mately equal width although first somewhat longer than second and
second bearing minute knob on anterior and another on posterior
distal sm-face, anteriormost knob (at least) with spinule. Third
segment somewhat narrower than second or first, ovoid in dorsal
view, with distinct, marginally denticulated spine distally and small,
knoblike accessory process at base of spine. Pair of ovoid adhesion
pads (fig. Id) present posterior to mouth cone and postoral process,
just medial to maxilla base, at anterior end of heavily sclerotized
ridge associated with maxilliped base. Maxilla (fig. 8e) 2-segmented,
first segment slightly less than one and one-half times the length of
second, excluding terminal processes, more strongly developed.
Second segment slender, with 2 saber-shaped terminal processes, each
with numerous, stiff plumosities.

♦Armature elements in middle of segment.
Maxilliped (fig. 8/) 2-segmented, first segment irregular although
of general triangular outline from lateral viewpoint, with adhesion
pad on posterodistal surface. Second segment smaller than first,
irregular, with knoblike projection from anterior distal surface and
bilobed terminal process projecting posteriorly over part of first
segment adhesion pad when second segment flexed. Terminal pro-
cess lightly rugose, inner lobe longer than outer; single, hairlike
accessory process present on second segment, underneath terminal
process.
