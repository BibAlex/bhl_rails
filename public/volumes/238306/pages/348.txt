Female: Black. Length averages 3.9 mm. (3.6-4.8). Abdomen,
from the side, narrowly oval or conical; lateral compression slight;
averaging 2.2 mm. (1.8-2.6) in length; sixth segment long, averaging
.78 mm. (.70-. 90) at widest point; sculpturing on lateral surface of
sixth tergum heavy ventrally, continues dorsally for about one-half
to two -thirds of surface and then fades out so that dorsal surface is
smooth and shiny. Valves of ovipositor usually in line with the hori-
zontal axis of abdomen. Ninth tergum short to moderately elongate,
broad and somewhat bluntly pointed; averaging .19 mm. (.12-.25) in
length. Liternal genitaUa with very little dorsal extension of valves
anteriorly; dorsal valves mediumly broad for horizontal length turning
dorsally with ventral valves at much less than a right angle; stylet
arch in a horizontal to obhque plane; whole structure averages 1.5 mm.
(1.4-1.8) in length and .75 mm. (.62-.87) in height; thus height is half
of length or length equal to about twice the height. Tegula black.
Propodeum with a wide, shallow concavity and a narrow and deep, to
wide and shallow, usually complete median furrow; furrow widest at
top and narrows ventrally; lateral areas with rough punctations be-
tween fine UTegular ridges; median carina in furrow in upper one-
thu'd to one-half only; lateral carinae usually discernible to base.
Antenna fiUform; the scape all yellow or dark brown to black except
yellow base; flagellum often with segments one to five longer than
wide, moniUform, or segments four and five may be almost square;
segment six separated from seven by a distinct annulation but not as
truncate as proximal segments; whole structure appears short and
