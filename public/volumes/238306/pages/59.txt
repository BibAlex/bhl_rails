Oxacis barbara Arnett
The eighteen specimens of this species collected at Tornillo Flat,
3200 ft., May 5-12, do not agree very well with the type specimens of
the species. They do agree with this species better than with any
other. I prefer to report this collection of specimens under this name
pending further study of the species instead of describing this series as
a new species. These specimens differ from the type series by the
paler markings and their smaller size. The type locality is Lucedale,
Miss.
Oxacis trimaculata Champion
Plate 3
This widespread and extremely variable species was collected at
light and on lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla) at Boquillas, May 13-28,
and at light May 14 at Santa Elena Canyon (pi. 4 bottom).
Oxacis cana (LeConte)
Twenty-five specimens of this species were collected as follows:
Chisos Basin, May 3-24; Tornillo Flat, May 12; Panther Junction,
May 24; Boquillas, Maj'" 23; and Santa Elena, ^i&j 14.
Summary: A new species is described, Oxycopis howdeni, and
eight other species are reported from Big Bend National Park. Two
of the species, Sparedrus depressus and Oxacis angustata are recorded
in the United States for the first time. These species may be identi-
fied by the descriptions and kej^s in Champion (1889, 1890) and
Arnett (1951, 1953, 1961, 1963).
