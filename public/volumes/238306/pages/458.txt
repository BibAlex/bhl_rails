Introduction
As the site of Napoleon's last imprisonment and death, St. Helena
is one of the best known solitary islands in the world, but much of
its marme fauna has not been accorded the attention that it deserves.
The island is an isolated volcanic peak 103^ miles long and 63^ mUes
wide, situated slightly east of the mid-Atlantic Ridge at latitude
15°58' S. and longitude 5°43' W. The nearest point of exposed land
is Ascension Island, about 800 miles to the northwest; southern
Angola, roughly 1,200 miles to the east, is the closest point on the
coast of West Africa, and Recife, BrazU, approximately 2,000 miles
to the west-northwest, is the nearest South American shore. That
St. Helena is reasonably old and has long been isolated is suggested
by its numerous endemic fishes (Cunningham, 1910, and Cadenat
and Marchal, 1963), mollusks (E. A. Smith, 1890), and echinoderms
(Mortensen, 1933).
Although considerable marine collecting has been done at St.
Helena by Melliss, Cunningham, Mortensen, Colman, and the Reine-
