NEOTROPICAL MICROLEPIDOPTERA, VIII â€” DUCKWORTH 393
stalked. Abdomen of males with strong, eversible pair of hair pencils
contained in an elongate cuplike pocket on first sternum (fig. la).
jMale genitalia: Uncus simple or furcate, erect or strongly recurved;
gnathos with separate arms, with or without yokelike connection from
their bases; subscaphium present or absent; harpe sunple, furcate
setae present; anellus with four lateral lobes, ventral pair simple,
setiferous, dorsal pair larger, variously shaped; aedeagus with or
without long lateral process, entrance of ductus ejaculatorius lateral,
cornuti present or absent.
Female genitaha: Ostium bursae sclerotized; ductus bursae mem-
branous; inception of ductus seminalis near ostium; corpus bui"sae
membranous, with a heavily sclerotized, dumbbell-shaped, dentate
signum.
This genus is unique in that it is recognized easily by its wing shape
and maculation, a situation not common in the stenomids. No other
genus in the family has the falcate wing apex and curious wing macula-
tion which Meyrick (1916) referred to as "an aspect of reptilian
mimicry." As regards "reptilian municry, " I have not been able to
locate any prior or subsequent application of this term and must
simply presume that Meyrick detected a resemblance between the
maculation of the moths of this genus and the scaling of reptiles.
The genitalia provide a number of distinguishing characters for the
genus. In the males the lateral entrance of the ductus ejaculatorius
into the aedeagus plus the separate gnathal arms associated with
either a yokelike connection from their bases or a subscaphium on the
tuba analis. In the females the mception of the ductus seminalis just
before the ostium, membranous ductus bursae, and dumbbell-shaped
signum readily distinguish the genus.
