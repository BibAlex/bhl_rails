NO. 3536 DECAPOD CRUSTACEANS — CHACE 635
Remarks: This immature specimen differs from Miers' description
of D. imperator in a few characters. The frontal margin is deeply
sinuous, rather than "nearly straight," and it is armed with, a slender
spine directed anterolaterally just lateral to the base of each eye-
stalk. The ocular scales each terminate in two divergent spines (the
outer one sHghtly stouter than the inner) rather than being "dentic-
ulated on theu" outer margins." Also, there are no calcareous plates
on the anterior abdominal somites. These differences may be merely
characteristic of subadult indi^^duals.
Distribution: Known only from St. Helena, to a depth of at least
25 meters.

Albunea carabus. — ]\Ionod, 1956, p. 40, figs. 10-14.
Material: None.
Remarks: There is nothing in Stebbing's remarks about the speci-
men collected by the Scotia at "James Bay, St. Helena, June 2, 1904;
Station 499" to suggest that it is other than A. carabus, but reexamina-
tion of the specimen would be desirable because of the information
that has been gained about the species of Albunea during the past
50 years.
Distribution: Mediterranean; West Africa as far south as Ghana;
St. Helena. Sublittoral.
