shorter ninth abdominal segment, a more dorsally arched and plumper
abdomen, lighter colored scape of the antenna, and its range.

Map 31
Eurytoma imminuta Bugbee, 1951, pp. 259-260. — Burks, 1958, p. 81.
Types: 9 females and 1 male, holotype female, allotype male,
paratypes in the U.S. National Museum (USNM 61239). Paratypes
in Bugbee collection, Allegheny College, Meadville, Pa.
Type locality: Pyramid Lake, Nev.
Distribution: United States: Nevada, Utah, Oregon.
Host: Diplolepis variabilis (Bassett) variety on Rosa puberulenta.
Remarks: Although close to E. spongiosa, this species can be sep-
arated by its very short dorsal valves (ninth tergum) that average
.10 mm. (.07-.12) in length, and the narrow and deep, complete
median furrow on the propodeum.

Types: 3 females, no. 2789 in the U.S. National Museum.
Type locality: One of the female types bears the no. 38E. The
following notations under type locality were taken from a card file
in the U.S. National Museum. Washington, D.C., galls collected
Aug. 1867; emerged May 1, 1868.
Distribution: United States: Washington, D.C., New York, Vir-
ginia, Indiana, South Dakota, Kansas.
Host : Gnorimoschema gallaesolidaginis (Riley) on Solidago species.
Remarks: The commonest host for this species is Gnorimoschema
gallaesolidaginis on Solidago species. Other host designations are
questionable as I have bred many specimens of eurytomids and never
recovered this species from any other host.
E. bolteri is a large species averaging 5.0 mm. in length. The
marginal and postmarginal veins are most often equal in length, and
the propodeum is wide with a shallow concavity, in the center of which
is a narrow, shallow median furrow that narrows ventrally. The
lateral surface of the sixth tergum is heavily sculptured to the dorsal
surface where sculpturing becomes lighter and may continue over
dorsal surface along anterior border, or fade out altogether.
