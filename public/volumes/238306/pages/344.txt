Female: Black except for yellow fore- and midtibiae, extremities
of hindtibiae and all femora, scape of antenna, and wing veins. Aver-
age in length 3.4 mm. (3.2-3.8). Abdomen globular and plump with
only slight lateral compression; sixth tergum about V/i times the
length of the fifth; sculpturing of fine, shallow punctations covers
all of lateral surface of sixth tergum and extends over dorsal sur-
face on anterior half; covers most of lateral and dorsal surfaces of
all other abdominal terga; ninth tergum short and stubby, averaging
.14 mm. (.12-. 17) in length. Internal genitaha with broad dorsal
valves for horizontal length and their color is black; very little dorsal
extension ateriorly, of dorsal and ventral valves, so that stylet arch
is close to a horizontal plane; average length of genitaha 1.5 mm. and
