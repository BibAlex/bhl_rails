NEOTROPICAL MICROLEPIDOPTERA, IX
REVISION OF GENUS PSEUDATTERIA
(LEPIDOPTERA: TORTRICIDAE) '
By Nicholas S. Obraztsov^
The species of the genus Pseudatteria Walsingham with their
comparatively large size and bright coloring appear as the most
striking moths among the entire South American Tortricidae; to-
gether with two other superficially similar genera, Atteria Walker and
Idolatteria Walsingham, they represent an endemic group of the
Neotropical fauna. Meyrick (190S) estabhshed a separate familj^
Ceracidae which included the Oriental and Palaearctic genus Cerace
Walker. Misled by some superficial resemblance of the Neotropical
Atteria with Cerace, the same author (MejTick, 1910) considered
them to be synonyms of a common genus. In accordance with this
the Pseudatteria species, not separated at that time from Atteria,
should also become members of the family Ceracidae. Later Meyrick
(1912) included this "family" in the Tortricidae, and treated it
(i\Ie}Tick, 1913) as a group of genera, not naming it separately.
