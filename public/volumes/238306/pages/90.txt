PARASITIC COPEPOD CRUSTACEANS — LEWIS HI
pads associated with the antennae are not as huge in the Atlantic
Coast specimens as they are on the Pacific specmiens. The postoral
adhesion pads, in all specimens, gre of a general ovoid shape. The
only difference in the thoracic leg armature of the specimens is that
the fom-th leg exopodite has 5 small spines in the Japanese spec-
imens and 8 in the Atlantic, Pacific Coast, and Hawaiian specimens.
This difference does not appear significant inasmuch as most of the
margin has nmnerous denticulations in all specunens and the differ-
ence between a large denticle and a small spine or spinule is not very
great.
