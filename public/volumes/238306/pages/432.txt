Remarks. — Somewhat similar to symplacota Meyrick and with a
cornutus almost of the same shape. Differs in having the genitalic
characters of the subgenus Eurynatteria and in some details of the
markings of the wings. The latter vary a little in the confluence of the
apical and terminal streaks of the forewing and the development of
spots in the internal areas of both wmgs; the extreme form with nu-
merous discal spots received a separate name baccheutis Meyrick
The hindwing of male is suffused with yellowish olive and usually has
the subdorsal spots larger and more numerous.

Remarks. — Meyrick described baccheutis as a separate species on the
basis of two specimens, one of which was the present lectotype, and
the other a male which is now missing. The photographs in plate 40
give a clear idea of baccheutis as a form very close to heliocausta. The
only important difference between them is in the discal and dorsal
spots, well developed in baccheutis and only slightly (and not always)
indicated in heliocausta. The discal dots of the hindwing show a
similar arrangement in both, although they also are better developed
and more numerous in baccheutis. There is no difference in the female
genitaha of both, and this is the reason for treating baccheutis and
heliocausta as conspecific. It is quite possible that baccheutis, originat-
