41. Eurytoma brevivena Biigbee
Map 20
Eurytoma brevivena Bugbee, 1958a, p. 198.
Types: 13 females and 1 male; holotype female in the U.S. National
Museum (USNM no. 66032) ; paratypes in Bugbee collection, Mead-
ville, Pa.
Type locality: Grand Canyon, Ariz., collected Jan. 26, 1920, A. C.
Kinsey.
Distribution: Known only from the type locality.
Host: Disholcaspis quercus-globulus (Fitch) on Quercus gambelii
(Bugbee, 1958).
Remarks: The host of this species is probably not the species indi-
cated on the labels, because D. quercus-globulus does not extend
westward to Arizona according to Weld in Muesebeck and others
(1951). Its host will probably be found to be a western species of the
genus Disholcaspis associated with Quercus gamhelii.
The strong striations on the lower face converging on the clypeus,
the short postmarginal vein that averages about half the length of the
marginal, and the wide median furrow on the propodeum that narrows
ventrally, are additional characteristics of this species.

Types: Holotype female, no. 49893, and 57 paratype females in
the U.S. National Museum, Washington, D.C.
Type locality: Ithaca, N.Y., collected and reared by G. F. Hughes
in 1930.
Distribution: United States: New York, Michigan, Indiana, Mas-
sachusetts, Louisiana, Kansas, Ohio. Canada: Ontario.
Host: Eurosta solidaginis Fitch on Solidago species (Gahan, 1934).
Remarks: No males have appeared in any of the series of E.
obtusiventris from the more northern states (New York, Michigan,
Indiana) and southern Canada. The females, therefore, must be
parthenogenetic. However, the series reared from Tephritis {—Neo-
tephritis) Jlnalis (Loew) on Helianthus species from Columbus, Miss.,
by Breland (1939) and determined by Gahan as E. obtusiventris,
does contain several males. I have examined some of the Breland
specimens and have included them in the succeeding new species.
Characteristics that separate this species from the next one, in
