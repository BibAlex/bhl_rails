is the fact that the two females are so very different, while both are from hosts
of the same genus. Further checks are being made to find out what species of
birds were actually collected on the two days corresponding to the dates of the
taking of the two specimens under discussion.
Furnaricola hylactiphaga hylactiphaga, new subspecies
Figures 20a, 30
Holotype female adult, from Scytalopus magellanicus affinis Zimmer,
collected by the author at Yanac, Huascardn, Peru, March 22, 1932
(Carriker type no. 803).
Diagnosis: Head slenderly conical, with the short, broken, pre-
antennary carinae black; gular plate small and without appendages;
thoracic segments normal; abdomen elongated oval, with deeply
pigmented, narrow pleurites; tergites heavily pigmented in outer
portion and pale in median portion.
Tergites separated medially, with rounded ends. The only known
host on which have been taken Furnaricola with this type of tergites
is Scytalopus.
Six rather longish setae behind the short, lateral spines on VIII.
Male unknown. Represented by the female holotype and one female
paratype.
It will be most interesting to see what type of genitalia is present
in the species from Scytalopus, and also in those from the Pipridae.
Measurements follow next species.
Furnaricola hylactiphaga canae, new subspecies
Figures 21a, 31
Holotype female adult, from Scytalopus magellanicus canus Chap-
man, collected by the author at Hcda. Potreros, near Frontino,
Anti6quia, Colombia, June 7, 1950 (Carriker type no. 804).
Diagnosis: As in the nominate race, the tergites are divided medi-
ally; the pleiu-ites are narrow dorsally and partly black, with wider,
paler sternal portion; head with preantennary margin slightly concave
and with temples more expanded. Anterior plate rather long, and
divided as in the nominate race (see fig. 31). Sternal spines on VIII
short, with 1 long and 5 very short setae behind them. Male un-
known. Represented by the holotype female and one female paratype.
Measurements of F. h. hylactiphaga and F. hylactiphaga canae are
