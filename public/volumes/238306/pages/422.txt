Remarks. — The wing spots are somewhat variable in the size,
shape, and number, but this changes very little the general appearance
of the species, which is esaily recognizable because of the very char-
acteristic markings of the wings. The spots in the subterminal area of
the forewing have a tendency to become confluent with the terminal
streaks. On the hindwing there are generally no spots in the interior
area of the wing, but in some specimens these spots are even more
numerous than in the male specimen figured in the present paper.
