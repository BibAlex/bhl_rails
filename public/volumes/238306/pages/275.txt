There is enough variation in this species and niimero^us so that all
characters which were thought to be distinctive were found to overlap
when more material was examined.
I have seen males of this species from the District of Columbia,
Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ontario, Pennsylvania, and
Virginia.
Brachycentriis numerosus (Say)
Phryganea numerosn Say, 1823, p. 160.
Brachycentriis nvmerosus.- — 'Ross, 1944, pp. 264-265, figs. 899, 902. [Neotypes
designated.]
Although males of this species and the preceding are easily separated,
no differences could be found between the females.
Males of this species from Massachusetts, Michigan, North Caro-
lina, and Quebec were studied.
Brachycentriis fuliginosus Walker
Brachycentrus fuUginosus Walker, 1852, p. 88.
Brachycentriis fuliginosus. — -Betten and Mosely, 1940, pp. 177-178, fig. 89. [Holo-
type figured.]
Brachycentrus fuliginosus. — -Leonard and Leonard, 1949, pp. 7-8, figs. 5-8. [Male
figured.]
The figures of the female type presented by Betten and Mosely
do not show anj^ differences from females of incanus or numerosus.
Figures of a male, presumed to be this species, are to be found in
Leonard and Leonard. The species, of which I have seen no examples,
is recorded from Michigan, Ontario, and Quebec.
Brachycentrus lateralis (Say)
Phryganea lateralis Say, 1823, p. 161.
Brachtjcentrus lateralis.— Ross, 1944, pp. 265-266, figs. 900, 903. [Neotypes
designated.]
This species appears to have paler legs, antennae, and pilosity
than related species. It is possible to separate the females of this
species from those of the incanus type. In lateralis the setal area
of the ninth and tenth terga is confined to the apical third, rather
than occupying a half or more of the segment.
Males from Illinois, Michigan, Quebec, and Pennsylvania were
examined.
Brachycentrus nigrisoma (Banks)
Figures 4:g,h
Sphinctogaster nigrisoma Banks, 1905, p. 12.
Brachycentrus notabulus Milne, 1936, p. 112. [New synonymy.]
The unique female type of this species was studied and found to be
identical to the female allotype of notabulus Milne. The female sex
