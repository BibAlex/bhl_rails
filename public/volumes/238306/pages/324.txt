NO. 3533 CHALCID WASPS OF GENUS EURYTOMA — BUGBEE 461
Host: Pachypsylla vesicula (Riley) on Celtis reticulata, C. occidentalis
and C. mississippiensis and P. mamma (Riley) on C. occidentalis.
Remarks: Additional characteristics that will help to separate this
species from the succeeding one are the presence of only two tubercles
on the proximal end of the fulcra! plate; the shorter ninth tergum
that averages .14 mm. (.10-. 17) in length, and the yellow color of the
horizontal length of the dorsal valves.

Map 8
Eurytoma flavovultus Bugbee, 1957, pp. 45-47.
Types: 64 females and 25 males; holotype female, allotype male in
the U.S. National Museum (USNM 66038) ; paratypes in the U.S.
National Museum, University of Texas, and Cornell University,
Type locality: Austin, Tex.
Distribution: United States: Texas.
Host: Pachypsylla venusta Osten Sacken on Celtis reticulata.
Remarks: In addition to the characteristics listed in the key, the
longer ninth tergum averaging .22 mm. (.20-.25), the black horizontal
length of the dorsal valves, and the presence of three tubercles on
the proximal end of the fulcral plate, will help to distinguish this
species.
17. Eurytoma bicolor Walsh
Map 7
Eurytoma bicolor Walsh, 1870, p. 298.— Ashmead, 1881b, p. 30.— Viereck, 1916,
p. 521.— Cole, 1931, p. 35.— Peck, 1951, p. 575.
Types: 1 male and 2 females. Types lost. Neotypes: 29 females
and 6 males in the U.S. National Aluseum.
Type locality: Probably from the vicinity of Rock Island, 111.
where Walsh did much of his collecting. Neotypes: Bloomington,
Ind.
Distribution: United States: Connecticut, Washington, D.C., Iowa,
Virginia, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois. Canada: Ontario.
Host: Galls on black oak (Walsh, 1870). Typha latijolia (cat-
tails) E. bicolor larva found in dried galls on stem (Cole, 1931).
Sphex={Isodontia) harrisi (Fernald) (Peck, 1951). Scolytus rugulosus
(Ratzeburg) (Peck, 1951). Aulacidea tumida (Bassett). Aulacidea
podagrae (Bassett). Eurosta solidaginis Fitch.
Remarks: Some of the hosts listed for E. bicolor seem very doubtful,
especially Sphex harrisi (Fei-nald) and Scolytus rugidosus (Ratzeburg).
The hosts most commonly stated belong to the genus Aulacidea that
produce galls on several species of Lactuca. E. bicolor is quite variable.
