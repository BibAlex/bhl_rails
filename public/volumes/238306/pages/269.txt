Dicosmoeciis palatus (McLachlan)
Figure 2j
Stenophylax palatus McLachlan, 1872, p. 63.
Dicosmoecus obscuripennis Banks, 1938, p. 76, figs. 4, 5. [New synonymy.]
No significant differences could be found between the type of
obscuripennis Banks from Alaska, and an example of palatus
McLachlan from the River Kolyma, Siberia. The lateral sheaths
of the aedeagus in this species are very long and slender and are
capped by a few spines and 1 or 2 nearer the base. The basal ridge
of the clasper is long with the upper end slightly separated, but
not developed into a sharp tooth. These specimens of this species
are a bit smaller than the other species and colored a more uniformly
darker brown.
Dicosmoecus frontalis (Banks), new combination
Drusinus frontalis Banks, 1943, pp. 350-351, figs. 28, 29.
The unique female type of this species was studied. The genitalia
of the type indicate that the species does not belong in Drusinus
but in the Dicosmoecinae, most probably in Dicosmoecus. D. aureo-
ventris Davis is probably a synonym, but until a series containing
both sexes becomes available, I hesitate to establish the synonymy.
Allocosmoecus partitus Banks
Figures 2k, I
Allocosmoecus partitus Banks, 1943, pp. 365-366, figs. 73, 74, 76.
This very large caddis fly bears a striking superficial resemblance
to the larger species of Dicosmoecus. The genitalia, however, are
totally different and fully substantiate a separate generic status.
The figures were drawn from the unique male type.
Pseiidostenophylax edwardsi (Banks)
Anisogamus edwardsi Banks, 1920, p. 345.
Anisogamus atripennis Banks, 1924, pp. 440-441. [New synonymy.]
The abdomens of the female type of atripennis and the allotype and
another female of edwardsi were cleared and studied. No differences
could be found between their genitalia, and additionally the two types
bear the same data. The type of atripennis is larger and more uni-
formly dark brown than edwardsi, but these are apparently only
superficial differences.
Pseiidostenophylax sparsus (Banks)
Halesus sparsus Banks, 1908a, pp. 63-64, fig. 12.
Stenophylax calypso Banks, 1911, p. 350, fig. 25.
Drusinus virginicus. â€” Ross (not Banks), 1944, p. 202, fig. 696.
This species is fairly common over most of eastern North America.
Ross (1944) published the only good figure of the male genitalia of this
