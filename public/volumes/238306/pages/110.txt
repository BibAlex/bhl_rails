medially and sharply curved so that distal surface at right angles to
proximal. Third segment and terminal process continuous, forming
strongly developed, heavily sclerotized claw bearing 2 small accessory
processes; first process a spinule from knob in proximal region, second
a slender setule from middle of combined segment and terminal
process. Mandible (fig. 34c) 4-parted, distal part short, curved in-
ward slightly, with 12 minute denticulations along inner surface.
Postantennal process (fig. 346) a suborbicular adhesion pad and 3
nodules, each bearing several hairlike processes, pad situated lateral
to base of antenna. Postoral process (fig. 346) situated lateral to

* Small, bilobed membranous process presumably modified from hairlike processes normal to members of
the genus.
•• Only marginal armature included.
*** The origin of the armature elements is presumed to be the exopodite,
mouth cone, consisting of 2 parts. Posteriormost part a broad,
heavily sclerotized, subtriangular projection, anterior part a node
bearing 2 slight swellings distally, each with flabby, setule-Hke process.
Maxilla (fig. 34(:Z) 2-segmented, situated posterior and lateral to post-
oral process, both segments of about equal length although first more
strongly developed, broader proximally than distally. Second seg-
ment narrow proximally, broader distally, with row of spinides on
posterior distal surface, long, whiplike terminal process with frUled
margins and short, dagger-like terminal process, also with frilled
margins.
Maxilliped (fig. 34c?) 2-segmented, situated posterior and medial
to maxilla base. First segment strongly developed, slightly less than
twice the length of second segment and terminal process, with narrow
proximal end, small concavity of inner medial surface, and small,
knoblike adhesion process just distal to concavity. Second segment
short and chunky, divided, by regions of sclerotization, from bifurcate
