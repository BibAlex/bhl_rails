other shapes. In the other female of igniflora ("Bolivia"; slide 4532)
the preapical spot of the forewing includes only one cream-white
costal mark, and is narrower connected with the internal, rounded
extension of the apical spot. The latter and the terminal spot below
it each includes only one cream-white marginal mark. The tornal spot
has no cream-white mark on the dorsum or anywhere. The apical
spot of the hindwing is less extended internad than in the type of
igniflora, and has a rather long, cream-white mark at the wing apex.
All mterspaces between the terminal and tornal spots are reddish
orange; in the type of igniflora the interspace between the terminal
spot and the upper of the tornal spots is cream white. The genitalia
of this female also are distinct from those of bradleyi, and differ
somewhat from those of the type specimen and the female specimen
of igniflora which has been discussed previously. It is quite possible
that in Bolivia there are more than one species similar to igniflora, and
the specimen from "Bolivia" (slide 4532) belongs to a new species.
