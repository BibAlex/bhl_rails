Remarks. — The female specimen in the British Museum (Natural
History), indicated as the type of anemonantha (Clarke, 1958, p. 200),
is merely a pseudotype which was collected in 1934. The real holo-
type of anemonantha is deposited in the Deutsches Entomologisches
Institut, Berlin; it was seen by the present author and compared with
other examined specimens of this species.
The species varies in the size and shape of the marginal spots of
the forewing and in the mode of their confluence among themselves
and the smaller, contiguous spots. The number and size of the
discoidal spots are inconstant. On the hindwings of the females
only the terminal and sub terminal spots are present; the males have
some additional spots and oblique streaks also in the discoidal area.
