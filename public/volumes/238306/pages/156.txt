DESCRIPTIONS AND RECORDS
OF WEST INDIAN CERAMBYCIDAE
(COLEOPTERA)
By John A. Chemsak^
This paper is intended primarily to report on a collection of Ceram-
bycidae made by Dr. J. F. Gates Clarke, Chairman of the Depart-
ment of Entomology, U.S. National Museum, while a member of the
Smithsonian-Bredin Caribbean Expeditions to the British Virgin
Islands and British West Indies in 1956 and 1958. A total of 136
Cerambycidae representing 13 genera and 21 species was taken on
these f aunistically interesting islands. Of these, six are presumed to be
new and one previously described is considered to belong to a new
genus.
A second objective is to contribute further to the knowledge of the
cerambycid fauna of the West Indies. Although no major monograph
covering this area as a whole has yet been published, a number of
papers dealing with island groups or reporting new species have been
published. Subsequent to 1862 when Chevrolat described several
of the Cuban species, the major works have been those of Gahan (1895)
