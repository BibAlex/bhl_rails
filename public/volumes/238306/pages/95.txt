terminal process longer than outer, with rows of very fine plumosities,
outer terminal process with membranous borders.
Maxilliped (fig. 25/) 2-segmented, complex, situated posterior to
maxilla base. First segment irregular, lumpy, with heavily sclero-
tized distal knob projecting past second segment and terminal process,
receiving terminal process of second segment when segment flexed.
Second segment and terminal process attached to posterior distal
surface of first segment, segment distinct from distally rounded termi-
nal process. Subtriangular process (fig. 25^) present between posterior
ends of maxilliped bases, projecting ventrally and bearing adhesion
surface distally. Process closely associated with maxilliped bases but
not attached directly to them, similar to condition of sternal furca-
bearing caligoids.
Thoracic legs I-IV biramous, with 1 -segmented protopodite and
2-segmented rami. For nature of armature and legs see table 10 and
figures 2Qa-d.
