Furnaricola anahacerthia, new species
Figures 18, 24a
Holotype female adult, from Anahacerthia striaticollis Lafresnaye,
collected by the author at Virolin, Dept. Santander, Colombia, Sept.
19, 1943 (Carriker type no. 795).
Diagnosis: Also one of the larger species (female, 1.70X.525),
but with the head of a different shape. Temples rounded; occipital
margin slightly undulating; preantennary margin almost straight;
frons wide and anterior plate small, protruding, and wider than long.
Pleurites heavily pigmented, ventral portion wider than dorsal; heads
large and rounded; anterior margin of tergites incised laterally and
with hyaline bands along both sides; sternites as in lachrymosa, but
wider laterally. Represented by female holotype and one female
paratype.
Measurements follow next species.
Furnaricola longifrons, new species
Figures 19, 20, 25a
Holotype female and allotype male adults, from Margarornis
squamigera perlatus (Lesson), collected by the author at La Palmita,
Santander Norte, Colombia, Aug. 14, 1916. (Carriker type no. 796.)
Head unusually long (female, .477 X -39); temples rounded and
with lateral margins converging from middle of temples to the wide
frons; preantennary margin slightly concave; anterior plate short,
wider than long and with anterior edge convex and posterior concave;
preantennary carinae submarginal; abdominal sclerites normal.
Basal plate of male genitalia very short, with length but little more
than that of the paramera (see fig. 20) ; paramera with thickened
bases and long, slender, slightly in-curved apical portion; endomera
almost parallel sided, with slender tip. Represented by female
holotype, male allotype, and two female paratypes.
Measurements of the types of F. anahacerthia and F. longifrons are
as follows:
