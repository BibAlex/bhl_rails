REVISION OF GENUS FURNARICOLA â€” CARRIKER 421
Furnaricola pipraphaga, new species
Figures 15a, 28
Holotype female adult, from Pipra pipra comata Berlepsch and
Stolzman, collected by the author at Enefias, Chanchamayo, Peru,
March 12, 1930 (Carriker type no. 801).
Diagnosis: Head decidedly triangular, somewhat similar to that of
F. triangularis, but the mandibles are quite different, as well as the
preantennary carinae, clavi and gular plate (see fig. 28). Head also
resembles that of pyriglena in shape, but the abdominal sclerites are
very different, the tergites in pyriglena almost filling the segments
and with prominent sternites in III- VII, while in the present species
the pleurites are without heads and tergites widely separated by
hyaline bands, and the sternites, if present, are entirely invisible,
excepting the genital sternite covering portions of VII and VIII.
One long and five short setae behind the short, slender lateral spines.
Male unknown. Represented by the holotype female only.
Measiu-ements follow next species.
Furnaricola inexpectata, new species
Figures 14a, 29
Holotype female adult, from Pipra caeruleicapilla Tschudi, col-
lected by the author at La Pampa, southeast Peru, July 8, 1931
(Carriker type no. 802).
Diagnosis : Head very differently shaped from that of F. piprajihaga
described above, being somewhat similar to that of F. acuticeps choco-
ana, but with more rounded temples and much wider frons and with
wide, heavily pigmented preantennary carinae having corrugated
inner margins. The gular plate very similar to that of pipraphaga,
but pterothorax longer and wider and \Ndth third pair of legs much
smaller. Also lacks the sternites as in pipraphaga; long spines on
VIII similar, but only three very short setae back of them.

Note: There is a faint possibility of straggling in the case of this and the pre-
ceding species, although no real proof. The genus Furnaricola is, on the whole,
quite sedentary in its habits, clinging tightly to the feathers of the dead bird,
and not moving about as do many other genera. The only thing that is suspicious
