and lateral to postoral process. First and second segments of ap-
proximately equal length, fii'st more strongly developed, with
tapered and curved proximal end forming articulation and muscle
attachment surface; second segment elongate, narrower proximally
than distally, with pair of saber-shaped terminal processes, inner
approximately twice the length of outer, with pair of fine, filmy
membranes, outer terminal process with fuzzy membrane along inner
and outer lateral margins.
Ventral smface of cephalothorax with several irregularities, 2 of
notable value. First a lobate projection (fig. 31e) of heavily sclerot-
ized ridge extending laterally from base of antenna. Second a pair
of minute, subtriangular projections (fig. 32a) between maxilla bases
and just anterior and medial to maxilliped bases, in region of postoral
adhesion pads found in pandarids, euryphorids and some caligids.

*SmaU, hairlike spicules on protopodite and exopodite not included.
Maxilliped (fig. 32a) 2-segmented, situated posterior and medial
to maxilla base. Fkst segment longer than second, with spikelike
projection from posteroproximal surface. Second segment slender,
tapered slightly from proximal to distal regions, with small, clawlike
terminal process distinct from segment, also with setule-like acces-
sory processes adjacent to terminal process. Sternal furca (fig. 32a)
large, situated between and slightly posterior to maxilliped bases,
consisting of anteriorly rounded, heavily sclerotized plate bearing
pair of slightly diverging tines, tines approximately one and one-
fourth times the length of plate.
Thoracic legs I-IV biramous, protopodite 1-segmented, rami of
first leg 2-segmented, of others 3-segmented. For nature of armature
and legs see table 13 and figm'es 326-/.
