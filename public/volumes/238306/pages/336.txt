NO. 3533 CHALCID WASPS OF GENUS EURYTOMA — BUGBEE 477
Type locality: Kent Island, Md. Specimens collected Feb. 8, 1953,
and emerged Mar. 3, 1953.
Host: Bred from galls of Protaplonx species on Baccharis helmifolia.
Remarks: The male antenna of this new species has only four
pedicellate segments in the flagellum. The fifth is separated from
the two closely fused terminal units by an annulation rather than a
short pedicle. The lack of yellow or reddish brown on the head,
thorax, and abdomen will distinguish this species from Eurytoma
juniperinus or E. prunicola.

the thorax is more robust and the propodeum is broad and shallowly
concave without a clearly defined median groove. It differs also in
the equal length of the marginal and postmarginal veins.

Host: Acraspis guadaloupensis (Fidlaway) on Q. chrysolepis (Fulla-
way, 1912) Andricus lasius (Ashmead) (Fidlaway, 1912).

but it is smaller in all its measurements; has more black infuscation
on the legs (not in blotches as in E. calijoi^nica) ; brown rather than
yellow tegulae, and the abdomen is not deeply oval but more
rectangular in shape in a lateral view.
