Types: Female holotype and male allotype, plus paratypes, in the
collection of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y.
Type locality: Ithaca, N.Y.
Distribution: United States: New York, Washington, D.C., Penn-
sylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana,
Kansas, and Michigan.
Host: Phytophagous in the seeds of sumac, Rhus typhina, R. glabra,
and R. copallina.
Remarks: This widespread species occurs wherever its host, sumac
species, are found. The oval abdomen with the sixth tergum equal in
length to four and five combined, the reduced sculpturing on the
lateral surface of the sixth, and its smaller size, will help to differentiate
this species from E. seminis Bugbee.

averages 2.0 mm. (L7-2.4) in length; plump with slight lateral com-

averaging .15 mm. (.12-. 17) in length. Internal genitalia with the
dorsal valves mediumly narrow for horizontal length or the length of
the exposed portion of the ninth tergum is about two-thirds the width
of the dorsal valves at their widest point; dorsal and ventral valves
turn dorsally, anteriorly, at less than aright angle; stylet arch oblique;
whole structiu-e averages 1.6 mm. (1.5-1.7) in length and 1.0 mm.
(.09-1.1) in height; thus height averages 62 percent of the length.
Tegula dark brown. Propodeum broad; shallowly depressed; wide
median fiurow indicated dorsally by lateral carinae for about one-half
or less of length; surface of furrow crossed by irregular horizontal
ridges; deep pit absent at base of propodeum; lateral areas narrow;
dorsal carina fiat across top of furrow. Antenna fihform, with the
scape yellowish brown and flagellum dark brown; segments of funicle
moniliform, longer than wide; legs with dark-brown to black infusca-
