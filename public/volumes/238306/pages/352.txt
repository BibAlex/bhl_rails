NO. 3533 CHALCID WASPS OF GENUS EURYTOMA — BUGBEE 497
15 males. All specimens except those collected in 1956 from vial 4 or
5, nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; lot 59-153.
Distribution: Canada: Ontario.
Host: Phytophagous in the buds of jack pine (Pinus banksiana).
Remarks: This species is close to E. squamosa in its size relation-
ships, short ninth tergum, sculpturing of the abdomen, color of the
legs, and phytophagous habit. It differs, however, in the shallow,
complete median furrow and the rougher sculpturing of the lateral
areas, the more dorsally produced female genitalia, and the different
host.

Type locality: Washington, D.C., A. D. Hopkins collection.
Host: Rhyacionia rigidiana (Fernald), R. buoliana (Schiff ermiiller) ,
and R. frustrana (Comstock) on Pinus sylvestris and P. banksiana.
Additional hosts from labels on determined specimens in the U.S.
National Museum and Bugbee collections: Acrobasis rubrifasciella
(Peck). Eucosoma scudderiana Clemens. Pectinophora gossypiella
(Saunders). Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis (Haworth). Epiblema
strenuana (Walker). Cremasius cookii Weed.
Distribution: Throughout the pine-growing regions of Canada
and the United States from southern Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba,
Saskatchewan, and British Columbia south to Maryland, Virginia,
Missouri, and Nebraska.
Remarks: For more complete details of host relationships, see
Bugbee (1958). This important parasite has been confused for many
years with Eurytoma tylodermatis Ashmead. It differs from E.
tylodermatis, however, in averaging larger (4.5 mm.); presence of more
extensive sculpturing on the sixth abdominal tergum; longer ninth
tergum (averaging .28 mm.) ; narrow horizontal portion of the dorsal
valves and the lack of a weU-defined, complete median furrow on the
propodeum.
