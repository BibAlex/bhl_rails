margin of its cusp — it agrees therefore with short^finned makos in this
respect and not with the long-finned species described as new here.
Cadenat regarded as improbable the likelihood that his mako is abnor-
mal, on the groimds that the abnormality would not be bilaterally sym-
metrical. Evaluation of the status of the specimen must await further
material.
Cadenat also pointed out that of the Isurus material that he has ex-
amined, the jaws of 12 specimens from Madeira, Senegal, and the
Ivory Coast in the collection of I'lnstitut Frangais d'Afrique Noire at
Goree, Senegal, are very consistent in having a dental formula of

more or less variation, and Pacific specimens generally tend to have
fewer lower teeth. The tabulation below gives frequency distributions
for the number of lower teeth in Isurus specimens from the Pacific,
Atlantic-Mediterranean, and Indian Oceans, using Cadenat's data plus
my own. This tabulation tends to confirm Cadenat's view that Pa-
cific specimens have fewer lower teeth, though a more adequate sample
of Pacific material is needed to substantiate the view.
Counts of teeth in one-half of the lower jaw of Isurus oxyrinchus
are as follows:

On the basis of the above discussion, I regard as conspecific all
short-finned makos presently reported, viz, the 12 nominal species
listed on page 665; they take the name Isurus oxyrinchus Rafinesque,
1810.
