Segment tapered to narrow distal end, with several adhesion pads.
Second segment short, with proximal swelling and broad, almost
laminate terminal process, process with distal concavity overlying
knob-shaped adhesion pad on first segment when second segment
flexed. Male maxilliped (fig. 126) 2-segmented, also with broad base
extending along area of heavy sclerotization. First segment strongly
developed, broadest distally, with rounded, padlike process on inner
surface. Second segment short, heavily sclerotized, with well devel-
oped clawlike terminal process that overlaps 2 adhesion pads present
on distal anterior sm-face of first segment when second segment flexed.
Female and male thoracic legs I-IV biramous, with some evidence
of fusion exhibited, especially in female. For anlaysis of armature and
nature of legs, see tables 4, 5, figures 12c-/, I3a-d.

'Process denticulated, appears fused with segment, not distinct as iu P. satyr us.
Discussion. — Pandarus cranchii and P. satyrus were synonymized
by Shiino (1954c). Based on the female specimens of both species in
the collection under description, there appears sufficient evidence to
warrant the maintenance of both species. This evidence includes the
length of the caudal rami (longer in P. cranchii), the presence of a
single-lobed process on antennal segment 2 of P. cranchii and a bilobed
process on the same segment in P. satyrus, the 1-segmented postoral
process of P. cranchii and the 3-segmented postoral process of P.
satyrus, the presence of a clump of plumosities on segment 2 of the
maxilla of P. cranchii and their absence on the same segment of P.
satyrus, the nature of the thoracic leg armature (compare tables 3
