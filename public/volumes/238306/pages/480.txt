female without eggs, 4.7 mm.; of ovigerous females, 4.2 and 9.8 mm.;
of juvenHe, 2.1 mm.
Remarks- Although the St. Helena specunens closely resemble the
variable Acanthonyx petwerii H. Milne Edwards, 1834, from tropical
waters of the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific, and A. lunulatus
Figure 12â€” Acanthonyx sanctaehelenae, male holotype: a, dorsal aspect of crab, right half
denuded; b, suborbital and buccal regions; c, right cheliped; d, abdomen; e, propodus
and dactyl of right posterior leg;/, caudal aspect of right gonopod; g, tip of same.
(Risso, 1816) from the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean (fig. 13),
I believe that they represent a distinct species. In the general con-
figuration of the carapace, A. sanctaehelenae seems nearest to A.
lunulatus, but apparently it can be distinguished from that species by
the broader, more pear-shaped carapace and the V-shaped, rather than
broadly U-shaped, smus between the rostral horns.
