most dependable, but I have not been able to examine a sufficient
number of specimens from the same host species to determine to
what extent the chaetotaxy may vary.
Nevertheless, the setae present on the head, prothorax, and last
abdominal segment of species in other genera of Mallophaga are being
used extensively now as identifying characters for species and species
groups, so that it seems logical that they may be successfully used
in Furnaricola.
UntU recently Xiphorhynchus picus has been placed always under
the genus Dendroplex, where I beUeve it should have remained. Both
in morphology and habitat, picus differs strongly from Xiphorhynchus
auct. whose species are strictly forest dwellers, while in Dendroplex
picus we have a species habitually found in semiarid open scrub,
composed largely of xerophytic vegetation, and they are often seen
out in the open on fenceposts. As further proof we have the very
great difference in the type of Mallophagan parasites which infest
them.

Furnaricola hirsuta picirostris, new subspecies
Figures 12, 19a
Holotype female and allotype male adidts, from Xiphorhynchus
picus picirostris (Lafresnaye), collected by the author at El Conejo,
Sierra Perijd, Colombia, March 18, 1945 (Carriker type no. 791).
Diagnosis: Resembles the nominate race in general appearance, but
in measurements, some are greater, some are less, and some are the
same. It is larger than hirsuta, especially the female, with longer
and wider head, but with frons the same width; prothorax same in
male, larger in female; pterothorax larger in both sexes; abdomen
longer and wider in male and much longer in female.
Male genitalia differ in shape and length of paramera, those of
picirostris being much longer and much narrower basally. Measure-
ments follow next species.
