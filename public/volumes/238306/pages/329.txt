Eurytoma solenozopheriae Ashmead, 1887, p. 196. — Driggers, 1927, pp. 253-259. —
McAlisterand Anderson, 1932, pp. 1164-1169.— Peck, 1951, p. 578.
Neotypes: 18 females and 15 males, collected May 1, 1949, by
O. Peck from gall of Hemadas nubilipennis. Neotype female and
neoparatypes in the collection of the Department of Agriculture,
Ottawa, Canada. Neoparatypes in the Bugbee collection, Allegheny
College, MeadvUle, Pa. Ashmead (1887) states that the species was
described from specimens from Toronto, Canada, sent to him by
WUliam Brodie. The types seem to have been lost.
Neotype locality: Marmora, Ontario, Canada.
Distribution: United States: Maine, Connecticut, Washington,
D.C., New Jersey, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania. Can-
ada: Ontario, Quebec.
Host: Hemades nubilipennis (Ashmead), gallmaker on blueberry,
Vaccinium corymbosvm, and V. pennsylvanicum (Driggers, 1927).
Remarks: Ashmead (1887) implies in his remarks following the
description of E. solenozopheriae that the host gallmaker on blueberry
was the cynipid Solenozopheria {=Loxaulus) vaccinii (Ashmead).
Driggers (1927) demonstrated that the true gallmaker was a chalcid,
Hemadas nubilipennis (Ashmead), and that he was unable to breed a
single female specimen of S. vaccinii from the galls. It was discovered
later that the single female specimen that Ashmead had was bred
from a gall on oak rather than Vaccinium.
The yellow scape, tegula, and legs including the fore- and midcoxae
and the deeper reddish-brown hindcoxa; the reddish-brown abdomen;
the very narrow dorsal valves of the female genitalia that bend
sharply dorsally, anteriorly, then posteriorly with the ventral valves,
forming an arc of 180°, and the vertical plane of the stylet arch, are
additional characteristics of this species.

Map 13
Eurytoma furva Bugbee, 1958a, p. 198.
Types: 11 females and 9 males; holotype female in the U.S. National
Museum (USNM 66031); paratypes in the Bugbee collection, Alle-
gheny College, Meadville, Pa., and in the U.S. National Museum.
Type locality: Napa, Calif.
Distribution: Known only from the type locality.
Host: Disholcaspis washingtonensis (GiUette) on Quercus douglasii.
Remarks: This species differs from Eurytoma querci-globuli in the
longer sixth abdominal tergum, the reduction of the sculpturing to
