Alpheus macrocheles (Hailstone)

Hippolyte macrocheles Hailstone, 1835, p. 395.
Alpheus macrocheles. — Holthuis, 1951, p. 69.
Material: Off Rupert's Bay; buoy; 0-2 meters; Feb. 11, 1963; 1
ovigerous female. — James Bay; collected by skindiver; Aprd 1964;
1 ovigerous female.
Measurements: Carapace lengths to base of rostrum, 5.1 and 7.2
mm.
Remarks: The smaller specimen bears only two or three eggs,
suggesting that it is a very young adult. In the proportions of the
antennular peduncle and last three pereiopods and in the length of
the distal spine on the attenal scale, the larger specimen resembles
two much larger British specimens of A. macrocheles available for
comparison more closely than does the smaller one, but the detached
minor chela associated with the larger St. Helena specimen is much
slenderer and has a more pronounced dorsal notch than noted in the
British specimens. Comparison of this appendage with those of
typical specimens of A. macrocheles of similar size would be desirable.
Distribution: The recorded range of A. macrocheles extends from
the south coast of England to the Cape Verde Islands and Guinea,
including the Mediterranean, usually in depths of from 20 to more
than 100 meters. The western Atlantic records of this species in
Rathbun (1901) and Schmitt (1935) are based on fragmentary speci-
mens and requu-e verification.
