Planes cyaneus Dana
Planes cyaneus Dana, 1852a, p. 250. — Chace, 1951, pp. 65-103, figs, lb, 2b, e, h,

IVaruna atlantica Melliss, 1875, p. 203.
Material: Off northeast coast of St. Helena; from drifting kelp;
Nov. 25, 1960; 1 female. — Sandy Bay; from kelp on beach; Dec. 29,
1962; 1 young female. — Off Rupert's Bay; buoy; 0-2 meters; Feb. 11,
1963; 3 males, 5 females (4 ovigerous). — James Bay; collected by
skindiver; February 1964; 1 female.
Measurements: Carapace lengths of males, 14.0-22.7 mm.; of
females without eggs, 6.9-26.0 mm.; of ovigerous females, 14.2-
16.9 mm.
Remarks: Three or four of the specimens found on the buoy off
Rupert's Bay were blue in Ufe (white in alcohol). The others were
mottled light to dark brown in alcohol, and three of them had a large,
whitish patch extending over much of the anterior part of the carapace,
similar to the color pattern illustrated for Planes minutus (Linnaeus,
1758) in Murray and Hjort (1912, pi. 6) and Sivertsen and Holthuis
(1956, pi. 2).
The "pretty Httle bright-blue Crab" from the hull of a ship, which
Melliss (1875) recorded as Vanma atlantica (a name apparently
coined by Spence Bate), may represent the fu'st Atlantic record of
P. cyaneus. The fact that the species was represented in the Love-
ridge collection by material taken in 4 different years indicates that
its occurrence in the South Atlantic is more than transitory.
Distribution: On floating objects in the open sea throughout the
eastern Pacific and presumably westward into the Indian Ocean; St.
Helena. Probably some or all of the South African records of P.
minutus cited by Barnard (1950, p. 120) should be referred to this
species.
