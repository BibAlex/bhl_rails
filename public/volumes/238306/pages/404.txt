NO. 3535 MICROLEPIDOPTERA, IX — OBRAZTSOV 581
tricini. The tribe includes the genera Polyortha Dognin, Ardeuiica
Meyrick, Pseudatteria Walsingham, and others not yet described and
presently in Polyortha. Thus, a key to the genera of the Polyorthini
cannot be given until a revision of the genus Polyortha is completed.

Type species. — Pseudatteria potamites Walsingham, 1913 (by
monotypy and original designation.)
Description. — Head smooth, sides of vertex with longer and
raised scales. Antenna simple or pseudoserrate, in male densely
short ciliated and with setae protruding; cilia not longer than width
of antenna] shaft, setose in female only; scapus long, somewhat
flattened. Labial palpus about four times width of eye or even
longer, porrect, slightly curved downward; basal segment pronounced;
second segment with appressed scales, longest of all segments, almost
uniformly broad along whole length; terminal segment rather long,
acute. Proboscis moderate. Thorax smooth.
Forewing smoothly scaled, elongate-subovate; costa strongly
arched; apex broadly rotundate, termen obliquely convex; tornus
broadly rotundate; dorsum almost straight, basally arched. No
costal fold in male. Twelve veins, all separate; Sc very gently bent;
Ri from before middle of discal cell; R2 more than twice as near to
R3 as to Ri; R3 twice as remote from R.j as R4 is from R5; latter vein
running to apex; internal vein of discal cell from between Ri and R2;
M,, \l2, AI3, and Cui almost equidistant; Cui from lower angle,
Cu2 from about two-thirds of discal cell; Ai weak; basal fork of
A24.3 shorter than one-fourth of entire vein.
