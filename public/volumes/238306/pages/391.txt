ably not over 3 meters) . — The single collection from this lake, August
21, 1960, contained 7 adults: 6 9 (5 with ovisacs), 1 cT.
Ponds and pools near lake 9. — (1) Pool (about 1 mile north-
west; estimated area, 25 square meters; maximum depth about 1
meter; vegetation largely Carex and Sphagnum), August 23, 1960:
1 C VI 9, 1 C VI cf. (2) Pond (about 1 mile southwest; estimated
area, 627 square meters; maximum depth about 1.5 meters; vegetation
largely Hipperus, Arctophila, Sphagnum) , August 21, 1960: 1 C V9.
Coastal region south of cape Thompson. — One or two specimens
were collected from each of four more or less brackish pools near
Singoalik Lagoon in 1960 (table 1). Large numbers of E. gracili-
cauda of similar size and habitus (see p. 567), occurred in two of these
samples and early copepodid stages (C II-C III) that were present
might be either of the two species. In 1961, recognizable stages of
E. arctica were not collected in any coastal pools that were sampled.
Occurrence in Noatak River Watershed
Locality about 58 miles inland from Chukchi Sea, near junction of
Kelly and Noatak Rivers, about 67°58' N., 162°20' W. Tash collec-
tion: 12 C V 9^; permanent freshwater pond, area about 0.2 hectares,
depth about 1.8 meters, from weedy margin {Carex dominant), July
29, 1961; occurring with Diap>tomus gracilis. This region is a part
of the Brooks Range physiographic province southeast of Cape
Thompson; the Noatak River and its tributaries drain a considerable
part of the western portion of the northern mountains of Alaska.
Eurytemora yukonensis, not yet known from the Arctic Slope province,
also occurred in shallow bodies of water of the Noatak region with
D. gracilis.
Occurrence at Umiat
Locality on Colville River in northern Alaska, in foothills of Brooks
Range, about 65 miles inland from Beaufort Sea, about 69°24' N.,
152°15' W. Wilson collection: 41 specimens (9 C TV 9^; 32 C V9c?)
taken by casting small net an unknown distance from shore in shallow,
freshwater permanent pond, estimated area about 0.2 hectares,
July 29, 1949, collector, C. S. WUson; occurring with a few specimens
of Heterocope septentrionalis (C VI) and Diaptomus prihilojensis (C
IV-VI).
Bionomics
Restriction to either brackish or fresh water cannot be assumed for
species of Eurytemora, but some occur much more commonly in one
than in the other. E. arctica was rare in brackish coastal pools and
was not found in the lagoons at Cape Thompson, although all other
