Diagnostic description of female. — Cephalothorax (figs. 31 a, 6)
suborbicular, consisting of cephalic, maxilliped-bearing and first 2
pedigerous segments. Frontal region broad, with narrow membrane
on anterior margin; lateral cephalo thoracic margins convex, bcrdered
by narrow membrane. Posterior end of lateral cephalothoracic re-
gions sharply curved, inner margin free at distal end of legion, attached
to lateral margin of second pedigerous segment for most of its length,
line of division between second pedigerous segment and rest of cepha-
lothorax convex. Major dorsal cephalothoracic grooves extending
anteriorly and slightly laterally from division between second pe-
digerous segment and rest of cephalothorax, terminating in anterior
third of cephalothorax. Several short grooves present, projecting
medially from irregularities of lateral cephalothoracic margins.
Groove separating second pedigerous segment forming, with major
dorsal cephalothoracic grooves, hregular H, similar to that of caligids.
Second pedigerous segment broad, width more than twice the length,
lateral regions projecting laterally and cmwing posteriorly, with
membrane on inner margin of posteriorly curved portion (fig. 316).
Inner margin of segment forming, with outer margin of free thhd
pedigerous segment, distinct sinus.
Third and fourth pedigerous segments (fig. 316) free, width of third
more than 3 times the length, separated from second pedigerous
segment by flatly convex line of division dorsally. Lateral surfaces
of segment irregular dorsally, forming, knob-shaped structure ven-
trally, similar to that found in Dinematura latifolia. Fourth pedig-
erous segment distinct from third, swollen at region of fourth leg
attachment. Division between fourth pedigerous and genital seg-
ments incomplete, visible on ventral and lateral surfaces but not on
dorsal surface.
Genital segment (fig. lie) variable in shape, dependent upon egg
content, broader posteriorly than anteriorly, anterior region forming
posterior portion of necklike connection between fom"th pedigerous
and genital segments. Lateral posterior margin of segment with 3
