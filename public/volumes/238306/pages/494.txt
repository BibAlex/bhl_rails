Although the nominal species treated here have been placed in
several genera by some authors, opinion has stabilized in more recent
years to include them all in Isurus Rafiuesque. It Avill be apparent
from the treatment of these nominal species in this account that
recognition of Isurus alone is the only possible coiu-se.
The nominal species of Isurus listed in the order in which they
were proposed* are:

The characters separating Isurus from the other two genera, Lamna
and Carcharodon, in the family Lamnidae are: upper teeth smooth
edged, lacking lateral basal denticles; first dorsal origin definitely
behind a vertical through posterior (inner) comer of pectoral fin ; and
no secondary lateral keel along anterior part of caudal fin. In Lamna
the teeth are smooth edged but have lateral basal denticles, at least
in subadults and adults. In Carcharodon the teeth are serrated.
Both Lamna and Carcharodon have the first dorsal origin anterior to a
vertical through the posterior corner of the pectoral. Lamna, but

5 Tortonese (1956, p. 106, ftn. 1) claims that, under Article 19 of "The
Code of Zoological Nomenclature," this spelling should be emended to
"oxyrhynchus." However, if we consider that Rafinesque used the spelling
"oxyrinchus" twice in his 1810a account (once on page 12, and again on plate
13) and repeated it in his 1810b account (p. 45), and nowhere used the spelling
"oxyrhynchus" we have no reason to believe that "oxyrinchus" was an in-
advertent error. Consequently, according to Article 32(b), the spelling
"oxyrinchus" must be treated as the correct original spelling and is not to be
emended.
