Diagnostic description. — Female cephalothorax (fig. 20a) sub-
orbicular, consisting of cephalic, maxUliped-bearing and first pedigerous
segments; frontal region narrow, anterior margin irregular, anterior
lateral cephalothoracic margin with indistinct indentation. Mem-
brane-rimmed lateral cephalothoracic margins regular, with small but
distinct indentation medially that forms outer end of indistinct,
irregular groove extending laterally from posteromedial cephalo-
thoracic region. Lateral cephalothoracic regions extending poste-
riorly to anterior end of genital segment, weU posterior to median
cephalothoracic region. Posteromedian region with narrow, flange-
like extension dorsally, overlapping anterior half of narrow second
pedigerous segment. Dorsal cephalothoracic grooves distinct, major
pair extending anteriorly from junction of inner margin of lateral
cephalothoracic region and median cephalothoracic region to join
with groove extending posteriorly from indentation of anterolateral
cephalothoracic margin. Several minor grooves present although
most indistinct. Eyes distinct though smaU consisting of 2 pigmented
regions, contiguous on median longitudinal axis of body, and 2 minute,
circular lenses. Cephalothorax of male (fig. 206) similar to that of
female, major differences consisting of regular instead of UTegular
anterior margin of frontal region, 2 instead of 1 small indentation of
lateral cephalothoracic margin and with major dorsal cephalothoracic
grooves appearing to terminate before joining groove extending
posteriorly from indentation of anterolateral cephalothoracic margin.
Female second through fourth pedigerous segments (fig. 20a) free,
second with 2-parted lateral extensions, anterior part heavily sclerot-
ized, rodhke except for adhesion pad formed by swoUen distal end;
posterior part of extension heavily sclerotized anteriorly, with mem-
branous margin posteriorly, both parts forming extension projecting
under lateral cephalothoracic region and under anterior end of fourth
