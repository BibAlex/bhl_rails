NO. 3533 CHALCID WASPS OF GENUS EURYTOMA — BUGBEE 503
.24 mm. (.20-.27) and postmarginal averages .18 mm. (.17-.20) in
length.
Male: Black. Averages 1.6 mm. (1.1-2.1) in length. Scape with
outer face black to dark bro^vn. Black to dark brown on all femora
and tibiae of legs, except for knees and apices which are yellowish
brown. Wing veins light yellow; marginal averages .23 mm. (.20-.27)
and postmarginal averages .18 mm. (.15-.22) in length.
Types: 8 females and 6 males. Holotype female, allotype male,
and paratypes in U.S. National Museum (USNM 66063). Paratype
specimens in the Bugbee collection, Allegheny College, MeadvUle, Pa.
Type locahty: Crown Point, N.Y., July 19, 1934, O. H. Hammer
collection.
Distribution: United States: New York, Kansas, Washington.
Host: Bred from apple curculio material, Tachypterellus quadri-
gibbus (Say), T. q. magnus List, and T. consors Dietz.
Remarks: This species is close to Eurytoma mali, new species, but
can be separated from it by its much smaller size, more black to
dark-brown infuscation on the legs, and the shallower more uniformly
punctate propodeum.
It is probably a primary parasite of the apple curculio. Specimens
which were determined as Eurytoma tylodermatis have been shown by
Parker and Lamerson (1934) and Hammer (1936) to be external para-
sites of the larvae, pupae, and occasionally adults of T.q. magnus List
and T. quadngibbus (Say). Although this smaller species is bred from
the Apple Curculio along with E. mali, and both species occurred in
the same series, they can be easily separated by the characteristics
mentioned above.

Eurytoma iniquus Bugbee, 1951, pp. 253, 254. — Burks, 1958, p. 81.
Types: Holotype female and allotype male in the U.S. National
Museum, Washington, D.C. (USNM 61235). Paratypes in the
Bugbee collection, Allegheny College, Meadville, Pa.
Type locality: Manitou, Colo.
Distribution: United States: Colorado.
Host: Diplolepis neglecta (Gillette) (=Z>. tuberculatrix) on Rosa
species.
Remarks: The short ninth tergum averaging .15 mm. in length,
combined with the broad marginal vein in contrast to the linear post-
marginal, and the narrow dorsal valves that turn at right angles
dorsally, anteriorly, with the ventral valves so that the stylet arch is
vertical, help to characterize this species.
