In 1961, collections were made in Lake 4 from April to August 7.
No specimens of E. arctica were taken in open water until July 6.
On July 13 and two subsequent dates, both open water and the beds
of rooted vegetation (mostly Arctophila fulva) were sampled, the
latter by hand-dipping a net. The samples from the two areas are
not quantitatively comparable, but it is believed that due to the
difficulty of maneuvering both the boat and the net in the thick
vegetation,only a small part of the popidationof thelatter was sampled.

Ponds and pools near lake 4. — The poorl}^ drained Carex marsh
surrounding Lake 4 has numerous ponds and pools of varying size
and permanence. In 1960, E. arctica was collected from 3 of those
having a heavy growth of vegetation around the perimeter or partially
covering the water. Collection records: (1) Pond (estimated area,
500 square meters; maximum depth about 1 meter; permanent),
July 7: 1 C III, 2 C V9; occurring with Heterocope septentrionalis and
Diaptomus arcticus. (2) Pool (estimated area, 83 square meters;
maximum depth about 1 meter), September 8: 1 C VI9 with ovisac,
15 C VI cf, some with spermatophores attached to apex of leg 5.
(3) Pool (estimated area, 10 square meters; maximum depth about 1
meter), September 8: 2 C Vl9 (1 with mcomplete ovisac), 6 C VI cf".
Lake 3 (68°11'09" N., 165°42'02'' W.; surface area, 1.8 hectares;
maximum depth, about 1.52 meters). — In 1 of 2 samples collected
on different dates from open water, August 19, 1960: 2 C Vcf . On
July 17, 1959, 4 specimens presumed to be this species (C III, C IV)
were collected by D. Hilliard from 2 separate pools in the vicinity of
Lake 3.
Lake 8 (68°11'06" N., 165°42'04'' W.; area 0.03 hectares; max-
imum depth about 1.52 meters). — In 1 of 2 samples collected on
different dates from open water, August 19, 1960: 1 C VcT, 1 C Vl9.
In 1961, no specimens occurred in collections made on one occasion
from open water and weeds of Lakes 3 and 8.
Lake 9 (68°14'08" N., 165°34'09" W.; about 4 miles northeast of
Lake 4, in Saligvik Valley ; outlet to creek tributary to Kukpuk River;
surface area about 12 hectares; maxim imi depth unknown but prob-
