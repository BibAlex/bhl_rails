REVISION OF GENUS FURNARICOLA — CARRIKER 419
Only sternite visible is the genital plate, covering median portion of
segments VI and VII ; structure and chaetotaxy of VIII distinct (see
fig. 26a).
Male genitalia small; basal plate short; paramera with thickened
bases and long, incurving tips; endomera of usual shape (see fig. 22).
Represented by the female holotype, the male allotype, and one
male paratype.
Measurements follow next species.

Figures Ua, 23, 24
Holotype (and only specimen) male adult, from Synallaxis c.
cabanisi Berlepsch and Leverkiihn, collected by the author at Bella
Pampa, S. Peru, June 6, 1931 (Carriker type no. 798).
Diagnosis: A small species with rather narrow, conical head, with
wide frons, rounded temples and strongly undulating occipital margin.
The preantennary carinae are short, blackish, and submarginal;
antennae unusually thick and gular sclerite of unusual shape.
First abdominal segment very large, parallel sided, and as wide as
pterothorax. Male genitalia strikingly different, almost unique.
Paramera with basal portion wide and parallel sided, with slender,
curving tips arising from outer portion and with a rather long, slender
bifurcation on inner margin (see fig 24); endomera also long, with
swollen sides and wide, truncate tip.
The only other species described in the present paper with bifurcated
paramera is myrmeciza, from an antbird (Formicariidae), but in my
first paper on the genus (Bol. Ent. Venezolana, vol. 3, no 2, pp. 83-96)
there are three species with bifurcated paramera, two quite similar,
mth the bifurcation starting near base of paramera (heterocephala and
laticepJmla) , one from a Furnariidae, the other from a Formicariidae.
The third species has a short bifurcation similar to the present species
and is from a Furnariidae also.
Until much more material is available for study it is impossible to
assign this type of genitalia to any particular type of host.
