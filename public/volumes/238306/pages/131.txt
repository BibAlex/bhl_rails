The genus Sigamhra either has been overlooked or has been con-
sidered to be indeterminable (Hartman, 1947, p. 483; 1959, p. 195).
The original figures and brief description of S. grubii from Santa
Catharina Island off Brazil seem to be sufficiently good to allow the
genus to be retained. I have included on page 182 the figures and
description of Miiller for S. grubii.
Figure 12.^ â€” Cabira incerta: a, parapodium from setiger 8; h, same, from setiger 18;
c, dorsal view anterior end; d, ventral view anterior end; e, parapodium from setiger 40.
Diagnosis: Body long, flattened, with parapodia deeply cut. Pro-
stomium with 2 biarticulate palps, 3 antennae longer than palps.
Tentacular segment achaetous, more or less fused to prostomium and
first setigerous segment, with 2 pairs tentacular cirri. First setigerous
segment with longer pau-ed dorsal cirri. Parapodia subbiramous.
Notopodia with notoacicula and stout emergent hooked setae. Dorsal
cirri long, slender, or flattened leaflike, extending beyond neuropodia.
