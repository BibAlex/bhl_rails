head length; the head length relative to the distance between the
pectoral fin axil and the pelvic fin origin; and the distance between
the origins of the pectoral fin and first dorsal fin relative to parts of
the head length. Figures 3-5 and table 1 do not support Bigelow
and Schroeder's criteria for distinguishing Atlantic and Pacific species
of Isurus, nor Smith's recognition of two or more species within each
of the major oceans. Instead the figures and table provide fairly
strong evidence that short-finned makos undergo considerable change
with growth in some proportions and are variable in others. The
amount of variation is large, but much of it may be due to differences
