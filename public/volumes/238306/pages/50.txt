SPECIES OF OEDEMERIDAE
OF THE BIG BEND REGION OF TEXAS'
By Ross H. Arnett, Jr.
During May 1959, Drs. Henry F. Howden and Edward Becker
made very extensive and interesting collections of insects in and near
Big Bend National Park, Tex. This particular collecting trip has
resulted in the detection of many rare and several undescribed species
in this poorly sampled area. The truth of this statement becomes
more apparent as their material is made available to the specialists.
Although there were "several good general rains totaling two to three
inches . . . during the month of May" (Howden, 1960), this alone
does not account for the wealth of material collected by these two
entomologists. After having been in the field with Dr. Howden, I
am convinced there is more than luck involved in the collection of
these rare species. His thorough and persistent methods, during
which time personal comfort is not his concern, has contributed
greatly to the progress of beetle taxonomy and biology. It is for this
reason that I wish to dedicate the new species described in this paper
to Dr. Howden. I also wish to acknowledge with thanks the loan of
this material by the Canadian National Collection of Insects.
