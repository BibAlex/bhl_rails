11. Eurytoma minnesotae Girault
Map 4
Eurytoma minnesoia Girault, 1916, p. 338.
Eurijtojna minnesotae Peck, 1951, p. 577.
Types: U.S. National Museum, no. 20322, 5 females and 2 males.
Type locality: Olmsted, Minn., reared from Quack grass, 1906,
Ainslie collection.
Distribution: United States: Minnesota.
most: Agropyron (Quackgrass sp.) (Gii\ault, 1916).
Remarks: Additional specimens of E. minnesotae were not found in
any of the collections examined. It seems to be a valid species, how-
ever, as the elongate petiole will separate it from any of the other
species bred from Quackgrass, such as E. pachy neuron Girault. The
small size, absence of a flared carina on the anterior surface of the
front coxae, and the rounded narrow propodeum with a narrow and
deep, complete, median furrow, will also help to distinguish E. min-
nesotae.
12. Eurytoma illinoisensis Girault
Map 5
Eurytoma illinoisensis Girault, 1920, p. 206. â€” Peck, 1951, p. 576.
Types: U.S. National Museum, no. 20629, 2 females.
Type locality: Urbana, 111. Reared in connection with Isosoma =
(Harmolita) .
Distribution: United States: Illinois, South Dakota, New Mexico,
Wisconsin, and Iowa. Canada: Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia.
Host: Reared in connection with Isosoma (Girault, 1920). Elymus
species (Girault, 1920). Stipa Columbiana, Vicia villosa, V. angusti-
jolia, and V. americana (Bugbee collection).
Remarks: The material included under E. illinoisensis Girault is
a mixture of what may be more than one species. Unfortunately,
good representative series from more than one locality were not
encountered in this study. One or two specimens, often without
host data, from a few scattered localities, are not enough to give an
adequate picture of the variation of a species.
The rectangular-shaped abdomen with the narrow sixth abdominal
tergum that is about equal in length to the fifth, the rounded pro-
podeum with a deep and narrow concavity, and the obviously clavate,
elongate antennae are characteristics of this species.
