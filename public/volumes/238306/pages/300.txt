Figures 2a, 3, 4
Furnaricola certhia certhia Carriker, 1963, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 13, vol. 5,
p. 465, figs. 28-30.
Host: Dendrocolaptes c. certhia (Boddaert). (Carriker type no. 701,
in British Museum (Natural History) ; male and female paratypes in
Carriker collection.)
One of the larger species, with female much larger than male;
the frons wide (.105 in both sexes) ; preantennary portion of head with
margins strongly concave; basal plate wide (.11 at base); endomera
short and wide (.06 X .046) ; paramera rather long (.11), with apical half
slender and curving inward, and with outer margins concave medially
(see fig. 4).
Specimens from D. certhia hyleorus and D. c. colombianus, in the
author's collection, differ sufficiently from F. certhia to merit sub-
specific rank and are described below.

Furnaricola certhia colombiana, new subspecies
Figure 5
Holotype, male adult, from Dendrocolaptes certhia hyleurus Wetmore,
collected by the author at Volador, Dept. Bolivar, Magdalena Valley,
Colombia, May 19, 1947 (Carriker type no. 787).
Diagnosis: This race of certhia is closely related to the nominate
form from British Guiana. The measurements are very close, but the
frons is wider (.14 against .105) ; the prothorax is slightly smaller; the
basal plate narrower (.08 against .11) ; endomera longer and narrower,
and the paramera are very differently shaped (see fig. 5), having the
wide, basal portion very long and parallel-sided, with the tips very
short, slender, and slightly incurved.
Represented by the male holotype and one male paratype.
