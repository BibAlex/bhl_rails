78. Eurytoma picea, new species
Map 35
Female: Black except for brown wing veins, yellow base of scape,
and extremities of femora, tibiae, and whitish tarsi. Length averages
3.6 mm. (3.1-4.1). Abdomen oval from lateral and dorsal views;
medium lateral compression so that greatest width in cross section is
nearer middle, sixth tergum about two times the length of the fifth;
smooth and shiny surface except for fine scaling on lower, anterior
half; ninth tergum elongate, averaging .22 mm. (.24-.25) in length.
Internal genitalia with narrow dorsal valves that turn dorsally, ante-
riorly, with the ventral valves at slightly less than a right angle so
that stylet arch and fulcral plate are in an oblique plane; dorsal
valves dark brown to black for entire length; whole structure aver-
ages 1.7 mm. (1.6-1.8) in length and .97 mm. (.95-1.0) in height.
Propodeum narrowly concave with a wide, shallow, complete median
furrow that narrows toward base; central carina about one-quarter
to three-quarters length of furrow; surface between horizontal ridges
within fmTow, smooth and shiny; lateral areas narrow or nonexistent.
Antenna with a flagellum of five truncate, slightly moniliform, seg-
ments; sixth separated from the terminal unit by a shallow annula-
tion. Legs with black to dark-brown infuscation on all femora and
tibiae. Wing veins brown; marginal about two times the width of
postmarginal, quite long, averaging .40 mm. (.35-.50) in length; post-
marginal averages .27 mm. (.22-. 32) in length.
