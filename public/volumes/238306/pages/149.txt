18 pairs when fully formed, arranged as indicated in generic diagnosis.
Dorsal cirri with cylindrical cirrophores; styles long, tapering, smooth,
extending to tips of setae. Ventral cirri in middle of neuropodial

biramous; notopodia short, conical, on anterodorsal side of neuro-
podia, with notoacicula only, without notosetae. Neuropodial lobe
elongated, flattened anteroposteriorly, split terminally into longer
presetal and shorter postsetal hps, with elongated inflated glandular
areas distal to notopodial lobe, with stout neuroaciculum extending
into postsetal lip, with fan-shaped bundle of neurosetae. Neuro-
setae of 2 kinds: lower ones shorter, stouter, with a few heavy widely
spaced spinous rows (3-4), with tips slightly hooked, sometimes
