MARINE AMPHIPODA OF THE FAMILY AMPITHOIDAE
FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
By J. Laurens Barnard
Associate Curator, Division of Crustacea
The family Ampithoidae is confined to littoral and sublittoral
marine depths of the world, generally in the canopies of kelp or
shallow rock bottoms where short-tufted algae grow. Being large-
bodied organisms, they are among the most conspicuous amphipods.
Indeed, the largest amphipod so far reported in shallow waters of
southern California is Cymadusa uncinata (herein a specimen 35 mm.
long). The world fauna supports eight genera (not including
Amphitholina, which was transferred to the Eophliantidae by
Gurjanova in 1958), but only two of these have been found in the
present collections, Ampithoe and Cymadusa. A fragmentary specimen
of a third genus, probably Paragrubia, has been found at Cayucos,
Cahf.
The present collections consist of materials dredged by the Velero III
Oi* the Hancock Foundation, especially in the channel islands off
southern California, and materials of intertidal origin collected by
the writer and other workers from Cayucos to La Jolla, Calif. A few
samples collected by scuba diving have proved most valuable. There
is a need for more extensive diving exploration of kelp holdfasts and
canopies and other algal bottoms.
