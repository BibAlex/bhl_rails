3, that of legs 3-4 longer than exopod 3 (leg 3, from 1.02 to 1.10:1;
leg 4, from 1.08 to 1.17:1); inner apical seta reaching almost to end
of or a little beyond inner spine in leg 2, shorter than spine in legs 3-4.
(Measiu'ements of exopod segments in midline, exopod 1 measured
from exact base which is inserted deeply into basal segment 2; in
above ratios, exopod 3 expressed as 1).
Leg 5 (figs. 2a, 6): Exopod segment 1, outer spines variable in
length, first usually longer than width of segment, second as long as
first spine or shorter; outer margin of segment constricted distad to
insertion of first spine; inner process slender throughout, du-ected
inwards, tip upcurved and finely serrate, about 4 X width of distal
part of segment (process measured from notch near base to its tip;
segment from notch of process to insertion of distal spine). Exopod
segment 2 slender, length less than twice width (about 1.7:1);
length of outer apical spine variable, ranging from about one-half to
a little more than that of segment (figs. 2a and 26 show extremes) ;
inner apical spine elongate, shorter than or subequal to total exopod
length and ranging from 5.6 to 7 X length of segment 2 and from
3.2 to 4.8 X that of outer spine; segment not produced to sharp point
between spines, with or without setule on inner margin.
Copepodid stage V: Total length (1 specimen, Lake 4, July 28,
1960): 1.72 mm. (metasome, 1.025; urosome, 0.695). Cephalic pro-
tuberance present. Metasomal wings shorter than in adult but of
similar form. Proportional length of urosome segments similar to
adult, but caudal rami shorter, their length less than segments 2 +
3 (0.8:1), width about 4 X length; genital segment without lateral
protrusions. Antennules a little shorter than metasome. Leg 5
(fig. 2b) : Inner process of exopod 1 a little longer than width of
segment. Length of specimens from Umiat less than that of Lake 4
specimen (1.32-1.43 mm.); length of theu' caudal rami subequal to
or only a little less than urosome segments 2 + 3.
Description of male.— Total length: 1.56-1.65 mm. Greatest
width of metasome in segments 2-3; distal segments not so narrowed
as in female. Distal cephalic protuberance present. Urosome (fig.
3/) without ornamentation; segment 4 the shortest, segment 5 the
longest. Caudal rami: Length subequal to urosome segments 3 +
4 + 5, about 7 X greatest width; with inner marginal and outer
distal hairs but no surface ornamentation; caudal setae similar to
those of female, lateral seta subequal to and others longer than rami.
Antennules reaching a little beyond metasome. The left differmg
