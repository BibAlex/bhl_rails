Remarks: The occipital dark spot is unusual in the genus and
besides this species is found only in Neobrotica oblongopunctata Jacoby
and A^. ebraea (Fabricius). This species has somewhat the same
elytral pattern as A^. duodecimsignata but in that species there is no
metallic lustre and the legs are pale.
