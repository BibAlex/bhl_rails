northward through the Mississippi River Valley and then spreading
eastward and westward by way of its main tributaries, such as the
Tennessee, Ohio, and Missouri. This suggests that the species may
be found also even farther north, wherever its hosts occur.
Remarks : E. sphaera and E. ohtusiloha Ashmead are closely related
but E. sjihaera has a longer petiole, averaging about half the length
of the hindcoxae, in contrast to E. ohtusiloha where the petiole averages
nearer one-fourth the length of the hindcoxae. In addition, the
marginal vein is broader, and also longer in relation to the post-
marginal; the stigmal club is larger than in E. ohtusiloha. E. sphaera
also has a wider and not as deep a median furrow on the propodeum.
E. sphaera has been bred from cynipid galls belonging to the genus
Disholcaspis on oak only, while E. ohtusiloha is restricted to the genus
Diplolepis on rose.
