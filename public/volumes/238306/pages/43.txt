Ampithoes, it is presumed they represent a marginal population that
will find assignment to a northern species. The aberrancy of the
shortened fourth article of antenna 2 of one of the males indicates the
marginality of the deme.
In summary, these several populations of closely related ampithoes
are now recorded, but relationships and taxonomic assignments are
still unclear: Ampithoe mea Gurjanova, A. eoa Gurjanova, A. annenko-
vae Gurjanova, A. eoa of Barnard (1954), the present material of
Ampithoe species, A. tea Barnard, new species, and A. plea Barnard,
new species.

Paragrubia uncinata. — Shoemaker, 1941, p. 188. — Hewatt, 1946, p. 199.
Diagnosis: Male gnathopod 2 with palm nearly transverse and
bearing a deep slit that splits off a large posterior tooth; accessory
flagellum 3-5 articulate.
Material: Velero station, 878-38 (3). Barnard station 41 (100+) .
Records: Goleta and Anacapa Island, Calif., 2 and 15 fms.; at
Goleta collected from holdfasts of Macrocystis pyrifera.
Relationship: This is the only species of the genus to have the
large tooth of gnathopod 2, and so it is remarkably distinct from its
relatives. Apparently this is the largest amphipod species on the
coast of southern California, reaching a length of 35 mm.
Shoemaker transferred this species to Paragrubia, but it belongs
with Cymadusa because gnathopod 1 is smaller than gnathopod 2,
the reverse of the condition of Paragrubia.
Distribution: Southern California.
