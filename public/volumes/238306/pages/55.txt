pronotal surface witli a shallow anterolateral depression on each side
and a vague central-posterior depression; pubescence fine, sparse,
recumbent, retrose posteriorly, yellow. Pronotal shape obovate with
sides convergent posteriorly, somewhat constricted posterior to the
center; punctation moderate, space between punctures slightly less
than tlie diameter of the puncture; interspaces microreticulate.
Scutellum pale, concolorous with pronotiun. Legs fuscus, femora pale
except for "knee" area; claws simple.
Elytra fuscus; pubescence fine, reciunbent, moderate in density,
yellow; elytral costae evident, sutural and lateral area concolorous
with elytral disk; surf ace rugose-punctate, interspaces microreticulate ;
elytra somewhat flattened, apices rounded, sutural angles obtuse.
Abdomen with sterna fuscus.
Male genitalia agree with those of the genus ; penis broadly expanded
apically with a subapical dorsal enlargment in the area of the ejacu-
latory duct (fig.2c) ; internal sac with evident spicules. Paramere
(fig. 2d) with apical bifurcation greater than ji the length. (The
figures are not of the holotype, but from a specimen from Del Rio,
Texas).
Body shape moderately elongate; length 9.2 mm.; head length/-
width ratio .8837; pronotiun length/width ratio 1.0681; elytral
length/width ratio 3.0476.
Allotype: Female, same data as holotype. There is no significant
sexual dimorphism. Body measurements: length 10.8 mm.; head
length/width ratio .8958; head length/interocular distance ratio
1.9090; pronotum length/width ratio 1.1041; elytra length/width
ratio 3.000.
Paratypes: Texas: Del Rio, Apr. 25-26, 1959, 2; Big Bend National
Park, Boquillas, May 17, 1959, 2; same data as holotype, 5; same
data as holotype except May 20, 1959, 1 ; Oak Spring, 4000 ft. May 8,
1959, 2; May 22, 1959, 3; Santa Elena, 3200 ft.. May 4, 1959, 2;
Maverick, 2700 ft., May 4, 1959, 2; Chisos Basin (pi. 4 top). May 19,
1959, 1; May 22, 1959, 1; May 27, 1959, 1 (afl collected by Edward
Becker and Henry F. Howden.)
Additional specimens examined: In addition to the type series, the
following specimens are not made a part of the type series because of
the scarcity of specimens and the lack of data to show that they are a
part of the type population: Mexico: Tlahualilo, Durango, July 28,
1935, 1 (Texas A. and M. Univ. collection). Texas: Brownsville, 2;
Chisos Mts., May 10, 1949, 1 (U.S. Nat. Mus. collection); Starr Co.,
Mar. 20, 1952, 1; Chisos Mts., May 27, 1959, 1 (Ohio State Univ.
collection).
Variation: The color pattern of these beetles is rather distinctive.
They resemble somewhat certain populations of Xanthochroina hicolor
