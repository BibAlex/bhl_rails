NEARCTIC TRICHOPTERA — FLINT 383
Athripsodes transversus (Hagen)
Leptocerus transversus Hagen, 18G1, p. 279.
Leptoceriis inornatus Banks, 1914, p. 263, fig. 42. [New synonymy.]
Athripsodes transversus. — Ross, 1944, p. 233, fig. 790, 797.
Both the holotype of inornatus at the U.S. National jNIuseum and a
male paratype at the JMuseum of Comparative Zoology are unques-
tionably denuded specimens of transversus.
Leptocella alhida (Walker)
Leptocerus albidus Walker, 1852, p. 71.
Leptocella coloradensis Banks, 1899, p. 215. [New synonymy.]
Leptocella gracilis Banks, 1904, p. 110. [Preoccupied.]
Leptocella exilis Banks, 1905, p. 19. [New name for gracilis Banks 1904. New
synonymy.]
Leptocella coloradensis. — Ross, 1938b, p. 22. [Lectotype designated.]
Leptocella albida. — Betten and Mosely, 1940, pp. 61-63, fig. 28. [Holotype figured.]
The types of both coloradensis and exilis are males, and their geni-
talia and that of albida all seem identical. In coloration both seem
well within the variability of albida as presently defined.
Leptocella minuta Banks
Leptocella minuta Banks, 1900, p. 257.
Leptocella minuta. — -Ross, 1938b, p. 22. [Lectotype designated.]
Although this species is also a probable synonym of albida, it is not
being synonymized at present because the male allotype lacks its
abdomen and shows small colorational differences. The types are
slightlj^ smaller than typical of albida and bear a few small bro vanish
spots along the veins apically.
Leptocella texana Banks
Leptocella texana Banks, 1905, p. 19.
At some time the species labels in the collection of the Museum of
Comparative Zoology for this species and the next became transposed.
The labels on the specimens, however, are still correct. This trans-
position of labels led Ross (1938) to designate a lectotype for texana
from the syntypic series of intervena, clearly an invalid designation.
The unique type of texana lacks abdomen but is probably a female.
The Vvings are white but heavily marked with brown along the veins.
Leptocella intervena Banks
Leptocella intervena Banks, 1914, p. 262, figs. 15, 50.
Leptocella texana. — Ross (not Banks), 1938b, p. 23.
Leptocella diarina Ross, 1944, pp. 218-219, figs. 752-760. [New synonymy.]
As mentioned under texana, the species labels of this and the pre-
ceding were transposed, causing Ross (1938b) to make an invahd
lectotype designation for texana.
