NEOTROPICAL MICROLEPIDOPTERA, VII — OBRAZTSOV 225
Female genitalia: Erectile sacs (?osmeteria) on sides of postsegmen-
tal membrane of eighth segment, shaped as two large, coniform bags.
Apophyses anteriores and posteriores slightly dilated and rounded at
tips. Area around ostium bursae membranous, with weak sclerites
on sides. Antrum as mde as adjacent portion of corpus bursae;
ventral side of caudal portion of bursa copulatrix with a strongly
sclerotized area; signum shaped as an elongate, moderately broad,
slightly crescent plate.
Type: Holotype, male (genitalia on slide 5797), Volcan de Chiriqui,
Chiriqui, Panama, 2000-3000 ft., 1881-1882 (G. C. Champion; 66559);
British Museum (Natural History).
Other specimen examined: One female (genitalia on slide 14-Obr.,
1963), Volcan Santa Maria, Quezaltenango, Guatemala, June; U.S.
National Museum.
Remarks: The external characters of the specimen from Guatemala
indicate that it represents a female at cordigera which was described on
the basis of a male from Panama. Both specimens have similar
markings of the forewing; the narrow projection of the basal blotch
almost reaches the point of origin of the curved, subterminal fascia.
As yet, this feature has been known in cordigera only.
