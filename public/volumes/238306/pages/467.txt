634 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. us
Distribution: S. herklotsii has been recorded previously from only-
three specimens, two from Ghana and one from the Congo, Pre-
sumably, however, the St. Helena material referred to S. latus by
Melliss, Cunningham, and Colman belongs to this species. It appar-
ently occurs in depths of 25 to 70 meters.
Family Nephropidae
Enoplometopus antillensis Liitken
Enoplometopus antillensis Lutken, 1865, p. 265. — Holthuis, 1946, p. 79, pi. 5,
figs, b, d, e, g, h, i, k, 1; pi. 6, figs, a-e; pi. 7, figs, a, b.
Enoplometopus dentatus Miers, 1880, p. 381, pi. 15, fig. 7.
Material: None.
Kemarks: Enoplometopus dentatus was described from a mutilated,
poorly preserved specimen collected at St. Helena by J. C. Melliss.
Holthuis (1946) suggested, with considerable justification but without
reexamination of Miers' type-specimen, that E. dentatus is a synonjrm
of E. antillensis, a species described from a West Indian specimen and
subsequently discovered in the Indonesian region.
Distribution: West Indies; Banda Island, Moluccas; St. Helena.
Probably sublittoral.
Family Paguridae
Subfamily Dardaninae
Dardanus arrosor (Herbst)
Cancer arrosor Herbst, 1796, p. 170, pi. 43, fig. 1.
Pagurus arrosor. — Cunningham, 1910, p. 121.
Dardanus arrosor. — Forest, 1955, p. 90, fig. 19.
Material: None.
Remarks: Although there is no reason to doubt Caiman's identifica-
tion of the specimens collected and reported by Cunningham (1910),
that material should eventually be reexamined in the light of knowl-
edge about this and related species that has accumulated since that
date.
Distribution: Eastern Atlantic, Mediterranean, Red Sea, Philip-
pines, Japan, and New Zealand, in depths of 20 to 300 meters.

length of anterior portion of carapace, 2.6 mm.
