possible at this tinie. As some of the records cited were published
in reports that are not directly concerned with the fauna of St. Helena,
however, there is a very real possibility that similar records in other
papers, even of species not mentioned here, have escaped my notice.^
The references listed for each species include the original description,
all St. Helena records that have come to my attention, a good figure,
and synonyms here proposed for the first time; there has been no
attempt to indicate all synonyms.
Most of these collections, including holot5"pes of the new species,
have been retained in the national collections. Available duplicate
specimens, including paratypes, have been deposited in the Museum
of Comparative Zoology at Harvard and in the British IMuseum
(Natural History).
I take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to Mr.
Loveridge for making this material available to me and for enthusi-
astically fidfilling my several requests for specific collections. Special
thanks are also due to L. B. Holthuis of the Rijksmuseum van Natu-
urlijke Historie, Leiden, and to J. Forest of the Museima National
d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, who graciously examined material in their
collections at my request. Among my Smithsonian colleagues, Ray-
mond B. Manning has been especially helpful in calling my attention
to St. Helena records in the literature and in reviewing the manu-
script of this report.

1 A glaring omissioa, brought to my attention after completion of this study, is
that of Pseudozius bouvieri (A. Milne-Edwards, 1869). This crab was figured,
but not identified, by Melliss, 1875, p. 206, pi. 22, fig. 3 (see Monod, 1956, p. 239,
and Forest and Guinot, 1966, p. 68, for synonymy and distribution).
