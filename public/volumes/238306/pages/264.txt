NOTES ON CERTAIN NEARCTIC TRICHOPTERA
IN THE MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY
By Oliver S. Flint, Jr.
Associate Curator, Division of Neuropteroids
The collection of Trichoptera in the Aluseum of Comparative
Zoology at Harvard University is one of the most important deposi-
tories in the New World of types and other important material.
During the summers of 1961 and 1962 it was my good fortune to be
able to spend a number of weeks studying and preparing notes and
illustrations on some of this material.
Many of the male types of Nearctic caddis flies in this collection
were illustrated by Ross (1938b) and most of the other species have
been figured or synonymized in later works of the same and other
authors. However, there remains a small number of species whose
status has never been clarified. In many instances the problem has
been that the type is female. Now, with oiu" increasing ability to
discriminate between the females of the various species, and with
the collection of longer series containing both sexes, it is possible in
many cases to associate these female types with the males of the same
species. In other cases the uncertainty about the species status has
resulted from the failure of the earlier workers to figure or study the
cleared, relaxed genitalia of the male types.
