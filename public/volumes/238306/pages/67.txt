Diagnostic description.— Cephalothorax of female (fig. 10a)
consisting of cephalic maxilliped-bearing and first pedigeroiis seg-
ments, wider posteriorly than anteriorly; frontal region narrow,
lateral margins sharply rounded. Lateral cephalothoracic margins
flatly convex, medial posterior margin convex, lateral regions pro-
jecting shghtly past medial posterior surface. Eight denticulations
present on medial posterior surface. Ocular region visible as smoothly
irregular, clear portion in heavily pigmented anterodorsal surface
and irregular, darkly pigmented region just anterior to it.
Cephalothorax of male (fig. 106) consisting of cephaUc, maxilliped-
bearing and first pedigerous segments, widest medially; posterolateral
regions extendmg well past flat-margmed medial posterior region.
Frontal region narrow, anterior margin wavy, with small median
depression. Anterolateral cephalothoracic margins deeply indented,
at junction of frontal region and cephalothorax, generall}^ flatly
convex posterior to indentation except for slight indentation in middle
of lateral margin. Cephalothoracic grooves present, extending ante-
riorly from each side of junction of cephalothorax and free second
pedigerous segment, terminating at indentation of anterior lateral
margin. Inner margins of posterolateral cephalothoracic regions
with filmy membrane extending medially and dorsally, covering most
of sinus formed by lateral cephalothoracic region and lateral margin
of second pedigerous segment. Additional membrane present on each
side of median posterior region and directed dorsally and posteriorly.
Female second through fourth pedigerous segments (figs. 10c, d)
free, second pedigerous segment visible dorsally as narrow band
slightly overlapped anteriorly by posterior median cephalothoracic
region, bearing 4 small denticulations and 2 large lateral plates pro-
jecting laterally and posteriorly to middle of genital segment. Third
pedigerous segment also appearing as narrow band, overlapped medi-
ally by posterior end of second pedigerous segment and laterally by
