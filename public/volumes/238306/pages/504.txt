which extends from the tip of the cusp to the base. The medial mar-
gins are similarly armed. The first tooth is therefore similar to the
second tooth. In /. oxyrinchus (excepting largest adults) the first
tooth in each jaw does not have a complete cutting edge on its lateral
margin. It is therefore dissimilar from the second tooth, particularly
in the upper jaw. The cutting edge on the lateral margin of the first
tooth is present at the tip of the cusp but extends only part way to the
base. The relative length of this cutting edge varies with growth. In juve-
niles the cutting edge may be only one-third or less of the length of the
cusp, but in subadults and larger specimens it will commonly extend
along two-thkds of the cusp. In large adults of 2,500 mm. or more
the cutting edge approaches or reaches the base— when the distinction
between /. alatus and /. oxyrinchus on this character disappears. The
same can be said of tooth shape in large adults of /. oxyrinchus where
the teeth are less flexuous and proportionately broader than those of
smaUer specunens— thus the teeth of large adults of /. oxyrinchus are
like those of /. alatus.

Another difference between the teeth of the two species is in the
position and shape of the third upper tooth. In /. alatus the thu-d
upper tooth is below the lateral margin of the palatine process of the
palatopterygoquadrate cartilage and is only shghtly obhque in shape
(pi. 1). In 7. oxyrinchus the third upper tooth is more medial in
position, usually below the upper two-thirds of the lateral margin of
the palatine process, and the tooth itself is more asymmetrical and
oblique in shape.
