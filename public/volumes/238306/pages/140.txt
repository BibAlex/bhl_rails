REVISION OF PILARGIDAE PETTIBONE 191
acicular setae (not hooked) ; dorsal cirri short, subulate. Neuropodia
cylindrical, with neuroacicula and simple neurosetae; neurosetae
capillar}^, linibate; ventral cirri short, subulate. Pygidium with
pau'ed short anal ckri. Proboscis unarmed, cylmdrical. Without
intestinal caeca. Integument smooth, w^ith thick, highly u-idescent
cuticle, not papillated or areolated.
A single species has previously been referred to Synelmis, S. simplex
Chamberlin, 1919, p. 177. Tuamotu Islands, South Pacific. Herein
referred to S. albini (Langerhans) , see below.
A single species has previously been referred to Kynephorus, K.
inermis Ehlers, 1920, p. 27. Amboina, Indonesia. Herem referred
to S. albini (Langerhans) , see below.
A single species has been described previously under Glyphohesione,
G. klatti Friedrich, 1950, p. 169. Off Helgoland, North Sea. See
Eliason, 1962, p. 29, as Ancistrosyllis klatti. Herein referred to
Synelmis, perhaps young of S. albini^
Other species were described under Ancistrosyllis and are being re-
ferred to Synelmis albini. See below and page 165.

Remarks: Ancistrosyllis albini, described by Langerhans in 1881
from the Canary Islands, was evidently overlooked by Chamberlin,
1919 (Synelmis simplex), Fauvel, 1919 (Ancistrosyllis rigida), and
Ehlers, 1920 (Kynephorus inermis) . Augener, 1927, synonomized iiC.
inermis with A. rigida. He also suggested that both inermis and
rigida might well be referred to A. albini and that the apparent differ-
ences could be due to preservation, since A. albini was described and
figured from a living specimen and not contracted due to preservation,
as in the specimens described by the other authors. Hessle, 1925
(A. gracilis) and Monro, 1933a (A. gorgonensis) indicated that their
respective species were close to A. rigida and A. albini. Hartman,
