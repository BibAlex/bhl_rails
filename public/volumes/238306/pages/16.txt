Diagnosis: Second and third pleonal epimera rounded behind, with
sHght lateral ridges; article 5 of male gnathopod 1 longer than article
6, hind edge truncated, not lobate, article 6 rectangular, slender, palm
transverse or slightly chelate, finger overlapping palm by its full
length; gnathopod 2 like gnathopod 1 except article 5 is slightly
shorter, although longer than article 6, and with a distinct, rounded
hind lobe; article 6 like that of gnathopod 1 ; article 2 of pereopods 1-2
about 1.7 times as long as broad; ventral edge of article 1 on antenna
1 lacking ventral spines; antenna 1 much longer than antenna 2,
ilagellum about four times as long as flagellum of antenna 2, neither
flagellum strongly setose; lateral apical lobule of lower lip much longer
than medial lobule, coxa 1 not produced forward; peduncidar process

Records: Intertidal: Friday Harbor, Wash.; North Bay, Cape
Arago State Park, Oreg. ; Hazard Reef, S. of Morro Bay, Calif. Islands
off southern California: San Nicolas 4-9 fms.; Santa Barbara, 26-39
fms. Point Conception, Calif., 8-9 fms.; off Long Beach, Calif., 13
fms.; Off La Jolla, Calif., 1 fm. Guadalupe Island, Baja California,

Relationship: This species is unique in Ampithoe for having the
male and female gnathopods identical, the male gnathopod 2 being as
small as gnathopod 1.
Young males and females are difficult to separate from A. plea, A.
lindbergi, A. mea, and A. tea.
Distribution: Puget Sound to Guadalupe Island.
