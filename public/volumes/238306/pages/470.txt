Actaea margaritaria A. IVIilne-Edwards
Adaea margaritaria A. Milne-Edwards, 1867, p. 41, pi. 21 bis, figs. 3-6.— Odhner,
1925, p. 47, pi. 3, fig. 8.
Actaea (Adaea) margaritaria.— Monod, 1956, p. 294, figs. 357-360.
Material: Off Rupert's Bay; buoy; 0-2 meters; Feb. 2, 1959; 1
male, 1 female.— Same; buoy and cable; 0-75 meters; Mar. 18, 1960;
1 male, 4 females.— Same; Apr. 5, 1962; 1 female.— Same ; buoy; 0-2
meters; Feb. 11, 1963; 3 females.— James Bay; collected by skin-
diver; April 1964; 2 males, 2 females (1 ovigerous).
Measurements: Carapace lengths of males, 3.1-5.3 mm.; of females
without eggs, 3.2-7.3 mm.; of ovigerous female, 8.7 mm.
Remarks: The smallest male and six of the eleven females (with
carapaces less than 5 mm. long) are evidently immature.
The male gonopods of this species resemble those of A. ruppellii
(Krauss, 1843) from South Africa and the Indo-Pacific region, but I
cannot accept Odhner's suggestion that A. margaritaria may be only
subspecifically distinct from that species. Not only does A. ruppellii
attain a much greater size than has been recorded for A. margaritaria,
but it is a much hau-ier crab, and the dark color of the fixed finger
extends over somewhat less of the surface of the male chela than it
does in the Atlantic species.
Distribution: Off West Africa from the Cape Verde Islands to
Annobon; St. Helena (new record). Subhttoral to 100 meters.

Xanthodes melanodadylus A. Milne-Edwards, 1867, p. 39, pi. 21 bis, figs. 1, 2.
Micropanope polita Rathbun, 1893, p. 238.— Garth, 1946, p. 459, pi. 77, fig. 4.
Panopeus tanneri Faxon, 1893, p. 154.
Micropanope melanodactyla— Monod, 1956, p. 320, figs. 401-405.
Material: Off Rupert's Bay; buoy cable; 0-75 meters; Apr. 5, 1962;
1 male.— Same; buoy; 0-2 meters; Feb. 11, 1963; 2 males.
Measurements: All three specimens have carapace lengths of 4.0
mm.
Remarks : Comparison of homeotypes of Xanthodes melanodactylus
from the Cape Verde Islands with syntypes of Micropanope polita
Rathbun from the eastern Pacific off Baja Cahfornia and a syntype of
Panopeus tanneri Faxon from near Cocos Island has disclosed no
apparently significant differences in the form of the gonopods (fig.^ 7)
or in any other characters that cannot be referred to normal variation
in this variable species. Garth (1946, p. 462) noted that the 800
