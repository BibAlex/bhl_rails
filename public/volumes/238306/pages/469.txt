Remarks: The four adult specimens agree with western Atlantic
material with which they have been compared and disagree with
specimens of D. personata (Linnaeus, 1758) [=D. vulgaris H. MUne'
Edwards, 1837, see Holthuis and Gottlieb, 1958, p. 78] in the morsi
evenly convex carapace and the more prominent suborbital tooth
mentioned by Milne Edwards. The two adult males and one of thei
adidt females differ from aU western Atlantic adults at my disposal,
however, in having the thu'd anterolateral tooth (not counting the;

orbital angle) placed so close to the second tooth as to form almost a
single bifid tooth (compare fig. 6 with Rathbun 1937, fig. 1 1) . Evalua-
tion of the systematic importance of this character must await the
examination of additional specimens. The immature specimen lacks
the third anterolateral tooth entirely, but it differs little in this respect
from western Atlantic specimens of D. erythropus of comparable size.
