472 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. us
Paratype specimens dated: 5 females, May 4, 1949; 6 males, May 30,
1949.
Type locality: Marmora, Ontario, Canada, May 4, 1949, O. Peck.
Distribution : Known only from the type locality.
Host: Melanagromyza schineeri (Giraud).
Remarks : Eurytoma contractura is close to E.flavicrus, the preceding
new species, in the similarly shaped, elongated abdomen, configuration
of the female genitalia, and the elongated ninth tergum. The former
differs, however, in the black tegula and legs, the shorter postmarginal
vein in relation to the marginal, and in the male antenna that has five
pedicellate segments instead of only four.

Eurytoma discordans Bugbee, 1951, pp. 220-223. — -Burks, 195S, p. 81.
Types: 9 females and 12 males. Holotype female, allotype and
paratypes in the U.S. National Museum (USNM 61219); paratypes
in the Bugbee collection, Allegheny CoUege, MeadvUle, Pa.
Type locality: Howe, Ind., galls, collected on Dec. 20, 1930.
Distribution: United States: Indiana, Massachusetts, Virginia,
Michigan, Wisconsin, Maine. Canada: Ontario, Quebec, Alberta.
Host: Diplolepis globuloides (BeutenmuUer) == (Z>. variabilis (Bas-
sett)) on Rosa species, Periclistus pirata (Osten-Sacken) and Syno-
phromorpha= (Periclistus) sylvestris (Osten-Sacken).
Remarks: The host of this species is believed to be an inquiline,
Periclistus sylvestris (Osten-Sacken), that modifies the host gall, D.
globuloides (BeutenmuUer), described by Beutenmuller in 1892 from
the gall only. The true gallmaker has been determined as Diplolepis
variabilis (Bassett), and so D. globuloides (Beutenmuller) is placed as
a synonym of D. variabilis (Bassett) in Hymenoptera of America
North of Mexico (1951). Eurytoma discordans differs from E. acuta
in the color of the scape (all yellow or upper extremity black only),
the pale yellow color of the wing veins, narrow stigmal club and
marginal vein, and the presence of a wide median furrow on the
propodeum that maintains same width from top to bottom.
