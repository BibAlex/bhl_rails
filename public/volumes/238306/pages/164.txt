WEST INDIAN CERAMBYCIDAE â€” CHEMSAK 219
small spots near suture giving the overall effect of a dark, broken,
irregular band, dark patches also irregularly placed behind the broken
band; apices obliquely emarginate truncate. Legs with hind femora
moderately clavate, irregularly infuscated over club, tibiae irregularly
infuscated. Abdomen moderately pubescent; apex of last sternite
narrowly rotundate truncate. Length 3.5-4 mm.
Holotype female (USNM 67329) and five female paratypes from
Little Bay, Peter Isl., B.V.I., Mar. 30, 1958 (J. F. G. Clarke); two
additional females not designated as paratypical from English Harbor,
Antigua, B.W.I., Apr. 20, 1958 and Apr. 2, 1956.
This species varies in the amount of dark patches present on the
elytra and in the infuscation of the pronotum and appendages. The
dark patches are restricted to the apical half of the elytra when viewed
from above.
Also tentatively assigned to L. clarkei is one female from Sopers
Hole, Tortola, B.V.I., Apr. 5, 1958. This latter specimen is clothed
with paler pubescence and the elytral apices are truncate. It may
represent a distmct species but the lack of definitive series makes such
an assignment unpractical at this time.
U. clarkei is dedicated to J. F. G. Clarke, who made available for
study the material reported in this paper.
Urgleptes species
One female from Antrim, 1000', Dominica, B.W.I. , Mar. 15, 1956,
probably represents a new species, but I choose not to describe it at
this time on the basis of a unique. This small (5.5 mm.) pretty
specimen is rather pale with the elytra and appendages being dom-
inantly testaceous. The head and pronotal disc are a pale reddish
brown. The elytra are u'regularly mottled by elongate patches of
dark pubescence, the vague costae are clothed with very pale brown
pubescence. The legs are almost all very pale with small dark spots
on the club of the femora and the tibiae are apically infuscated.
