MORE NEW GALERUCINE BEETLES
WITH EXCISED MIDDLE TIBIAE IN THE MALE
By Doris H. Blake
Honorary Research Associate, Department of Entomology
This paper is a supplement to "A Review of Some Galerucine
Beetles with Excised :Middle Tibiae in the Male" (Proc. U.S. Nat.
Mus., vol. 108, 1958) which, owing to its delayed publication, appeared
subsequent to a paper by J. Bechyne (Ent. Arb., vol. 7, 1956), wherein
he described the genus Trichobrotica, giving the same type of the genus,
Neobrotica sexplagiata Jacoby, that I had for my new genus Iceloceras,
He described only one new species under this, Trichobrotica brasiliensis,
the type of which I have examined. Since it is my Iceloceras flavipes,
I am transferring to the genus Trichobrotica those species described
by me under Iceloceras although I recognize that some of them do not
fit entirely into the rather narrow limits of Bechyne's genus described
from two very similar species and having as the only characters
coarsely punctate elytra with sparse pubescence and with vertical
elytral epipleura visible the entire length. Bechyne did not note the
excised middle tibiae in the male, which, together with the lack of
any sexual differences in the antennae, I had taken as characters
separating Iceloceras from other genera with excised middle tibiae.
In general most beetles of the group with excised middle tibiae have
unusual antennal development in the male also. In Trichobrotica I
