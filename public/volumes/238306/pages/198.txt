NEOBROTICA AND RELATED GENERA â€” BLAKE 271
(BMNH) and various museums in the United States have loaned me
material, notably the Museimi of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), the
American IVIuseum of Natural History (AMNH), and the California
Academy of Sciences (CAS) . John A. Wilcox of the New York State
Museum has given freely his help in the classification of these difficult
galerucine beetles. Gerhard Scherer has made notes and drawings
of Bechyne's types in the Frey Museum collection at Tutzing,
Germany.
Key to the Genera of Galerucinae Here Treated
1. Head of male unlike that of female, with the front deeply excavated or with
a median hole 2
Head of male similar to that of female 5
2. Head of male with a small median hole over labrum.
Cyclotrypema, new genus (p. 354)

3. Third antennal joint of female usually longer than the fourth, rarely equal to
it and never shorter Eccoptopsis, new genus (p. 339)
Third antennal joint of female equal to or shorter than fourth 4
4. Male antenna with third joint only much widened and irregularly excised
in middle, not at end Rachicephala, new genus (p. 354)
Male antenna with third and fourth joints widened and excised at adjoining
ends Eucerotoma
5. Anterior coxal cavities closed Potamobrotica, new genus (p. 351)
Anterior coxal cavities open 6
6. Fi'ont of face with well-developed carina, eh^tral costae usually faintly developed.
Neobrotica
