A REAPPRAISAL OF THE TRILOBITE Scoticlla 3
the smallest (earliest) holaspides frequently possess genal and
caudal mucronations which may be resorbed during the succes-
sion of holaspid instars. The largest (latest) holaspides, the adults
or the species, may be completely non-mucronate, e.g. the develop-
ment of Acastocephala imicrops (Salter 1864) (see Shergold,
1966).
The species primarily concerned in this paper were originally
described by Hall (1860, pp. 156-7) as Dalmania logcmi and
referred to Dalmanitina logani (Hall) and D. logcmi (Hall) var.
conservatrix by McLearn (1918a, 1918b, 1924). The genus
Scotiella was erected by Delo (1935, p. 409) with Dalmania logani
(Hall) as the type species.
