which differ in degree. The following are deemed diagnostic:
glabellar furrows incised to varying depths, there being apparent
gradations between species with well-defined furrows and those in
which the anterior and median lateral furrows are faint or obso-
lescent; convexities of associated lateral side lobes correspondingly
variable; preoccipital lobes approximately one-fourth as wide
(exsagittal) as median lateral lobes; a narrow (transverse), up-
raised, longitudinal glabellar ridge flanked by shallow depressions
joining anterior lateral and preoccipital furrows always present
but varyingly distinct; long genal spines in young holaspides, short
spinules in adults; pygidium with five to six strongly furrowed
pleural segments, up to 11 axial rings; posterior axial rings may
be uniformly entire throughout morphogenesis or mesially inter-
rupted in the adults; margin entire in late holaspides, possibly
denticulate on the shell of early holaspides; short, delicate, often
inflected, caudal spinule, as in Acastella.
RELATIONSHIPS. In emending the diagnosis of Scotiella an attempt
has been made to bring the genus into direct comparison with
Acastella. It seems most closely related to those species of Acas-
tella, similar to A. spinosa (Salter 1864), the type species, which
have non-denticulate late holaspid pygidial margins. Species of
Scotiella may be readily distinguished from those of the Acastella
spi)iosa species-group by their longer glabellar furrows, reduced
preglabellar furrow and shorter genal mucronations.
