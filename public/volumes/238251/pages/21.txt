derived from a parent species of Acaste at a time when Acastella
was evolving from a similar source in northwest Europe.
5. Acastella, present in Europe and north Africa from Lud-
lovian to Siegenian time, has not been reported from North
America. Scotiella, present from Ludlovian to Lower Gedinnian
time in North America, is only sparsely represented in Europe,
where its range is confined to beds about the Siluro-Devonian
passage (late Ludlovian to early Downtonian). Scotiella may
thus be interpreted as the temporal equivalent in North America
of the genus Acastella in Europe and north Africa.
