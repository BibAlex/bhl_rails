small tubercle which appears to lie sagittally within the fifth and
sixth transverse furrows. Rings 7-10 are mesially interrupted by
a smooth band or groove running longitudinally along the axis
from the sixth transverse furrow. Whereas the halves of rings
7 and 8 are directed sagittally to the posterior, those of rings 9 and
10 point forwards. There are four well-defined pleurae, deeply
grooved and separated by extremely weak interpleural furrows;
a fifth is faintly indicated and there is sufficient space for a sixth
in the smooth area at the posterior end of the pleural field. Border
moderately wide, separated from the furrowed pleurae by a weak
marginal furrow. Lateral margins entire in adults.

TYPES. It has not been found possible to trace with certainty either
of the specimens used by Hall (1860, p. 156, text-fig. 18) to
illustrate Scotiella logani. All the specimens figured by McLearn
(1924, pi. XXVII) were labeled as plesiotypes and none of these
can be accurately matched with the original syntypes. I have,
therefore, selected from among McLearn's plesiotypes, GSC 6210,
as neotype of the species.
DISTRIBUTION. All the available material is from the Arisaig coast
sections of Nova Scotia, the species occurring there in zones a-c
