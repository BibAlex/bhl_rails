PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION,
In nearly all of the recent works of this nature, appearing
in America, the subjects dealt with have been confined, more
or less, to those plants that can be and are cultivated by
commercial florists for profit, or by those who own conserva-
tories. And while the present book includes all this class of
information it has a far wider scope, treating, as it does, on
the care and management of a diversity of plants not touched
upon by other writers, all equally necessary in the adornment
of our gardens and homes and, for this purpose, as beautiful
and interesting as those that generally receive the greatest at-
tention from authors of most horticultural works. Divested
of superfluous verbiage, and shorn of perplexing technicalities
which tend to confuse, the cultural directions here given can
be easily and successfully followed, the results contributing to
the perfect enjoyment of the purest of human pleasures, by
some, and affording to others a lucrative occupation.
What I have given here are teachings gleaned and sifted
from the experience of many years work as a gardener. The
methods described are such as have been successfully prac-
ticed by me and can be safely relied on as up-to-date and
thoroughly applicable to American conditions and requirements.
