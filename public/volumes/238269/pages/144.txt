several other annual and perennial species grown; none, however, is as

SACCHARUM OFFICINARUM VIOLACEUM— A variety of the sugar
cane with violet or plum colored leaves and stems; useful for sub-tropi-
cal bedding. It is easily increased b3 cutting the stems into pieces, with
two joints to each piece, and placing them on the sand bed of a warm
house at almost any time. Numerous shoots are produced at the joii](ts,
and they make plants rapidly.
STIPA PENNATA (Feather Grass)— An old favorite in gardens. The
leaves are long and narrow. The flowers are arranged in long, arching
spikes, presenting a very delicate appearance. Propagated in Spring by
division, and from seed. There are over a hundred species, only a few
of which are In cultivation.
UNIOLA LATIFOLIA is a native species which makes an attractive
border plant, growing usually from 2 to 8 feet high. The leaves are
broad and arching, about an inch wide; the spikelets are drooping on
long pedicels. This grass starts early into growth and is one of the
easiest to propagate by division.
