BULIiOrS P LASTS.
acoDHiderable diBtance from the base or disc, but attached to the disc
by a root-like formation which continues active, after the swollen base
of the leaf is dead, in supplying nutriment to the young bulb until it
sends out roots. When this little root-Hke process is of no further use it
gradually shrivels up. Afterward the young bulbs grow apace and rob
the soil of the nourishment intended for the parent bulb. This provision
evidently shows that the Vallota naturally grows deep in the soil and
is intended to raise the tulblets near to the surface before taking root.
These bulblets, unless intended for increasing the stock, should be
removed as soon as they make their appearance above the soil.
