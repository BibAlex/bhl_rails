While the notes have been made short, they will, never-
theless, in most cases, cover the essential points in the methods
of raising and caring for the plants named, and be understood
by the average reader as easily as if they had been dealt with
in longer articles. Hitherto, the information available on the
subjects treated upon has, for the most part, been widely
scattered in numerous magazines and books, many of which
are expensive; and it is often found necessary to search
through a mass of technical details in order to find the re-
quired information. It is to be hoped that the present vol-
ume will, in great measure, reduce the oifficulties referred to,
and render the art of plant cultivation profitable and enjoy-
able to the many whose tastes are horticultural.
