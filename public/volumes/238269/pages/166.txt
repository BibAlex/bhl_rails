liV2 FERNS AND LYCOPODS.
Insect Enemiesâ€” If the plants are not subjected to adverse condi-
tions, such as too high a temperature, or insufficient moisture in the air
or at the roots, they will seldom be attacked by insects. The Mealy
Bug, Thrips and Brown Scale, are sometimes troublesome. Scale is not
easy to remove, and the only efficacious method is to use a sponge and
water. For the other insects fumigation or vaporizing may be resorted
to, or, if only a few plants are affected, they may be laid on their sides
and the insects removed by using the hose. Slugs are the greatest ene-
mies of the Ferns, and a close watch should be kept for them. Various
methods are employed to capture them, such as a board smeared on the
under side with lard, cabbage leaves, and sliced turnips, or potatoes laid
among the plants; or by using camphor among the pots, and air-slacked
lime on and under the benches. If the slugs are numerous, hand-picking
should first be resorted to. They feed at night and rest during the day.
They will usually be found in the angular space beneath the rims cf the
J)OtS.
