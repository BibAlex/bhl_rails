iiig D. Chisolmii with the 20th Century. D. Chtsolmii Is a remarkable
species discovered tliree years ago in Mexico. It has bright scarlet
flowers on very long stems; the leaves are very large, simple and cov-
ered with coarse hairs. The hybrids heretofore have only been tried at
Washington in the grounds of the Dept. of Agriculture. Last year the
third generation seedlings gave almost every shade of color common
to the Dahlia. The flower stems are, as a rule, longer than those of the
varieties in common cultivation; most of the seedlings are single, some
are semi-double and others quite double, those of the latter resembling
more or less those of the Cactus class. The Cosmos Dahlias do best the
second year, especially when the old tubers are planted. In Washing-
ton they have done well when planted deeply during the first half of
April. The principal feature of the Cosmos Dahlia is its early flower-
ing trait.
