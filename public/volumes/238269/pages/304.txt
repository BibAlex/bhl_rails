For outside work lengths of temporary iron piping screwed into posi-
tion vherever necessary should be provided so as to use the hose low
down among the plants, never allowing the water to be squirted on the
soil. A good plan is to use distributors, one ^f which can be made in a
few minutes if the necessary material is at hand. Take a piece of zinc,
about a foot long and 5 inches wide, bend the sides for half its length
so as to clasp the end of the hose to hold it in position, and tie with
wire. The other end should overlap the end of the hose by about 6
inches, and be turned up slightly so as to meet the water, distributing
it in such a manner as will enable the soil to absorb it without being
disturbed in the least. This will also prevent the foliag;^ and flowers
from being spattered with muddy water.
