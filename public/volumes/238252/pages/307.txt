SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION AND PROGRESS. 303
Finally, two exceedingly interesting experiments in the way of en-
couraging scientific investigation are now attracting the attention of
the world. I mean, of course, the Carnegie Institution, with its endow-
ment of $10,000,000 and the Eockefeller Institute, devoted to investiga-
tions in the field of medicine, which will no doubt be adequately en-
dowed. It is too early to express an opinion in regard to the influence
or these great foundations upon the progress of scientific investigation.
As both will make possible the carrying out of many investigations
that would otherwise probably not be carried out, the chances of
achieving valuable results will be increased. The danger is that those
who are responsible for the management of the funds will be disap-
pointed that the results are not at once of a striking character, and
that they will be tempted to change the method of applying the monev
before those who are using it have had a fair chance. But we who are
on the outside know little of the plans of those who are inside. All
signs indicate that they are making an earnest effort to solve an ex-
ceedingly difficult problem, and all who have the opportunity should
do everything in their power to aid them.
In the changes which have been brought about in the condition of
science in this country since 1848, it is safe to say that this association
has either directly or indirectly played a leading part. It is certain
that for the labors of scientific men increased facilities and a wider
usefulness have been procured.
