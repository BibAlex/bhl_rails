fails to record stars wliich will appear when an exposure of five or six
hours is used. For the comparatively bright stars, the number in-
creases approximately by the ratio three for each magnitude. For
example, there are about three times as many stars of the second
magnitude ag of the first, and three times as many of the third magni-
tude as of the second. There are indications, however, that this ratio
is not kept up for the fainter stars, that is, there are not three times
as many stars of the sixteenth as of the fifteenth magnitude. No limit
to the universe has yet been reached, however. With the Bruce tele-

telescopes of our day; but increase in exposure always brings out new
and fainter stars, until the practical limit of the exposure is reached
in the fogging of the plate by the diffused light of the sky. The
longest exposure yet made in this observatory was with the Cooke lens,
an exposure of twenty-four hours, on four different nights. Such
an exposure in such an instrument brings out with great perfection
the wonderful beauty of the cloud-forms of the Milky Way.
Since the establishment of the Peruvian station, meteorology has
formed an important, though subordinate, part of the work. For
about ten years a line of auxiliary stations was maintained, reaching
from the Pacific across the Andes to the low country on the upper
waters of the Amazon. The culmination of this series was the station
