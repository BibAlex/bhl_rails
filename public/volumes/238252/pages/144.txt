of their strength all are so light that his trained assistants send the
giant kites up into the air as easil} as the little fellows.

by Dr. Bell. It is a wonderful flier, darting up from the ground with

The kite flies steadily without a turn or quiver as the line is reeled in

I have rarely seen it flying at an angle of less than eighty degrees.
The kite is admirably adapted for meteorological observations at great
heights, as it can carry considerable weight with the greatest ease.
