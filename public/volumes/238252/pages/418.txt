offer the same degree of resistance to intestinal and other poisons, and
the great eliminating organs begin to exhibit a gradual lessening in
functional activity. The theories of immunity rest upon the assump-
tion of the presence of some proteid body in the blood which endows
the whole system with powers of resistance to toxins. Exhaustion,
especially such as is induced by the emotions, fatigue, grief, anger and
fear, are well known to weaken the protective power of these mysterious
agencies. At the time of the so-called change of life, woman is us-
ually burdened with the maximum of her cares and labors and too
often at this time the severest griefs assail. If she be single there is
a species of spiritual awakening and the realization that youth is
utterly past. In married women the disappointments which follow
upon enthusiastic expectations become manifest, and in numberless
ways strains are thrust upon the organism. It must be remembered
that the greatest maturity of the powers, also, are evident at this time,
and therefore she should be capable of meeting all exigencies. The
whole question may be summed up in a few words : if a woman, married
or single, will so order her life that she retains to the best of her ability
her physical and mental vigor, and if she also sets her face sedulously
toward looking upon the bright side of existence and ignores emotional
impressions of a disagreeable character, she has nothing to fear as life
moves steadily on the downward incline.
