TEE COLLEGE COURSE. 209
furnished man. Throughout, it should be remembered that college is
not intended only for those who look forward to professional life.
And this means also a change in the preparation of men for college
chairs. Men go through college as specialists; they follow graduate
courses as specialists; they become college instructors as specialists.
Such training does not fit men for college teaching, however well it may
fit them for university teaching. Having never had symmetrical
mental training, they can not understand the true purpose of college
work, and they are liable to make the college student narrower than
themselves. There must be a return to the older type of professors,
men whose studies were not confined to the immediate area of their
chairs. We are accustomed to laugh at the notion that a college con-
sisting of a boy at one end of a log and Mark Hopkins at the other
was complete — and we are right; but the conception underlying that
notion is true in no small degree. The graduate of such a college had
learned to think and the information which he had received was
correlated, was his own. The writer reveres the memory of such a
teacher in his college, Benjamin IST. Martin, who, teaching philosophy
well, succeeded also in welding together for the student mathematics,
history and science into a well-related body of knowledge. His pupils
learned to think and, as far as in them lay, to think for themselves.
Not the classics but the method of training made the men in the
older colleges; students learned to think and they were compelled to-
obey. They learned much of self-control in college — an easier school
than that of the world, where college students of to-day must learn
the same lesson — or fail.
