POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY.
The university is strictly governmental and is under the control of
the Department of Education, one of the main divisions of the im-
perial administration. It includes six colleges â€” law, medicine, engin-
eering, literature, science and agriculture. In general, its students
are the graduates of high schools and are enrolled in a three-year
course, medicine and law requiring, however, four years. It may be
safely said that the grade of the regular work of the university is
higher than that of the American colleges, for I find that the courses
which are set down in the curricula of many colleges for freshmen and
sophomore classes are given in the Japanese high school. One may
further note that in the interest of general higher education the univer-
sity courses are practically free. And as evidence of the democracy
of learning one may sometimes note a young noble sitting shoulder to
shoulder with the son of a peasant. It goes almost without saying
that every university student is expected to understand lectures when
given in one of the European languages.
With this introduction we may briefly refer to the development of
our university. Between the end of the sixteenth century and the
beginning of the eighteenth century young Japanese who had been
thirsting for western learning began their study of medicine, astron-
omy, physics, chemistry, gunnery, fortification, by the aid of text-
books, mainly written in Dutch, which they had obtained, often in
spite of much local disfavor, from the trading station at Nagasaki.
Succeeding in their western studies, some of these Japanese workers
opened schools at several places for the dissemination of their hard-
earned knowledge. And one of these schools, named Bansho-shirabejo
(the place for the examination of the writings of the barbarians).
