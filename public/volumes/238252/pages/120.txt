different question from that as to whether the nucleus or the cytoplasm
of the egg determines which of the two possibilities that are potentially
present in the nucleus shall be awakened.
5. Our general conclusion is that while recent theories have done
good service in directing attention to the early determination of sex in
the egg, those of them which have attempted to connect this conclusion
with the assumption of the separation of male from female primoidia
in the germ-cells have failed to establish their point of view. The egg,
as far as sex is concerned, appears to be in a sort of balanced state, and
the conditions to which it is exposed, even when it is not fully formed,
may determine which sex it will produce. It may be a futile attempt
to try to discover any one influence that has a deciding influence for all
kinds of eggs. Here, as elsewhere in organic nature, different stimuli
may determine in different species which of the possibilities that exist
shall become realized.
