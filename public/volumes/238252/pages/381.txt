of the association rose during the year
from 3,600 to 4,000. The falling off in
attendance due to the abandonment of
the summer meeting appears to be a
definite loss with no compensating ad-
vantages. Many members unable to
attend in midwinter want a summer
meeting, and those who can not travel
as far as a thousand miles should be
given an opportunity to attend a meet-
ing within reach, and this requires two
further from the east to the west than
from the west to the east. Many sci-
entific men would rather travel 1,000
or 1,500 miles to an eastern meeting
than a much shorter distance to a meet-
ing in the central states.
Under the circumstances the St.
Louis and Philadelphia meetings may
be regarded as successful. They were

ing can also be given certain distinctive
features of out-of-door life and scien-
tific excursions, which are out of the
question in midwinter. The American
Association must be national in scope,
but meetings in the central states are
always smaller than those on the At-
lantic seaboard. The scientific centers
in the east are more concentrated, and
it is also true that it is psychologically
as members in attendance. In both
cities excellent local arrangements were
made for the meetings of the societies
and sections and for the entertainment
of visitors.
