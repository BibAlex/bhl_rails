flora are said to be poorer than those of the English island, but there
are certain advantages in having the station established upon land
possessed by the United States. This also applies to the Isle of Pines,
which has been ably recommended by J. Fred Clarke.
The marine fauna of the Tortngas is greatly superior to that of
the Florida mainland or Gulf Coast. Moreover, while the ocean water
surrounding the Tortugas is of the purest the shore waters of Florida
and the Gulf of Mexico are often charged with silt, and sullied with
the drainage from mangrove swamps to sucli a degree as to be rapidly
fatal to pelagic life. The littoral fauna of the mainland shores is

Beach Rock at Mastic Point, Andros Isd., Bahamas. A typical sea-worn rocky beach com-
posed of agglutinated fragments of shells, corals, etc.
inferior to that of the Tortugas, and the greater heat, mosquitoes and
occasional epidemics of mainland places render them undesirable.
The fauna of Bermuda is subtropical and consequently poorer than
that of the Bahamas, Tortugas or West Indies. Judging from the
results accomplished by Fewkes and others the pelagic life appears to
be even poorer than that of the Bahamas, although the expeditions
under Verrill have demonstrated that the littoral fauna is very rich.
Summing up, the question of site appears to have been narrowed
down to a choice between the Tortugas and one of the Antilles, the
favorite island being Jamaica. Before this question can be definitely
settled some competent naturalist who is already familiar with the
fauna and flora of one of these places should investigate the other with
a view to drawing a just comparison between them. It is remarkable
