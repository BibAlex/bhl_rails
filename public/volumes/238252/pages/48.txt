gas is now a naval coaling station, and a naval surgeon is stationed
at Fort Jefferson, which is in telegraphic connection with Key West.
A large naval tug makes two regular trips each week to and fro
between Key West and the Tortugas, completing the journey in less
than six hours. The climate is rendered cool by the small land area
and the almost constant breeze. There are no sand flies and practi-

quitoes at Fort Jefferson could be eradicated by screening the cisterns.
The quarantine station has been removed, and the place is most health-
ful on account of its isolation.
With the exception of several species of gulls, numerous migrating
birds and a few insects, the land fauna of the Tortugas is uninterest-
ing, and the flora is limited to the few plants which can cling to
beaches of coral sand. In these respects Jamaica is incomparably
superior to the Tortugas. The social conditions, and opportunity for
the study of a diversified land and fresh-water fauna and flora in
Jamaica are far superior to those which may be enjoyed at the Tor-
tugas. On the other hand, the Tortugas has a far richer pelagic and
certainly equally good littoral fauna, the purest of ocean water, and
it affords the best situation in the world from which to study the life
and conditions of the Gulf Stream. To students from the middle
west the Tortugas are more accessible than is Jamaica.
