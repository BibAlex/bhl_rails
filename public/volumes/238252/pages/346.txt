stars traced. This was the very first occasion upon which a comet
had been treated as a celestial body like another. How could an object
of the sort circulate among material crystal spheres? Questions of
this kind were in mens minds; the observations upon which their solu-
tions must depend were a-making; sufficient progress in mathematics
had already been made ; the time for a recasting of the accepted theory
of the world was at hand.
Crystalline spheres were the basis of the theory of Fracastor. To
explain the motions of the heavenly bodies he employed sixty-three
spheres whose motions were linked one with another like wheel-work.
His doctrine is that : All motions take place in circles ; uniform motions
are the most probable; each planet always remains at a constant dis-
tance from the earth; the changes in their observed brilliancy depend
not on changes of distance, but on differences in the earths atmos-
phere, or in the density of the crystal spheres; the Primum Mobile
moves uniformly and always will do so unless God the Creator inter-
venes by a special act; spheres are of various kinds â€” conductors, anti-
conductors, circling, anticircling, countervailing; sixty- three of them
will explain the world; ten orbs belong to Saturn, eleven to Jupiter,
nine to Mars, four to the sun, eleven to Venus, eleven to Mercury, seven
to the moon. The system of Fracastor is not only complex, but me-
chanically impossible. It represents the worst aspect of the doctrine
which Copernicus was to overthrow and it is interesting as almost the
last exposition of its sort, and especially because Fracastor was a con-
temporary of Copernicus and died in the same year (1543).
