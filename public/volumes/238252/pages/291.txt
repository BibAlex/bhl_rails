THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE.
287
ical Work in the Philippines, by Mr.
Elmer D. Merrill, gives an interesting
account of the history of botany in the
islands. Prior to the advent of the
Americans, various travelers had made
collections in the islands, and a certain
amount of work had been accomplished
by the priests; but the apathy of the
Spanish government is in remarkable
contrast to the present activity. The
priests in the early centuries were
chiefly interested in collecting medic-
inal plants, but Manuel Blanco pub-
lished a flora of the Philippines ex-
tending to 887 pages in 1837, and a
revised edition by Fernandez- Villar was
published in Manila between 1877 and
1883. Blancos original work is said
to be very faulty, so that De Candolle
regretted that he had not confined him-
self 10 writing sermons, and the later
revision, jjrepared without reference to
existing types or authentic botanical
material, will retard rather than ad-
vance the science of botany.
In 1873 Domingo Vidal went to the
islands and became director of the Bo-
tanical Garden, and after his death in
1878 he was succeeded by his brother
Sebastian Vidal. The latter, who died
in 1889 at the age of forty-seven years,
appears to have been the ablest of
Spanish botanists who have worked on
the Philippine flora. He was greatly
respected, both as a botanist and as a
man, and a life-size statue, which is
here reproduced, was erected by his
friends in the center of the Botanical
Garden.
The garden is said to have an un-
satisfactory situation, being only a few
feet above the level of the sea, with no
