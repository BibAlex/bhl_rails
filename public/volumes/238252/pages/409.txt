THE METRIC SYSTEM. 405
for this purpose. It would require the majority of the nations of the
civilized world to change their standard, with all the expense that this
implies, for the sake of saving expense to English and American
mechanical engineers and capitalists. For the sake of international
uniformity such a conference might well be undertaken, although with
the assurance that the continental engineers and capitalists would not
regard the subject from our standpoint.
Objection has often been made to the nomenclature of the metric
system, which is thought to be too diffuse, too high sounding and
scholastic to appeal to the masses. Such names as hectare and kilo-
meter are unwelcome to the farmer, who is well satisfied with his acres
and miles. There is no good reason to prevent any needed modification
in nomenclature so long as the fundamental units and the decimal rela-
tion between them are preserved. In our decimal currency the eagles,
dimes and mills are for the most part forgotten, while dollars and cents
are enough for most purposes. No great inconvenience has resulted
from the use of the word nickel for a five-cent piece, or the alleged
pennies and Calif ornian bits in the nomenclature of small change.
Those who are habituated to the use of the metric system rarely ever
speak of decimeters or dekameters, or decigrams or myriagrams. The
fathers could not provide for an indefinite future. Elasticity is neces-
sary, and new subordinate units are certainly allowable as long as they
serve any useful purpose.
In conclusion, those who advocate the introduction of the metric
system will need to be patient and considerate. Those who oppose it
must look to the future as well as the present. The well-worn query,
What has posterity done for me? is good enough for the local poli-
tician but unworthy of the statesman.
