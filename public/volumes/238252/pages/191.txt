SHORTER ARTICLES AND DISCUSSION,
AN UNUSUAL AURORA.
In the October number of the Pop-
TJLAE Science Monthly, Mr. A. F. A.
King has called attention to the re-
markable display of aurora borealis
on August 21 and has figured it as
seen at York Harbor, Maine. I had
the privilege of witnessing this aurora
from Intervale, New Hampshire, and
it corresponded very closely to the de-
scription given by Mr. King with a
single exception, so remarkable that it
seems to me worthy of note. At York
Harbor the western half of the arch
was made up of the comet-like pen-
nants while the eastern half of the
arch was continuous. This is clear,
both from Mr. Kings description and
from the accompanying cut. As seen
from Intervale this was reversed, the
western half of the arch being continu-
ous and the eastern broken. When I
first saw the display, perhaps a little
after half-past nine, the top of the
arch was about ten degrees south of
the zenith, and it slowly descended till
about thirty degrees south. This was
about half -past ten, and at this time
the arch had so faded as to be hardly
distinguishable.

To the Editok: I was much inter-
ested in the account of the Auroral
Arch, given by Dr. A. F. A. King in
the October number of Popular Sci-
ence Monthly, owing to the facts
that I observed the phenomenon and
wondered what it was, and that Dr.
Kings observations differed somewhat
from mine.
It was about 8 p.m. that I first saw
the aurora. To me and others who
observed it, it seemed in no way un-
usual save that we had not seen the
â–  northern lights for several years, and
we thought it was rather a poor dis-
play. No more notice was taken of it
at this time. It was about nine oclock
that we were called out to see a pe-
culiar appearance in the sky. It was
a band of nebulous light extending
from the eastern to the western ho-
rizon, and it seemed to be about three
feet wide (to me wider than the ap-
parent diameter of the full moon). It
was of nearly uniform width and in-
; tensity throughout its extent.
At nine oclock I took the direction
of the band with a pocket compass and
I the time by my watch. At this time
the band had begvui to break up at
the zenith and eastern end into the
comet-like, slowly wavering bodies as
described by Dr. King. The band con-
tinued to break from the east to a little
west of the zenith until the whole
eastern arc was composed of these
bodies, which was at about 10 P.M.,
when I returned to the house. Then
the western arc was intact save that
it seemed to have faded somewhat.
The phenomenon as described here
was seen by five others at the time and
place that I saw it. I was ignorant of
the nature of the display, but thought
it could not be the aurora borealis, so
watched the papers for the next few
days to ascertain if others who might
explain the phenomenon had observed
it, but found nothing satisfactory until
I received the Octooer Popular Sci-
i ENCE Monthly.
