I ought to add that the style of design which my hand draws is strange
to me. I have never observed anything like them anywhere. Neither do I
know of any influence, suggestive or otherwise, that could have given me this
power, with the exception (as I have stated) of having seen a man make a slight
exhibition of automatic drawing, but this exhibition was long after I had noticed
movements of my own hand. However, that exhibition gave me the idea of
taking a pencil into my hand to try for results.
One point I might state clearly. While drawing, my eyes are fastened
intently on the point of the pencil in contact with the paper, following the
course of the pencil as if they were fascinated by it.
Of automatic icriting I have done little. Occasionally the name of a near
relative will appear, sometimes with figures attached. Sometimes an inco-
herent sentence will be commenced, but not finished. The name and figures
usually appear either on a face or under or over it. Occasionally a word or
line is written in (as I suppose) some ancient language, under or close to a
drawing. I have never been able to discover what language this is. Perhaps
it is, like the drawings, imperfect.
I had never been interested in hypnotism or kindred subjects before, nor
ever attended any meetings or exhibitions in these lines, having always had a
disbelief in anything of the kind.
P. S. Three months having elapsed since writing the above, I have but
little to add in explanation. Pictures are still produced by the same mysterious
power. The artistic appearance is better and the human form is more in
evidence. I still think the drawings come from involuntary suggestion, that
is, suggestion from the inner mind. Perhaps it would be better to call it im-
pulse rather than suggestion.
