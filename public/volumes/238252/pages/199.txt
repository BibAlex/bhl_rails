A CASE OF AUTOMATIC DKAWING.
By Professor WILLIAM JAMES,
HAEVAKD UNIVERSITY.
* A UTOMATISMS have recently been made a frequent topic of
-^-*- investigation by psychologists, and although the exact reason
why some persons have them and others do not remains as little ex-
plained as does the precise character and content which they may
affect in a given individual, yet we are now so well acquainted with
their variety that we can class them under familiar types.
The rudiment of all the motor-automatisms seems to be the
tendency of our muscles to act out any performance of which we may
think. They do so without deliberate intention, and often without
awareness on our part, as where one swings a ring by a thread in a
glass and finds that it strikes the number of times of which we think;
or as when we play the willing game, and, laying our hands on the
blindfolded percipient, involuntarily guide him by our checking or
encouraging pressure until he lays his hands upon the object which
is hid.
The next higher grade of motor automatism, involving considerable
subconscious action of intelligence, is found in the various alphabet-
using forms of amateur mediumship, such as table tipping, the * Ouija-
board, and certain other devices for making our muscles leaky and
liable to escape from control.
Graphic automatisms, of which planchette-writing is the most
popularly known example, is a more widespread accomplishment than
ordinary people think. We have no statistics, but I am inclined to
suspect that in twenty persons taken at random an automatic writer
of some degree can always be found.
