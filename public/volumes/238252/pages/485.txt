EECENT DISCOVEEIES IN EADIATION AND THEIR
SIGNIFICANCE.
By Professor R. A. MILLIKAN,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO.
n^HERE are times when the atmosphere seems to be fairly saturated
-*- with the spirit of scientific discovery. Such a time existed
during the opening years of the nineteenth century when John Dalton
was putting the atomic theory of matter upon an experimental rather
than upon the purely speculative foundation upon which it had
previously rested; when Count Rumford, an American by birth, was
laying the corner-stone of the modern mechanical theory of heat, in
accordance with which heat consists in the vibratory motion of the
particles of which matter is composed; when Thomas Young was
forging the final links in the chain of proof that light consists in the
wave motion of some all-pervading medium, the ether.
It is not a little interesting that the opening years of the twentieth
century have also been marked in no less a degree than those of its
predecessor by epoch-making discoveries in physics. Most of this new
activity has been grouped about the general subject of radiation, dis-
coveries of new rays having followed one another in such rapid suc-
cession that it is difficult even for a physicist to keep posted about
them all. As a result of these discoveries important progress has been
made toward the solution of one of the most fundamental questions
with which science has to deal, viz., the question as to the nature and the
constitution of matter.
The Discovery of X-rays.
The discovery of X-rays is to be regarded as the starting point of
this epoch of investigation upon radiation. It was in the Christmas
