United States, the stimulus of a comparatively rigorous climate, and
the examples of white neighbors organized into a complex and highly
competitive industrial civilization. The reserve of foresight, energy
and ambition which the white Brazilian has inherited from his ances-
tors stands him in good stead in the easy and enervating surroundings,
while the negro will only work when he is obliged to.
The race which will inherit the fertile and salubrious plains and
plateaux stretching north from the Argentine border to the lowlands
of the Amazon will probably be of Caucasian origin and descent,
although its characteristics may have become much modified in fitting
its new surroundings. The Azorean hoes his little patch of ground
with the painstaking industry of the JSTorman peasant, but his gaucho
descendant in Eio Grande neglects agriculture for riding after cattle.
A capacity for indolence may perhaps be one of the conditions of sur-
vival in tropical climates, and the future master of these regions will
possibly possess oriental characteristics, and may lose some qualities he
inherits from his immediate ancestors, the restless Latins, Celts and
Teutons of western Europe.
So far as it has gone, Brazils experience tends to prove that the
white man has the adaptability, vitality and fecundity to ensure his
preponderance in the tropics as well as in the temperate zone, and that
the other races will exist there upon his sufferance.
