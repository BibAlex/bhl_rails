WiNFiELD Scott Chai-un, A.M., LL.U.,
Chancellor of Washington University.
After the lapse of a year, on the twenty-second of February, a meet-
ing of the incorporators was held, the charter accepted and the institu-
tion organized under the name of Washington Institute, which name
was further changed in 1857 to Washington University. The name
was chosen becaitse of its national significance, having also been sug-
gested by the day, February 22, on which the charter was given. The
first building was erected in 1853-4, and since that time the university
has had a steady and substantial growth, a new department being
added when the circumstances warranted it, until to-day Washington
University comprehends six departments and has three preparatory
schools organized under its charter and, embracing the whole range of
university studies except theology, affords complete preparation for
every sphere of practical and scientific life.
