too short a Hue, so that she was blanketed by the big hull of the
steamer and therefore received but a small fraction of the wind of
motion.
In spite of these two serious disadvantages, however, as the steamer
gathered headway, the great kite first trembled for a few moments, and
then rose gracefully from the water and flew steadily the full length
of her line.
Fig. 19 shows the kite as she rose from the water after being lowed
a short distance. The rain was pouring down in such torrents at the
time that my other pictures were not successful.

The experiment was thus a success, and showed conclusively that
Dr. Bell has obtained a man-lifting kite, or flying machine, that will
rise of itself. If a pull will make the kite rise, there is no reason to
doubt that an equally powerful push, such as propellers would give,
would be equally successful in causing the kite to ascend..
Though the tests have proved that Mabel II. can easily carry a man
and engine, no actual ascents have been made this summer. When
ascensions are made the man will sit in the center of the open space
between the two bridges (see Fig. 16).
One of the beauties of Dr. Bells models is that in every one there
is a large roomy space in the center where the operator and his passen-
gers can sit. This position is much safer and more comfortable than
