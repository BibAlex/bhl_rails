apparatus ? In a word the solution to the whole flying machine problem
if to get a machine that will start of itself without being shot off as if
from the mouth of a cannon. The successful machine in rising will
probably have to imitate the start of a large and heavy l)ird â€” that is
glide along the ground or surface of a lake for some distance with
constantly increasing speed until it rises of its own momentum.
A little kite, such as that shown in Fig. 5, darts up from the hand
if there is the least breath stirring. The larger kite, shown in Figs.
6 and 7, is equally nimble, but in a faint breeze, to raise the large White
Flier, shown in Figs. 9 and 10 and which is more than twelve feet on
a side, the operator has to run a few yards towing the kite behind him.

Kites larger than the White Flier Dr. Bell sends skyward by tying
the rope to the collar of a fast horse and then sending the steed
galloping down the field. Of course, when a good wind blows all these
kites soar upward as easily as the little fellow.
But to raise the giant kite Mabel II., shown in Fig. 15, Dr. Bell
found a more serious problem. It would be difficult for a man or
horse to pull the great frame so steadily as to keep her from being
dashed against the ground and smashed before she could rise.
The kite has power enough to lift several men, but how was Dr.
Bell to get her up into the air? If he could raise Mabel II. naturally,
like one of the smaller kites, he could be pretty sure that she would
go up when a motor, with propellers, was suspended to her. A pull
cr a push would be identical in its effect. In a word, if Dr. Bell could
^let this great man-lifting kite into the air by towing, as he did the
