IMPERIAL UNIVEBSITY OF TOKYO. 473
ence college, I should also mention a marine biological station at
Misaki. At this point, about thirty miles south of Tokyo, the warm
black current comes frequently close to the land and brings to the
station interesting pelagic forms, especially the minute floating plank-
ton.
In anthropological lines Professor Tsuboi and his assistant have
been many years engaging in the study of the Japanese races, past and
present, including the exploration of Ainu, Formosan aborigines and
the investigations of the prehistoric Japanese race. And in connection
with his laboratory we may mention the rich anthropological cabinet.
In summary, accordingly, I think that it can safely be claimed
that Japan has made studies not less in higher education than in
matters of military, naval or practical importance, and that its work
is progressing satisfactorily in quantity, no less than in quality. The
Tokyo Imperial University, as we have seen, is not more than twenty-
five years old, yet it has become the largest educational institution of
the far east. Its graduates already number about 6,000, and of
these alumni many are now filling posts of importance as professors,
scientists, jurists, physicians, statesmen, diplomats, and one can pre-
dict with reasonable certainty that many of the best supporters of the
future Greater Nippon and its emperor will have worn the square cap
as they passed under the red gate of our alma mater.
