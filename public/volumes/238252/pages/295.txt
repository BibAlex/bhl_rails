America, to give stronger and more general impulse and more system-
atic direction to scientific research, and to procure for the labors of
scientific men increased facilities and a wider usefulness.

course between those who are cultivating science in different parts of
America; the second is to give a stronger and more general impulse
and more systematic direction to scientific research; and the third is
to procure for the labors of scientific men increased facilities and a
wider usefulness. Those who are familiar with the history of the
association are well aware that it has served its purposes admirably,
and I am inclined to think that those who have been in the habit of
attending the meetings will agree that the object which appeals to
them most strongly is the promotion of intercourse between those who
-are cultivating science. Given this intercourse and the other objects
