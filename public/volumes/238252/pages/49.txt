MAIUXE ZOOLOGY IN THE TROPICAL ATLANTIC. 45
The discussion has at least succeeded in establishing the fact that
the Bahamas are on the whole inferior to the Tortugas, for despite
their good coral reefs, their pelagic and littoral faunge are relatively
poor. Nutting who directed one of the most successful biological
expeditions ever sent to the Bahamas, is emphatic in declaring the

Fish UawJc expedition of 1898-99 under the auspices of the United
States Fish Commission, the littoral fauna is remarkably good, al-
though I am informed on excellent authority that the pelagic hauls
of the expedition were poor. The social conditions of Porto Rico ap-
pear to be not so good as those of Jamaica, and its land fauna and
