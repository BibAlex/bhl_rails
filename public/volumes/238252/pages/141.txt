built in the laboratory. The experiments made with these cells have
given startling results:
First. — A tetrahedral cell has astonishing strength even when com-
posed of very light wooden sticks. As Dr. Bell has expressed it: It
is not simply braced in two directions in space like a triangle, but in three
directions like a solid. If I may coin a word, it possesses three-dimen-
sional strength; not two-dimensional strength like a triangle, or
one-dimensional strength like a rod. It is the skeleton of a solid, not
of a surface or a line.*

Second. — A large kite constructed of tetrahedral cells is as solid as a
small one, for it is likewise self-braced in all directions.
Third. — A kite built of tetrahedral cells is an almost perfect flier;
it is steady in squalls, a good lifter and flj^s almost directly over-
head. Tetrahedral cells when combined do not interfere with each
other in the least or hurt each others flying ability as box or triangular
cells do when combined.
