fact of even enlightened systematic utility. Such flagrant solecisms
of economy as that the post quartermasters offices, the post office and
the meat market should be huddled together in the same vicinity, will
now be completely remedied. Hitherto appropriations have been too
limited in amount and too rigidly doled out in detail by civilian
watch dogs of trivial parsimonies. Now at last the way seems toler-
ably clear by which the several functions of the post shall be grouped
in order of the importance : first, that which is military, afterwards,
and adjoining, that which is scholarly, and then, separate and apart,
all other and subsidiary functions — supplying and purveying of goods,
reception and entertaining of guests ; all will be no longer scattered or
occupying the most eligible positions, but grouped together and in
exactlv their right localitv.
The plans as already outlined are in scope and arrangement as
nearly perfect as practical ingenuity could devise. It is greatly to be
hoped that in carrying out so thorough a reformation, they who are
charged with the duty may remain unhampered by an authority su-
preme in the state, but which has in manifold instances in the past
proved its woeful incapacity to deal with technical needs or more
deplorably yet, with the demands of art. The mistake at Annapolis
will probably not be here repeated; but the New West Point will be
made to burgeon out of the old ; the revolutionary relics retained with
all their hallowed associations unimpaired, and the sacred traditions of
the academy held inviolate.
