there was no means of judging forward motion. The discharge from
a cannon would roll, squirt and seethe without showing any forward
motion, if we were looking into the cannons mouth. There can be
no question^ however, that there was an avalanche of solid materials
which accompanied the second black cloud seen by Anderson and
Flett, and I am tempted to ask, may there not have been a similar
non-incandescent avalanche with the first cloud, representing the
relatively cool material which cleared the craters throat?

If this were true we should have with each puff a sequence of
events somewhat as follows :
1. Straight puff upwards.
2. Avalanche of heavy materials downwards.
3. Horizontal dust-cloud outwards.
The sharply differentiated horizontal and vertical blasts had been
noted in all the eruptions of these volcanoes. They may be seen in
the photograph of the eruption of July 16, where one cloud lowers over
the water, the great column is upright, and its crest is bent to the
east by the high counter trade-wind. (fig- 1-)
The three stages above mentioned, in an explosive discharge from
a fissure upward, might have been expected on purely a priori grounds.
