The Method of Building up Kites with Tetrahedral Cells. The four-celled kite
B weighs four times as much as one cell and has four times as much wing-surface ; the sixteen-
celled kite Chas sixteen times as much weight and sixteen times as much wing-surface; and
the sixty-four celled kite D has sixty-four times as much weight and sixty-four times as much
