dependence to thousands of white men whose lives had been one of
woeful sacrifice to the slave-worked plantation economy, the tragedy of
whose wretched existence has never yet been written, but it was cal-
culated vastly to increase the wealth of the country; for, to a point
not yet reached in the United States, the productiveness of farms rises
exactly as their acreage decreases.
But no sooner had the more enterprising of the southern population
begun to succeed than the tendency to a wider distribution of land
met a counter tendency towards the increase in the size of estates,
doubly augmented by the prosperity of some and the misfortunes of
others. It may be safely asserted that to-day the best type of southern
farmer either owns a large estate, or is paying for tracts recently
added to his plantation, or is expecting to make such additions. He
has set a thousand acres as the goal of his ambition. In many localities
this feeling has grown into such an insatiable land hunger on the part
of wealthy planters as seriously to handicap young farmers who have
not inherited property.
One bulwark protects, but not completely, the country from serious
injury from this tendency: there are so many men with this same
ambition and with the same chances for gratifying it.
The vast majority of southern farmers, 93i^ per cent., are in-
cluded in the three classes of owners, cash tenants and share tenants.
Owners operate 47 per cent, of the whole number of farms; cash
tenants I7I/2 per cent., and share tenants 29% per cent. The desira-
bility of these three classes is in the order of their enumeration, as is
also their wealth-producing capacity, even to a degree beyond what
appears from glancing at the figures. It is the universal rule that
small farms of any given tenure are more productive than large farms ;
so that when we consider that notwithstanding the fact that cash ten-
ant farms are one third larger than share farms and owner-operated
farms are two and one third times larger than share farms, yet the
productivity of owners and of cash tenants exceeds that of share ten-
ants, while that of owners almost equals that of the much smaller
cash-tenanted farms, the relative superiority of the different forms of
tenure is more thoroughly revealed.
