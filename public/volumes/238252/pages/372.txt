and the other, built by the university at an expenditure of $190,000,
containing a large dining hall, will accommodate 80 students.
At the western end of the university tract is the gymnasium ad-
joining the athletic field. This building, costing $150,000, is of the
bold gothic type, with two square towers facing the east. It contains
eight large dressing rooms with showers and lavatories attached, and
will accommodate 2,000 men. The gymnasium hall is 75 feet by 108
feet, with overhead running track.
The large athletic field is provided with a grand stand of solid
concrete 704 feet long, extending the entire length of the south side
of the field, and will seat 7,300 people.
The Washington University Club, on the corner of Twenty-ninth
and Locust Streets, is a splendidly appointed club-house belonging to
the university and managed by a committee composed of the dean, one
alumnus and one student of each department. Membership is open
to all officers, to all male professors and instructors of the university,
and to all male students and graduates of the college, the schools of
engineering and law and the medical and dental departments. The
building is admirably constructed and contains dining-rooms, library,
smoking and reading-rooms, billiard-room and bowling alleys. The
dues are only $5.00 a year, and meals are furnished to students at
$3.50 a week. The club has proved of great value in the social life of
the university, by bringing together on a common ground the students
of all departments, so keeping all the students in touch and helping to
create a true university spirit.
With a large and productive endowment, with an efficient faculty,
with buildings that will compare favorably with any in the country
and with a large enrollment of students in all departments the future
growth and usefulness of the university seem to be assured.
