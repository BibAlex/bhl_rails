With its head in the clouds.
PIKES PEAK.
One of the most famous mountains
in America stands about midway be-
tween Denver and Pueblo. Forty
years ago, it took as many days to
reach it as it now takes hours, so
improved are the transportation facili-
ties. The
NEW YORK CENTRAL LINES
and their connections offer fast and
luxurious trains with only one change
between New York or Boston and im-
portant points in Colorado.
