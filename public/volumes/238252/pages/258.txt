As a rule, not without some exceptions, those counties in the
south which have a large negro poj)ulation are inferior in productive-
ness to those of similar natural quality in which the negro population
is small. The productiveness of the farms of white farmers, north
and south, is, with rare exceptions, greater per cultivated acre than
the productiveness of lands cultivated by negro farmers.* The fairest
basis of comparison is the productiveness of share farmers of the
two races; for in this class practically all the management and all
the labor are done by the farmer and his own family. Not only do the
financial limitations and the small fields of share farmers preclude
them from hiring labor, but whites will not work for negro farmers,
nor will the negro, if he can avoid it, work for the small white farmer,

* Tlie figures of the twelfth census are arranged in such a way as to conceal
the shortcomings of the negro farmer, though there was doubtless no intention
of producing such a result.
t Tlie census tables giving production of farms of various tenures divide
population into white and colored. In some states the number of Chinese
farmers is so great as to make anything more than a mere approximation of
production by negro farmers of various tenures possible; therefore I did not
attempt it, but took the productivity of negro farmers of all tenures as given
in a separate table.
J A large portion of the rich river bottoms are share-farmed to negroes.
