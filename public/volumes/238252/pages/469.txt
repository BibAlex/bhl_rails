HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF VEGETARIANISM. 465
hungry for fish/ having reached that stage when vegetables can no longer
satisfy, and his soul, like those of the Hebrews in the desert, begins to lust after
the flesh-pots. (In the South Seas, Chapter XI,)
How differently the experiences of mankind appeal to different
individuals ! We oppress the living, yet shrink from barbarities
toward the dead; we condemn in others the very practises which at
times have applied to ourselves. Individual bias is so common among
the great masses of people that it is rare to find impersonal judgments
in things ethical or religious. But ideas which claim exemption from
scientific control can never demand recognition by force of argument
alone. There is no short cut to truth except through the gateway
of scientific method. The doctrines of the vegetarians have not es-
caped the attacks of scientific criticism; with what success they have
met, this paper is not intended to proclaim. It has aimed merely to
point out some little known historical aspects of a movement which is
unique, if not progressive. A position so long and stubbornly held
can not be entirely devoid of some resources, and may well offer an
occasional helpful suggestion for the improvement of our plans of nu-
trition. By the physician and hygienist especially is real progress in
dietetics to be welcomed. Qui bene nutruit, optime medehitur.
