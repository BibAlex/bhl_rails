IMPERIAL UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO.
471
The present catalogue shows an enrolment of 3,121 students, and
of these about 350 are post-graduates in the University Hall. Every
student must wear a square cap with golden badge of the university.
And the square caps, as they are called, are entitled to special con-
sideration from the general public. The graduates are termed
Gakushi, to which title is added the prefix of their college, as Ho-
gakushi (law), Bun-gakushi (literature), I-gakushi (medicine), Ri-
gakushi (science), etc.
The title Hakushi, corresponding somewhat with Ph.D., is given
to those who have been in the University Hall (post-graduate) and
passed prescribed examination, or to those who have attained similar
distinction, especially in research.
The commencement usually takes place on July 11. It may be of
interest to describe the ceremony, since it differs somewhat from that
, of American colleges. The large reading hall of the library is simply
decorated; purple and white silk drape the walls, and in the place of
honor hang portraits of the emperor and empress. The room is closely
filled, students standing massed in military order in the middle of the
room, professors and guests standing at the sides. Then the ceremony
commences by the presidents recital of the words of the emperor on
the principles of ethics and on the education of his subjects. Then
follows a brief address by the emperor, or by one of the imperial family.
And after this has been made the emperors gracious presents, about
twenty in all, are given to the best graduates. Then the president
gives an address. The national anthem kimigayo is then sung three
times, followed by the cries of Tokyo-Teikoku Daigaku Banzai. The
entire ceremony is a simple one, but it is notably solemn and impressive.
