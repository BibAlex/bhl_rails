TETRAHEDRAL KITES.

smaller kites, lie would succeed in obtaining a successful form for a
flying machine.
There are two ways in which Mabel II. might be towed — on wheels
along a track or on floats on the surface of a lake. Dr. Bell preferred
to try the second method first, as it is simpler and easier.
With tetrahedral frames he built three long boats and covered them
with oilcloth to make them watertight. The boats possess great
strength, and yet, because of their tetrahedral structure, are so light
as not to overweight the kite.
The three boats were then ranged
parallel to one another and the
whole structure placed upon and
securely fastened to them.
Fig. 15 shows Mabel II., just
before she was launched. Thi^
figure and Figs. 16 and 17 give
an excellent idea of the construc-
tion of the kite. Across the floats
extend two bridges, built of tetra-
hedral cells. Resting on the bridges
are four large kites, like the one
shown in Fig. 8. The spaces be-
tween the four kites are filled with
smaller tetrahedral cells. In all
there are 272 cells in the structure.
Fig, 18 shows the kite fioating
merrily on the water waiting to be
put to the test. With her tiers of
red Avings above and white wings
below she was a beautiful sight.
But would she fly? A small model
of Mabel II., shown in Fig. 13
had flown beautifully on land. The
flying weight of this model was
greater than the flying weight of ]\[abel II., and Dr. Bell had
therefore every reason to believe that Mabel II. would also fly if he
could raise her.
When everything was ready Mabel II. was towed out to the center
of the bay and her flying line cast aboard the steamer which Dr. Bell
had engaged for the experiment. The flying line was made fast to a
cleat on deck and the steamer started ahead at full speed, twelve or
thirteen knots an hour.
But Mabel II. was working under two bad handicaps — first, a
