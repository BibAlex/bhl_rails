RECENT THEORIES IN REGARD TO THE DETERMINA-
TION OF SEX.
By Professor T. H. MORGAN,
BRYN MAWR COLLEGE.
TT was long believed that the sex of the embryo is determined at a
-■- relatively late stage in its development, and therefore it seemed
probable that external factors must decide whether the embryo is to
become a male or a female individual. Many views have been held
as to what these external factors are, and from time to time hopes
have been held out that it might be possible to regulate, by artificial
means, the sex of the developing embryo.
In the last few years opinion has begun to turn in the opposite
direction, and several attempts have been made to prove that the sex
of the embryo is determined in the egg. That this must be the case
in man seemed to be indicated by the fact that identical twins are
always of the same sex. There can be little doubt that such twins come
from the same egg, and the presumption is strongly in favor of the
view that they represent the separated first two cells of the segmenting
egg. These twin embryos are enclosed in the same chorion, which
further indicates that they have come from one egg. The ordinary
twins of man are no more like each other than are any other two
children born at different times. The pair of ordinary twins often
consists of a male and a female. Since the embryos that give rise to
ordinary twins are subjected to practically the same conditions during
their uterine life, and are often, as has been said, a male and a female
in a pair, it follows that in man the external conditions that affect the
egg, after it has left the ovary or after it has been fertilized, do not
determine the sex. A similar and even more remarkable fact is known
