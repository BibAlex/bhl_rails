Fourtli. â€” By the use of the tetrahedral cell it is possible to build
kites unlimited in size and in which, however gigantic the kite, the
ratio of supporting surface to weight remains the same as in a small
kite.
The successive doubling in size of the kite shown in Fig, 3 may be
carried on indefinitely without the weight increasing faster than the
wing surface. The cells all act in harmony; no part of a kite built of
tetrahedral cells has to be strengthened to counterbalance an opposing
force or a weakness in some other part of the kite; no weight is thrown
away.
By his invention of the regular tetrahedral winged cell, Dr. Bell
thus got around the old law which said you can build kites up to a

certain size, but no greater. The adherents of that law have always
admitted that the law might be circumvented if a kite could be com-
bined of many small models, but they have denied or at least doubted
that a working combination of small models effective enough to carry
a man, and to be called a flying machine, could be made. With his
tetrahedral cell Dr. Bell has, however, been able to build kites of
tremendous power, strong enough to carry up several men. One of his
first kites lifted two men off their feet in a squall, and they only
saved themselves from an undesirable ascent by instantly dropping the
rope. Later this same kite (Fig. 4) snapped its rope, a three-eighth-
inch new manila rope, as quickly as a thread. Kites much more power-
