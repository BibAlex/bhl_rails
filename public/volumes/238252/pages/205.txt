I saw Mr. P. make one drawing. His hand on that occasion moved
yery slowly in small circles, not leaving the paper till the drawing had,
^s it were, thickened itself up. He seemed to grow very abstracted
before the close of the performance, but on testing his hand with a
needle, it showed no anesthesia.
It is evident that with a little more system, a little more handwri-
iing, and possibly some speaking under control, this gentleman (whose
narrative seems absolutely sincere) would exemplify a case of medium-
ship of what one might call the Martian type. It would then remind
•one somewhat of the case so admirably studied by Professor Flournoy
in his book From India to the Planet Mars. As the case stands,
it is peculiar only for the monotony and oddity of the designs drawn
by the hand. As in many other cases, we have no means of guessing
why the subject in his drawings follows so peculiar a type. His own
statement that he never saw anything like them before, must be taken
with a grain of salt; for memories which have lapsed entirely from the
upper consciousness of a subject have again and again been proved to
actuate his hand in automatic writing. This case may be one of such
a memory simply developing and confirming its habits. It may
possibly on the other hand be the expression of a secondary person-
ality of some sort, in which (or in whom), if we could make explora-
tion, a systematic context of ideas would be found.
