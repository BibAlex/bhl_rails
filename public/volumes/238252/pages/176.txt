rivers as the Skaguay Eiver, or they may be little brooks, in any case not
frequented by the king salmon, and having no lake in the course,
hence not fit for the red salmon. Their runs are confined to the
ignoble species, which ascend for a short distance only. In the larger
streams to the northward as Skaguay Eiver and Dyea Eiver, the dog
salmon predominates. Southward as in Fish Creek, at Ketchikan
and Anan Creek, the humpback salmon predominates, although the
humpback is equally common in the red salmon streams. Some of
these streams of the third class as Fish Creek flow through lakes.
Presumably these lack fit spawning grounds.
The question as to what constitutes the mouth of the river is one
of some importance in Alaska. The tides run very high, often twenty-
five feet or more, the high tide extending far up the estuaries, which at
low tide may be occupied by fresh water. The Naha Stream at Loring
flows through a series of lakes, the lowermost of which (Eoosevelt
Lagoon) lies close to the estuary of the stream, the water flowing from
the lake over a considerable waterfall at low water. At high tide
this cascade is reversed, the salt water passes by an overfall into the
lake, which is thus converted into a brackish lagoon. It is a well
separated lake at low water, part of the sea at high water.
