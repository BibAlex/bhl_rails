At the outset, there was much uncertainty as to the effect of the
curvature of the earth on the propagation of a Hertzian wave over a
distance of many hundreds of miles. In the case of the Atlantic trans-
mission between the station at Poldhu in Cornwall and that at Cape
Cod in Massachusetts, U. S. A., we have two stations separated by about

45 degrees of longitvide on a great circle, or one eighth part of the cir-
cumference of the world. In this case, the versine of the arc or height
of the sea at the halfway point above the straight line or chord join-
ing the two places is 300 miles.
This question has recently attracted the attention of several eminent
mathematical physicists. The extent to which a free wave propagated
in a medium bends round any object or is diffracted depends on the
relation between the length of the wave and the size of the object.
Thus, for instance, an object the size of an orange held just in front of
the mouth does not perceptibly interfere with the propagation of the
waves produced by the speaking or singing voice, because these are from
two to six feet in length ; but if arrangements are made by means of a
Gallon whistle to produce air waves half an inch in length, then an
obstacle the size of an orange causes a very distinct acoustic shadow.
The same thing is true of waves in the ether. The amount of l)ending
of light waves round material objects is exceedingly small, because the
average length of light waves is about one fifty-thousandth part of an
