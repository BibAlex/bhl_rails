MARINE ZOOLOGY IN THE TROPICAL ATLANTIC. 43
of highest respect when we consider that among them are such inves-
tigators as Barton, H. L. Clark, Conklin, Duerden and Morgan. The
advantages claimed for Jamaica are a healthful climate, the hest of
social conditions, a rich land and fresh-ivater as well as marine fauna
and flora, and the accessibility of the island. The land flora and
fauna of Jamaica are stated on good authority to be the richest of
the Antilles, while the coral reefs and marine fauna, although possibly

not so rich as those of the Tortugas, are said to be remarkably varied.
Unfortunately none of the gentlemen who advocate Jamaica have been
at the Tortugas, and it is therefore impossible for them to make any
direct comparison between the marine faunge of the two places.
The advocates of the Tortugas, Florida, claim that here we find
by far the richest pelagic fauna of the tropical Atlantic which is driven
upon the shores by the prevailing winds from the Gulf Stream.
The Tortugas reefs, while not so rich in corals, are richer in fishes
and invertebrates than are those of the Bahamas and probably of other
West Indian Islands. The nearness of the Pourtales plateau would
give the station an enviable opportunity for deep-sea dredging, while
the remarkable purity of the ocean water surrounding the Tortugas
would provide the laboratory with an almost unique advantage in the
rearing of larvse, and prosecution of physiological work. The Tortu-
