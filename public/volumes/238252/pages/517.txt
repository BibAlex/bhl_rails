A record of the cloudiness was kept not only at Mount Harvard,
but at Arequipa and Pampa Central for some time after our residence
in Chili. The cloudy season at Mount Harvard and Arequipa is in
the southern summer, that of Pampa Central in the southern winter.
By changing from one to the other of these localities one could keep
in a region of clear sky nearly the whole time.

The Temporary Station on Mount Harvard.
As a result of the investigations thus made the director selected
Arequipa for the site of the permanent station, and the equipment on
Mount Harvard was removed to that, city in October, 1890. In
January of the following year Professor W. H. Pickering arrived in
Arequipa, bringing with him the thirteen-inch Boyden telescope and
other smaller instruments. Under his direction a residence for the
astronomer in charge and his family was erected, and two additional
buildings were received from the United States. One of these was de-
signed for a laboratory and the other for the use of the Boyden tele-
scope. During his two years residence in Arequipa, Professor Picker-
ing, assisted by Mr. Douglass, made a large number of observations of
Mars, and of the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, as well as of the
