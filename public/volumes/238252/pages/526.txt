The people of Peru, and especially of Arequipa, have always taken
great interest in the observatory, and have extended to it many favors
and constant good-will. There is a university in the city of Arequipa
which is supported by the Peruvian government. There is no lack
of educated and refined Peruvian society, and in addition there are
American, English and German colonies. The laboring and servant
classes are half-breeds, usually illiterate and careless, but kindly and
contented. Besides these, especially in the interior, are large numbers
of civilized Indians. In the low lands lying about the head waters of
the Amazon are also numerous groups of savages, but they are never
seen near Arequipa, and are slowly becoming half-civilized or dis-
appearing. Revolutions have been numerous in the past history of
Peru, and one occurred since the establishment of the station in
Arequipa, but not the slightest indignity was offered to the observatory
or its members. The common people of Peru, even in time of revo-
lution, are not dangerous, and those who are not actually engaged in
warfare are seldom molested. It is a game of politics, carried on by
bullets instead of ballots, and without permanent hatreds. For several
years past no revolution of importance has occurred, and there are
strong indications that Peru has at last entered on a career of peace
and prosperity. Such, at least, is the earnest wish of her best citizens.
