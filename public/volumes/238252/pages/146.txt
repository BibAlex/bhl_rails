sixty-four, the cells being four times as large. The kite is not as suc-
cessful as the preceding one. Dr. Bells experiments have convinced
him that the small cells are better ; when the wind varies in strength as
in a squall, the shifting of pressure on a small cell is less than the
shifting on a large cell; hence the resultant shifting of pressure on a
kite built of small cells is considerably less than on a kite built of large
cells. Fig. 8 shows the method of attaching five pounds, a piece of
lead in this case; the kite is not disturbed by the weight. The kite

shown in Figs. 9, 10 and 11 is also tetrahedral in form and built of
tetrahedral cells. It is twice as large as the red flier, being four
meters on a side. Fig. 9 gives a side view and Fig. 10 a front view
of the kite as it rests on its keel. The average pull of this kite in light
winds is 80 pounds; in a heavy wind it exceeds 150 pounds.
The strength of the kites made of tetrahedral cells is something
remarkable. I have seen one of these kites towed on a tetrahedral float
for more than a mile on the bay at a speed of eleven or twelve knots
without breaking, though one end was dragging one foot under water
all the time. As I saw the kite pulled along I expected to see it
