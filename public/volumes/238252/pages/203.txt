A CASE OF AUTOMATIC DRAWING.

when it commenced, and often did
not know until finished. Sometimes
a design would be entirely changed.
Small pictures were frequently
produced by a few rapid movements
of the pencil from side to side, the
pencil apparently not being lifted,
yet the features of the face and gen-
eral contour of the subject in hand
would appear plainly. Voluntary
suggestion has little effect on the
drawings. After repeated sugges-
tions I have sometimes been able to
obtain an allegorical picture, as for
instance when I asked for a message
from my son, who resided at a dis-
tance, a carrier pigeon, having a
ribbon around its neck with a letter
attached, was produced.
I have tried hard to account for
the power or directing mind that pro-
duces these pictures, but so far with
no satisfactory result. I must say,
however, that evidence to me is strong
that, in order that the unknown power
should have sway, the natural or
earthly mind must be for the time be-
ing set aside, either entirely, or (what
seems to me more reasonable) the
unknown power is for the time being
the dominant one, but acts in con-
junction with the earthly mind. Al-
though while drawing I feel more or
less drowsy, my senses seem in some
respects to be very keen. To my eyes
the pictures usually appear highly
exaggerated in beauty as well as in dis-
tinctness.
So much is this the case that on the
completion of a picture and having taken
it up to examine it, the distinctness and
beauty which were so apparent while draw-
ing, have departed. Frequently, while draw-
ing, the picture will be illuminated by
delicate colors; and a feeling of great disap-
pointment occurs when, on the completion of
the picture, I find that not only the colors
have disappeared, but the fine points of the
picture also.
One strong feeling is left in my mind
that whatever directs the pencil is all-power-
ful, and that nothing is too difficult for its
performance if it only chooses to assert its
power.
