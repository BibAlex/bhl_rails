rr^HERE are now dawnings of two possible solutions of the problem
-- of aerial navigation; a problem which has impassioned men for
perhaps 4,000 or 5,000 years. Navigable balloons have recently been
developed to what is believed to be nearly the limit of their efficiency,
and after three intelligent but unfortunate attempts by others, a suc-
cessful dynamic flying machine seems to have been produced by the
Messrs. Wright.
It is therefore interesting to review the present status of the ques-
tion, the prospects of its solution and the probable uses of the hoped-
for air-ships.
Balloons.
As to balloons, we may pass over the early gropings and failures to
make them navigable. It was recognized very soon that the spherical
balloon was the sport of the wind, that it was necessary to elongate it
in order to evade the resistance of the air, and that, inasmuch as aerial
currents are much more rapid than aqueous currents, it was necessary
to obtain considerable speeds in order to have a useful air-ship. This
means that there must be great driving power, and that this power
shall weigh as little as possible; for in any case the balloon itself with
its adjuncts and passengers will absorb the greater part of its lifting
power.
Giffard was the first to apply in 1852 an artificial motor to an
elongated balloon. This motor consisted in a steam-engine of three
horse power, which weighed with its appurtenances 462 pounds, and
