chants and a few convicts. The total white immigration for the whole
colonial period was about two hundred thousand.
No census was taken in 1807, but partial enumerations made shortly
before indicate that the population of Brazil was then composed ap-
proximately of 900,000 whites or very light mulattoes; 3,000,000
negroes; 400,000 mulattoes, and 260,000 civilized Indians. In 1808
the mother country was overrun by Napoleons armies, and the Portu-
guese king fled for refuge to Brazil, accompanied by thousands of office-
holders and soldiers and most of the court. Fifteen thousand persons
crowded the ships which carried John VI. out of the Tagus. His first
act on arriving in Brazil was to open its commerce to all the world,
and thenceforward immigration was unrestricted. White arrivals from
1808 to 1817 were 40,000, and those of negroes, 200,000.
The census taken in the latter year gives the white population at
1,043,000; negroes, 2,350,000; mulattoes, 426,500, and Indians, 259,-
500. The whites had constituted only 8 per cent, of the original com-
ponents of the population, but now numbered 28 per cent., while the
negroes had fallen from 74 to 62 per cent, and the Indians from 18 to 7.
In the fifty-five succeeding years until 1872, 813,000 blacks were
imported and 432,000 white immigrants arrived from Europe. The
census taken in the latter year gives the white population as 3,787,289,
and that of negroes as 1,959,452. Therefore the 672,000 whites who
had come to Brazil up to that date had increased 562 per cent., while
the 3,013,000 negroes had decreased to 65 per cent, of their original
numbers. The civilized Indians surviving were only half as numerous
as their ancestors.
In making a calculation of the total proportions of the three races
in the total population of the country there are two uncertain ele-
ments which must be taken into consideration. In the census of 1872,
3,750,000 persons were returned as mulattoes or caboclos (white and
Indian, or negro and Indian), and no data is given as to what pro-
portion of the three bloods entered into the mixture. Some of those
returned as whites were in fact light mulattoes or caboclos. The
latter fact would certainly tend to increase the apparent ratio, and it
is also probable that the proportion of white blood in those returned
as mulattoes is smaller than the proportion of negro and Indian blood.
Personal observations indicate that the non-Caucasian element in those
returned as white is less than one fourth, and that about two thirds
of the ancestors of the mulattoes are negroes or Indian â€” principally
the former. Assuming these ratios in default of statistics on the sub-
ject, the population of Brazil in 1872 was 42 per cent, white, 53 per
cent, negro and 5 per cent. Indian, while the percentages in the original
immigrants were, respectively, 16, 72 and 12.
European immigration from 1872 to 1889 inclusive amounted to
