RECENT DISCOVERIES IN RADIATION. 499
radium is itself a product of the disintegration of some heavier element
which has been undergoing this process of decay since the world began.
Subaiomic Energies.
The energy which would be required to produce such changes from
the simpler to the heavier atoms, and the equivalent energies which are
set free when the heavier atoms disintegrate into simpler ones, are
enormously greater than those involved in the changes which take place
in the constitution of molecules in the ordinary chemical transforma-
tions with which we have thus far been familiar. The disintegration
of a gram of uranium, or thorium, or radium, sets free at least a
million times as much energy as that which is represented in any
known chemical change taking place within a gram weight of any
known compound substance. The experiments of the last eight years
have then marked a remarkable advance in science in that they have
proved the existence of an immense store of subatomic energy. It
seems highly improbable, however, that this energy can ever be util-
ized on the earth to serve mans economic needs, for thus far we
know of but three substances which are disengaging it and these are
changing so slowly that the rate of evolution of energy is almost
infinitesimal. Eadium may possibly prove to be of some practical
value in the cure of disease, although it is too early yet to assert even
this with certainty. But even if no practical application of these dis-
coveries should be found, radio-activity will nevertheless have served
one of the most useful of all ends, namely, that of enlarging mans
knowledge of the ways of nature and of deepening his insight into the
constitution of matter. â–
