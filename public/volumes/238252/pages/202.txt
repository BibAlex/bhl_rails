aim, but finally rude forms of objects were executed.
Gradually my hand moved with more regularity and the pictures pro-
duced became interesting. Among these were dark-skinned savages, animals
and vases of ancient type usually ornamented fantastically with curious faces.

Many times I tried to produce pictures of familiar faces, or scenes familiar

the unknown power. Weird, fantastic pictures were produced in abundance,
many of them artistic in execution, but mostly of ancient type.
Sometimes the face would be so covered with strange devices as scarcely

While drawing these pictures I became drowsy, so much so that after
finishing an artistic one I would sometimes go into an hypnotic sleep, and

My pencil moved sometimes so rapidly as to make it difficult to follow
it with my eye. At other times it moved slowly. Some of the best eflfects
were produced by rapid movements. I never knew what my pencil would make
