THIS is a solitary retired species, always prefer-
ring the thickest parts of the woods to make its
habitation : its beak and legs are black : the under
parts of the body and stripe across the wings white :
the rest of the plumage plain black : the size of
the bird is about that of the Redwing : the female
is less than the male, and is brownish in those
parts where the male is black ; the under parts of
her body are entirely fulvous, the throat, which
is rufous, excepted : the band on the wings is
slightly inclined to that colour. It is abundant over
great part of Africa: the male has a note similar
to the word Boubou, and the female Cou-i: the
latter lays four or five eggs.
