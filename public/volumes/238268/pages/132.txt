is most abundant, and they are fed by them in
the same manner as the European Swallow does
its young: these birds are easily tamed, and soon
become very gentle and familiar, and in the
course of a short time, when confined in a room,
will begin to employ themselves in catching flies,
and will call out to their companions as they pass
by the window. Their song is a sprightly warble,
and is sometimes continued for a length of time.
The Barn Swallows arrive near Philadelphia the
latter end of March, or the beginning of April :
about the middle of August they begin to
assemble and make preparations for departing,
and by the middle of September there is scarcely
a single one to be seen : they are most abundant
to the east of the Alleghany Mountains, and
extend as far north as the river St. Lawrence j and
are observed in great numbers in Florida, during
the months of September and October, passing to
the south. L'Hirondelle a ventre roux of Buffon
has very much the aspect of the female of this
species.
