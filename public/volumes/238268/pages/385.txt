THE beak of this bird is black at the base, yel-
low towards the tip : the irides are blue : the head
is slightly crested, and black : the back, wing-
coverts, and rump, are grey: the quills are black :
the feathers of the throat, neck, breast, and ab-
domen, are long and narrow, and black in colour,
with white shafts ; those of the head are also of
that shape: the tail is of the same colour as the
quills, but its under coverts are white: the legs
and claws are yellow. It is abundant among the
Pagodas of Malabar and Coromandel, where it is
known by the names of Martin Eramc and Fowee :
it is often kept in cages, on account of its song.
