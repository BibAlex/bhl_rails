Siberian Titmouse. Lath. Gen. Syn. 4. 556. 23. A.
CONSIDERED by Dr. Latham as a variety of P.
sibiricus, but it is evidently different, having a
much longer tail, and without any rufous tinge
on either the breast or the bottom of the back ;
neither is the black on the chin and throat so
broad : its beak and legs are black : the upper
parts of the plumage pale cinereous : quills dusky,
with hoary margins : forehead and under parts
white : throat and middle of the breast black.
Native place unknown.
