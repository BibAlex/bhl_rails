HUDSON'S BAY TITMOUSE. o3
webs : rump pale cinereous : upper tail-coverts
dirty white: tail brown, with grey margins: the
two middle feathers cinereous : throat black :
cheeks and all the under parts of the body white :
legs and claws blackish. Native of the United
States of North America; generally observed about
autumn and winter amongst evergreens, on the
seeds of which they feed : about the middle of
April they build their nests in the deserted hole
of a Woodpecker or Squirrel, or digging one out
with great labour : the female lays six white eggs,
sprinkled with red ; the first brood appears about
the beginning of June, and the second towards
the end of July.
The Hudson's Bay Titmouse of Latham is sup-
posed by Wilson to be only the young of this
species, it agreeing tolerably well with the de-
scription, and being found within the limits of
the countries with the Black-capt Titmouse.
