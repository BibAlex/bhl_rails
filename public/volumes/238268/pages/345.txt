CRYING THRUSH. 271
the chin is white : the breast flesh-colour, spotted
with black : the rump, belly, and vent, are rufous
orange : the thighs are ash-coloured : the legs
dusky.
The habits of this species are rather singular :
it assembles in small flocks of six or eight, and
utters a remarkable note, which gives the idea of
a chime of three bells, which is often continued
for hours together : it is not very abundant, and
is found in Cayenne and Guiana, among the
thickest forests : it does not associate with any
other birds of the genus, although it eats the same
food.
