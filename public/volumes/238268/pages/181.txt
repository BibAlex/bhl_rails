a half; and is entirely of deep sooty brown, ex-
cept the chin and supercilia, which are dusky
whitish : beak extremely short, and black : eyes
black, surrounded with a bare blackish skin or
orbit : legs covered with a loose purplish skin ;
thighs naked, and of the same tint : feet extremely
muscular, the three fore toes nearly of a length,
claws very sharp : the wings when closed extend
one inch and a half beyond the tip of the tail,
which is slightly rounded, and consists of ten fea-
thers, scarcely longer than their coverts ; their
shafts extend beyond the vanes, are sharp pointed,
strong, and very elastic, and of a deep black co-
lour : the shafts of the wing-quills are also re-
markably strong : the female can scarcely be dis-
tinguished from the male by her plumage. The
