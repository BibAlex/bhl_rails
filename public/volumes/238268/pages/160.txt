112 ESCULENT SWALLOW.
a drawing of Poivre, who, it is well known, has
delineated many birds that were fictitious, and
the present species may have been in the same
predicament : if there was really such a bird, no
doubt, from the thousands of edible nests that are
procured, it would have occurred since his time ;
but the contrary is the fact.
The nest of this bird is exceedingly curious,
and is composed of such materials that it is not
only edible, but is accounted among the greatest
dainties by the Asiatic epicures. It generally
weighs about half an ounce, and is in shape like a
saucer, with one side flatted, which adheres to the
rock : the texture somewhat resembles isinglass or
fine gum dragon ; and the several layers of which
it is composed are very apparent, it being fabri-
cated from repeated parcels of a soft slimy sub-
stance, in the same manner as the martins form
theirs of mud. Authors differ much as to the
materials of which this nest is composed ; some
imagine it to consist of sea worms of the Mollusca
class ; others of the sea qualm (a species of cuttle-
fish), or a glutinous sea-plant called Agal-agal.
It has also been supposed that the Swallows rob
other birds of their eggs, and, after breaking the
shells, apply the white of them in the composition
of these structures.
The best sorts of nests, which are perfectly free
from dirt, are dissolved in broth, in order to
thicken it, and are said to give it an exquisite
flavour ; or they are soaked in water to soften
them, then pulled to pieces, and, after being
