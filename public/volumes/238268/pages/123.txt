SWALLOW. 83
Mr. Pearson had ; who concludes this interesting
account with the following words. Jan. 20, 1797
I have now in my house, No. 21, Great Newport
Street, Long-Acre, four Swallows in moult, in as
perfect health as any birds ever appeared to be
in when moulting."
The general food of the birds of this genus con-
sists of insects, which they capture while on the
wing ; and from their amazing quick flight must
be endowed with a wonderful keen sight, to enable
them to distinguish such small objects: they usually
have two broods in the year ; some will occasionally
have three : their nests are made of mud, rendered
firm by a mixture of hair, twigs, and such like ma-
terials : they are fond of flying over the surface of
rivers and brooks, and sipping the water, without
staying their flight : many of them warn small
birds of the approach of Hawks and other birds of
prey, by setting up a loud scream. They are found
throughout the whole world.
