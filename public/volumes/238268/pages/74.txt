THIS species is called the Amorous on account
of its disposition, as, when kept in confinement

half an inch in length, and is black at the base,
and orange at the tip : wing with a longitudinal
fascia on the middle, half yellow, half rufous : rest
of the plumage of a dark slate colour, verging on
black.
