THIS greatly resembles the preceding, and is of
the same size, but differs in having the entire
plumage above cinereous, spotted with brown and
white ; the under parts pale grey, and the quills
and tail tipped with white : its beak, irides, and
legs, are brown : it inhabits Chili, and its nest is
cylindrical, armed on the outside with thorns, and
lined with wool and feathers within ; the entrance
is on one side: its eggs are white, with brown
spots.
