76 WHITE-COLLARED SWIFT.
HEAD and beak black : upper parts of the body
black, with a violet tinge : greater wing-coverts,
nearest the body, brown, margined with white :
quills black : chin and throat white, which colour
passes round the neck, and forms a collar : between
the beak and eye is a divaricating white streak, part
of which goes above and part beneath the eye :
sides of the lower belly and top of the thighs
white : tail black and forked : legs black : length
five inches and a half.
This species builds its nest in the shape of a
large truncated cone : it is composed of the down
of the dogs-bane, well twisted together ; and is
divided into two chambers by a partition running
obliquely down the middle, and spreading over
that part of the nest where the eggs are situated ;
there is also a sort of plug made of the same down
as the nest, to fill up the entrance so as to exclude
the atmospheric air : it is said to build this singu-
lar nest in the houses at Cayenne, where the bird
is found.
