THIS is the size of the preceding, and is sup-
posed by many to be the female of that species;
but it appears to differ too materially for that to
be the case : the crown of the head and nape of
the neck are fine blue grey: the chin and fore-
part of the neck and breast black : ears with a
white patch : lower part of the neck, back, wings,
and tail, pale green : belly, thighs, and vent,
yellow: length seven inches and a half: beak and
legs black. Inhabits New South Wales.
