166 POPETUE GOATSUCKER.
the female is destitute : in other respects the sexes
are similar.
This species inhabits the whole of the United
States : it makes its appearance in Pensylvania
the last week in April : about the middle of May
the female lays her eggs, which are two in num-
ber, in a dry place on the bare ground, generally
where the country is open : both ends of the
eggs are nearly the same in shape; they are dirty
blueish black, with dark brown spots : the male
is very attentive to the female during incubation,
and guards her very carefully, and if any one
approaches he flies off in an opposite direction,
and utters a loud scream : the favourite time of
these birds for making their appearance is in the
evening (but during gloomy weather they are seen
at all times of the day), when they are all life and
activity : even in the hottest and clearest weather
they may be observed basking themselves in the
sun : they are very fond of perching lengthwise
on the branches of trees : they feed on large
insects : in August they are seen by hundreds
moving towards the south.
