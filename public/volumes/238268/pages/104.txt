66 PENDULINE TITMOUSE.
This species has a very singular flight, frequently
folding up its wings : it is very abundant in many
parts of the United States of America : it builds
its nest in hollow trees early in May, laying six
pure white eggs, sprinkled with extremely small
red spots, near the larger end : it generally feeds
on insects, but when captured and confined in a
cage it will eat hemp-seed, cherry-stones, apple-
seeds, and similar substances, if broken in small
pieces : it soon becomes very familiar, but if placed
in a wooden cage soon effects its escape.
