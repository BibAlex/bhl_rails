154 VIRGINIAN GOATSUCKER.
neck, a few orange spots ; beneath the eyes grey
brown : chin of the male with a triangular white
spot, varied with orange on the lower parts : under
parts of the body reddish white, barred with dusky:
tail similar to the wings ; the two outer feathers
with a white spot near the end : legs flesh-colour :
female with a rufous white spot on the chin, and
without the white on the quills and tail-feathers.
This species of Goatsucker, which is known in
the United States of America by the name of .
Whip-poor -will, arrives in Virginia about the latter
end of April : it does not make a nest ; but la^s
its eggs, which are two in number, and not much
unlike those of the Popetue Goatsucker, except
in being rather darker in colour, on the bare
ground in May: its food consists of the larger
moths, grasshoppers, and such-like insects, which
it does not always catch while on the wing, but
will frequently sit upon a post or rail, and leap
up after them, as they fly by : it begins its note,
from whence its American name is taken, about
sunset, and continues it nearly till sunrise, with-
out intermission ; and very often five or six may
be heard at once : it is said to be very good for
food : it departs in September towards the south.
