with yellow: the feathers of the head and neck are
similar in shape to those of the Pagoda Thrush, and
are of an ash-coloured grey, with the shafts white:
the upper parts of the body are cinereous grey :
quills black : the under parts of the body rufous
brown : tail greyish ash : legs yellow. Inhabits
Malabar ; and, like the preceding, is kept in
cages, and bears the name of Powee. As it only
differs in wanting a crest, and in having the head
of the same colour as the body, may it not be merely
a variety, or young bird ?
