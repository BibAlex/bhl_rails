the rest of the upper parts, the belly, vent, and
tail, are black : the feathers on the back and wings

those parts a pretty undulated appearance ; these
markings are fainter on the throat than on the
other parts, and not the least appearance of the

with a mixture of white, the latter with brown :
the legs and toes black." The above was com-
