THE length of this species is upwards of twenty-
six inches : its beak is black, and it has a groove
in the upper mandible, into which the lower one
fits when shut : the plumage is similar to that of
the European Goatsucker, and is composed of a
mixture of biack, brown, rufous, and white : its
tail is much forked, and is extremely long in pro-
portion to the size of the bird: its legs are yellow.
Le Vaillant discovered this species in a decayed
hollow tree, which had fallen by the borders of
the river of Lions, in the Great Namaqua, in the
interior of the Cape of Good Hope : its note is
very similar to that of the European species.
