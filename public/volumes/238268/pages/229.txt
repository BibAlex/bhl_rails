RATHER larger than C. Europaeus, which it
somewhat resembles, except in having a single
feather springing out of the middle part of the
wing-coverts on each side, which is in length
about twenty inches : it is only webbed at the
tip for about five inches of its length ; this part is
very similar to the rest of the plumage in colour,
and is crossed with five dusky bars : the web on
the inside is more than one inch in breadth, but
on the outside not more than one quarter of an
inch : the rest of the feather towards the base for
about fourteen inches has only a few solitary
hairs towards the tip on the inside : the legs are
very small. Inhabits Sierra Leona.
