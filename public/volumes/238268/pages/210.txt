152 BANDED GOATSUCKER.
Pigeon : in the evening this bird begins to utter
its note, which is similar to the words chuck-wills-
widow, and is continued for two or three hours ;
it then remains silent till near day-break, when it
again commences till the sun has risen ; the last
syllable is pronounced the strongest : during the
day it is silent: in September it departs: it is
greatly troubled with vermin. Pennant has figured
this species, but has not described it.
