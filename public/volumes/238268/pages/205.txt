EUROPEAN GOATSUCKER. 147
summer visitant, appearing about the middle of
May, and retiring the latter end of September or
beginning of October *. In common with its
kind, it is fond of perching lengthwise on. the
branch of a tree: it likewise does not make a
nest, but lays two oblong oval eggs, of a whitish
colour, and elegantly marbled with light brown
and cinereous, on the bare ground among fern,
heath, or long grass, generally near some wood,
where it conceals itself during the day; and it has
been observed to shift its eggs to a more secure
place when they have been disturbed.
This species makes a most singular noise,
which has been compared to that of a large spin-
ning wheel, and which it has been observed to
utter while perched with its head lowermost, and
has on that account been called the wheel bird :
it has also a plaintive note or squeak, which it
emits during flight, and is supposed to be a call to
its female, as it has been remarked to utter it
when in pursuit of her. The food of this bird
consists of the larger insects, such as Melolontha
vulgaris, and solstitialis, and the large bodied
lepidopterous insects, for Latham mentions having
taken six of the former and four or five of the
latter out of the stomach of one on dissection : its
large gaping mouth appears to be well calculated
to capture these insects, few of which ever escape
it. It lives in woods, and comes out of a morning
and evening in search of food, retiring in the day
* One was observed by Montagu as late as the 8th of Novem-
ber, 1805, in Devonshire.
