JL HE birds of this genus are readily distinguished
by their immense wide gape, which in many of
the species reaches beyond the eyes : they do not
build a nest, but lay their eggs, which are gene-
rally two in number, on the bare ground ; neither
are they ever seen in society, but appear to be all
of a solitary disposition : their food consists of
large insects, which their wide mouth is well cal-
culated to entrap, and most of them take their prey
flying: there is but one species found on the
European continent, and the greater part of them
are natives of America.
