COMMON SWIFT. 73
lays only two white, oblong eggs ; and during the
period of incubation, the male is continually flying
backwards and forwards, uttering a loud scream-
ing note, which is all it possesses : it is supposed
to return to the same nest, year after year: it
feeds on flies and other winged insects ; and as it
is apt to catch at any thing during flight, it may
be easily caught by tying an insect to a thread,
and letting it fly, when the Swift will most proba-
bly dart at and swallow it. Buffon observes, that
the boys in the isle of Zante will take five or six
dozen in a day, by getting on an elevated place,
and throwing up a hook baited with a feather.
In very warm or sultry weather these birds re-
tire to their holes during the day, but in the morn-
ings and evenings they assemble together, and
play about amongst the most elevated trees or
towers in the neighbourhood, with the most varied
and amusing flight, uttering their screaming noise,
which most persons are not displeased with, as it
takes place only in the most serene settled weather:
at other times they are almost continually on
wing, even remaining so above eighteen hours;
but if they should accidentally fall upon a piece of
level ground, they experience great difficulty in
rising, owing to the shortness of their legs, and
the great length of their wings.
They are said to inhabit the greater part of the
old continent, even as far as the Cape of Good
Hope, and the most remote parts of Asia; but are
not found in any part of North America: travellers
who have mentioned its being observed there,
having mistaken the Purple Swallow for this bird.
