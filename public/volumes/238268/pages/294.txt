228 RING THRUSH.
with broad grey margins : legs dusky brown." The
female differs in having the white on the breast
less conspicuous, and in some it is almost wanting,
which most probably marks the young state : there
are several varieties of this bird ; some quite white,
others spotted with white, and another spotted
with white, but without the crescent on the breast.
This species of Thrush is migratory, and is
found throughout the greatest part of Europe,
Asia, and Africa ; in this country it is very abun-
dant in the isle of Portland every spring and au-
tumn, upon their arrival and departure, although
they cannot be said to be common : they breed
in Wales, and other mountainous parts of Britain
and Ireland, on Dartmore in Devonshire, and
near the Land's-end in Cornwall : its nest is ge-
nerally placed on the ground, under some small
bush ; it is formed like that of a Blackbird ; and
the eggs in number, size, and colour, are very
like that bird's: during the breeding season it
is a rare occurrence to observe a second pair
in the neighbourhood : they are very clamorous
if they be disturbed, when they have young : their
food consists of snails, insects, and berries, parti-
cularly those of the juniper : when fat they are said
to be excellent food. The young has been called
the Rock Ouzel.
