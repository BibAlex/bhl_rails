GREAT TITMOUSE. 37
conquer a bird they always pierce a hole in the
skull and eat the brains, which they will also do,
if they find one that has recently died : they are
very partial to flesh, particularly fat, which they
eat with the greatest avidity: their principal food
consists of insects, which they obtain in the spring
by biting oft" the opening buds*, and in the summer
by searching in cracks and crevices of trees.
These birds are found over all parts of the old
world, and many of them throughout the Ame-
rican continent and West-Indian islands ; also in
New Zealand, and other islands in the Pacific
Ocean.
