THE description of this bird in the Supplement
to the Ornithological Dictionary appears to be the
most correct of any I have seen, therefore I shall
transcribe it as it is there written : " It weighs full
four ounces, and is eleven inches in length : the
beak is partly orange yellow, especially the under
mandible all but the tip ; the point and the base
of the upper mandible more dusky: irides dark
hazel : the whole upper part of the bird is black,
with scarcely any grey on the margins of the fea-
thers: tail also black: the quills and wing-coverts
dusky, more or less bordered with pale grey, most
so on the secondaries, .and their larger coverts:
the under parts black, with cinereous edges to
the feathers on the body and under tail-coverts:
gorget pure white : under wing-coverts pale brown,
