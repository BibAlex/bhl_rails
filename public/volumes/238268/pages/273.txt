Thrush are of a grey brown, changing to dusky
black on the wing-coverts and quills : the primaries
are darker than the secondaries, which, as well as
the coverts, are edged with ash-colour : the tail is
similar to the wings in colour, and is tipped with
white for about an inch on the outer feathers, the
next on each side less, and the rest marked with

the under parts of the body are whitish grey : the
beak and legs are black : its length is about eight
inches and a half. Inhabits Guiana,
