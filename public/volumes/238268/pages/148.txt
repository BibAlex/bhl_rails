THE Sand or Bank Martin is near five inches
in length : its beak is dusky : irides hazel : super-
cilia whitish : head, neck, breast, and back, mouse-
coloured brown : wings the same, with their in-
terior feathers singularly notched at the tip :
throat, fore-part of the neck, belly, and vent,
white; tail brown; the outer feather slightly mar-
gined with white : legs dusky, slightly feathered
behind.
This species is common to Europe and Ame-
rica, arriving in this country first of the Swallow
tribe: it is the scarcest and most local with us,
but is extremely abundant in America : its nest
is placed on the high sand-bank of a river, quarry,
or gravel-pit, at a few feet from the surface, and
