CYPSELUS. SWIFT.
Generic Character.
Rostrum basi glabrura, et ti i- !
angular!, versus apicem an-
gustatum, utrinque cora-
pressum ; mandibula infe-
riore apicem recurvata.
Rictus capite amplior.
Pedes simplices, digitis om-
nibus anticis ad imumfissis.
Beak smooth, and triangular
at the base, narrow towards
the tip, and compressed on
both sides ; the upper man-
dible recurved at the point.
Gape very wide.
Feet simple, with all the toes
divided from their origin,
and placed forwards.
JL HE birds comprised in this genus are remark-
able for the shortness of their legs, which are co-
vered with feathers to the toes ; and likewise for
having all the latter placed forwards, and composed
of two phalanges only, which enables them to ad-
here very firmly to the perpendicular sides of walls,
and such like places, which they frequent : they
feed on insects, which they take during flight, not
settling on the ground to collect them, like many
birds, from the great difficulty they have in rising.
They are found throughout both continents.
