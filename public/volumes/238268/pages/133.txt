RED-FRONTED SWALLOW. 91
FIGURED in plate 4. of 1'Histoire Naturelle
d'^Egypt, by Mons. Savigny, but the letter-press
not having made its appearance in this country,
I have named it after that celebrated naturalist :
by the figure, it seems to have all the upper parts,
and a band on the breast, of a beautiful blue ; with
the forehead, throat, cheeks, abdomen, vent, and
under tail-coverts bright fulvous ; quills dark fus-
cous ; tail with the outer feathers very much elon-
gated, and forked. Native of Egypt.
RED-FRONTED SWALLOW.

THIS species has the beak and feet black : the
head, back of the neck, shoulders, wings, back,
tail, and its upper coverts, with the throat and
breast, of a shining blue-black : the under parts of
the body, from the breast to the tail-coverts, of
a pure white : the forehead red : eyes brown : the
tail of the male is very much forked, of the female
not quite so much; in other respects she resembles
the male. Inhabits the southern parts of Africa,
arriving at the Cape of Good Hope in the spring,
and retiring northward in the autumn.
