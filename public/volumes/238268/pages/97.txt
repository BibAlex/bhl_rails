T-OXG-TAILED TITMOUSE. 61
at the side as an entrance : the outside is com-
posed of moss, wool, and dry grass, curiously and
firmly woven together with wool, and lined with
an immense quantity of feathers : it takes four or
five weeks to complete its habitation. The female
lays about a dozen eggs at one brood, and not, as
is generally] supposed, upwards of twenty: they
weigh about twelve grains ; are white, sprinkled
with rust-coloured spots at the larger end.
This bird is found in Italy and the northern
countries of Europe, and frequents low situations,
especially where the trees are covered with moss
and lichen : it is very common in orchards and
gardens, injuring the trees in the same manner
as the rest of the genus, by plucking off the buds
to search for insects; it flies very swiftly, and from
its slender shape it seems like a dart flying through
the air : it is an active, restless creature, running
up and down the branches of trees with the great-
est facility, and flying backwards and forwards.
In the spring it is said to sing very prettily, though
at other times it has but a shrill call. The young
birds remain with the parents during the winter,
and in the night they assemble and go to rest on a
branch of a tree, and are huddled together so close
as to appear like a ball of down : many small birds
are observed to do the same.
