THIS species of Swallow is remarkable for hav-
ing a crest, which is similar in appearance to that
of the Crested Lark ; it consists of five or six
feathers, which are of the same colour as the rest
of the head: the upper parts of the body are of a
shining grey colour ; the wings and tail are dark-
est, and shine with a blue gloss in some positions:
the throat, front of the neck, and upper part of
the breast, are of the same colour as the upper
parts of the body, but variegated with whitish :
the lower part of the breast, the sides, abdomen,
and under tail-coverts, are greyish white : the
feet and beak are lead-coloured : the eyes are
brown.
