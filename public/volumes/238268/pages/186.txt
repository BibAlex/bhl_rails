THIS bird has a very great affinity to the follow-
ing, but it wants the needle-shaped processes at
the tips of the tail-feathers : it is of the same size:
the prevailing colour is dusky brown, but without
any tinge of green on the wings and tail : the
throat and rump are blueish white. Inhabits
New Holland.
