THIS bird is said to inhabit India by Dr. Latham,
who thus commemorates it. " Beak dusky :
cheeks white : crown, hind parts of the neck, and
back, brown, marked with curved black spots :
lesser wing-coverts black, chequered with white :
outmost primary black ; the rest of them rusty
brown, tipped with ash : fore-part of the neck,
breast, and belly, white, barred with curved black
marks : tail dusky : legs yellowish : in India it is
called Cowal, from its note imitating that word:
gorges fruit till torpid, and after a time flings up
the stones."
