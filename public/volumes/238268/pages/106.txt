THIS species is almost as remarkable as the
preceding in respect to its nest, which is fixed on
a forked twig of the poplar, and is composed of
the downy parts of the flower of that tree : it is
only open on one side, and there is a kind of por-
tico erected over the entrance, as a security from
the wind and weather, which projects nearly an
inch from the sides : the nest is about the size and
shape of an Ostrich's egg. The bird is found in
Languedoc : it is four inches in length : the beak
is black, the upper mandible edged with yellow-
ish : top of the head grey: upper parts of the body
rufous grey : upper wing-coverts blackish, edged
with rufous : greater quills blackish, with whitish
edges : secondaries the same as the upper coverts,
but the tips paler : under parts of the body pale
rufous grey : tail black, with rufous edges : legs
lead-colour.
