THIS beautiful species, which is supposed to
inhabit China, is given on the authority of Dr.
Latham, who thus describes it : " Length nine
inches : beak dusky : irides brown : head, chin,
and nape, white : at the base of the beak begins a
yellowish streak, which passes beneath and takes
in the eye, but does not appear above it: the
neck is black : the upper part of the back and
scapulars ferruginous brown ; the lower of a dusky
black, inclining to ferruginous on the rump :
under parts of the body brown, except the breast
and thighs, which are yellowish: all the quills are
black, but the secondaries have white tips: tail
cuneiform, of a deep lead-colour, almost black :
legs dusky."
