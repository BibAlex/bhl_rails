Tuneful Manakin. Lath. Gen. Syn. 4. 534. 25.
THIS active and agreeable bird is in length four
inches: beak dusky: forehead yellow : crown and
nape blue : upper part of the back, wings, and
tail, dusky black : lower part of the back and
rump orange : chin, cheeks, and throat black :
breast, belly, vent, and thighs orange : legs dusky.
The song of this bird is said to be the complete
octave, which it repeats for a considerable length
of time together note after note successively. It
is common in St. Domingo, and like the Wood-
peckers and Creepers, it shifts itself round the
branches of the trees with such rapidity that it is
not easily shot.
