COMMON SWALLOW. 87
and within a day or two of retiring they assemble in
vast flocks on house-tops, the leads of churches,and
on trees, especially by the water side, which latter
circumstance may have induced many persons to
think they went into the water : many of them are
observed to stay behind for some time after the
general flight, but they are only the young and
weak birds, that are incapable of undertaking the
journey at that time ; but most probably the few
that are obliged to remain behind perish in the
ensuing winter through a want of food.
They generally make their first appearance in
the early part of April, and occasionally thousands
die for want of food, should the weather prove
cold after their arrival. It has been observed by
Colonel Montagu, that all the Swallows in his neigh-
bourhood disappeared of a sudden, in the month
of April, when the thermometer was at 4'2 ; but
in a day or two he discovered them collected to-
gether by hundreds in a valley, close to the sea-
side, near a large sheltered pool.
This species is sometimes found entirely of a
snowy white colour, and is described by Brisson
as distinct on that account.
