throat and lower part of the breast yellowish:
from the lower part of the eye, passing beneath
the throat, is a black line : under parts of the
neck, and upper parts of the breast, rufous brown :
under wing-coverts bright rust-colour and black :
feathers of the sides rust-coloured : tail greatly
forked, and tipped with grey on the inner webs,
the outer web of the exterior feathers white : legs
and feet rufous brown : claws dusky.
The variety called the Collared Pratincole, by
Dr. Latham, is rather less, and has the forehead
black, with a white spot on each side near the
eye ; the throat and fore-part of the neck white,
surrounded with a brown collar or line : rest of
the under parts whitish. The Maldivian variety
differs in having the throat white surrounded with
a band, and all the feathers spotted with black on
their shafts. The next, called the Coromandel
Pratincole, is rather paler than either of the pre-
ceding on the upper parts ; the throat is rufous
brown, with a black collar ; the feathers at the
base of the tail are whitish, and at their tips
brown, with a dirty grey spot at the apex ; breast
rufous white. The last distinct variety has the
top of the head deep brown ; the neck, back, and
wing-coverts dirty rufous grey ; quills brown ;
two middle tail-feathers the same, all the rest
tipped with white, and the outer ones white half
way from the base : breast and belly pale brown.

of the old continent, and is most abundant in the
