THE length of this bird is six inches : breadth
nine and a half: the upper parts of a plain dark
olive : over the eye a white streak, which is con-
tinued some way down on the sides of the neck :
lower parts white, tinged with yellow ; the whole
breast and sides marked with pointed spots of
black or deep brown : beak dusky brown : legs
flesh-coloured, but occasionally yellow: both sexes
are similar.
This species is extremely fond of frequenting
marshy places, and is generally found in the
neighbourhood of a brook or rivulet in the thick
woods of North America : it is not known where
it breeds, being only seen in Pensylvania in the
beginning of May and the latter end of August,
for a few days together, in its passage from north
to south, and on its return.
