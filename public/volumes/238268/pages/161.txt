pelago ; but are nowhere so abundant as about
Croee, near the south end of the island of Su-
matra. The best kind sell in China at from one
thousand to fifteen hundred dollars the peckul
(about twenty-five pounds); the black and dirty ones
for only twenty dollars. It is said that the Dutch
alone export from Batavia one thousand peckuls
of these nests every year, which are brought from
the islands of Cochin-China, and those lying east
of them.
The following description of these birds and
their nests is given by Sir George Staunton, in his
account of the Embassy to China. " In the

a number of those bird's nests so much prized by
the Chinese epicures. They seem to be com-

transparent viscous matter, not unlike what is left
by the foam of the sea upon stones alternately
covered by the tide, or those gelatinous animal
substances found floating on every coast. The

cavern, mostly in rows, without any break or in-
