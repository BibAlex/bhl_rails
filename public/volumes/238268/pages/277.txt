different stages of moulting, or, perhaps, age of
the bird: its most general appearance is as fol-

head and neck, the shoulders, and the upper parts

wing-coverts tipped with white: tail-feathers dusky

spotted with brown ; the white on the wings dirty ;
the wing-coverts, scapulars, and back, reddish ;
the feet and beak brown.
