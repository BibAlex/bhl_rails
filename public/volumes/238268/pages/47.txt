Crimson-throated Manakin. Lath. Syn. Sup, II. 254. 8.
THIS species is a native of Huaheine : it has
the upper parts of the plumage blueish black :
chin, throat, fore-parts of the neck, and vent,
crimson : belly white : legs dusky : beak pale.
This bird appears at first sight to be allied to
the Crimson-vented Manakin, but upon a more
accurate examination the dissimilarity is very evi-
dent, not only in colour, but its inhabiting a dif-
ferent country.
