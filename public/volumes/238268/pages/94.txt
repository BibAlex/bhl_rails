58 COLE TITMOUSE.
beak dusky : irides hazel : crown of the head
glossy black, with a white spot dividing it behind:
cheeks white : throat and under side of the neck
black : breast and belly of a yellowish white ; the
sides more yellow : quills, back, rump, and tail,
of a blueish grey colour ; on the rump inclining to
buff: smaller wing-coverts and secondaries tipped
with white : legs and claws lead-colour.
This is abundant in most parts of England,
frequenting woods and gardens, but chiefly the
former : it lives entirely on insects, and does not
seem to be fond of flesh or grain, like many of the
species : its nest is placed in a hole in a tree or
wall; it is constructed of moss and wool, and lined
with hair : its eggs are six or seven in number,
white, spotted with rusty red, very similar to those
of the preceding species, but the spots are more
numerous.
Dr. Latham appears to doubt whether this and
the Marsh Titmouse be distinct ; but they differ
so essentially, that we must consider them dis-
tinct : this species is much smaller j has the head
of a glossy black ; but the white spot behind the
head is never found in the other ; neither has it
any white on the wing-coverts, which is always to
be met with in this, even in young birds.
