O PERUVIAN MANAKIN.
South America in rocky situations, and builds its
nest, in dark sequestered recesses, of dry bits of
stick, laying two round white eggs : it is a shy
bird. The female is said by Salerne to assume
the plumage of the male in the ensuing moult
after having ceased to lay, in the same manner as
many of the gallinaceous kinds are known to do :
both sexes are said to be a year before they arrive
at their full plumage.

THIS species is rather larger than the preceding,
which it very much resembles : its head is crested,
but the crest is not so well defined : its prevailing
colour has more inclination to red: secondary
wing-coverts, and rump, cinereous : wings and tail
black 5 the upper coverts of the latter not trun-
cated at the tips, and of the former not fringed :
in other respects it agrees with it.
According to Buffon, it is a native of Peru.
