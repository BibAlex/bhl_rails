end of February this species arrives in Georgia

brambles, where it perches and utters its cry,
which is precisely like that of a young kitten : it
is extremely numerous in the United States, but
is much hated by the inhabitants : it is very fond
of ripe fruit of all sorts, especially strawberries
and cherries : its nest is made of dry leaves,
weeds, twigs, and dry grass, well lined with
fibrous roots: its eggs are of an unspotted green
blue, and are four or five in number : it has gene-
rally two and often three broods in the year.
