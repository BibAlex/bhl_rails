it frequents mountainous and rocky places, and is
always seen alone, except in the breeding season,
and even then no more than a pair are seen in
the neighbourhood, from whence it has received
the name of solitary. Like the Starling, it pre-
pares its nest in old ruined edifices, church towers,
and other similar places, and lays five or six eggs:
the young are readily reared, and have a beauti-
ful song when they grow up, which they will utter
at candle-light, for which the natives of the Archi-
pelago esteem it so much as to think it sacrilege
to take the nest, or kill the bird.
Its food consists principally of insects, grapes,
and other fruit: it is said to be common in France,
Italy, and the islands of the Mediterranean and
Archipelago ; and is observed to change its abode
with the seasons, coming into those parts where it
usually breeds in April, and departing in August.
