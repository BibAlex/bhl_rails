THIS is in length ten inches : the prevailing
colour of its plumage is brown, with a beautiful
dull green reflection : the wings reach to about
the middle of the tail : the belly and rump are
white.
Inhabits the Cape of Good Hope, where it is
known by the name of Spreuw : it is a shy bird :
it makes its nest in holes on the borders of rivers,
or in old ruined buildings and hollow trees : its
eggs are greenish, spotted with brown, and are
five or six in number: it feeds principally on in-
sects, but will do great damage to vineyards by
feeding on the ripe grapes, by which their flesh
becomes extremely delicate.
