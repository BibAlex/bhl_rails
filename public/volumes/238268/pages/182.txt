130 ACULEATED SWALLOW.
appear to be merely the young in their immature
plumage : one has the throat and fore-part of the
neck dirty white, spotted with greenish brown :
the other is blueish brown ; has the rump grey,
and the throat and fore-part of the neck rufous
grey.
This species arrives in Pennsylvania late in
April or early in May, and builds its nest in high
chimneys that are seldom used ; but in those parts
of America that are inhabited with Indians, and
where there are no chimneys, they construct it in
hollow trees : it is of a singular construction, and is
formed of very small twigs, fastened together with
a strong adhesive gummy substance, which is said
to be secreted by two glands, situated on each side
of the hinder part of the head, and to be mixed
with the saliva*. With this substance, which be-
comes as hard as the twigs themselves, the whole
nest, which is small and shallow, is thickly covered:
it is attached by one side or edge to the wall, and
is totally destitute of the soft lining with which
those of the other Swallows are so plentifully sup-
plied : its eggs are four in number, and of a pure
white : it has two broods in the season. The
young are fed at intervals during the night : and
the nest is frequently detached from the sides of
the chimney, by the heavy rains, and is preci-
pitated to the bottom : the eggs, if there be any,
are destroyed ; but if there be young, they will
scramble up to the upper part, by clinging to the
Wilson's American Ornithology, vol. 5, page 64.
