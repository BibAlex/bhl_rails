BLACK AND WHITE SWALLOW. 105
often extends two or three feet in a horizontal
direction : several of these holes are often within
a few inches of each other, and extend for a con-
siderable distance : at the extremity of this hole
its nest is placed; it is composed of fine dry grass,
lined with a few downy feathers, on which the
eggs, which are pure white and very transparent,
are placed; they are mostly five in number : the
young are hatched late in May: it occasionally
has two broods in the season, and will not always
take the pains to make a hole for its nest, but will
sometimes lay its eggs in a cavity of a quarry, or
a hole in a tree.
The manners of this species are similar to those
of the common Martin, with which bird it often
associates, and flies over the water in pursuit of
insects : it has a low muttering voice. In some
parts of America they are so numerous amongst
the quarries and sand-banks as to appear like
swarms of bees round their hives.
