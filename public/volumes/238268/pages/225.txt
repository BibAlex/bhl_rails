JPOPETUE GOATSUCKER. 1 65
Virginian Goatsucker, to which it has not the
least affinity, and from which it differs mate-
rially : in the first place this species has no bristles
on the edges of the upper mandible, which most
of the species possess ; and in the next place the
tail is greatly forked, whereas in the Virginian
species it is rounded. Edwards, in his sixty-third
plate, has given a tolerably correct figure of the
bird, but he has ornamented its gape with bristles:
Pennant has described it after him, but has figured
the short-winged Goatsucker, or Chuck-wilis-widow,
instead of this bird. Vieillot and Wilson have
described and figured it as distinct, by which they
have given an example of their accuracy. The
former of those authors thus describes it : the
beak is black; the upper parts of the head and
shoulders brown black, spotted with white and
reddish ; which colours are repeated on the upper
wing-coverts, the secondary wing- quills, and the
middle feathers of the tail, which are likewise
spotted with pale cream-colour: the primary quills
are entirely black, with the exception of the third,
fourth, and fifth, which have a large white spot
towards the middle, and which appears to be
transparent when the bird has got to a certain
elevation : on the breast and under parts of the
body the colours are placed transversely : the
lateral tail-feathers are black, barred with reddish
white : the tail itself is forked : the feet are
brown : it is in length eight inches and three
quarters: the male has a white spot on the throat,
and likewise on most of the tail-feathers, of which
