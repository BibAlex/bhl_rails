BLUE TITMOUSE. 41
THIS elegant little bird is in length four inches
and a half: its beak is dusky: irides dark hazel:
forehead and cheeks white ; that on the former in-

of the head (which is of a clear blue) ; behind
this there is a circle of blue, surrounding the head,
and joining at the base of the under mandible,
where it is nearly black : from the beak, through
the eyes, is a narrow black line : the back is yel-

wing-coverts blue, edged with white : under parts
of the body yellow : tail blue, the two middle
feathers longest : female rather smaller than the
male, has less blue on the head, and the colours
in general are not so bright.

of insects, and their larvae that are lodged within ;
but whether it does more harm than good has
never been correctly ascertained : it is fond of
flesh of any description, either fresh or putrid,
and will attack birds smaller than itself, and eat

beak till it breaks the shell : the nest is made in
the hollows of trees, of moss lined with feathers
and hair : the female lays seven or eight eggs,
white, speckled with rust colour; she is very tena-

taken rather than quit it ; and upon that occasion
will hiss like a snake, 'erect all her feathers, and
