80 SWALLOW.
If these birds were to remain torpid in the
winter, would there not be annual proofs of it in
almost every county ? Whereas we have but few
accounts of their being taken in that state, and
innumerable narrations from mariners and others
who have observed them to settle on their ships,
whilst out at sea : and would not they appear
much earlier in forward years than in backward,
and vice versa? The contrary appears to be
the case ; Mr. Forster observes, that he has seen
them as early as the second of April, when the
thermometer was below the freezing point ; and
at other times, when there has been a fortnight of
mild weather in the same month, not a single
Swallow has made its appearance.
It is the opinion of most modern naturalists
that the generality of these birds migrate, but
that a few may occasionally remain behind, from
being too weak to undertake the journey. The
various species do not appear or disappear at the
same time. The Sand Martin generally arrives
first, about a week after the Chimney Swallow is
seen, and in a few days the House Martin makes
its appearance.
It is a singular fact, that Swallows and other
migrative birds always return to the same places
they left in the autumn, which has been proved
by many experiments, particularly by Frisch, who
tied threads round their legs, stained with water
colours, for the purpose of ascertaining whether
they went under water during the winter, and in
the ensuing spring, upon taking some of the
Swallows that were in the vicinity of his house,
