f. 2. male.
THE velocity with which this species flies is
wonderful, going, according to Le Vaillant, at the
rate of one hundred toises in the space of five se-
conds; which rapidity, if continued for one minute
without alteration, would enable the bird to travel
the distance of half a league in that time.
The whole plumage of this bird is black, chang-
ing to blue on the top of the head, the wings,
and the tail ; which latter is much forked, and is
nearly two inches shorter than the wings, when
the bird is at rest : the eyes are reddish : the feet
and beak are brown.
This species inhabits the forests, and builds in
trees in the country of Auteniquois, and the Cape
of Good Hope : it is small, measuring only four
inches in length.
