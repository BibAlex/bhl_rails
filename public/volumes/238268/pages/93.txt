COLE TITMOUSE.
says he has observed one excavating the decayed
parts of that tree, carrying the chips in its beak
to some distance, always working downwards,
and making the bottom for the reception of the
nest larger than the entrance : its nest is com-
posed of moss and thistle down, intermixed oc-
casionally with wool, and lined with down : the
eggs are five or six in number, spotted at the
larger end with rusty ; weight about twenty
grains.
This species is very fond of wasps, bees, and
other insects ; it will also eat flesh, like the greater
Titmouse: it is said to lay up a store of seeds
against the winter. It is found throughout Europe,
and is more plentiful than the Cole Titmouse.
