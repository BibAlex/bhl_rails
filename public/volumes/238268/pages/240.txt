180 WOOD THRUSH.
THIS very much resembles the following species,
which Wilson thinks was intended by Pennant for
this bird; but the figure in Vieillot of T. mustelinus
does not agree with Wilson's figure or description of
the Wood, and yet agrees very well with Pennant's
description of the Tawny Thrush. This species
is eight inches in length and thirteen in width :
its beak is dusky brown ; the lower mandible
flesh-coloured at the base : the whole of the upper
parts of the body fulvous brown, brightest on the
head, and inclining to olive on the rump and tail :
chin white : throat and breast white, tinged with
buff, and sprinkled all over with dusky spots: belly
and vent pure white : eyes surrounded with a
white circle : irides chocolate brown : legs and
claws flesh-colour : both sexes are nearly alike.
Inhabits the whole of North America, from
Hudson's Bay to the peninsula of Florida: it
makes its appearance in Pensylvania about the
middle of April, and departs in October: its song
is uttered every morning and evening during the
months of May and June, and is greatly admired ;
but during the day it is silent: its favourite haunts
are thick shaded hollows by the sides of rivulets
or brooks : its nest is often placed in an alder
bush; it is made of withered beech leaves with
layers of dry grass mixed with mud, and neatly
smoothed ; it is lined within by dry fibrous roots :
its eggs are four or five in number, and are of an
uniform light blue.
