THIS well-known species of Swallow is about
five inches and a half in length : its beak is black :
irides hazel : upper parts of the body and tail of a
glossy blue black : rump and all the under parts
of the body white : secondaries with a narrow
white fringe : tail slightly forked : legs covered
with white downy feathers as far as the claws,
which are also white.
Dr. Latham mentions having seen a variety of
this bird which differed in being dusky where the
above is black, and in having the quills, tail, and
upper coverts of the latter, tipped with white ;
but it most probably belongs to another species,
