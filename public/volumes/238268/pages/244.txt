184 REDWING THRUSH.
the belly whitish : legs pale grey : claws brown.
In the British Museum there is a specimen of this
bird entirely of a cream-coloured brown, with all
the markings of a pale colour : beak and legs nearly
white.
The general manners of this bird correspond
with those of the Fieldfare, and like that species
it is migrative, generally arriving in this country
about the latter end of September j and should
the weather become severe, they will fly still
farther south. Montagu mentions, that " in the
hard winter of 1799 vast abundance resorted to
the west of England, where a sudden fall of snow,
unusually deep in that part, cut them off from all
supply of food ; and being too weak to attempt a
passage over sea to a warmer climate, thousands
of them and their companions the Fieldfares were
starved to death."
This species is said to breed in the maple forests
of Norway and Sweden, placing its nest in a low
bush, or shrub, and laying five or six blue-green
eggs, spotted with black : during the breeding
season its song is not inferior to that of the
Thrush : it is so abundant in Prussia, according to
Pennant, that excise duty was paid at Dantzic for
thirty thousand pairs, besides what were smuggled,
or paid duty in other places.
