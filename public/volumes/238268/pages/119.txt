SWALLOW. 79
late as the 5th November, 1805*; and Forster
says he has frequently [seen them after the 19th
October : and that they have been taken in a tor-
pid state during the winter there can be no doubt,
from the many eminent naturalists that have as-
serted the fact.
But that the greatest number of each species
migrate is so well established by a multitude of
observers, that there does not appear to be any
reason to doubt the fact, especially when it is
considered that they are generally eighteen or
twenty hours on the wing daily, during their stay
in this country ; and that they fly with greater
celerity than the swiftest quadruped can run.
We have an instance on record of a famous race-
horse, that went at the surprising velocity of a
mile in a minute, but only for the space of one
second ; but allowing the Swallow to go merely
at the rate of half a mile in the minute, for the
space of eighteen or twenty hours, it will have
gone over in that time between five and six hun-
dred miles, so that it would be able to cross any
part of the sea between this island and the conti-
nent; a circumstance that has been doubted by
many. The fact of their appearing in several parts
of Africa (particularly at Senegal, as noticed by
Adanson), when they disappear in Europe, and
vice versa, tends to give additional plausibility to
the theory of migration.
* I found a Swallow (Hirundo rustica), at Hertford on the
2/th December, 1814, which, to all appearance, had not been
dead any great length of time, as it had not contracted any bad
sroeti, and in other respects was in good condition.
