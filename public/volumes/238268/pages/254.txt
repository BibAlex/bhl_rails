September it leaves Pensylvania, and arrives there
in March : it builds its nest in a low situation, on
a cedar or in a thick bush : its nest is composed
of sticks and leaves externally, and lined with
fibrous roots and horse-hair : its eggs are four in
number, of a blueish white, sprinkled with rust-
colour at the larger end: it has generally two
broods in the year : its song is very fine, and it
will imitate that of many birds, from whence it
has obtained the name of the French Mocking
Bird, to distinguish it from the common Mocking
Thrush of America.
