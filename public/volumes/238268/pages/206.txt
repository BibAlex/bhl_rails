abundant any where ; also in parts of Asia and
Africa, having been observed throughout Siberia

Goat-owl, and Night-hawk, which have been ap-

its rise from the ridiculous supposition of the an-
cients, that it used to suck the teats of goats ! but
it requires no great reasoning to prove the phy-
sical impossibility of its being able to perform such
a feat.
