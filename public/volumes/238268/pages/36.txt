JL HE birds included in this genus are noted for
the brilliancy of their colours, and are very active,
rarely continuing in the same attitude long : their
flight is short, but quick : they frequent woods,
assembling in flocks, and many of them sing de-
lightfully : some species are said to build in hollows,
composing their nests of very coarse materials.
The Piprae at first sight greatly resemble the
birds of the following genus (Parus}, in which
they were formerly placed by Linnaeus, but may be
distinguished by their having the middle and outer
toes connected at the base, which the Pari have
not.
