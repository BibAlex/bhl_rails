THIS remarkable species is nearly one foot in
length, of which the tail measures more than half,
the two middle feathers being six inches and a
half in length : its beak is black : the head, neck,
back, and wing-coverts, are shining purplish
black : the quills obscure dusky black : the rump
white: all the under parts of the plumage rusty
orange : tail wedged, the four middle feathers
entirely black ; the rust on each side, with their
tips white ; and the three outer ones wholly of
the latter colour : legs pale yellow : claws black.
Found at Pulo Condore. This and the Amboyna
Thrush frequently throw up the tail with a flirt-
ing motion, similar to the Magpie.
