THIS receives its name from the circumstance
of its building in pigeon-houses : it is nearly the
size of the Song Thrush, but varies in that respect :
the entire plumage is green, with various reflections
according to the light : some birds have the rump
and vent whitish : it inhabits the Philippine Isles.
