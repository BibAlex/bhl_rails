RED-BREASTED THRUSH. 277
the upper parts of the plumage dark griseous, the
lower pale, with a red tinge, with the lower parts
of the breast, and upper parts of the belly, spotted
with fuscous, as are also the sides of the throat,
which is whitish : the sides of the body, beneath
the wings, are rufous : it has very much the ap-
pearance of the Fieldfare.
This bird is a native of the greatest part of North
America, being found from Hudson's Bay to
Nootka-Sound on one hand, and as far as Georgia
on the other : it is a very familiar bird, and is
often kept by the Americans in confinement for
its song, which is exceedingly fine, and is con-
tinued nearly without intermission during the
months of April and May : its eggs are of a beau-
tiful clear blue colour, and the nest is generally
placed in a tree : it is fond of gum berries, of
which it will eat such immense quantities in the
autumn as to give its flesh a purple tinge ; and
that circumstance has tended very much to keep
the bird from being extirpated in North America,
as they used to be shot by thousands for food,
until a gentleman, that had great regard for the
species, asserted that they were poisonous, in con-
sequence of eating so many berries ; and when
the flesh appeared purple upon being opened, the
inhabitants were afraid to eat them : its general
food consists of insects and worms.
