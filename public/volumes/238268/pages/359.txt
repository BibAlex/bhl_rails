RED-LEGGED THRUSH. 283
hood of inhabited places, but in deep forests,
where it may be observed perched singly on a
tree, uttering its song, which is most beautiful,
and is so much admired among the Cayennese,
that they have given it the name of musician : its
length is four inches : beak black : upper parts of
the body, wings, and tail, rufous brown, striated
transversely with dusky: the chin, cheeks, and
throat rufous orange, with a broad black patch, spot-
ted with white, on each side of the neck, beneath
the eye : the breast, belly, and vent, dirty white :
legs yellowish : it feeds principally on ants : its song,
which is thought superior, by many, to that of the
Nightingale, consists of different tones and ac-
cents, much resembling the flute, and sometimes
a short whistle.
