GREEN-BLUE SWALLOW. 107
inch longer than the middle ones, and all of an
uniform brown black : lores black : all the under
parts of the body pure white : wings, when closed,
extend about one quarter of an inch beyond the
tail : legs naked, short, and strong, and, as well
as the feet, of a dark purplish flesh-colour : claws
stout : female with less of the greenish gloss than
the male, and all the colours less brilliant; in
other respects the same.
The White-bellied or Green-blue Swallow has
generally been confounded by European writers
with the common Martin, but separated by Wilson
in his American Ornithology with great propriety
from that species, from which it differs in not
being of a dark cserulean black above, and white
on the rump : it arrives in Pensylvania a few days
later than the Barn Swallow, and often takes pos-
session of the boxes that are put up for the Purple
Swallow : its nest consists of fine loose dry grass,
lined with large downy feathers, rising above its
surface, and so placed as to curl inwards, and
completely conceal the eggs, which are four or
five in number, and pure white in colour : the
bird has generally two broods in the season, and
will sometimes build in a hollow tree : it is a very
quarrelsome species, and is continually fighting :
they are extremely numerous in some parts of
North America : Wilson mentions one hundred
and two being brought down by one discharge
from a gun, in the low lands of Long Island !
