226 ASH-HEADED THRUSH.
a thick bush, or against the side of a tree or bank:
it lays four or five eggs, of a light blue colour,
thickly covered with pale ferruginous brown spots,
especially at the larger end; they are hatched
after fourteen days incubation. It is a soli-
tary species, and is likewise very timorous and
restless : it frequents hedges and gardens in the
summer, but in winter it affects woods. Its food
consists principally of insects, worms, and shelled
snails; the latter are dexterously broken against
a stone, to extract the animal : it will also eat
fruit, and in confinement will eat bread and flesh,
either raw or cooked.
This bird inhabits the greatest portion of the
temperate parts of Europe, and in Russia it mi-
grates in the dead of the winter.
