THE Solitary Thrush is much smaller than the
Blackbird, and is in length between eight and
nine inches : the male has a brown beak : the
irides orange : the prevailing colour of his plum-
age brown, varied with small whitish spots : the
sides of the head, throat, neck, breast, and upper
wing-coverts, tinged with blue : quills plain brown :
rump and under tail-coverts the same : the tail
dusky : legs brown : the female has not the
slightest tinge of blue on her plumage, and the
spots are more yellow than in the male, especially
on the breast, where they are most numerous.
Montagu has very erroneously supposed the
Starling in its first year's plumage to be this bird,
and as such has figured it in his Supplement, and
introduced this species of Thrush into the British
Fauna, whereas it is perfectly unknown in these
parts, being only found in the south of Europe :
