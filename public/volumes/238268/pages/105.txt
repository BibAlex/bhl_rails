These birds are noted for the singularity of their
nests, which are wonderfully constructed for the
purpose of security against the attacks of quadru-
peds or reptiles, of the down of the willow, poplar
and thistle, which they twist into a close compact
body, and strengthen with fibres and roots of
plants, lining the whole with the fine materials :
it is generally suspended on the extreme end of
a weak branch that projects over some water; the
entrance is the only place that is left uncovered,
and is on one side, and generally on that which is
opposite the water : they are often seen in the
marshes about Bologna : and the peasants that in-
habit the parts where they are abundant are very
superstitious in respect to bird and nest : indeed
the former is reckoned almost as a sacred animal,
in the same way that the Redbreast is in many
parts of England : the female generally lays four
or five eggs, white and almost transparent ; and
often has two broods in the year, about May and
August. It is found in Poland, Italy, and other
parts of Europe, and Siberia.
