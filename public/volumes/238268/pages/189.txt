JL HE only species of this genus knov/n to Lin-
naeus was placed by him amongst the Hiruudines,
but many subsequent writers have transferred it
from thence and placed it among the writer birds,
to which it has not the least affinity, except in
having rather long legs, which are ba<3 of feathers
a little above the knee ; whereas it has the entire
habit of the Swallow tribe, especially in the shape
of the wings and tail ; and like them it resorts to
rivers and such like places in search of insects, on
which it feeds, and for the purpose of building its
nest'.
