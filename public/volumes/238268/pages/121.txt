at first ; thus proving that they returned to the

water. These birds are always very much reduced
in number when they return in the spring, proba-
bly from many of them being exhausted by fa-
tigue in crossing the sea, and being consequently
drowned.
Bewick relates the following experiments, which
were communicated to him by Sir John Tre-
velyan, and performed by Mr. Pearson ; which are
well deserving the attention of naturalists. " Five
or six of these birds were taken about the latter
end of August, 1 784, in a bat-fowling net, at night ;
they were put separately into small cages, and fed
with Nightingale's food. In about a week or ten
days they took the food of themselves : they were
then put all together into a deep cage, four feet
long, with gravel at the bottom ; a broad shallow
pan with water was placed in it, in which they

the result, he left them to themselres about half
an hour, and on going to the cage again found
them all huddled together in a corner, appa-

proper distance from the fire, when two of them
