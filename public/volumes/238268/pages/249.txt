FIELDFARE THRUSH. 187
varieties of this bird : the first has the head and
neck white, the former spotted with white, and
the latter with lead colour ; the throat and breast
rufous, spotted with black ; the back brown ;
rump ash-coloured ; and the under parts of the
body white, with black spots : the other variety
has the head and upper parts of the neck white.
Dr. Latham adds another which has the head and
neck white, and the rest of the body variegated
with white and brown : this latter specimen was
shot in Derbyshire : Bewick also describes a very
similar variety.
This is only a visitant in this island, arriving
about the beginning of October, and departing
either the latter end of February or beginning of
March, retiring to Russia, Sweden, and even as
far as Kamschatka : it does not arrive in France
till the beginning of December, but they are then
seen by thousands : during the winter they feed
on hawthorn, holly, and other berries: they build
in high trees, and frequent the places where jum-
pers grow: their flesh is much esteemed, although
it is sometimes bitterish : this and the Redwing
Thrush are supposed to be the Turdi of the Ro-
mans with which they took so much pains to fat-
ten in aviaries for food. This bird is much more
sociable than the Throstle or Missel, and is often
gregarious : if severe weather come on gradually,
few are met with after Christmas, but on their
return northward they appear again in small
flocks : it will sometimes feed upon warms, slugs,
and snails.
