BEARDED TITMOUSE. 63
under tail-coverts black : tail about three inches
long, very much wedge-shaped, and of the same
colour as the back ; the three outer feathers more
or less tipped with white ; black towards the base :
legs black. The female differs in having no black

and eye a dusky spot ; and a few black marks on
the back.
Of the history of this species there is very little

amongst the reedy tracks near Cowbit in Lanca-
shire, and also in similar situations in Gloucester-
shire ; it is likewise found near Winchelsea in
Sussex, at Exeter in Devonshire, and in some part
of Scotland. The nest of this bird is not at all
known, unless, as Colonel Montagu observes, it is
so like the Reed Wren's as not to be distinguished
from it : various authors have attempted to give a
description of it, but their accounts are so different,
that there is no certainty respecting it ; whilst
others have undoubtedly mistaken that of the Reed
Wren for it : the most plausible conjecture that
can be advanced to account for the above is, that
the bird builds only in reedy places, that are quite
inaccessible on account of their swampiness.
This species is common in Denmark, Sweden,
and the reedy banks of the rivers that fall into the
Caspian Sea ; and Buffou supposes that they were
first introduced into this country from a pair hav-
