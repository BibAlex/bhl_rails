hundred dollars and upwards : its general haunts
are in moist shady woods, where it builds its nest,
which is composed of dry sticks and twigs, mixed
with straw, hay, pieces of wool and tow, and lined
with a thick layer of light brown fibrous roots: its
eggs are four or five in number, of an ash-coloured
blue, sprinkled with brown blotches : the female
sits fourteen days, and has generally two, and if
disturbed, three broods in the year.
Immense numbers of these birds are taken in
some parts of the United States, for the purpose
of keeping in confinement on account of their
songs ; and amongst them many young ones are
captured, w 7 hich are far from being difficult to
rear, as they will bear great fatigue, and only re-
quire to be kept clean and well fed : when first
taken they will endeavour to escape through the
wires of their cages, and will kill themselves if the
upper parts of them be not made of wood, so as
entirely to obstruct their view: they are fond of
berries of various sorts, and also insects. They
are found throughout all parts of North America,
and great part of the West Indies.
