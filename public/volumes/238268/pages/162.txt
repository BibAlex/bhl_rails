114 ESCULENT SWALLOW.
terruptiori : the birds that build these nests are
small grey Swallows, with bellies of a dirty white.
They were flying about in considerable numbers,
but were so small, and their flight was so quick,
that they escaped the shot fired at them. The
same sort of nests are said to be also found in
deep caverns at the foot of the highest mountains
in the middle of Java, at a distance from the sea ;
from which source it is thought that the birds
derive no materials either for their food or the
construction of their nests, as it does not appear
probable they should fly in search of either over
the intermediate mountains, which are very high,
or against the boisterous winds prevailing there-
about: they feed on insects, which they find hover-
ing over stagnated pools between the mountains,
and for the catching of which their wide opening
beaks are peculiarly adapted. They prepare their
nests from the best remnants of their food. Their
greatest enemy is the kite, who often intercepts
them in their passage to and from the caverns,
which are generally surrounded with rocks of grey
limestone or white marble. The nests are placed
in horizontal rows, at different depths, from fifty
to five hundred feet : the colour and value of the
nests depend on the quantity and quality of the
insects caught, and, perhaps, also on the situation
where they are built : their value is chiefly ascer-
tained by the uniform fineness and delicacy of
their texture; those that are white and transpa-
rent being most esteemed, and fetching often their
weight of silver in China.
