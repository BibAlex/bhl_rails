MISSKL THRUSH. 173
tlie female are not quite so brilliant. Dr. Latham
mentions two varieties of this bird, one of them
reddish cream-colour, palest beneath, and the
belly white, spotted with cream-colour ; the other
white, spotted with brown on the under parts.
The food of this species consists principally of
berries, of which those of the misseltoe are its
favourite, from whence the ancients supposed
that that plant could not vegetate without having
passed through its body ; but experience proves
the contrary : it w r ill also eat insects, and their
larva?, with which it feeds its young. It builds its
nest, which it is said to do twice a year, in the fork
of low trees, particularly those that are covered with
moss, of lichen, and coarse grass, woven together
with wool, and lined with fine dry grass: its eggs
are four or five in number, of a flesh-colour, varied
with deep and light rust-coloured spots, and weigh
somewhat more than two drachms.
It is the largest of song birds, and frequently
Begins to sing with the new r year, if the weather
be mild ; but upon a diminution of temperature
below 40 degrees of the thermometer it ceases :
when the female commences to build, and during
incubation, it resumes it, until the young brood
make their appearance, when it becomes silent, and
is not heard again till the ensuing year, unless
the young be taken, or the female destroyed;
when it continues to sing throughout the summer :
its song is much louder but far inferior in melody
to that of the Song Thrush, or Throstle.
This bird is very abundant in the west of England,
