COMMON MARTIN*. H9
as it came from some part of North America,
where the Martin does not occur.
It is found throughout Europe and Asia, and is
much more abundant in England than the Swal-

nest during the period of incubation, and likewise
after the young are first hatched : their eggs are
pure white, and five in number the first brood, the
second they are three or four, and the third two
or three ; but it seldoms happens that they have

to the nest, the old ones feed them by adhering
to the outside of the nest ; but as soon as they are
able to fly, they receive their food on the wing, by
