THIS has a very great affinity to the preceding,
but is nevertheless very distinct, as the descriptions
and figures demonstrate ; and it is not a little
surprising that Wilson in his American Ornitho-
logy should increase the confusion by giving a
name that was applied by Pennant to the preced-
ing, when he was confident this bird was a distinct
species, as he acquaints us in the last paragraph of
his description.
It is in length ten inches, and in expanse one
foot : the whole of the upper parts of the body
are of an uniform tawny brown, the under white :
the sides of the head and under the wings slightly
tinged with cinereous : chin white : throat and
upper parts of the breast cream-coloured, and
marked with pointed brown spots : lores blueish
white : cheeks dusky brown : tail nearly even at
the end : shafts of the feathers and of the quills
reaching beyond their webs, in which it agrees
