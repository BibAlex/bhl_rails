GREY-RUMPED SWALLOW. 115
These nests are a considerable object of traffic
among the Javanese, many of whom are employed
in it from their infancy. The birds, after having
spent nearly two months in preparing their nests,
lay each two eggs, which are hatched in about
fifteen days : when the young birds become
fledged, it is thought the proper time to seize
upon their nests, which is done regularly three
times a year, and is effected by means of ladders
of bamboo and reeds, by which the people de-
scend into the caverns, but when these are very
deep, rope ladders are preferred : this operation is
attended with much danger, and several perish in
the attempt."
