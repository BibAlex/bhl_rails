ROSE-COLOURED THRUSH. 275
beak slightly bent, of a flesh-colour, with the base
dusky : irides pale : head crested, and, with the
neck, wings, and tail, black, glossed with blue,
purple, and green, according to the position with
respect to the light: the back, rump, breast,
belly, and lesser wing-coverts, pale rose-colour,
with a few irregular dark spots : legs pale red :
claws brown, and much crooked : female rather
paler.
This is met with in many parts of Europe, and
has also been observed in Asia, even to India : it
is abundant about Aleppo, towards the latter end
of summer, where it pursues the locusts : it is also
seen in flocks every year in the south of Russia :
it also occasionally visits England, but so rarely
as scarcely to be admitted into the British list :
there are but few instances on record of its having
been taken, except about Ormskirk in Lancashire,
where one or two are said to be taken almost every
season. It is frequent in France, especially about
Burgundy, in its passage to other parts.
