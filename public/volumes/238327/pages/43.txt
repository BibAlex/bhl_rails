In this typical section, the radula of the type species, 5 and that
of 0. convexa* have been examined. The radular formulae are
given in Table II. The centrals of 0. orbiculata (Plate III, fig. 2)
are similar to those of Hendersonia, but the R-central has a less
attenuate base, and the C-central has considerably smaller cusps.
The comb-lateral is somewhat lighter, while the accessory plate
is both lighter and much more elongate transversely (Plate IV,
fig. 11). The wing is somewhat reduced, and gives a lanceolate
outline. The marginals are very close to those of Hendersonia,
but are slightly more numerous.
The radula of 0. convexa is not figured, but it is very close to
that of 0. orbiculata. The formula is given in Table II. The
shell of 0. convexa is also very similar to that of 0. orbiculata; it
is of the same depressed form and has a similarly thickened peris-
tome. In this connection, a number of Antillean species, included
by A. J. Wagner in the sections Subglobulosa and F estiva, need
examination. Many of them have the calcareous, light-colored
opercula of this group.
This group has many primitive characters, but in the reduction
of the wing on the accessory plate, slightly approaches Oxyrhombus
of Helicina. Its closest relatives are in the section Succincta, thru
which it is connected with Alcadia. As indicated in the relation-
ship diagram in Table I, it probably represents a primitive stock
near the ancestral line of the genus Helicina. The distribution
of the species appears to sustain this idea, If the Antillean species
1 < (roups preceded by a question-mark are those of which I have not examined
the radula; species preceded by a question-mark are those I have not seen;
in the latter, 2 question-marks indicate considerable doubt as to its position
or specific rank.
