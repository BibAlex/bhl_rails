living, 18 dead shells. Also found 1 mile south of Indian Well,
Riverside County, California; George Willett, March, 1919; 6 liv-
ing specimens.
This very attractive little snail in many respects recalls Pilsbry's
description of his Micrarionta rixfordi, but the umbilicus is narrower,
and the sculpturing of the earlier whorls evidently quite different.
As the two species come from different mountain systems, with
the whole upper Cahuilla Basin between, it is doubtful if they
are as nearly allied as the descriptions superficially indicate. To
my notion, M. hidioensis is really the nearest akin to xerophila of
any of those previously described. Its larger size, more elevated
outline, and narrower umbilicus serve to distinguish it, but it is
the same general type of shell, and it may be that enough inter-
grades will come to light in intervening territory to reduce M.
xerophila to the status of a subspecies. In fact, the small series
of snails above noted which Mr. Willett collected to the south of
Indian Well may represent one of the intermediate forms, as his
specimens, though surely not all typical of indioensis, are yet not
quite characteristic of xerophila. It seems best to refer them to
the latter species at least tentatively, as the available information
regarding the possible limits of variation in all these forms is
still very scanty.
The dead shells were either picked up on the surface or from
among loose soil and rocks, but living ones could be obtained only
by digging out the loose detritus in the lee of large rocks, following
up crevices, or turning stones. They were generally within a few
inches of the surface, and wherever deeper digging was attempted
we met with no success.
