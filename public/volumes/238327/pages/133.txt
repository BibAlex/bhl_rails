The genus Phyllomimus is monotypic, granulosus ( = detersus)
being the type. Kirby has selected elliptifolia Saussure and Pictet
as genotype of Microprion, a species congeneric with detersus, if
not actually a synonym of that exceedingly variable species.
Hence Microprion falls as a synonym of Phyllomimus.

In one specimen there is a large black spot meso-proximad
between the median and ulnar veins, in the other specimen traces
only of such a spot are found. Such a spot is individually absent
or present, but variable in size, in the series of P. detersus (Walker)
before us. It is evident that this feature is of no specific diagnostic
value in these species.
The ovipositor is here figured, as it is very different from that of
detersus. Its dorsal denticulations are transversely lamellate and
rounded.
Length of body 36.5 and 36.2, length of pronotum 7.2 and 7.7,
length of tegmen 54 and 55.3, median width of tegmen 13.8 and
13.3, length of caudal femur 17.1 and 21, length of ovipositor
19.8 and 19.4, median width of ovipositor 3 and 3 mm.
The narrower tegmina with venation more regular and cross-
veins straight, transverse, gives to individuals of this species a
very distinctive appearance.
