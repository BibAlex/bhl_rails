General coloration buffy, the tegmina distad pale green ; probably
uniform pale green in life. Eyes dark brown. Antennae immac-
ulate. Pronotum with a band of ochraceous-orange defining on
each side the lateral margins of the disk, this continued as a pos-
tocular band on the head.
Length of body 11.2, length of pronotum 4.8, greatest total
width of pronotum 2.8, length of lateral lobe of pronotum 2.3,
depth of lateral lobe of pronotum 2.1, length of tegmen 16.9,
width of tegmen 2.8, length of cephalic femur 3.6, length of caudal
femur 10.7 mm.

The previously unknown male of this species is briefly compared
with that of A. bakeri under that species.
In the present pair the ventro-cephalic angle of the lateral lobes
is very weakly indicated in the male, obsolete in the female. The
male genitalia show the highest specialization known for the species
of Alloteratura. Cerci heavy and irregular in contour, stout in
proximal third to a dorso-internal node, median third tapering in
vertical section with dorso-external margin sharply angulate, distal
third with margins curving weakly to the apex and dorsal margin
sharp; the cerci curve inward and upward with some angulation
indicated at each section described above and embrace the large
yoked portion of the ultimate tergite. This projects mesad above
the cerci as a large, vertical, transverse, rounded lobe and is pro-
duced ventrad beyond the cerci and apex of the subgenital plate
as a stout cone, with apical portion lamellate, truncate and directed
ventrad. Subgenital plate with lateral margins weakly convex
convergent, a longitudinal carina on each side terminating at the
latero-caudal angle and there supplied with a slightly decurved
style, three times as long as its basal width; between the cerci the
plate is bilobate, these small projections forming a broad V-shaped
emargination mesad.
