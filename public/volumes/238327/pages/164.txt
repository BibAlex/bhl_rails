The only differences between this individual and those recorded
as S. ornata Brunner are as follows. Size larger, coloration some-
what deeper, caudal portion of pronotal disk more produced and
more strongly rounded caudad, pronotal lateral lobes with caudal
angulation stronger and tegmina which widen distinctly caudad.
In these insects the genicular lobes of the femora are as follows ;
internal of cephalic and median femora unispinose, external of the
same triangularly produced, all of caudal femora bispinose.
There is a decided possibility that lobaspoides may prove to be but
a striking phase developed in the species ornata.

width of tegmen 10.7, distal width of tegmen 11.7, length of cephalic
femur 12.9, length of caudal femur 27.7, length of ovipositor 19.3,
greatest width of ovipositor 3 mm.

We agree with Kirby, who examined Walker's type of Lesina
lutescens, an immature male, in considering these species congeneric.
We do not believe, however, that blanchardi Brongniart 78 is gener-
ically distinct (as did Kirby) and in consequence we place Eume-
galodon Brongniart, proposed for the preoccupied Megalodon, in
synonymy under Lesina. In fact it appears probable that lutescens
will be found a synonym of ensifer. Karny doubted Kirby's
assigrment of Lesina and in consequence retained the name
Eumegalodon.
The specimen of this uncouth, spiny insect before us is bister,
shading toward sayal brown, the dorsal surface of the limbs buffy
brown. The vertex and proximal portions of the antennae are
7S
A Siamese specimen of that species is before us.
