occurred in many species of the genus, this resulting in other
synonyms by that author in the same paper. That longipennis
is a very widely distributed species is an established fact, but
Redtenbacher may easily have confused individuals of other
species in his series listed under longicorne and we here designate
the type locality for that name as Borneo.

A single pair from Sandakan are brachypterous. The male from
Singapore has the organs of flight somewhat reduced. The series
shows marked size variation, as follows.

In the present series the ventro-external margin of the caudal
femora is armed with from five to nine spines, the most frequent
number being six.
The following features have hitherto not been given. Male
ultimate tergite weakly bilobate distad. Male cerci rather slender
throughout, the medio-internal tooth not greatly swollen at its
base, the apical portion with dorsal surface declivent and weakly
concave to its sharply rounded apex. Ovipositor straight or show-
ing a very faint indication of curvature dorsad. Female subgenital
plate with median portion of distal margin concave-emarginate,
this plate tightly embracing the base of the ovipositor.
84 The body is shrivelled in this specimen.
