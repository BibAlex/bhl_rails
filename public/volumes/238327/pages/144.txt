The present individual is compared with specimens of S. torrida
Stal under that species. It differs similarly from S. rugosa (Lin-
naeus), except that the elevation of the pronotal disk is fully as
prominent in its caudal portion.

The pale face, truncate tegmina and black spines of the cephalic
femora distinguish this insect. In the present specimen the head
and thorax ventrad, limbs and even the first antennal joints are
thickly supplied with long silky hairs, which are strikingly evident.
The general coloration is grayish brown, the tegmina irregularly
mottled with pale greenish and rusty brown. The costal margin
of the sinistral tegmen has three, that of the dextral tegmen six,
moderately large, rounded triangular projections.
The previously unknown male has the supra-anal plate small,
produced and shield-shaped. The cercus is nearly semicircular,
with apex minutely toothed. The subgenital plate is broad and
shining black proximad with a broad subchitinous pale medio-
longitudinal sulcus, then suddenly narrowed, the slender distal
portion pale, short, with apex briefly forked and bearing moderately
heavy styles, which curve inward distad.
