studies in malayan, melanesian and australian
tettigoniidae (orthoptera).
By Morgan Hebard.
In 1920 the author published a first paper, dealing with that
part of the collections here treated which covered the section be-
longing to the family Mantidae. 1
Though the present paper is considerably larger, the number 01
species of Tettigoniidae known from the regions under consideration
is very much greater and, as a result, the present work is not
intended to be in any way monographic. A number of difficulties
have been cleared up and the proper sequence of species in some
places we feel is now defined.
Much work remains to be done, and the Tettigoniidae of these
regions must be monographed before the student will be able to
determine material in small series. The literature on the group
is too vast and scattered to be accessible, unless a great amount of
preliminary work has been done; and reference to a large and
comprehensive library is a constant necessity. In order to aid in
locating the literature, particularly that subsequent to Kirby's
Catalogue, numerous references have been given in the present
study.
All of the material here recorded, unless otherwise stated, is in
the author's collection at The Academy or Natural Sciences of
Philadelphia, with the exception of duplicate specimens from
Mr. C. F. Baker, representing species not in his collection; such
will be forwarded to him whenever desired. Five hundred and
thirty-one specimens are recorded, representing ninety-four genera
and one hundred and ninety-one species, of which fourteen genera,
one subgenus, seventy-three species, and one subspecies, are new.
Unfortunately, the great majority of species are represented by
but one or two specimens.
We have found that Wallace's line separates quite as large a
percentage of species of Tettigoniidae as of the Mantidae, clearly
delimiting the Malayan from the Melanesian fauna.
