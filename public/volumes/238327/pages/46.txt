Section Analcadia A. J. W. Antilles to Central America.
Analcadia A. J. W. (1907). Type (now chosen) H. dysoni Pfr.
(1849). Cumana, Venezuela.
?0. dysoni bocourti (C. and F.) (1869). Belize, Honduras.
??0. dysoni diaphana (Pfr.) (1851). Honduras (small, angulate form).
?H. dysoni jasoni von Martens (1890). Isle Bonacca, Honduras.
???0. sanguinea (Pfr.) (1849). Honduras (Dyson). Probably an Antillean species.
In this subgenus the radulae of C. palliata u , O. rotunda 15 , and
O. riparia (Pfr.) 16 were examined. All are included in Table II,
but only 0. palliata is figured (Plate V, fig. 25) here. The differences
are indicated in the synoptic key, and in Table II. Except for
the broad R-central of O. dysoni, they differ mainly in size.
From the indications given by these few radulae, Alcadia appears
very close to Oligyra s. s. A. J. Wagner (1907) has shown in his
study of the opercula and shell characters, that the Mexican species,
which he groups around O. gemma, are connected, in these parti-
culars, by an intergrading series with the typical forms of Alcadia.
In the radulae, the biggest break comes between the West Indian
forms and those of the mainland (exclusive of Analcadia). Never-
theless, the whole group of radulae, included here in the genus
Oligyra, form a very closely related group, separated from other
genera by quite distinctive characters. It is true that the subgenus
Alcadia and the subgenus Oligyra appear to represent the basal
members of two diverging lines of evolution, but at present it
would be extremely difficult to name any very definite characters
for their separation.
13 The last two sectional names can be used.
