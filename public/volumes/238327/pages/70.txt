interior valleys well within the desert drainage system 6 was wholly
unexpected, but it is apparently a common species in Whitewater
Canyon in the San Bernardino Mountains, where a live adult
and 3 dead juvenals were taken at Station I, a live juvenal and
9 dead shells of various ages at Station II, and an adult bleached
shell at Station III. None of the shells is of the typical coastal
form, nor do they seem exactly referable to the subdolus or rufiterrae
types of the San Jacinto and San Bernardino Valleys, but the
material is insufficient to justify one's saying more.
ZONITIDAE
Genus ZONITOIDES Pilsbry
Zonitoides minuscula (Binney 1840)
1840. Helix minuscula Binney, Bost. Jour. Nat. Hist., vol. 3, p. 435, pi. 22,
fig. 4.
1885. Zonites minusculus W. G. Binney, Man. Am. Land Sh., p. 19, 23, 25,
30, 31, 32, 35, 38, 57, 63, 479, fig. 18-20.
Two specimens of this species were taken in the drift of Palm
Canyon at Station XII.
LIMACIDEA
Genus AGRIOLIMAX Morch 1868
Agriolimax sp.
Ten specimens of a small slug thought to be referable to this
genus were taken on a moist slope in Little Palm Canyon, but
the specific determination is still uncertain. They have been
deposited in the collection of The Academy of Natural Sciences of
Philadelphia.
PUPILLIDAE
Genus GASTROCOPTA Wollaston 1878
Gastrocopta pellucida hordeacella (Pilsbry 1890)

A scant dozen specimens oÂ£ this minute Gastrocopta, picked from
6 It is appropriate to mention, however, that species of this genus must cross
into the desert drainage at several points, for Mr. Smith has collected H. cuyama-
censis in the wash at Warner's Hot Springs, and has found a large race of it
(H. c. loivei Bartsch) at an elevation of 5,500 ft. on the east slope of Hot Springs
Mountain in the same region.
