The radula of S. hidalgoana 39 is figured (Plate V, figs. 18 and 20).
The centrals are somewhat Alcadia-like; the B-central has an outer
projection that fits under the C-central. The comb-lateral is
large and heavy and has a squarish base, -but the outer triangular
projection is so thin and weak as to be difficult to see. The accessory
plate is rather small and not very heavy. The inner 9 marginals
are bicuspid and resemble those of Emoda, although the blades are
considerably longer and more close-ranked than in that group.
The small number (46) is striking in a shell as large as the present
species.
The distinctive shell characters were noted early, and are so
peculiar as to probably warrant the generic separation of this
group and Emoda, but the writer did not wish to erect the latter
into a genus until a more thorough study of the West Indian forms
had been made. The species from the mainland of North America,
given above, constitute simply an alphabetic list of the names
that have been proposed.
Genus STOASTOMA Adams. Jamaica.
Stoastoma C. B. Adams (18-19). Type S. pisum C. B. Adams (1849).

Hemicyclostoma "C. B. Adams" Pfr. (1865). Type S. pisum.

? Blandia Chitty (1857). Type S. blandianum C. B. Adams (1849).
The radula of the type species has already been figured by Pilsbry
39 2 dried specimens; A. N. S. P. no. 85919; collected in canon 4 miles west of
Victoria, Tamaulipas, Mexico, by S. N. Rhoads (1903).
40 The second name in this list is an exact synonym of Stoastoma ; the remainder
may be distinct. I have already tentatively included Lindsleya under Luciddla.
