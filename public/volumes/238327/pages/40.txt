In this genus the radulae of H. occulta (Say) 1 and H. japonica
(Adams) 2 were examined. The formulae are shown in Table II.
In this table, under the headings "A, B and C Centrals" (the
R-centrals are omitted as they usually have no true cusps) are
given the number of cusps on each tooth for. the various species.
Under the heading "Comb-lateral" are given the number of cusps
on that tooth. Under the heading " Marginals, " the subheadings
"2, 3, 4, 5, 6" indicate numbers of cusps; under each of these
subheadings is given the number of teeth that bear the complement
of cusps indicated. Where the inner teeth bear more cusps than
some further out; these interstitial few-cusped teeth are put in their
proper column but are marked with an asterisk, while the two
groups of teeth with one more cusp, situated on either side of them,
are put in their proper column but the first and second groups are
separated by a plus sign. For instance, A. verecunda has 4 cusps
on the inner most marginal (1 in 4-column), followed by 2 teeth
with 3 cusps each (2 followed by an asterisk in 3-column), which
in turn are followed by 3 more teeth with 4 cusps (+ 4 in 4-column).
Under the heading "Total" are given the number of marginals on
each side; under "Grand Total" are given the usual number of
teeth in each transverse row.
In H. occulta, the R-central (Plate III, fig. 1) is peculiarly attenu-
