The measurements of the Bornean female are given last. Length
of body (all shrunken) <? 14, 9 13 and 14.5; length of pronotum
cf 4.7, 9 4.5 and 4.4; greatest width of pronotum c? 2.8, 9 3.3
and 3.3; length of pronotal lateral lobe c? 3.3, 9 3.3 and 3.3;
depth of pronotal lateral lobe c? 2.1, 9 2.2 and 2.2; length of tegmen
d 1 22.7, 9 24 and 25.4; width of tegmen c? 3.3, 9 3.4 and 3.4;
length of cephalic femur c? 5.1, 9 5.8 and 5.8; length of caudal
femur <? 11.1, 9 12 and 11.5; length of ovipositor 13 and 13.2 mm.
The spines of the ventral margins of the cephalic and median
tibiae, though showing some development toward the claw-like
type found in Phisis, are as short as is usual in Xiphidiopsis, the
longest only slightly over twice the tibial width at that point.
Phlugis thaumasia new species. Plate XXI, figures 2, 3 and 4.
This insect agrees in every feature of generic importance with
the American genotype, P. teres (DeGeer). 94 It is the second
Malayan species to be described of this otherwise Neotropical
genus.
Known from a single male, the specimen is found to agree closely
with the single known female of the other Malayan species, P. dubia
(Karny), described from Banguey Island, British North Borneo.
It is distinguished by the wholly unarmed caudal femora. We
believe that the male sex of the Bornean insect will show distinctive
genitalic differences.
These species may be quickly separated from other Asiatic
Listroscelids by the prominent eyes, which are produced cephalad,
the short, declivent and non-projecting vertex, the large curved
spine of the cephalic coxae and distinctive limb armament.

In addition to the generic characters noted above, the following
are of diagnostic value. Size small, form slender, though not as
slender and delicate as the majority of the American species.
Maxillary palpi with fourth joint two -thirds as long as fifth, the
latter very gradually enlarging distad to its truncate apex. Pro-
notum cylindrical, moderately produced caudad, the metazona
two-fifths as long as the prozona; lateral lobes with ventral margin
horizontal, caudal margin oblique, showing only a faint offset
opposite the small, round but exposed thoracic foramen. Tegmina
and wings somewhat reduced, the former slightly surpassing the
94 Except that the caudal femora have but two pairs of distal spurs, the dorsal
pair having disappeared. We, however, find this condition to be characteristic
of the majority of the American species of Phlugis.
