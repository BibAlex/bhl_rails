The head and pronotum in this insect are not as decidedly im-
presso-punctate as in 0. intermedins Redtenbacher.

Redtenbacher does not comment on the shortness of the limbs
and the numerous short, stiff hairs there found. The species ap-
parently has no close allies.
Length of body 21.5, length of pronotum 5.7, caudal width of
pronotal disk 4, length of tegmen 31, width of tegmen 5, length of
cephalic femur 4.8, length of caudal femur 10.7, length of ovipositor
10.2, greatest width of ovipositor 2.7 mm.

The large size and black body but almost uniformly pale limbs
of this insect distinguish it from its nearest allies. Agreeing more
closely with A. nitidus Redtenbacher in other features of colora-
tion, the male genitalia are seen to be very different, while the
limb spination is closer to that described for A. geniculates Dohrn.
All of these species are known only from the Island of Mindanao.
Type: d 1 ; Surigao, Mindanao, Philippine Islands. (From C. F.
Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 836.]
Size large, form moderately robust, for the genus. Fastigium
of vertex produced in a straight, very slenderly conical projection,
its apex sharply rounded. Face smooth and shining, showing a
few subobsolete impressions. Tegmina greatly reduced, much
shorter than pronotum, with distal margin very broadly convex;
stridulating field fully developed but in normal position wholly
concealed by the pronotum. Cerci very short and heavy, weakly
curved inward, with a heavy dorso-distal and a decidedly heavier
ventro-distal tooth, these curved and directed strongly inward.
