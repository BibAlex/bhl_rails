covered there, it was still with considerable surprise to the writer
that the material described here proved to be celestite, SrS0 4 .
The specimen consists of part of a vein of pink rhodochrosite
on a mass of calcite through which is disseminated much franklinite.
The rhodochrosite, which is quite crystalline, is filled with solution
cavities which are coated with druses of brilliant colorless crystals,
rarely over 1 mm. in size. The mineral was found to be biaxial,
positive; * = 1.621, £ = 1.625, T = 1.631; all ± .003. A single
crystal was measured with the results given in Table III. The
habit of the crystal measured is shown in fig. 2; other crystals
were tabular parallel to c (001).

Calcite
The calcite occurs as a cavity lining on a calcite-zincite mixture
