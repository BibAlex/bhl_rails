is at hand to warrant our undertaking such a revision, it is clear
to us that the literature on the genus is in quite as great confusion
as that for the tropical American species of Neoconocephalus. In
that genus we were able to determine, from thorough study of the
North American forms found north of Mexico, based on ample
series, that a multitude of synonyms existed and that the range of
variation in the widely distributed and very plastic species was a
feature of the greatest importance, unknown or ignored by both
Redtenbacher and Karny. In the material of Euconocephalus,
now under consideration, eight species appear to be recognizable.
For these we have chosen the apparently best fitting names from
the long list and have been able to assign to synonymy a number
of the names there found.
It is to be hoped that more truly revisionary work will be under-
taken and, should this be done, we are satisfied that the number
of species of Euconocephalus, placed at thirty-eight by Karny in
the "Genera Insectorum" (1912), will show very great reduction.
