ate basally. As remarked in the key to the groups, the cusps of the
paired centrals, and especially those of the C-central, are larger
and better-developed than in any other group; in fact the whole
central group is large in comparison with the rest of the radula.
The comb-lateral has comparatively few cusps, but these are large,
and exceptionally long and well-pointed (Plate IV, fig. 10). The
accessory plate is heavy bu1 short, and has horn-colored thickenings
along the inner end and down the middle, while in most of the
nearly related groups it is comparatively transparent. The re-
flected wing is large and triangular, although much shorter (trans-
versely) than in Oligyra. The marginals are practically the same
shape as those of 0. orbiculata. All are evenly ligulate, with a
decided tendency for the cusps to be arranged on the outside of
the tips.
The radula of H. japonica is not figured as it is practically
identical with that of H. occulta. One more cusp on the B-central
was noted in one radula of H. japonica but it was absent in the
other radula examined. This species also showed a slight tendency
to increase the number of cusps on the marginals more rapidly
than did //. occulta (see Table II). This practical identity of the
radulae, despite the divergence in opercula, is the reason for the
inclusion of Waldemaria as a section in the genus Hendersonia.
I am very doubtful if Miluna even deserves sectional rank, but
have seen no specimens.
