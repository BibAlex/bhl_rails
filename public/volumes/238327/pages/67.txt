This is the longest known of the desert Helices, yet does not
seem to have been collected many times, and I cannot find thai
living specimens have ever been taken. In spite of much exertion,
we ourselves were no more fortunate than our predecessors in this
respect. The type locality is said to be "near Indio, " but without
doubt this can be emended to "south of Indio," rather than north,
as the dead shells found by us in the cove back of Indian Well are,
except for their slightly smaller size, so nearly typical as to indicate
I hat the original specimens could not have been collected so very
far away. At this point the steep slope is, at the present time,
very dry, supporting only the scantiest vegetation, and even dead
shells proved difficult to find, although occurring scattered loosely
on the surface from, near the base of the slope to the top of the
ridge. Only 11 fairly good shells was the total catch of the party
in an hour or so of work. This and M. xerophila appear to be
species of the Santa Rosa Range; they are unknown from the
Sau Jacintos.
The largest specimen at hand measures: maximum diameter.
18.6; minimum diameter, 15.1 ; altitude, 10.5; diameter of umbilicus,
2.0 mm. It has 4 % whorls.

Shell strongly depressed, of moderate weight; whorls convex;
sutures distinct; last whorl strong y descending behind peristome.
Umbilicus wide and deep, contained about six times in the diameter
of (he shell, funicular, permeable, all the whorls easily visible to
the apex. Aperture strongly oblique, its deflexion about 45-50°.
Peristome but little thickened hardly reflexed except slightly at
the umbilicus, which it barely indents. Nuclear whorls heavily
covered with narrow, elongate papillae, ranked in oblique, forward
slanting lines so close together as to be almost or quite confluent.
the lines thus be ng transformed practically into low lirae; papillae
on subsequent whorls less crowded and always smaller and rounder
than the foregoing , being very obscure on the upper surface of the
