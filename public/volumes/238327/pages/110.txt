Failure to associate the sexes which show a decided contrast
in size, led to the synonymy indicated above. The present material
enables us to establish this synonymy without hesitation.
The male genitalia have been very superficially described for
the species. The anal tergite is truncate, with a small, shallow,
triangular impression above the elongate-trigonal supra-anal plate.
The cerci are ovate enlarged in distal two -fifths, the external
surfaces of this portion being concave, the internal surface armed
mesad with a large, erect tooth. The subgenital plate is short,
extending caudad to the median portion of the cerci; it is carinate
mesad, with apex very broadly emarginate, the lateral portions
short, straight, styliform but not articulated.

Phaula luzonica new species. Plate XIII, figures 5, 6 and 7.
This insect is nearest in relationship to P. phaneropteroides
Brunner, differing in the larger size, dark marking of the cephalic
tibiae at the auditory foramina, male genitalia (which, however,
are of the same general type) and much shorter ovipositor.
Type: d 71 ; Baguio, Benguet, Luzon, Philippine Islands. (From
C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 795.]
Vertex rather narrowly V-shaped and shallowly sulcate, the
lateral margins weakly concave and expanding weakly in distal
