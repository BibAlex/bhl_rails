The median vein branches meso-distad in females, near the apex
of the tegmina in males of this species.
The tegminal spots described by Brunner, when small, are dark
vinaceous. When larger, these spots are seen to have white centers
and in one female before us the more proximal are enlarged into
opaque white blotches, rimmed with dark vinaceous.
Length of body cf 29, 9 32 and 34; length of pronotYrm cf 7,
9 9 and 9.1; length of tegmen cf 35.8, 9 55.7 and 55.8; median
width of tegmen cf 11, 9 14 and 13.8; length of caudal femur
cf 16.3, 9 22.7 and 22; length of ovipositor 27.8 and 30 mm.
From the measurements of the original series, it would appear
probable that considerable individual variation in size and tegminal
development will be found in this insect.

The previously unknown male of this species differs from males
of Phyllomimus detersus (Walker) in the decidedly more flattened-
convex pronotum, with surface tuberculation somewhat weaker,
lateral lobes decidedly wider, with ventral margin very broadly
convex, less ample tegmina in proportion to body bulk, much more
hairy ventral surface of limbs and caudal femora which are minutely
denticulate dorsad and have their ventro-external margins armed
with fewer spines, which, however, become distinctly larger distad.
Compared with a female of Phyllomimus pallidus (Brunner),
this insect is found to show convergence in the pronotal flattening,
hairiness of the limbs and minute denticulation of the dorsal surface
of the caudal femora. That species is easily separated by the
immaculate pronotum, the punctulation of which is decided, lateral
lobes with ventral margin weakly obtuse-angulate, much smaller
male stridulating field, very much shorter cephalic femora and
very different armament of the ventral femoral margins.
