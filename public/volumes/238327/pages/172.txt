This insect appears to be very close to C. laetus (Redtenbacher),
differing in the much shortened organs of flight and dark genicular
areas of the caudal femora.
In the specimen here recorded the caudal femora have the
genicular areas tipped with a suffusion of brown, rather than
"apice extremo nigro-nitido." The male stridulating area is
proportionately smaller and less elongate than in males of laetus
before us, while the caudal tibiae have the dorso-internal spur
conspicuous and decidedly larger than any of the dorso-internal
spines. So close does it agree in other respects with laetus, that,
were these features not of decided diagnostic value, we would have
considered it a brachypterous example of that species.
The very narrow convex callosity of the pronotal lateral lobes
in this species and laetus is slightly narrower than in the related
C. glacliatus (Redtenbacher).
Length of body 16.8, length of pronotum 3.9, length of tegmen 13,
length of caudal femur 14.3 mm.

The female before us from Los Bafios agrees fully with Stal's
inadequate description of spinipes and we believe that examination
of the type will establish definitely this synonymy, first indicated
with a query by Redtenbacher.
Redtenbacher described longicorne, overlooking the fact that
macropterism and brachypterism as well as variation in size
