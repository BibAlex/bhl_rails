weakly curved dorsad. Subgenital plate very short, truncate, sur-
face concave mesad.
General coloration clay color. Mandibles blackish brown, with
a suffusion of the same above their bases. Vertex, antennal scrobes
and proximal joints of antennae marked with blackish brown, the
antennae showing very short annuli of this color and with inter-
sections of joints slightly darkened. Occiput with a postocular
sulcus blackish brown on each side. Pronotum with a blackish
brown suffusion latero-proximad on each side and a large suffusion
of the same occupying all of the area of the lateral lobes above the
humeral sinus and invading the disk, with internal margins parallel.
Disk of pronotum latero-mesad between these markings with flecks
of blackish brown and with a pair of minute flecks of the same mesad
at the base of the produced caudal portion. Tegmina with minute
intervals between veins and veinlets blackish brown. Abdomen
with a median row of clay colored diamond-shaped spots narrowly
delimited in blackish brown, mesad on each side is also a suffused,
longitudinal blackish brown band. Limbs with spines dark brown,
femora with a pre-genicular annulus of dark brown but with
apices themselves very pale, these markings strongest on caudal
femora. Cephalic and median tibiae suffused proximad and distad
with dark brown. Ovipositor amber brown, becoming clay color
proximad.

Nicsara 71 bifasciata (Redtenbacher)

XL1, p. 459, pi. IV, fig. 65. [d\ 9; Cape York and Rockhampton,
Queensland, Australia.]
Townsville, Queensland, Australia, November 4, 1899, (F. P.
Dodd), 1 cf .
This is one of the handsomest and most distinctively marked
species of the genus.
Length of body 34.5, length of pronotum 10, length of tegmen
42./, (least) median width of tegmen 6, length of cephalic femur
9.7, length of caudal femur 23.9 mm.
71 The best key to the genus Nicsara is that given by Brunner for the synonymic
Lobaspis, Abh. Senckenb. Naturforsch. Ges., XXIV, p. 267, (1898).
