ated with greenish-white crystals of willemite. The glaucochroite
is readily identified by the remarkable fact that the mineral is
bluish-green by daylight, but pink by artificial light. The largest
crystals measure 2 mm. in length.
Four crystals were measured the results being given in Table I.
Six forms are new: r (130), z (270), d (101), k (Oil), 1 (131,) and

y (122). The relative development of the faces and their position
are shown in figures 1 to 4.
Three types of crystals occur; these will be designated below as
Types I, II, and III (figs. 1, 2, and 3, respectively).
Type I (figure 1) is of rare occurrence, being limited to the
smaller cavities where the conditions were most favorable to perfect
growth The crystals show a well-developed prismatic zone, in
which there may be an oscillation of a (100), and m (110) ; terminat-
ed by a large, dull, and apparently etched dome, k(011); about
which is a prominent zone including d (101), e (111), f (121), and
1 (131).
Type II (figure 2) shows also a well-developed prismatic zone
but the dominant terminal form is the pyramid f (121); h (021) and
