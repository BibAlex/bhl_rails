criterion for separating these species as here recognized.

These specimens agree closely with ■ those here recorded as
E. pallidus (Redtenbacher), except in having a noticeably heavier,
longer and more truncate fastigium of the vertex, while the ovi-
positor averages shorter.

The insect which we recognize as this species is intermediate in
form of fastigium of vertex between E. varius (Walker) and E. so-
brinus (Bolivar) ; this process averages proportionately longer than
in varius but not as elongate nor as acute as in sobi-inus.
In the present material the tegminal costal margins are immacu-
late or faintly margined with brown. This feature is clearly
valueless as a specific factor in gracilis, except that it may be said
that these margins are sometimes embrowned in the present insect,
while in other species such coloration never occurs.
