The ventral femoral margins are armed with very small but
stout spines, as follows. Cephalic internal 2 to 3, cephalic external
1 to 2, median internal 0, median external 3 to 4, caudal internal
to 1, caudal external 7 to 9.
The present specimens are clay colored, the dorsal surface of
head and pronotum with very weak longitudinal streaks, the face
suffused toward the clypeus with dark brown, the mandibles
blackish except in proximo-external portions, the tegmina with
subobsolete, scattered brown flecks.
Length of body 31.7 and 30, length of fastigium of vertex 79 1.8
and 2, length of pronotum 8 and 8.1, length of tegmen 33.8 and
32.2, length of caudal femur 15 and 15.2, length of ovipositor 12.8
and 13.5 mm.
Pyrgocorypha philippina new species. Plate XXI, figure 1.
The present insect may be distinguished from the previously
known Asiatic species of the genus by the longer fastigium of the
vertex, heavier limb armament and dark proximal marking of
the ventro-external margins of the caudal femora.
In general size it agrees closely with P. formosanus (Matsumura
and Shiraki).
Type: cf ; Baguio, Benguet, Luzon, Philippine Islands. (From
C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 857.]
Size large for the genus, form robust. Fastigium of vertex
elongate; dorsal surface flat, heavily and irregularly rugose, with
79 As is customary, this measurement is taken from the ventro- cephalic base,
where a tooth occurs if present, to the apex.
