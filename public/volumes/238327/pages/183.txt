plate, it then shows a roundly elevated U-shaped ridge, above which
the surface is raised in a rounded Y-shaped ridge, the apices rounded
and projecting, while dorsad between these the surface is deeply
concave, with dorsal margin bilobate beneath the bifid apex of the
ultimate tergite. Subgenital plate medio-longitudinally subsul-
cate, lateral margins broadly convex to very slender apices, between
which the distal margin is U-emarginate, these lateral apices Sur-
mounted by slender tapering styles, each about three times as
long as its basal width. Limbs and their armament much as in
cryptosticta, except that the genicular lobes of all the femora are
bluntly rounded. Longest spine of cephalic tibiae slightly over
twice the tibial width at that point.
Allotype: 9 ; Dapitan, Mindanao, Philippine Islands. (From
C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection.]
Agrees closely with male, differing as follows. Production of
pronotum caudad decidedly shorter, the metazona three-quarters
as long as the prozona. Supra-anal plate and cerci much as in
cryptosticta. Ovipositor more elongate than in that species, the
apex of the ventral valves much as in dicera. Subgenital plate
medio-longitudinally subcarinate, distal third broadly angulate
emarginate with margins of this emargination feebly concave, 91
the lateral angles thus formed nearly as long as their basal width,
their apices sharply rounded and forming an angle of slightly less
than ninety degrees.
General coloration light yellowish brown, green distad on organs
of flight and caudal limbs; in life light green. Genicular lobes of
cephalic and caudal femora suffused distad with dark brown, this
narrowly margining the dorso-distal extremity of these members
as well, though there very weak on the cephalic femora. Antennae
and tegmina marked as in cryptostosticta. The males have a dark
brown suffusion on each tegmen at the caudal extremity of the
stridulating area.

those of the allotype first for the females. Length of body d 71 15

nsivc, occupying the distal two-thirds of the subgenital plate. In all other
features it agrees so very closely with the allotype that we believe this difference
to be attributable to individual variation.
