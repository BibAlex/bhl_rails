the drift of Palm Canyon at Station XII, represent a small, narrow,
quite evenly cylindrical form, somewhat different from the majority
of Arizona specimens (e.g., drift of Salt River near Tempe, collected
by L. -E. Daniels; drift of San Pedro River near Benson, collected
by H. A. Pilsbry and L. E. Daniels; foothills of Plumosa Range,
Yuma County, collected by George S. Hutson) with which I have
been able to compare them. Pilsbry 's original figure, drawn from
a Texas specimen, differs in much the same way. The material
is, however, too scanty to be considered as showing that the Palm
Canyon specimens belong to a race or subspecies realty distinguish-
Figs. 1-4. Gastrocopta pellucida hordeacella (Pilsbry). Camera outlines of
four specimens from Station XII, Palm Canyon, California, showing variation
in contour of shell and form of denticles in aperture.
able from true hordeacella. The specimens are of most interest
in that the known distribution of the group of Pupillidae which
they represent is thus pushed many miles to the westward. Indeed
it is thought that the species is recorded here from the state of
California for the first time.
