are as figured by Brunner, except that all are more delicate. The
median and caudal limbs are suffused with old rose. The re-
markable coloration of the costal margin of the tegmina has been
inadequately described. The margin itself is tawny, then comes a
narrow band of white, interrupted by frequent slate-colored flecks,
followed by a narrow band of ochraceous-tawny.

This astonishing insect represents the most specialized develop-
ment yet known in the section of the Pseudophyllinae including
pale green or brown species which have smooth tegmina. In the
females at hand the pronotum is armed with a pair of large spines
on each side of the cephalic margin of the disk, of which the lateral
are very large, two large spines on each side of the mesozona,
situated on the lateral margins of the disk and eight spines on its
caudal margin, which grade from the two smallest mesad to the
two largest laterad; the lateral lobes have the ventral margin armed
with (3 to 5) large spines.
Length of body 38 and 36, length of pronotum 6.8 and 6.8,
height of longest pronotal spine 2.1 and 2.1, length of tegmen 47
and 47, greatest tegminal width 18.7 and 18.8, length of cephalic
femur 13.4, length of caudal femur 22.3 and 22.6, length of ovi-
positor 16 mm.

The delicate and uniform coloration (except that the costal
margin of the tegmina is narrowly yellowish and the antennae
distad are delicately and finely annulate) and evenness of tegminal
venation give to this insect an exceptionally neat appearance. A
comparison of this genus with Togona will be found under T. philip-
pina, here described.
