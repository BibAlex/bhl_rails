RECORDS OF FISHES FOR THE EASTERN AND SOUTHERN
UNITED STATES.
By Henry W. Fowler.
The present paper is a report on the collections obtained for the
Academy, chiefly during 1921. The materials and notes for the
Middle Atlantic States are given first. They contain some inter-
esting and unusual items of more local distribution. It is, however,
chiefly in the streams of the Southern Alleghanies that the greater
results were gathered. These were largely from collections made
by the writer with Mr. Edwin Fowler, for the Fowler-Academy
Expedition of October 1921. Eight rare or little-known species
were rediscovered. The American Museum of Natural History
in New York City, through Mr. John T. Nichols, very kindly
submitted the collections made in Virginia and North Carolina by
Mr. E. R. Dunn. As they contain two very interesting species, they
are noted accordingly. A duplicate set of specimens had been
generously donated to the Academy for the services rendered in the
study of this material. Ten figures, representing the rare species
hitherto unfigured, are given.
