The present material proves conclusively the synonymy indi-
cated above, caused by Brunner's failure to associate the sexes of
this species.
The anal tergite of the female has not been described. It is
strongly specialized, being produced in a pair of slender, straight
processes above the small, shield-shaped supra-anal plate.

The present female apparently represents the previously unknown
female of nigro-signata. It agrees closely with that sex of E. tenera
Brunner. In addition to having the forking of the branch of the
median vein more distal in position, the present female has the
anal tergite produced in a pair of very slender, slightly decurved
and divergent, straight processes, above the shield-shaped supra-
anal plate, these processes more slender and elongate and more
widely separated than in tenera.
Length of body 16.7 (shrivelled), length of pronotum 5.3, caudal
width of pronotal disk 3.4, length of tegmen 36.7, greatest tegminal
width 7.3, length of cephalic femur 6.2, length of caudal femur
20.8, length of ovipositor 10.7 mm.
Elbenia makilingae new species. Plate XIII, figures 1 and 2.
Known from a unique female, this sex differs from any pre-
viously described female of the genus, except E. manillensis Pictet, 22
in the brevity of the ovipositor. From that insect the present
differs in the smaller size and shorter pronotum, with lateral lobes
no deeper than wide.
20 It appears very possible that Brunner's E. modesla, described from the
Philippines, will prove to be a synonym of manillensis. Pictet describes the
ovipositor of that species as short, but does not give the length.
