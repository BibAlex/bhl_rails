We concur with Karny in considering Dohrn's M. pictipes a
synonym of this species. Dohrn, however, stated for the male
cerci, "apice bifidi, subtus in medio dente brevi acuto instructi."
There appears to be some inaccuracy here, as the males before us,
though agreeing closely in other respects, have the strongly in-
curved cerci bidentate distad and, though unarmed ventrad, bearing
mesad on the dorso-external margin a stout, uncinate tooth, directed
caudad.

The present insect is widely distinct from A. brongniarti Karny,
75 We fully agree with Dohrn (Ent. Zeit. Stettin, LXVI, p. 2^3, (1905),' in
believing that Pictet was in error in giving Java as the type locality for this
species. All subsequent material studied indicates that this remarkable insect
is peculiar to Borneo.
