58 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Vol. LXXIV
(1910), and that of another specimen 41 is given here (Plate VI, fig.
26). As Pilsbry has already pointed out, this radula is truly
helicinid in character. Although possessing certain marked, indi-
vidual peculiarities, in others it forms a connecting link between the
Vianinae and the Helicininae.
The A-central is heavy and has a single, large, outer hook
which makes it superficially resemble that of Lucidella. The,
B-central has three heavy cusps and somewhat resembles that of
the more primitive species of Eutrochatella. The comb-lateral
has only 3 large cusps, and the heavy outer process is more like
that of the Vianinae than like any of the preceding genera. Never-
theless, in general shape it is distinct, and more closely related
to the Helicininae. The accessory plate is small and heavy and has
an inner projection which fits behind the outer end of the comb-
lateral. The anterior edge is slightly reflected and must act as a
rather efficient brace to the comb-lateral. The inner 14 marginals
are unicuspid, although the base is broad, as in all of the
Helicinidae.
While the description of the radula of the type species throws
light on the relationships of the genus s. s., the other groups need
examination. As pointed out under Lucidella, it is very probable
that other distantly related small species have been included in
the genus, as a whole. Since Chitty's description of the many
species and "genera", the group seems to have received very little
attention.
