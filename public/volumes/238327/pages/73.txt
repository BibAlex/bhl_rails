coating which is yellowish near the assay, and white farther out.
Globules of lead are obtained by reduction with soda in the R. F.
Composition. A preliminary determination of lead gave 27.78%
Pb. A complete analysis (shown in Table I) was then made by
Dr. J. Edward Whitfield on 1.25 grams of carefully selected acicular
crystals. It was impossible to free the needles from some sulfides
and quartz. The loss of 1.18% in the analysis is due to the
latter mineral. Column II shows the analysis after deducting
8.15% sulphides, and recalculating to 100%. The ratios of the
constitutents are shown in column III, and approximate Pb : Sb : S
= 2:6:11, corresponding to Pb ? Sb 6 Sâ€ž or2PbS.3Sb 2 S 3 .

The mineral thus belongs to the "Acidic Division" of Dana,
with a ratio of PbS : Sb 2 S 3 of less than 1 : 1. Although no "Acidic"
lead sulfantimonite has heretofore been discovered, an analagous
sulfbismuthite, rezbanyite, has long been known:
Rezbairyite 2PbS.3Bi 2 S 3
Koeleyite 2PbS.3Sb 2 S 3
The relation of keeleyite in composition to the other lead sulf-
antimonites is shown in Table II, and Figure 1.
