Conocephalus (Xiphidion) melas (Haan)

There is scarcely any doubt that Redtenbacher has described a
recessively colored specimen of the species as nigro-geniculatum.
Borneo, 1 cf.
Singapore, British Straits Settlements, (from C. F. Baker), 2 cf .
This handsome and strikingly colored species is now known to
have a very wide distribution. A considerable unrecorded series
is before, us from Japan and China.
In the specimens here recorded, the ventro-external margins of
the caudal femora are armed with two to four small spines. The
measurements of the Singapore males are as follows; length of
body 14.7 and 15.2, length of pronotum 3.3 and 3.7, length of
tegmen 13.9 and 14.5, length of caudal femur 12.7 and 13.8 mm.
Conocephalus (Xiphidion) formosus (Redtenbacher)
1891. Xiphidium formosum Redtenbacher, Verh. Zool.-bot. Ges. Wien,
XLI, p. 530. [d", 9 ; eastern Java.]
Pasoeroean, eastern Java, (determined as formosus and presented
by Saussure), 1 d\ 1 9 , [A. N. S. P.].
The greatly reduced tegmina and broad oblique suffusion of
brown on the enlarged portion of the caudal femora readily dis-
tinguish this species from C. melas (Haan), to which it is closely
related. The ventro-external femoral margins are armed with
one to three minute spines in the pair before us.
Conocephalus (Xiphidion) vestitus (Redtenbacher)
1891. Xiphidium vestitum Redtenbacher, Verh. Zool.-bot. Ges. Wien,
XLI, p. 529. [cf, Philippine [Islands].]
1920. Conocephalus sannio Karny, Verh. Zool.-bot. Ges. Wien, LXX, p. 27.
[cf, 9 ; Los Banos, Philippine Islands.]
Karny apparently overlooked the description of vestitus, the
name sannio being based on material, apparently identical, except
in being slightly darker in coloration than Redtenbacher's type.
Los Banos, Laguna, Luzon, Philippine Islands, 1917, 1 9 ,
[A. N. S. P.]; (from C. F. Baker), 1 cf , 1 9 .
Tnis is one of the handsomest species of the genus, its coloration
distinctive and strikingly contrasted. Length of body; c? 11.5,
9 12 and 12.5; length of pronotum d 1 3.4, 9 3.7 and 3.9; length
of tegmen c? 5.3, 9 2.7 and 2.7 85 ; length of caudal femur cf 14,
9 13.7 and 14.8; length of ovipositor 6.7 and 7 mm.
85 The least exposed dorsal length is, however, only 1.7 mm.
