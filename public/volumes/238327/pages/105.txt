Without males we are unable to determine these specimens with
certainty. Brunner has described lamellosa from the male genitalia
alone, but the measurements show it to be a species with more
slender tegmina than cochleata. As the present specimens agree
in this respect, we have assigned them accordingly. In all other
features, except those of proportion, they are similar to the Amboina
female here recorded as cochleata.
In these females as well as in the specimen of cochleata, the teg-
mina have the veinlets of the distal section of the enlarged portion
of the anal field buffy, with minute intervals dark brown. From
there to the apex the sutural margin has the minute spaces between
the green veinlets similarly dark brown. These latter markings
are so fine that they are scarcely distinguishable to the naked eye.
Length of body 24.5 and 25, length of pronotum 5.4 and 5.8,
length of tegmen 38 and 39.3, greatest width of tegmen 6.9 and 7,
length of caudal femur 26.7 and 27, length of ovipositor 10 and
10.9 mm.
Casigneta pellucida Brunner.

Dapitan, Zamboanga District, Mindanao, Philippine Islands,
(from C. F. Baker), 1 9 .
As stated by Brunner, this species differs from C. cochleata
Brunner mainly in the paler general coloration and the triangular
female subgenital plate. The tegmina show the same delicate
marking we have noted for C. lamellosa Brunner, and in addition
have a very small blackish brown fleck at the base of the anal vein.
Length of body 23, length of pronotum 5.8, length of tegmen 38,
greatest width of tegmen 7.6, length of caudal femur 28.7, length
of ovipositor 8.3 mm.
