The general coloration of this remarkable species is a very light
milky green. The male before us is immaculate, except that the
tegmina have a black spot in the second areola of the anal field
beyond the enormous stridulating area, toward the anal vein, and
the subgenital plate is shining black with styles, however, pale.
The female here recorded is marked with hay's russet, as figured
by Brunner, the markings of the tegmina being, however, less
heavy.
