CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC NOTES ON WAVELLITE FROM BOLIVIA,
PENNSYLVANIA, ARKANSAS, AND BOHEMIA.
By Samuel G. Gordon.
Wavellite usually occurs as hemispherical or globular aggregates
with a radiated crystalline structure, or very rarely as druses
of minute crystals. The crystallographic data on the mineral are
rather unsatisfactory due to the small size of the crystals heretofore
found and their imperfect character. On the 1921 Vaux- Academy
Expedition to the Andes, the writer obtained large slabs of beautiful
prismatic crystals measuring up to 2 X 3 X 6 mm. This material
forms the basis of this investigation. A study was also made of
the other specimens of wavellite in the collections, with the meas-
urement of crystals from Pennsylvania, Arkansas, and Bohemia.
Crystals of wavellite were first measured by Senff 1 from Frank-
enberg, Saxony. These showed the following forms: b (010),
m (110), n (340), q (13.1.0), p (101), s (111), and o (121).
Des Cloizeaux 2 noted the following forms on wavellite from
Montebras, France: b (010), m (110), n (340), s (111), and the
doubtful form r (5.11.6).
Cesaro 3 described wavellite from Arbrefontaine, Belgium, with
the forms b (010), a (100), m (110), s (111), o (121), and p (101).
He suggested that the doubtful form r (5.11.6) of Des Cloizeaux
was probably o (121).
Further examination of a crystal from Montebras by Ungemach 4
gave in addition the forms h (310), and 1 (430).
Ungemach also measured good crystals from Moore's Mill,
Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, 5 which showed the combination
b (010), a (100), m (110), 1 (430), i (320), h (320), o (121), and s(lll).
Finally, Wherry 6 listed the following forms on crystals from
Hellertown, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania: b (010), a (100),
1 (430), m (110), n (340), p (101), s (111), and o (121).
The axial ratios obtained by these writers are listed in Table I.
A new value determined on crystals from Bolivia is given in Table II.
