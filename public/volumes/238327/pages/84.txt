crystals, or to poor reflections. The results of the measurements
of the others are given in Table II.
The following forms were noted, (fig. 1) : a (100), b (010), m (110)
w (650), 1 (430), B (10.7.0), z (850), and p (101), of which w, B,
and z are new. Their characters in brief are: a (100) exists as a
very narrow face; b (010) is a large brilliant face which usually
gives multiple reflections; m (110) is a wide pearly face, free of
striations, and usually giving fair, bright reflections; w (650), 1
(430), B (10.7.0), and z (850) are line faces forming a striated zone
between m (110) and a (100); p (101) is a wide, deeply striated
dome, giving a series of multiple reflections, of which the p angle
is fairly constant.
The average coordinate angles of m (110) and p (101) were used
to determine the axial elements given at the top of Table II.
The cleavage of wavellite was given by Senff as parallel to p
(101) and b (010) rather perfect; and by Des Cloizeaux as parallel
to m (110) and b (101). The only cleavage noted by the writer
was a very perfect one parallel to m (110).

Wavellite, Trimble's Mine, Pennsylvania
Trimble's mine is the famous locality for wavellite listed in the
older books as "White Horse Station, Chester County." The old
abandoned limonite pit so described is situated about a mi l e
northwest of Planebrook Station on the Philadelphia and Chester
Valley branch of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, in Chester
