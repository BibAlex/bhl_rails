Fig. 4. Gnomonic projection of glaucochroite forms.
The last value approaches that of tephroite, as shown in the
following table, in which all the members of the Olivine group
are listed in the order of increasing length of the a-axis:

The refractive indices of one of the crystals measured were
higher than n 1.740, so that the present mineral is probabty inter-
mediate in composition between glaucochroite and tephroite.
WlLLEMITE
One of the specimens obtained consisted essentially of frank-
linite and willemite on which was a cavity containing a number
of brilliant, greenish, transparent, highly modified crystals of
willemite associated with glaucochroite. A single crystal, ^ x 1 mm.
was measured. The general habit of the 'crystals is indicated in
