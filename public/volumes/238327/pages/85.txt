County. The mineral occurred in the form of white stalactitic
masses of cryptocrystalline to crystalline structure, and occasionally
in druses of very minute crystals.
A single crystal measuring 3^8 by 3^ mm. was measured. The
results are given in Table III. The following combination of forms
was noted, fig. 2: b (010); m (110), B (10.7.0), N (210), f (520),
and y (122); of which B, N, f, and y are new.
A crystal measured by Dr. Edgar T. Wherry 7 from this locality
showed the following forms: b (010), a (100), i (320), 1 (430),
m (110), n (340), p (101), and o (121).

Wavellite, Hellertown, Pennsylvania.
As noted above, crystals from the Hellertown locality, Lehigh
County, were described by Wherry. As the material collected
by the writer at this mine were different in habit from those already
described, a single crystal, | X 1 mm. in size was therefore measured.
The results are given in Table IV.
The following combination was found b (010), in (110), o (121),
and y (122). The dominant pyramid y (122) is a new form.
