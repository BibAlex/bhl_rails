Phyllomimus ampullae eus (Haan)

This species differs widely from P. deter sus (Walker). 58 The
tegminal markings are distinctive, though very faint. In the
present species the wings fail to reach the extremities of the tegmina
by a very brief distance, but show, nevertheless, decided atrophy,
quite unfitting them for even usefulness as parachutes.
The present specimen is much smaller than the female described
by Brunner as pallidas. The species, like detersus, is probably
subject to decided size variation. Length of body 27, length of
pronotum 6.1, length of tegmen 40, median width of tegmen 13.2,
length of wing 35.8, greatest width of wing 13.8, length of cephalic
femur 6.1, length of caudal femur 13.1, length of ovipositor 13.2,
median width of ovipositor 3 mm.
Phyllomimus tonkinae new species. Plate XVII, figure 4.
This insect appears nearest P. inquinatus Brunner, described
from a unique female, from Penang, British Straits Settlements.
The present male differs from the description and a male of that
species before us, in being dark green in coloration, the tegmina
with nearly colorless areas between the veins distad, with minute
callosities mesad in all the larger areolae, which are whitish, except
those between the ulnar and median vein which are dark. It is a
much heavier and decidedly less delicate insect, the male body bulk
being much greater and the organs of flight less developed, the
egmina narrowing more decidedly distad to the much narrower
67 The body is shrivelled in this specimen.
68 The above synonymy has recently been indicated by Karny {Zool. Mededeel.
Rijks Mus. Nat. Hist. Leiden, V, p. 175, {1920)).
