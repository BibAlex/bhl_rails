appear to be marked off proximad by a slight groove, so that they
have much the appearance of large, triangular cusps. The small
form is the one figured; it has a much smaller number of the mar-
ginals (80 as against 106), and the comb-lateral has one more
cusp and all are longer and narrower than in the larger form.
This species is apparently quite closely related to H. neritella.
The operculum of this group is very similar to that of Tristramia,
s. s. It has a heavy, reddish, horny plate, and a thin calcareous
plate; the latter is somewhat thickened towards the columella!-
but incomplete towards the palatal margin. Although the group
certainly belongs with Tristramia, it is rather divergent and needs
further study before any accurate estimate of its relationship
can be stated. As already remarked, there are certain resemblances
to Tamsiana, and it is possible that the two groups connect up in
the lesser Antilles. Many of the species included in Subglobulosa
A. J. W. and F estiva A. J. W. have the yellowish operculum, with
the poorly-developed horny plate, which is more characteristic
of Oligyra than of this group.
