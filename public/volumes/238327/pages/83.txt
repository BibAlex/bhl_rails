Wavellite, Llallagua, Bolivia
The Llallagua tin mines are situated on the northeast slope of
Cerro de Llallagua, about . 100 kilometers southeast of Oruro,
Bolivia. The deposits are phenomenal, and form the richest known
mines of cassiterite. The ore bodies are distinct fissure fillings, or

County, Pennsylvania; 3. Hellertown, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania.
mineralized brecciated zones, in a quartz-porphyry which forms the
core of the mountain. The principal metallic minerals are cassit-
erite, pyrite, wolframite, and bismuthinite.
The wavellite occurs locally in vugs in the quartz-pyritic portions
of the veins. Frequently three generations of wavellite crystals
are to be seen.
The crystals are colorless, the smaller individuals being quite
limpid. The luster is vitreous, excepting on the unit prism m
(110), which is pearly. The mineral also occurs at Llallagua in
pale greenish stalactitic masses. The largest specimen in the
Vaux Collections is a slab measuring 25 X 35 cm., and entirely
covered with wavellite crystals. The crystals show the usual
tendency to form subparallel aggregates, with distinct individuals
in the cavities.
Preliminary measurements were made on twelve crystals, of
which half were rejected due to subparallel growth present in the
