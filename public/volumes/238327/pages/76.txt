CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC NOTES ON GLAUCOCHROITE, WILLEMITE,
CELESTITE, AND CALCITE FROM FRANKLIN, NEW JERSEY
By Samuel G. Gordon.
On a recent trip to the famous zinc mines at Franklin, N. J.
the writer secured a series of specimens for the Vaux Collections
which included the following
minerals: calcite, celestite, ga-
lena, glaucochroite, hardy-
stonite, willemite, and zincite.
Crystallographic measure-
ments of the glaucochroite,
willemite and calcite showed
the presence of new forms;
while the celestite represents
a new occurrence of this
mineral.
Glaucochroite
Glaucochroite was described
by Penfield and Warren 1 in
1899. The original specimens
consisted of small prismatic
crystals in nasonite. As no
terminal planes were found,
the twin-plane (Oil) was used
in calculating the axial ratios.
Subsequently Palache 2 de-
scribed briefly the results of
measurements on two ter-
minated crystals.
The specimens which form-
ed the basis of the present
study are far superior to those
which have been heretofore
found. Several large masses
of franklinite- willemite ore Fig. 1. Glaucochroite, Franklin, N. J.
contain fractures lined with small glaucochroite crystals associ-
