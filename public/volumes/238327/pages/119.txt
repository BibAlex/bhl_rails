This species is closely related to H. javanica Brunner, differing
in the tegmina which are obscurely maculate and which, in the
females, narrow less evenly distad and are, in consequence, broader
meso-distad. A short, suffused postocular line of brown is found
on each side of the head, this continued as a short line of the
same color along the lateral margins of the pronotal disk at its
cephalic margin.
Brunner does not mention the striclulating area of the tegmina
in the male type. In the male before us this area is occupied by a
close network of veinlets, the striclulating vein itself subobsolete
with no distinct convexity at the costal margin. This appears to
agree closely with the type described for the male of H. javanica
Brunner.
The female subgenital plate is minutely emarginate distad,
this affording a feature of decided difference from javanica.

This insect, known from a single female, is closely related tc
H. fusco-spinosa Brunner. It differs in the larger size, pale im-
maculate femoral spines and more deeply cleft apex of the sub-
genital plate. The tegmina are similar but more heavily maculate,
this being, however, probably no stronger than in maximum in-
tensive individuals of that species.
