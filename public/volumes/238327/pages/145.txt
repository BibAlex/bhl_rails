occupying six joints, above the bases of the caudal femora.

Brunner's ferrugineus is probably, at least in part, a synonym of
this species.

AGRAECIINAE
EPPIOIDES 68 new genus.
The present genus has no close relatives. The truncate conical
vertex suggests that of Oxylakis, but is sulcate dorsad only at its
apex. The pronotum, with disk flattened, in shape somewhat
suggests the Listroscelid genus Hexacentrus; its lateral lobes much
deeper but otherwise agreeing with those of Oxylakis. The teg-
mina widen gradually distad, as in the Listroscelid genus Para-
hexacentrus and are strikingly truncate, though no. to as great a
degree as in Eppla. The armament of the limbs in some respects
resembles that of Oxylakis truncatipennis Bolivar. 69 The armament
of the mesosternum and metasternum is nearest that of Oxystethus.
The ovipositor shows a striking development, not known to us in
any other genus of the Tettigoniidae.
In spite of all these differences, the present species runs to
68 In allusion to the very superficial resemblance, which the truncate tegmina
give individuals of this genus, to the tropical American Eppia truncatipennis Stal.
69 A species which we believe should be removed from that genus.
