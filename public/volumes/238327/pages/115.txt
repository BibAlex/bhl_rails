The specimen from Amboina agrees fully with Brunner's de-
scription in form of the male cerci. In the Obi male the minute
subapical internal tooth is absent from the cerci.
The literature on this genus is extremely unsatisfactory and
without more material we cannot solve the problems which at
present confront the student. It would appear very probable that
melanonota Stal is a synonym of ensis (Haan), as is also marginata
Fritze, in Karl. 29
Until a complete revision of the genus is accomplished we can
only state that in the material before us two distinct species are
represented, one unquestionably brunneri of Karny, the other
melanonota of Stal.

The Moluccan series has the pronotum immaculate except for a
broad transverse band of blackish across the caudal portion of the
disk above the humeral sinus. This band is sometimes paler in its
cephalic half. The two distal cereal teeth in the males vary in
their curvature and in the first tooth, which in form ranges from
chisel-shaped to acute.
PSEUDOPSYRA new genus
Known only from the male sex, we are in consequence unable to
state whether this genus should be referred to the Group Psyrae or
28 Described for spinoso-laminata as scarcely longer than the pronotum, (7
millimeters), by Brunner, Verh. Zool.-bot. Ges. Wien, XLI, p. 80, (1891).
