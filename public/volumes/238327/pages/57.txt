Growth has been retarded towards the columellar wall and accentu-
ated towards the palatal margin. This idea is substantiated by
the crushed and thickened growth-lamellae along the basal and
columellar margins. A. J. Wagner's figures (1905, 1907) are very
diagrammatic; that of Fischer (1893), although somewhat vague,
shows the fundamental structure much better. The separation of
this group from Eutrochatella s. s., even as a subgenus, is only
justifiable on the grounds of the peculiar shell and opercular
characters.
Subgenus EUTROCHATELLA s. s. West Indies; Venezuela???
Section Ustronia A. J. W. Cuba.
Uslronia A. J. Wagner (1908). Type (now chosen) H. sloanii d'Orbigny
(1845). Cuba. (=H. sloanei A. J. W. and authors, not of d'Orbigny).
The radula of the type species has been figured and described
by Troschel (1856-63). I have re-examined this species, 52 and have
also studied E. acuminata columellaris 53 and E. remota. 5i I am
unable to name any definite characters of the radula that will
separate this group from the next. It appears to have a smaller
number of unicuspid marginals than does Eutrochatella s. s. The
specimen of E. acuminata columellaris has a minute, but very
sharp-pointed cusp at the inner end of the margin of the B-central.
Section Excavata A. J. Wagner. Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica.
Excavata A. J. Wagner (1907). Type (by tautonomy) H. excavata Pfr.
(1855). Haiti.
In this section the radula of E. chrysostoma ("Sh." Pfr.) (1850)
has been described and figured by Troschel (1856-63).
Section Eutrochatella s. s. Jamaica.
Ampullina Blainville (1825). Not Saint-Fond (1803) etc. Type A.
striata Blainville (1825).
Trochatella Swainson (1840). Type H. pulchella Gray (1825). Jamaica.
Not Trochatella Lesson (1830).
Eutrochatella Fischer (1885). Type H. pulchella Gray.
Granifera A. J. Wagner (1907). Type H. pulchella Gray.
In this section the radula of the type species of the genus 55
has been examined and is figured (Plate VI, figs. 31 and 32).
Troschel (1856-63) has described and figured that of E. tankervillii
(Gray) (1825). His statement that all of the marginals are unicuspid
