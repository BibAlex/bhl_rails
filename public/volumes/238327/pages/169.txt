It is very possible that gracilis may be referred to synonymy
under sobrinus, when these apparently plastic species are better
known.

The male here recorded has the fastigium of the vertex of no
greater length than in males from Sumatra assigned to E. gracilis
(Redtenbacher). In the present male, however, it is distinctly
more slender and fully as acuminate as in the Javanese female
before us.

Chloroxiphidiox new subgenus
In 1915, Rehn and Hebard published a key to the subgenera of
the genus Conocephalus}- Little work has been done on the genus
from that portion of the World here under consideration and we
are not surprised to find an undescribed subgenus represented by
certain species from Australasia and Malaysia.

spines of the dorsal margins of the caudal tibiae and only differentiated from
them by having a basal socket.
