I have been able to obtain but one specimen of H. neritella
diplocheila A. J. W. 30 The animal was almost completely destroyed
by dermestids, but by washing it out carefully, I obtained
examples of all of the kinds of teeth, and a few clumps with the
centrals, comb-laterals, accessory plate, and a few of the inner
marginals still clinging together. The centrals are not arranged
in their natural position in the figure (Plate III, fig. 6), and the
R-central, especially is not foreshortened as usually seen.
The markings of the R-central are peculiar. The A-central
has a peculiar shelf-like projection, which bears three, deep-set,
large, rounded cusps. The B and C centrals are very similar to
those of Tenuis, but are shown from a somewhat different angle.
The comb-lateral has a rather narrow basal plate (Plate IV, fig.
17). The accessory plate has a small body but a large lanceolate
appendix, and the reflected anterior portion forms a quite promi-
nent shelf, which juts out almost at right angles to the body of
the plate. The innermost marginals are very short and broad,
not over one-half as long as the longest ones. All of the definitive
marginals have sickle-shaped tips, with wings which remotely
resemble those of the section Succincta of Oligyra, but are much
better-developed.
In addition, I have examined H. adspersa Pfr. (1839), both the
large, typical form and a smaller variety H. a. marmorata d'Orb.
(1845) = //. tenuilabris Pfr. (1848) 31 . This Cuban species has
sharper cusps on the A-central (Plate VII, fig. 37) and also on the
comb-lateral (Plate IV, fig. 17 A). The wings on the marginals
are more prominent than in H. neritella, and, in certain views,
10 1 dried specimen; A. N. S. P. no. 104391; collected at Orange Hill, Montego
Bay, Jamaica, by A. P. Brown. This is H. n. angulata C. B. Adams (1851),
not H. angulata Sowerby (1842).
31 3 alcoholic specimens, sent me by John B. Henderson; from Western Cuba.
