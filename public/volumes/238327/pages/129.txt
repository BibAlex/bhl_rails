Cleandrus colosseus new species. Plate XVI, figures 12 and 13.
This, the largest Pseudophyllid known, is closely related to
C. titan (White). In addition to the larger size, the male before
us differs from that sex of titan in the smaller number of equally
decided pronotal tubercles, the much broader and much more
inflated tegmina, median femora which are smooth dorsad and
caudal femora armed with a row of minute blunt tubercles dorsad
instead of stout spines. The ventral femoral margins are also
much less strongly armed with much smaller spines, none of which
show any tendency toward lamellation.
Type : cf ; Sandakan, British North Borneo. (From C. F. Baker.)
[Hebard Collection, Type no. 813.]
Size very large and robust. Vertex as in C. dyaka here described.
Pronotum with surface mesad supplied with (about thirty) stout,
blunt, prominent tubercles, with two very deeply impressed trans-
verse sulci; caudal margin of disk weakly and bluntly obtuse
angulate and supplied with a few low tubercles; lateral lobes with
margins strongly and thickly tuberculate, these tuberculations
longest on cephalic margin. Tegmina very large and strongly
inflated; costal margin broadly convex, sutural margin showing
broad concavity meso-distad, thence broadly convex to the rather
strongly rounded apex; mediastine vein oblique. Prosternum
unarmed. Cerci and subgenital plate as in dyaka, except that the
styles are narrowly paddle-shaped. Ventral margins of femora
armed with small spines, those of the caudal femora being more
elongate distad, as follows. Cephalic internal 3 and 4, cephalic
external 0, median internal 6 and 7, median external 5 and 6,
caudal internal 13 and 14, caudal external 11 and 12. Spines on
caudal tibiae likewise small and slender, showing no lamellation.
General coloration light green. Antennae with brown suffusions
forming elongate, vague annuli. Tegmina in proximal area between
anal and ulnar veins with a large opaque, buffy, circular marking,
margined with brown and with a dot of brown in its centre; branch
of median vein, from near its base, showing a very slender brown
line.
Length of body 56, length of pronotum 17.6, greatest width of
pronotal disk 16.3, length of tegmen 99.3, approximate width of
