We find that the genus Furnia agrees so closely with Elbenia in
the great majority of generic and group characters that we refer it,
without hesitation, to the present position in the Group Psyrae.
The auditory foramina of the cephalic tibiae are conchate on both
sides in this genus and, for this reason alone, it had been assigned a
position in the Group Anaulocomerae.
The specimen before us agrees closely with the original de-
scription. We would note that the vertex, at its base only, is
nearly as wide as the first antennal joint. The triangular pro-
jections of the anal tergite lie on each side of the shield-shaped
supra-anal plate. The tegmina show a small brown suffusion
proximo-laterad in the anal field.
Length of body 23.5, length of pronotum 5.8, length of tegmen
40.7, greatest width of tegmen 8.8, length of cephalic femur 7.8,
length of caudal femur 23. 3, 22 length of ovipositor 11 mm.

The last two specimens are larger than the type, but agree closely
in all proportions and other characters given. Males may prove
the presence of more than one species having the pronotum shal-
lowly though thickly impresso-punctulate.
Length of body (the measurements of the Philippine specimens
are given first) 23.3, 24 and 24.2, length of pronotum 4.8, 5.6 and
5.6, caudal width of pronotal disk 3.1, 3.3-3.3, length of tegmen
31.2, 35 and 36.2, width of tegmen 6.8, 8.2 and 8, length of caudal
2 This dimension is given by Karny as 35.5, probably a printers error for 25.5.
