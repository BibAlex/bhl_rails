better development of the wing on the accessory plate, which is more
like thai of the subgenus Alcadia. The centrals are closer to those
of Oligyra s. s., as is also the comb-lateral. As shown in
The synoptic key, the especial characteristics of this group are:
the wing on the marginals, the increased number of teeth, and the
tendency for the cusps on the A-central to be reduced to a small
number at the extreme outer tip. This last character and the wing
mi the marginals, which is shown in the figure of 0. oweniana
coccinostoma (Plate V, fig. 24), separate Succincta from all other
groups. In 0. cacaguelita, the A-central has a triangular expansion
of the tip, similar to the other species, but the cusps are either
pracl ically absent or are very much worn in the species, as compared
to 0. f. strebeli, is probably correlated with the difference in size.
All of the species show a tendency to increase the number of the
cusps on the marginals very rapidly.
0. cacaguelita is the only South American species that I can
place definitely in this group. The section Tamsiana, which Wagner
places very near his section Gemma, appears from the radula, and
also from the texture of the operculum, to be a section in Helicina.

â€¢'"' last three sectional names are included simply for completeness; they
may represent perfectly valid groups.
I ischer (1885) names the type of the genus Helicina, and then gives', in
parentheses and without remark, examples of each group. However, he seems
ike an attempt to name the types, as in the first group they are correctly
For this reason, I have chosen, as far as possible, his examines as types
oi each group. Emoda II. and A. Adams is an exception, as A. J. Wagner, con-
trary to his usual habit, uses this group in an emended sense.
