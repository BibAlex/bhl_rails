The species has been collected in anthesis also in July, Oct-
ober, and December, and in fruit in February, liarch, April, May,
and September. It has been found on ancient sand-dunes, in
roadside ditches, in low pinelands near swimi.iing-pools , in pine
woods, flatwoods, moist grassy openings in live oak hammocks,
wet sandy meadows, moist pinebarrens, moist sedgy places, low
black sandy muck near bays, and wet places in general.
Recorded common names include "buttons" and "pipe\Tort".
Martin in the reference cited above discusses the endosperm
morphology, while Femald gives a very detailed discussion of
the supposed occurrence of the species in Virginia, a record

is a depauperate specimen. Sheets number 156011 aind 186012 in
the Pomona College herbarium contain mixtures. The specimen on
the former sheet is actually Eriocaulon septan gulare V/ith. and
belongs on sheet 186012, collected by Brewer & Chickering at
