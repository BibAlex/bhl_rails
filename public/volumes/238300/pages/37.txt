3k PKYTOLOGIA Vol. U, no. 1
to tliinJc tliat prooably only a small remnent of a monoecious
"core" exists in tlais species.
By our ovm reasoning vre should "be 'boTond to accord to J.
monosperma .^nd to <J^ Asliel , also, the status of "basic, primi-
tive species in the event that monoecious mr.teriol of thorn
v/ere found - in v;hlch caso our speculations as to their con-
posito origin woxild stand refuted. 5*or the present it seems to
us improbable that it v/ill be found, "he characters of "both
species appear to us as not oricinal, tut derived. It seems to
us ii'ipro'bable that a primitive speciation should have occurred
quite so devoid of discernible distinctive characters. Consid-
er hov/ very distinct are the Ai.ierican species kno\m to contain
dioecious elements! J^ occidentalis , J. osteospema , J. Deppe-
ana, J^ flaccida ajid J^ texensi s .
PROBABLE DERIVATION OF J. ASHEI jUID J. KOITOSPEHMA
Prom the iiiorrihology of these species \ffi jud^e that "both are
composites of, on the one hand, J^ texensls , and, on the other,
of J\ v irginiana .
J._ virginiana, extends into southv/estem Oklahoma, where it
is abundant in the Uichita Mts. - an area not very yeraote from
the northern limit Icnown to us of J^ texensis . We deem it very
probable tliat the two species overlapped, and that J^ Ashei is
a resTJlt of hybridity bet\reen them. This species is now abun-
dant on the Arbuclcle Plateau in south-central Oklahoma. It ex-
tends southward to near San Antonio, Texas, and eastward in
northeastern Texas. It is known, also, from northwestern Ar-
kansas and adjacent parts of Missovirl and Oklahoma. It may be
believed to occur, aiso, at points connecting the latter area
with the Arbuckle Plateau or northeastern Texas.
There aprjears to us to exist a difference, not qtiite defin-
able geographically, between the northerly materials vMch oc-
cur with and in proximity to J^ virginiana , and those from the
more southerly Austin - San Antonio area, which bear equally
strong resemblances to J^ silicicola . The southerly material
has thinner tiltimate branchlets and often approaches the dor-
sal leaf cliaracters of the last-named species. It seems prob-
able to us that this southerly material may represent the re-
sult of back-crossing between Jj_ Ashei and J^ silicicola .
As for Jj_ monosperma - it seems probable to lis tliat at some
point in south westernmost Oldahoma or in northwestern Texas it
resulted from baclc-crossing of J^ Ashei \d.th northern material
of J^ texensis ; and that it represents today one of two appar-
ent v/ell settled results from an originally probably more un-
settled hybrid population; the other result being the var.
Pinchotii . In other words, v/e seem to have, today, two dis-
cemibly distinct results of the supposed hybridity: J^^ mono-
s perma , with the smell hilum of J\ Ashei ; and the variety,
\d.th the larger hilum of J. texensis.
