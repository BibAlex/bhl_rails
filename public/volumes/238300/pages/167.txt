Evidently the flora of Costa Rica and of much of Panama is
still imperfectly known, Costa Rica, with an area smaller than
that of West Virginia, has well over 1,000 species of trees ~
or about as many as the whole of the United States, and several
hundred of these are economically important. Three-fourths of
this Central American republic are in virgin, trackless and
almost impenetrable forest and it is likely that members of our
party were able to visit certain areas vrtiere no forester or
botsmist had hitherto traveled, so that our relatively small
collections have, we believe, more than average scientific
interest.

follows :

Service serial nos. 95011 to 95024, incl.; Barbour's nos. 1001
