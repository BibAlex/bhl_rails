of the true identity of E, bonodora ond B. Istifolia
was not possible by circmnstsntial evidence, that is,
by suits of specimens from the type localities, any
more than by examination of the types.
Of the Multiflorae with the corolla-tube far ex-
serted from the calyx, there is B, ranosissima (Pohl)
Bentham (based on Franciscea ranosissima Pohl, l827).

strict application of priority would demand a new
combination. Two formae of B. ranosissima were de-
scribed by Schmidt in l862, ^ . conf ortif lora ( Fran -
ciscea confortiflora Fohl) and y . parciflora. In
addition to the typical forma. The species has short
narrovJ leaves and an entirely different rppesrance
from B, Hire . Schmidt placed Franciscea divaricata
