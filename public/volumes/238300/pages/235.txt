apparently unpublished plate 53, the type from Serra da Lapa.
Other synonyms are Paepalanthus lampr oc ephal\is Mart, and P. 1am-
procephalum Mart., of which the type is Clausen 13 [Herb. Marti-
us 895] and P. filiformis KOm. Several of the specimens cited
below were originally identified as S. gracilis (KOm.) Ruhl.
Other specimens identified as var. filiformis are, I believe,
better regarded as typical S. nitens and var. koemickei and
are herein cited \inder those entities. The type collection of
var, filiformis is short-peduncled . The variety is listed by
Malme in his Phanerogamen 3: 10 (1933). It has been collected in
anthesis in August and September.
