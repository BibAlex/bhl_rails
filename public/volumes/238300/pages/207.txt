The type of this species was collected by Cornells Gijsbert
Gerrit Jan van Steenis ( no. 9hO0) along a forest edge at 1300 to
1500 meters altitude, between Gadjah and Blana Kedjerren (Gajo
•Lands), northern Sumatra, on February 27, 1937, and is deposit-
ed in the herbarium of the Botanisch lluseimi at Utrecht. The spe-
cies in its general habit reminds one greatly of V. erioclona
H. J. Lam and V. longisepala King & Gamble.
