undersides of the leaves is pronounced. By the mid-
dle of October the leaves are mostly yellowed and
fallen. Our plants are from the Arnold Arboretxam
and one represents a collection by E. J. Palmer at
Eureka Springs, Arkansas in 1913.
Aesculus glabra var. Sargentii, Rehd.
SARGENT BUCKEYE Iowa, Kan., Mo.
Rehder in Jour. Arn. Arb. 1926
Bean in Chittenden 1,59 (1951)
Rehder seems to have given Sargent Buckeye the
incorrect habit designation of a shrub in his Man-
ual. Bean follows by cabling it shrubby. So far as
can be observed here and in the Arnold Arboretum it
is tree-like in habit to 25 or more feet high. The
Gray's Manual, 8th ed., classification of small tree
or large shrub seems more accurate. Sargent never
writes of this variety as differing in growth habit
from the type, and he made a var. monticola for the
shrubby form. Sargent Buckeye varies in having, fre-
quently, two more leaflets and a heavier pubescence
on branchlets and leaves. Our plants have a con-
spicuous rufous pubescence on the leaf petioles.
The foliage drops early in the fall.
Aesculus Hippocastanum, L.
COMMON HORSE-CHESTNUT Balkan Pen.
Linnaeus - Sp. Pi. 1753
iktk
Bean 1,190 (1950); Turrill 138 (1929)
Knowledge of the origin of this tree did not ac-
company its introduction into horticTiltural use in
1576. Over 250 years later it was discovered that
the widely distributed Horse-Chestnut was one of the
interesting relict species native to restricted areas
in the Balkans. Except for an unfortunate leaf
blotch disease, the Horse-Chestnut is still an im-
portant ornamental flowering tree. Some trees in
Highland Park gave a good yellow foliage effect last
October.
