AEGIPHILA BOGOTENSIS var, AEQUINOCTIALIS Moldenke
Camp describes this as a tree 7 m. tall, with leaves deep-
green and nitid above, pale-green or dullish beneath, the corol-
la pale but clear yellow, and the fruit pyriform an^ U-loculed,
with four bony seeds, growing at altitudes of 8OOO to 9000 feet,
blooming and fruiting in July and August. He says that "although
the majority of the people in the region know the true 'lugma'
(lucma) and many of them grow it around their homes, they still
insist on calling this abundant and completely wild forest tree
'lugma' (or lucma), too, probably because of some similarity in
the leaves. They readily admit the possibility of confusion, but
shrug their shoulders. A few of the more intelligent said that
if they are asked which 'liigma' they mean, they call this one
• lugma del monte » " .
