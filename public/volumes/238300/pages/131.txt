the herbaria of the Jardin Botanique de I'Etat at Brussels, the
Nattirhistoriska Riksmuseum at Stockholm, the Estacion Experimen-

State Mviseum at Springfield, the Botany Department of the Coll-

South Yarra, the British Museum (Natural History) at London, and
the New York Botanical Garden, and from the Rijksherbarium at
Leiden, the Museum en Herbarium at Utrecht, the Herbariimi Bogor-
iense at Buitenzorg, the Erik li7all herbarium at Stockholm, and
