scure above, only very slightly subpromlnulous beneath j veinlet
reticiilation rather sparse, indiscernible above, flat beneath;
inflorescence axillary and fasciculate or terminating much abbre-
viated axillary twigs, rather fevf-f lowered, nigrescent in drying;
peduncle and its branches more or less pubescent, densely so
toward the base; pedicels filiform, 1 — 2 mm. long, glabrous,
nigrescent; bractlsts linear, about 1 ram. long, nigrescent;
calyx campanulate, about 3 mm. long and 2 mm. wide, its rim dis-
tinctly 5-toothed, the teeth triangular-acute and about 1 mm.
