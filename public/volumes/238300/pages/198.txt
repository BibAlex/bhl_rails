Woerlitz Buckeye is a tree out of European nur-
series for which no covmterpart has been reported as
a native plant nor has an accepted hybridity been
proposed. Rehder places it close to A^ neglecta in
relationship. Early importations made by the Ell-
wanger and Barry nursery had the horticultural names
of Aj. purpiirea and A^ rubra. Trees in Highland park
are now over 25 feet tall.

The variety honoring the Rochester nurseryman
came to the Ellwanger and Barry nursery as A^ atro-
s anguine a and Aj^ Whitleyi from European sources. It
has darker red flowers and larger leaflets than the
Woerlitz tree. Highland Park trees range aroTond 25
feet in height. Their mid-October golden brown fol-
iage has, in fiill sun, additional handsome red tints.

An ubiquitous iirban tree, but in park plantings
no weedier than many other trees. The large fruit
clusters which may remain most of the winter have
considerable ornamental value. Matiiring fast, older
trees in Highland Park of 50 and 40 foot heights
have recently all died out and the tree, apparently,
is not destined to attain old age in this area.
