This species is very widely distributed from Mexico [Vera-
cruz] through Costa Rica, Colombia [Cundinamarca, H^ta, Norte de
Santander, & Vaup^s], Venezuela [Amazonas, Anzoategui, Bolivar,
& Carabobo], British Guiana, Surinam, and French Guiana to Peru
[San Martin], Brazil [Amapd, Amazonas, Bahia, Goyaz, Kattogrosso^
tlinas Geraes, Parand, Pemambuco, Piauhy, Rio de Janeiro, Rio
Grande do Sul, & SSo Pa\ilo] , Bolivia [Santa Cruz] , Paraguay, and
Argentina [Corrientes & Misiones] .
It has been collected in forests, mountain forests, bogs,
shaded and open siffamps, swampy places, damp campos, woody campos,
very wet places in campos, moist depressions in llanos, stagnant
river valleys, and very wet soil below springs, at the margins
of pools, and on igneous outcrops in open savannas. It is often
found on firm soil, although it is really an aquatic plant. It is
said to be common in "marichales", frequent on moist sandy banks
among rocks and infrequent along sandy stream banks under
Mauri tia . It is recorded by Luetzelburg, Estudo Botanico do
Nordiste 3- PP. lU9 & 1^1 (1923) from eastern Goyaz, northeastern
Bahia, and central Bahia, where it is said to be typical of the
carrasco. The plants are almost acaulescent when young and are
then very misleading. The flowers are described as white or
cream-colored, blooming in May and from August to March. It has
been collected at altitudes of 200 to 3200 meters.
Material of this species occvirs in herbaria identified as
Eriocaulon splendens Bong., Paepalanthus caulescens Kunth, P.
caulescens (Poir.) Kunth, P. procerus Klotzsch, P. splendens
Mart., P_^ splendens var.o, KOm., P_^ surinamensis Miq., Syngonan -
thus caulescens Ruhl . , S . caulescens (Bong.) Ruhl . , S_^ c aules -

The species is cited from Corrientes, Argentina, "det. John-
ston", by Parodi in Darwiniana 6: l63 (19U3). Another specimen
of Maguire , Kunhardt , & Politi 27299 is said to be deposited in
the United States National Herbarium at Washington. A Britton
Herbarium sheet of Cuatrecasas 7886 is S. huberi Ruhl., with
flaccid leaves, but the United States National Herbarium sheet
is plainly S. caulescens . I compared the two in 19U5. The Stock-
holm sheet of Brade 5$28 is a mixture with Leiothrix flavescens,
the Britton Herbarium sheet of Jgrgensen 3723a is a mixture with
a Calpidisca sp . , and the "«Yashington sheet of Galen Smith &
Idrobo l$6l is mixed with something cyperaceous.
