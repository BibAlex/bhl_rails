BAUMANN HORSE-CHESTNUT
Schneider - 111. Handb. Laubh. 1909
Pourtet 516 (194-9); Wyman 125 (1951)
In many situations, as public parks where fruit-
ing is undesirable, the double-flowering Baumann
Horse-chestnut is preferable to plant. Its flowers
are of good substance and last longer than those of
the typical tree. Our trees are equally floriferous
and the flower effect is most stately. There is no
record of the source of our two old specimen trees.

UMBRELLA HORSE-CHESTNUT Schelle
Schelle in Beissner et al. - Handb. Laubh. -Ben,
1903
Bean 1,191 (1950); Kriissmann 41 (1951)
Undoubtedly as a yovinger tree it had more defin-
ite form, or if it were grown in a less crowded sit-
uation our one old Umbrella Horse-Chestnut would be
more convincing. Krussmann gives a thick and spher-
ical crown as characteristic, while Bean describes
it as with a low, dense rounded head of branches.
It will be necessary to start some new plants to be
certain that we have good material of this form; its
so\arce is not known.

LYON BUCKEYE (octandra x Pavia)
De Candolle - Cat. Hort. Monsp. 1813
Krussmann 41 (1951) ; Pourtet 519 (1949)
Many forms of this hybrid have been recorded.
The one known as Lyoni was in the Ellwanger and Barry
collection; one of owe plants came here from the
Arnold ArboretxM in 1915. The flowers of Lyon Buck-
eye are an intermediate orange red, but various color
combinations from the Yellow (or Sweet) Buckeye and
Red Buckeye have been noted. A striking rufous pu-
bescence along the midrib of the leaves is an inher-
itance from A. octandra . In habit oiu* 25 foot trees
are upright and densely branching. Leaves yellow
and fall by the middle of October.
