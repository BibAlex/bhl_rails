of the interior mountains of Arizona, New Mexico, trana-Pecoe
Texas, and northern Mexico, while C. betuloidee is a Pacific
coast species of the California chaparral. In central Arizona,
chiefly in Yavapai and Gila counties, is an island of genuine
California chaparral vegetation with a smaller number of speci-
es, partly Californian, and including C. betuloides . (Perhaps
the rarest of these disjunct species row separated by great ex-
panses of deserts is Fremont ia californica Terr. For more than
two years I lived in this interesting Arizona chaparral while
in forest influences research at the Sierra Ancha Experimental
Forest in Gila County.)
C. douglasii Rydb. once was reported as a State record for
Arizona by Kearney (Wash. Acad. Sci. Jour. 21: 69. 1951) on
authority of a determination by Rydberg but af ..erwards was re-
duced by Kearney and Peebles (PI. PI. Ferns Ariz. 4o7. 1942)
to synonymy under C. betuloides . In the original description
of C. douglasii . C. betulaefoliue blancheae Schneid . "in part"
was cited in synonymy. C. alnifolius was another segregate.

Cercocarpus betuloides Nutt. (in Torr. & Gray, PL No. Amer.
1: 427. 1840; June) in its widespread typical variety, C. be-
tuloides var. betuloides. is found in central Arizona and from
western Oregon south through California to northern Lower Cali-
fornia, Mexico. Three other varieties of restricted distribu-
tion can be maintained, var. macrourus (Rydb.) Jeps. in south-
western Oregon and northern California, var. traski ae (Eaetw.)
Dunkle of Santa Catalina Island, and var. blancheae , for which
the new combination is made, on Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and
Santa Catalina Islands of California.
When checking these names more than ten years ago, I noted
that this new combination might be needed, but the type collec-
tions of the United States National Museum (US) were then in
protective storage. Martin took up the older varietal epithet
and designated Blanche Trask in I896 (Mo) as the lectotype of
C. betulaefoliua Nutt. var. blancheae Schneid. C. alnifolius
Rydb. (type US 540025, seen) was based upon the same collection.
