DAMASK HORSE-CHESTNUT (x carnea x Hippocastanum)
Andre in Rev. Hort. 1894
Bean 1,194 (1950); Mottet 110 (1924)
It seems necessary to differ from Rehder in the
separation of Damask Horse-Chestnut from the x carnea
group. It is now well established by chromosome
coxmt that it is the result of a back cross of the
X carnea with Hippocastanum , the latter being the
seed parent. Though this back cross supposedly
brought sterility, one of our trees was fruiting
sparsely in 1952. Because of its softer pink flower
color and longer life as a healthy tree it may well
be recommended as better than the Red Horse-Chestnut,
Aesculus splendens, Sarg.
FLAME BUCKEYE s U.S.
Sargent in Trees and Shrubs II, 1913
Bean 1,195 (1950)^; Blackburn 85 (1952)
From the 1915-16 distribution of plants by the
Arnold Arboretum, one plant of the Flame Buckeye of
wet calcareous soils in Alabama and neighboring
states has survived in Highland Park. It is now a
large shrub, 16 feet high. This is an indication
that it is as hardy as the rest of the southern buck-
eyes, a point on which Rehder was uncertain. It
does have a brightness to its red flowers which
merits the praise given it by Sargent. There is
only a slight yellowing of the leaves before they
begin to fall in mid-October.
Aesculus turbinata, Blume
JAPANESE HORSE-CHESTNUT Japan
Blume - Rumphia. 1837
Blackburn 84 (1952)^; Pourtet 516 (1949)
As an ornamental tree, the Japanese Horse-Chest-
nut extends the flowering time by one week beyond
that of Common Horse-Chestnut and bears a somewhat
larger leaf. Some yellowing of the leaves takes
place before they fall off in late October. Plants
were received at Highland Park in 1907 from the
Ellwanger and Barry nursery.
