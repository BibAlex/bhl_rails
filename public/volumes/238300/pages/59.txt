Shrub or tree; branches slender, fistulose, glabrous or
practically so throughout, the younger parts compressed and
brunnescent in drying; nodes annulate; principal internodes
3.3 — 3 cm, long or longer; leaves decussate-opposite, palmately
compound, -with 3 — 7 leaflets; petioles slender, 3.5 — 1^.5 cm.
long, glabrous, canaliculate, club-shaped at the apex; leaflets
membranous, dark-green above, lighter green beneath, varying in
size from largest central one to smallest basal ones, glabrous
on both surfaces, the central one oblanceolate, 6 — li cm. long,
short-aciMiinate or cuspidate at the apex, entire, long-attenua-
te or cuneate at the base, borne on a glabrous petiolule 1 — 2
cm. long; lateral leaflets smaller and borne on shorter petio-
lules; midrib very slender, often undate in drying, flat above,
very prominent beneath; secondaries very slender, 6 — 10 per
side, arcuate-spreading, not anastomosing, flat above, prominu-
lous beneath; veinlet reticulation rather sparse and inconspic-
uous on both surfaces; inflorescence axillary, cymose, much
shorter than the subtending mattire petioles; peduncles slender,
compressed, h — $ cm. long, nigrescent, glabrous; cymes very
loosely bifurcate, rather few-flowered, completely glabrous
throughout, nigrescent; bractlets linear, 2 — 3 mm. long, glab-
rouf^; pedicels slender, 1 — 2 mm. long; calyx campanxilate, about
2 mm. long and wide, glabrous, nigrescent, the margin subtrun-
cate, minutely 5-apiculate; corolla zygomorphic, pilosulous
outside, its tube sharply curvate or genuflexuous, about 5 mm.
long, the lobes small.
The type of this species was collected by Yusuf Lazar near
Bagdad, Iraq, in July, 1918, and is deposited in the Britton
Herbarium at the New York Botanical Garden.
