U92 PHYTOLOGIA Vol. U, no. 8
"on tree", but if he means to imply by this that the plant was
epiphytic or not is not clear. Killip & Smith describe it as an
herb 3 — 5 feet tall, the main branches prostrate, the flowering
branches erect, and the "corolla white at base, blue at apex"
(no. 25023), "corolla-tube white to pale blue, lobes deep blue"
(no. 23397 ), "corolla pinkish-blue, paler without" (no. 2^001 ),
or "corolla light blue" (no. 26625 ) • Klug says of the corollas
that they are "violet and white" (no. U206), "light-blue" (no.
2339 ), or "white" (no. 390U ) . Oliveira, on the labels of both of
his collections cited below, also describes the corolla as white.
It is possible that these last three collections represent an
albino form of the species and may be worth^r of a form name.
Other collectors have described the flowers as blue, violet, lil-
ac, or pink, wl-iile Hoshne (Herb. Inst. Dot. S. Paulo 23307 ) calls
them red. Sandeman says they are "Parme violet" and that the
stems of the plant are purplish-brown. Svenson reports it as
growing 2 — h feet tall, common in open places near sea-level,
with purplish-pink flowers. Rojas cauLls it a subshrub 1 — 2 m.
tall, with rose-lilac flowers. One spike of the Llello Barreto
specimen cited below is conspicuously galled at the base, with
fruit-like gadls .
Notes on the pollen morphology of this plant are given by
Erdtman in Svensk Bot. Tidsk. 39: 281 & 283 (19U5) . Svenson in
Amer. JoUrn. Bot. 33s ii30 (19ii6) states that the binomial,
Bouchea fluminensis (Veil.) Moldenke, was firts published in
"Phytologia 1: 265. 1937", but this is an error, for the name
does not appear there. Stellfeld reports that the plant is employ-
ed medicinsilly as a pectoral, but his " Bouchea fluminensis " in
Trib. Farmac. 19 (10: 172 (1951) is actually Aloysia lycloides
Cham. On the other hand, IrmSo Augusto, Fl. Rio Grande do Sul
226, fig. 109 (I9U6) misidentified our plant as " Bouchea agrestis
Mart. ?i. Schau." It has often been misidentified as a species of
Stachytarpheta ♦ The Columbia University specimen of Rusby 915 has
proved to be B. boliviana , so the rest of the material of this
collection cited by me as B. fluminensis here and in Fedde, Rep-
ert. U9: 123 (19U0) ought to be re-examined. The Troll 636 cited
by me on the same page of my monograph as from "Department undet-
ermined" is actually from Cochabamba, Bolivia. "Gervao de folha
grande" and "gervao de folha larga" arc recorded as common names.
