the identification. No flowers nor fruit seen. How-

Goethalsia is placed in Tiliaceae by Standley ( 20)
and Record and Hess (17), Gleason (£) amended Pit-
tier's description of the genus Goethalsia and placed
it in Flacourtiaceae, M, Burret (" Goethalsia Pitt,
doch eine Tiliaceae, keine Flacourtiaceae." Repert,
Spec, Nov, 36: 195 o 1934) disagrees with Gleason 's
family disposition of Goethalsia. as does Record
("Note on the classification of Goethalsia ." Trop,
Woods 40: 18. 1934) citing his own wood and twig exam-
inations and the opinions of Pittier, Donnell Smith,
Burret and Standley, In a later article [."Note on
Goethalsia (Tiliaceae)," Trop, Woods 42r 21, 1935^
Record mentions Rehder and Ducke as additional author-
ities in favor of placing this genus in Tiliaceae, In
a letter to me dated May 25, 1944, Dean Record reports
as follows:
"Barbour 1016 (F,S, Ser, No, 95749) and Dayton
3125 (F. S. Ser. No. 95169) are not Goethalsia but
one of the Flacourtiaceae, Standley says: 'Now that
you place them in Flacourtiaceae, I checked our ma-
terial and find this same tree was collected twice
by Skutch and that I determined each collection as a
n, sp, of Hasseltia , The two are sonetrtiat differ-
ent, but I now believe they ai^ one species because
I do not believe the tree belongs to Hasseltia
