Many plants have been received at Highland Park
as Cilician Fir, but cone studies have narrowed down
the correct specimens to two trees, now 20 and 32
feet tall. They are, quite possibly, the two receiv-
ed from Ellwanger & Barry in 1918. As generally re-
ported, this fir suffers badly from winter burning
and it cannot be recommended as an ornamental tree
for this area. Though associated in nature with the
hardy Cedar of Lebanon, it lacks the ability to
thrive as that tree has here. Dallimore in the re-
cent RHS Dictionary of Gardening notes that it is un-
common In cultivation.

The only reservation to naming White Fir as the
preferred fir to grow in this region arises from the
weakness of old specimens in recent wind storms. The
earliest record of acquisition is 1895 from Ellwanger
and Barry. One of these now approaches 70 feet in
height. One remaining tree of those labelled f. vio -
la cea has finally been rejected as not truly repre-
sentative of that forma.

Though their source remains unknown, two yotmg
trees have borne cones in the past few years that
seem to confirm the identification by needle charac-
teristics of this West China fir. According to Cheng
