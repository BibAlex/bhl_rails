The data shovm in the last two columns above have no bearing
on the method used in rating the various tracts but they are in-
cluded because of their interest to botanists.
It is obvious that the number of species in a woodland has no
bearing on its rank, reflecting the magnitude of the timber. Wood-
lands having a large nvunber of species and woodlands having a small
number are scattered thruout the list.
In the Woodland Table, the average number of species and hy-
brids is 43 and the average ratio genera/species is 61^. In
eleven cases out of the fifteen (73^) either a below average nximber
of species is accompanied by an above average percentage or «m
above average number of species is accompanied by a below average
percentage. Therefore it usually appears that where the number of
species is small the number of genera is relatively large, and
where the ntimber of species is large the number of genera is rela-
tively small.
The combination of a small number of species and a relatively
large number of genera occurs in Woodlands 1, 3i 5i 6, 12 and 15.
Big Oak Tree State Park of Missouri and Punk's Grove are the near-
est approaches to climax forests in the list. It is evident that a
concomitant condition of climax forests is the occurrence of a rel-
atively large number of genera. The probable explanation is that
in the long course of evolution the process of natural selection
has had more of an effect in reducing the number of species in the
existing genera than in reducing the number of genera.
In Woodlands 2, 8, 10, 11 and 13 the number of species is
large and the number of genera is relatively small. 6, 10 and 11
are in the Chicago region, trtiose flora is characterized by an ex-
cessive development of species of Rosaceae and Salix . resulting in
relatively few genera for the many species.
DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FIFTEEN WOODLANDS
BIG OAK TREE STATE PARK, MO.
Foremost and tallest of the woodlands of the Midwest is the
Big Oak Tree State Park of Missouri, located 22 miles south of
Charlest(Hi and li miles northeast of the Mississippi River. Its
geographical position is unique in that it is within fifty miles of
