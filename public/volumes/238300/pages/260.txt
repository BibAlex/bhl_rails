The first plantings of this variety, which ap-
pears to differ only in the color of the cones, have
proved to be normal purple-coned Kiicko Fir. In Dur-
and-Eastman Park are true green-coned plants raised
from seed, Wilson's #7707, from 1,500 meters eleva-
tion in the mountains at Nikko. We received small
plants from the Arnold Arboretiim in 1918.

One plant received from the Arnold Arboretum in
1921 and grovm in a favorable situation in Durand-
Eastman Park represents this alpine species from
southern Korea and the island of Quelpaert. Though
it has coned for several years, our Korean Fir has
reached only 15 feet in height. It has the stiff
habit of a high mo\antain tree.

Early plantings from Veitch in 1899 were noted by
John D\anbar as very hardy and quite promising. How-
ever, as with Balsam Fir, the promise of good growth
in young plants never has been fulfilled by shapely
mature specimens. The Veitch plants are gone, the
oldest tree in Highland Park is about 30 feet tall, a
narrow-columnar tree. A younger tree in Durand-East-
man Park is still good in appearance and from 1938 to
19^8 grew from 8 feet to lA. feet.

European authorities recognize Arizona Cork Fir
as a distinct species. If it must remain as a var-
iety of A_^ lasiocar pa, its variance from typical maw
terial should be better known. Its natural adapta-
tions to a dryer and hotter climate greatly increase
