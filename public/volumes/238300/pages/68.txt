L,, Sp. pi, i:502. 1753 et Gen? PI? ed. 5, 175A.
POTENTILLA PALOSISIS (L.) Scop. f. OLANDULOSA
Gunnarsaon; P. palustris (L.) Scop. var. villosa (Pers.) Lehm.
(Vide Rhodora i^:5-ll. 19U).
This variation, more glandular and with leaves velvety
above, occurs in Canada from the Maritime I^ovlnoea to British
Columbia. It seems to be an ecological variant and does not
appear to present a distinct geographical range, neither in
Canada nor in the range of the species as a whole.

POTENTILLA L. subgenus SlbJ)jildiop8l8, (Rydb.) stat. n.,
Slbbaldlopsls Rydberg, Mam. Depr^BotT Col. U. ^:187, 1897.
Ill - PQtentlUji
POTENTILLA BIPINNATIFim Douglas. Appears to be re-
lated to P. nultiflda L. at least as much as to P. Pensylvanica
L. to which it is often subordinated as a variety.
Specimens examined from Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta
