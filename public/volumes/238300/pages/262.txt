dale, Long Island, surplus plants were sold by Mr. C.
W. Knight under the name of Westbrook Gardens. In
1923 we received some firs from this source. A mixup
in labelling followed and the name Aj^ numldica became
attached to the tree in Durand-Eastman Park now de-
termined to be this plant. Typical Nordmann Fir
cones have been borne in recent years by this fine
specimen tree now about 20 feet high.

In no situation has this west coast species of
fir been able to accomodate itself to the change of

#4.051 from a western Szechuan locale near the Min
River.

One tree now over 20 feet high in good condition
at Durand-Eastman Park indicates that we can keep
Saghalin Fir in our collection; an older tree in
Highland Park is in poor shape. The yo\anger tree
came from the Arnold Arboretxam in 1919, a seedling
from the E. H. Wilson collection #7316. A single
