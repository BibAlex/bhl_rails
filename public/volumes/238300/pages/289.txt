The Schu4.tes & L6pea collection cited below exhibits mature
calyxes that are deeply lobed. It seems possible that this con-
dition may obtain during anthesis, too, although the type col-
lection has plainly subtruncate calyx-rims. The type collection
is described as having yellow corollas, but the Mur^a Pires
specimen cited below is said to have white flowers. It was at
first mis-identified as A. chrysantha Hayek, and was collected
in anthesis in April.
