Two trees, only, remain of plantings made of Sil-
ver Fir from 1897 to 1918, and although one has
reached 50 feet in height its appearance is poor.
Dry summer weather and injury from winter s\an are the
factors which limit their ornamental usefulness in
Highland Park. Oiir plants all came from the Roches-
ter nursery firm of Ellwanger and Barry and very
likely were seed impottations of northern origin.
There may be strains better adapted to this area
from its southern range in the Balkan mountains.

WEEPING SILVER FIR Vosges mts., France

Bean 1,130 (1950); Hornibrook 20 (1938)
In nature this form is known only from the Vosges
range in France Just west of Germany's Black Forest
region. The East Friesland references pertain to a
forest planting near the North Sea. Two upright
trees, now 25 feet high, in Durand-Eastman Park seem
identifiable with the wild weeping form of Silver
Fir. Its present good appearance seems to indicate a
greater tolerance of an adverse climate than any
strain of Silver Fir so far grown here. Weeping Sil-
ver Fir first came to Highland Park from Manda in
1905; the existing trees may have been propagated
here later.
