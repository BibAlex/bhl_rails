Representing this hybrid, we have a plant re-
ceived from the Arnold Arboretum in 1922. Another
tree is recorded as from Harbison's #106lA, which
with #1061 are the type collections made in Brook-
ville, Mississippi in 1913. These two trees of small
statue (18 ») have some redness along the veins and
midribs in the autumnal coloring of their leaves.
Their fruits are small as compared with Ohio Buckeye.
Another more vigorous (28 ») seedling of Harbison's
#106lA without redness on the leaves evidently is
closer to the glabra ancestry.

Older plants of Etowah Buckeye in Highland Park
have become excellent trees; one is 36 feet high.
The Arnold Arboretum and the Ellwanger and Barry
nursery are the known so\irces of our trees, those
from the latter soiirce being yellow- flowered. Sar-
gent wrote here that the Arnold Arboretum plants
from the Stone Mountain, Georgia collection made by
Harbison were all red-flowered. Leaves fall early
from this variety, the trees being bare early in
October.

In the nursery catalogs of Ellwanger and Barry
this plant was listed as Aj. rubra carnea superba .
Another plant known in horticulture as Michauxi is
now considered synonymous. Mr. Horsey noted of the
latter at Highland Park that, though the leaves were
the same, it appeared slower growing and dwarf er in
