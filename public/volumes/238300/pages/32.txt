As for J. Pinchotil , it seems to us that Suc!.'.,'orth's publi-
cation of that species (cited "oelov;) hrj-dly represents a con-
trast with J^ monosperr.ia , "out rather vdth the less juicy- end
duller- fruited Jj_ texensis - -he only element in this original
description that distinfjulshes Jjj_ Pinchotil froia J^ monosperaa,
is the "large hiltm" of the seed, './e find, moreover, that the
seeds of J^ Pinchotii are of some'/ha.t smeller averp^e size
than those of J^ monosperaa.
The difference het^'roen the tv/o kinds is pli-^ht. Yet it ap-
pears to us to have some significance, and to merit recos^iti-
on. We therefore place Sudv/orth's Jiniiper in vrjrietal rtink \m-
der J\_ monosperma , as follov;s:
JTJiriPERUS MONOSPERMA (Sn^elm.) Sarg. var. PIITCKOTII (Sudv/.)
Comh. nov.
J^ Pincliotii Sudw. in Tor. & Irrig. 11 : 204 (1905).
A special typo seminihus minoribus hilo dimidio seminum
longitudine differt.
The difference in relative length of the hilum, hest o"b-
served in solitary seeds, is clear ajid consistent to us in a
comparison of some 1500 seeds of each of the tvro Irinds.
'.'e have seen specimens of the variety from the following
localities: Texas , Anastrong, Briscoe and Rajidall Counties.
Oklahoma, Cimarron Co.
It seems to us that ramy specimens have "been identified ag
J. Pinchotil on the hasis of their localities rather than that
of the relative length of the hil\im.
Vi'e re^^ard the variety not a.s of lesser philogenetic rank
thsn the nomenclatural type, hut simply as a slightly distinct
phase of the species.
As to J. erythrocajrp a, described hy Cory in Hliodora 30 :
186 (l936y"as a species distinct hy its red fruit and seed
characters - we conclvide, from exa/nination of his type speci-
men (Cory 7642, at the Arnold Arborettun) that it is conspecif-
ic v/ith J^ monosperma , differing from it by the relatively
larger hilun of the seed. The grooves on the seed appear to be
pa-rticularly well defined but we do not thinl: that they con-
stitute a clear-cut difference from typical Â£^ monosperma , in
which sometimes they are equally distinct. In all other res-
pects J^ erytlirocarp a appears to us, from the type specimen,
to represent the normally fruited J\ monosperma . of which Cory
described, in the same paper, the teratolorical material with
exposed seed as Jj^ gy ronocarp a. In the same paper, r-lso, he
transfers Jj_ occidentalis Hook. var. monosperma 2ngelm. to
the species me:ci cana Spreng., -iiich is now believed to equal
the geograpliically rather remote, 3- to 4-seeded J^ monticola
f. compacta of I'ii'.rtinez (o.c. 85). In fa,ct, Cory's over-all
picture of the monosperma situation does not seem very clear.
