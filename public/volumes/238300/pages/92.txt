Since the publication of the last previous installment of
my supplements to this geographic distribution enumeration some
1375 additional specimens have come to hand and have been stud-
ied and annotated by me, bringing to 139, iiU? the total of speci-
mens thus examined. This new material is from the follo'.iring her-
baria: I.leisner Herbarium, Torrey Herbarium, and Britton Herbari-
um, all at the Mew York Botanical Garden, North Queensland Her-
barium at Cairns, Botanisches Museum en Herbariion at Utrecht,
Herbarium. Bogoriense at Buitenzorg, United States National Her-
barium at "Washington, and the herbaria of the l.'elbourne Botanic
Garden at I.lelboume, the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet at Stock-
holm, the Naturhistorisches L'useum at Vienna, and the Estacion
Experimental Agronomica at Santiago de las Vegas, Cuba. Study of
this material has brought to light 2 new county records, 88 new
state, province, or department records, and 1^7 ne^.v country or
island records not hitherto listed by me. It has also revealed
several corrections and emendations which must be made on the
original list published by ne in the year 191x9*
