it is widespread in the moiontains of West China in
the lower altitudes. First known as A^. Beissneriana
and not widely grown at present, it seems a fir that
may well become an important ornamental. As time
goes on familiar names become confused, hence Ernest
Fir as proposed by Standardized Plant Names is re-
jected here and Wilson Fir substituted for English
usage.

A leaderless plant, only, remains in the Highland
Park pinetiom from Wilson's #4.451, as distributed by
the Arnold Arboretum in 1915. As Mr. Hillier notes,
there is pubescence on some branchlets, especially
the lesser ones where it is thick in the slight
grooves of the stem. Its habit of growth seems to be
in response to difficulties with our winter climate,
as erect branchlets have started up only to be killed
back. It is vigorous within its height limits of six
feet, spreading to twelve feet.

In Rochester Nikko Fir has prospered very well.
It seems to be the preferable tree of the shining
dark green, white-banded reverse, needled group. It
is conspicuous among firs by its bark, reddish and
flaking off in small patches. Our oldest tree (
Veitch 1906) is now about 55 feet tall and in good
condition.
