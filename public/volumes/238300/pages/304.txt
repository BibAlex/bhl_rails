fascicles, the lower ones as nmch as 7 craÂ» long, naked below
the middlej spikelets 6-7 mm. long, the gliunes equal, acuminate,
3-5-nervedj lemma 5 ran, long, scabrous, the tip hyaline, the
nerves excxirrent, awned from about the middle of the back, the
awn about 10 mm. long, geniculate, tightly twisted below the
bend, appressed pilose; callus hairs dense, about 2 mm. longj
rachilla 2 mm. long, densely hairy, the hairs about 2 ram, long.
Specimens of this species were formerly referred to C,
junciformis , but are readily distinguished by the short iTgule,
pilose blades, and pilose awn.

Perennial; culms erect, geniculate at the lovrer nodes,
about 50 cm, high; sheaths about as long as the internodes,
glabrous, or the lower ones sparsely pilose on the margins;
blades 9-13 cm, long, 3-ii nim, wide, flat, actuninate, glabrous,
or sparsely pilose toward the base; racemes 5, 8-10 cm. long,
stiffly ascending, spike let-bearing to the base, pilose in the
axils; spikelets mostly in 3's, crowded, 2,2 mrn. long; first
glume wanting; second glume and sterile lemma sparsely to
rather densely pilose between the nerves with capitate hairs,
the glume obtuse, 3-nerved, 1/2-2/3 as long as the fruit, the

This species has been referred to Digitaria villosa (Walt.)
Muhl. which differs in having the racemes naked or nearly so at
the base, less crowded spikelets, and longer, acute second
gl\ime. Several specimens from southern Mexico also may be
referable to this species,
