This is nearest M. bidentata , of the knowTi Am.erican species,
1 have not succeeded in identifying it iTith any of the Old
World Sapotaceae. Ducke (letter of March 30, 1952) inforried I'le
that it spf^ns to have been introduced by Barbosa Rodrigues from
some botanical garden. Ducke has sent material to Sandwith and
Eyma, but has not yet received an answer.
Barbosa Rodrigues (1893) listed the cultivation of "Mirausops
balata Gaertn."
Material of South American Manilkara was borrowed from var-
ious institutions in the hope of discovering a collection of
this species from ivild plants, perhaps confused with M. longi-
folia. I shall leave the plant unnamed until its nativity is
known."
