pages. Numerous corrections of previous records are also noted
here. In my original work an asterisk (■«■) indicated a species or
other taxonomic entity endemic to the island, country, or colony
under which it was listed. Additional collections have in mar^y
cases revealed the presence of this taxon in other geographic or
political areas. Such cases are indicated on the follo'<ving pages,
where, as in other supplements, it is stated that the asterisk
is to be deleted from the original entry.
Host of the material in this paper was presented by me, on
invitation, at the Secci6n Botinica of the Congreso Cientifico
I;'exicano eld in connection with the Fourth Centenary of the
University of Llexico at Mexico City in September, 1951. Delay in
publication by the Congress of its proceedings has made it des-
irable to publish the material here.
