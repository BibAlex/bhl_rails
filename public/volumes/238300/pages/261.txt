Its light blue-green, glaucous needles are as strik-
ing as the lighter color forms of Picea jiungens, and
In texture and habit the fir is much to be preferred.
In Europe where it has been widely tested its hardi-
ness has been well proven. First imported from the
Veltch nxirsery in 1906, a Highland Park tree now is
4-0 feet high with a half inch of corky bark develop-

to nearly 4-0 feet in 1953, holding its lower branches
in good condition. Our trees are from Korea, E. H.
Wilson's # 11,252, where its habitat is in the moun-
tains.

ornsimental seems well deserved from the several trees
