1952 Konachino, A new Variety of Chrysophyllum 39
C. auratum var. majus '.'iquel has ti-pically strigose cor-
ollas7 and the varieties acutifolium and obtusifoliun of C.
sericeum (placed in the synonymy of C_. auratim by Cronquist)
were distin[;uished by I.'iquel on the basis of leaf characters.
In the key to the South American species of Chry'sophyllun
in Cronquist' s revision (Bull. Torr. Dot. Club 73: 239. 19h0)
the present variety, having a glabrous corolla, falls errone-
ously to C. parvulum Pittier. It is readily separated from the
latter by its clearly arcuate lateral nerves, larger leaves,
and more persistent pubescence on the lower surface of the
leaves. Hov^ever, good distinguishirg characters are lacking;
but this is generally true in the whole typical section of the
genus, the species of which are very closely connected.
A NEW COMBINATION IN SCHINDLERIA
Joseuh V. lionachino
SCHINDLERIA DENSIFLORA (Kuntze) Konachino, comb. nov.
Rivina densiflora K\intze, Rev, Gen. Pi. 3 (3): 268. I898 .
Only six species have hitherto been proposed in Schindler-
ia, as follows: S. glabra H. Vi'alter, from Peru, described in
1906; S^ mollis h7 '.Valter, Bolivia, 1909; S_^ racemosa (Britt.
ex Rusby) H. V/ alter, based on Villamilla racemosa Dritton ex
Rusby in T.Iem. Torr. Bot. Club (139!3) h: 2^1, Boli\'ia; S^ riv -
inoides (Rusby) H. IValter, based on Villamilla rivlnioides
Rusby (error for rivinoides ) , Bolivia, 1907; S, rosea K. IValt-
er, Boli-zia, 1909; S_. '.Veberbaueri 0. C. Schmidt, Peru, 1923.
Schindleria rivinoides K. ".Valter, with Villanilla rivin-
oides Rusby in syno-nymy, was first published in I9O6, but the
name was based on a cheironym: " Villamilla rivinoides Rusby I
Exsicc. Boliv. Bang. no. 1292, 2607." Likevdse, S^ rosea , with
V. rosea in synorxyray . In the latter case, " Villamilla rosea"
was never published by Rusby. The name appeared merely on the
label of the herbarium sheet Bang 1292, and the specific part
of this name was subsequently changed (probably in Rusby 's own
hand) to " rosea-oenia (Lem.) Rusby". The combination Villamilla
rosea-oenia (Lem.) Rusby, based on Ledenbergia rosea-aenea Lem.
(not Ladenbergia rosea-oenia , as spelled by Rusby), I869, was
published in 1396. The specimen Bang 1292 , however, is a
Schindleria, whereas Lemaire's species is Trichostigma peruvia-
