PAEPALANTHUS CRASSICAULIS KOm.
Ruhland on page 208 of his monograph cites this species from
"Colcanbia: bei Chachapoyas, unfem der Stadt San Carlos (Field-
ing n. Iii03)''. Mr. E, P. Killip, in a letter to me dated Novem-
ber 20, 19 U5, says that this locality is undoubtedly in the de-
partment of Amazonas, Peru. The index to the American Geographic
Society's map of the Americas (page 863) gives a San Carlos in
that depajrbnent , The Fielding referred to is evidently H. B.
Fielding, who assembled a herbarium of 70,000 specimens although
he never collected in Peru himself. An account of this herbarium
is published in Joum. Bot. Hook., page 6, and on page 283 refer-
ence is made to 2000 specimens of Mathews' collection, Mathews
lived for a long while at Chachapoyas, and I have seen many of
his specimens bearing that name as the locality of collection,
but without his own name as collector (although written in what
we know to be his own handwriting) I It is probable that the
specimen cited by Ruhland has a label reading about as follows:
"Chachapoyas: Herb. Fielding", The species is not included in
Macbride's Flora of Peru and it is therefore of importance def-
initely to plawje it. Possibly other species referred to Colombia
by various monographers do not really belong there.
The species has been collected at altitudes of from 2l50 to
3li30 meters, mostly in paramos or on bushy slopes, blooming in
