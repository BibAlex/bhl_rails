306 PHYTOLOGIA Vol. U, no. 5
Some years later, Putnam (Management of bottomland hard-
wooda. U. S. Dept. Agr., Forest Service, Southern Prrest Expt.
Sta. Occas. Paper 116, 60 pp. 19^1) accepted Delta post oak
(Q. miaslaBlppienBls ) as a species in a table of Important
Bottomland Species.
The Forest Products Laboratory, in exajsining wood from a
single tree of this variation, reported that the samples showed
wider rings, more pronounced springwood pore zone, and more
golden color of the heartwood than specimens of ^. stellate but
that these differences might be related to site conditions.
Clair A. Brown (Louisiana treea and shrubs. La. Forestry
Comm. Bui. 1, 262 pp., illue. 194^) accepted the species ^.
misaiseippieneis Ashe, Mississippi Valley oaUc (p. 70, fig. 57C)
and regarded it as more closely related to Q. lyrata than to ^.
etellata . He thought it possibly might prove to be a variety
of the former.
Quercus mis a ia a ipp iens is is transferred to varietal status
under Q. etellata Wangenh. (Beytr. Teutsch. Holzger. Fortwise.
Nordamer. Holz. 78, pi. 6, fig. I5. 1787). Apparently none of
the varietal names published under Q. stellate , including Q.
stdllata var. attenuate Sarg., is the same.
ULMUS AMERICANA L. var. FLORIDANA (Chapm.) Little, comb. nov.
Florida elm
Ulmus floridana Chapm., PI. Southeast. U. S. 4l6. I860.
Some authors have accepted Ulmus floridana Chapm., of the
Coastal Plain from eaatern North Carolina to central Florida,
as a distinct species but others have not. For example, Charles
Sprague Sargent (Silva No. Amer. 7: Aj. 1895; Man. Trees No.
Amer. Ed. 2, corr., p. 509. 1926) listed this name aa a ayno-
nym of U. americana L., AmericÂ£ui elm.
Florida botaniata report the two to be distinct and to flow-
er at different times. Erdman West and Lillian E. Arnold (The
native trees of Florida. 212 pp., illua. 1946) accepted Ulmus
f loridsLna Chapm., Florida elm (p. 60, fig.)* They suggested
that this tree may represent a geographical variety of U.
americana L., which, they noted, grows on drier ground, normal-
ly has downy twigs, and has converging tips on the fruits. I
observed Florida elo in Highlands Hammock State Park near Sab-
ring, Fla.
As no varietal name under U. americana seems applicable,
the specific epithet floridana ia reduced to a variety of U.
americana L. (Sp. Pi. 226. 1755).
