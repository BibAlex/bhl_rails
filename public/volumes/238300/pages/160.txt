Cerrate notes that this plant is used as a ronedy for pneu-
monia, hence the specific name. The species is strikingly like
P. roezlii S. Morr. in its bracts and flowers, although easily
distinguished by its small leaves and short flowering branches.
It grows at about a thousand meters higher elevation than P.
roezlii and may well represent an adaptation to more rigorous
climate, PI. II, fig. 1: Primary bract and axillary branch x 1;
