106 PHITOLOGIA Vol. U, no. 2
elliptic, 3.5 - 6.5 cm. long, 2 - 3 cm. broad, glabrous or irtien
young thinly and spareely sericeous appressed lepidote, nerves
distinct beneath; pedicels surpassing petiole, staminodes and
filaments about equal length, briefly connate at base, ovary
6-celled. (Compiled from description, illustration and photo of
type.)
Type.- "Crecit arenosis, ad Oceani littus, e.g. prope Cabo
frio," Rio de Janeiro, Herb. Mart. U88. (Type photo at Field
Kus., Gray Herb.)
Illust.- Miquel (18^6, t. 17).
Martius observed that this species is perhaps a variety of
M. subsericea . Ducke (19^0, p. 236, 2hU) stated that it is with
great probability a glabrous leaved M. subsericea . At Rio he
saw material, from the maritime restingas near the city, with
subglabrous leaves forming transitions to the common form with
leaves sericeous beneath.

Petioles 1.2 - 2,5 cm. long, blades coriaceous, 9.5 - 13 cm.
long, h - 5.7 cm. broad, glabrous, when young with sparse scat-
tered appressed hairs, lateral nerves not raised beneath, ret-
iculation sometimes impressed. Pedicels deflexed, 1 cm. long,
sparsely hairy, sepals U - U.3 mm. long, rufous-tomentose, cor-
olla-segments 3 - 3.3 inm. long, staminodes shorter or longer
than filaments, 1.7 - 2.2 ram, long, 2 -3 laciniate to 0,8 mm.,
filaments 1,7 - 2,5 mm. long, anthers 1,5 mm. long, ovary glab-
rous.
Type,- "prope Bahiam in sabulosis maritimus (Salzm. I
Blanch. I coll. lign. n. 218)." Photo of the Geneva specimen
of Salzmann 7503 at Field Mus. Type of ^. mucronata ; "prov.

Field Mus. ("Bahia, partie meridionale").
Distrib.- Pernambuco, Bahia and Espirito Santo (Ducke 1950,
p. 236, 238, 239). Riedel UOl is from Rio de Janeiro, "silv.
maritimas pr. Ilheos, Sept. 1526."
Riedel UOl has petioles up to 2.5 cm. long, blades up to 13
cm. long, 6 cm. broad; staminodes longer than the filaments,
almost reaching height of anthers, Lima h9-366 , from Dois
IrmSbs, has short petioles, 5-9 mm. long, blades U - 6 cm.
long, 1.6 - 2.h cm. broad, midrib raised on upperside; pedicel
longer than petiole, staminodes and filaments free, ovary 10-
celled. Another collection from Recife ( Lima 1j9-315 ) has
leaves up to 9 cm. long and lj,5 cm. broad"! Froes 2(7035 and
20071, from Bahia, have relatively short petioles, 8 - 12 ram.
long (sterile branches, leaves near ends of twigs); midrib
raised on upper side of blade. The midrib in Blanchet 3171 is
slightly or not raised on the leaf upperside; staminodes and
filcunents are united at base for a short distance to varying
degrees. Ducke states that trees from Mata dos Morros de Dois
Irmaos, in the suburbs of Recife, are taller and have smaller,
narrower leaves than those of the littoral.
According to Ducke (1950, p. 2ljii), Glaziou 11158 , syntype of
M. glaziovii , belongs here; M. salzmanni is cultivated in Quinta
3e S. Cristovao, Rio de Janeiro.
