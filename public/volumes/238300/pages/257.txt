Abies amabills, (Loud.) Forbes
CASCADE FIR B. C. to Oregon
Forbes - Plnettom Wobum. 1839
Bailey 93 (1948); Dom. For. Serv. 68 (1949)
Cascade Fir has endvired rather than thrived In
Rochester, It reached here by way of Veltch Nurser-
ies, England, In several importations from 1899 to
1905. Only one tree remains in Highland Park in a
protected spot. Its growth has always been noted as
slow and the surviving tree is about 22 feet high.
Abies balsamea, (L.) Miller
BALSAM FIR e N, America
Miller - Gard. Diet. 1768
Bean 1,120 (1950); Peattie 57 (1950)
The Balsam Fir is not long-lived when planted in
Rochester. Plantings were made throughout the parks
from a p\irchase of 100 plants in 1904 from R. Douglas
Sons, Waukegan, Illinois. None of these now survive.
Our oldest plants are in Durand-Eastman Park. They
were received as var. macrocarpa from the Arnold Ar-
boretum in 1920, but observation of their coning here
indicates that these, at least, do not differ from
the type (v. Vlgul^ et Gaussen) . Cones are produced
on young trees such as were planted in Highland Park
from a local nursery in 1950.
Abies cephalonica. Loud,
GREEK FIR mts. of Greece
Loudon - Gard, Mag, 1838
Vigul^ & Gaussen 118 (1929) ; Wyman 112 (1951)
Though subject to burning of the needles in se-
vere winters, Greek Fir does make a good specimen
tree. For planting in Durand-Eastman Park, several
seedlings were obtained from HickÂ»s Nurseries, Long
Island, in 1922. These are now handsome trees of 25
and 30 foot heights. One tree of this lot is a hy-
brid. One older tree remains in Highland Park, a
venerable specimen 60 feet in height, in good health
and coning. The plant received here in 1905 as A.
Reglnae-Amaliae from the Arnold Arboretum seems not
distinguishable from typical Greek Fir, although it
