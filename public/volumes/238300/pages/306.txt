ADDITIONAL NOTES ON THE GUJUS AEGIPHILA . XIII
Harold N. Moldenke
AEGIPHILA Jacq.
To the List of Excluded Species should be added
Aegiphila triflora Moldenke, Suppl. List Invalid Names 1, in syn.
- Clerodendnjm tessmanni Uoldenke.
An additional synonym of Aegiphila virgata Turcz. is Cornutia
brasillensis Miers ex Turcz., Bvdl, Soc. Nat. Mosc. 36 (2): 220,
in syn. 1863; Moldenke, Prelim. Alph. List Invalid Names 23, in
syn. I9UO. Since Aegiphila virgata Turcz. is based on a Miers
specimen from Rio de Janeiro and Cornutia brasillensis Miers is
synonymous with it, and since Cornutia brasillensis Mart, is a
synonym of Arrabldaea corchorloides (Cham.) P. DC. [see Fedde,
Repert. UO: I96. 1936] in the Bignonlaceae , it seems very prob-
able that Aegiphila virgata , long a perplexing name [see Britton-
la 1: U69 â€” U70. I93U] is also synonymous with Arrabldaea corchor-
loides. The original description of Aegiphila virgata agrees very
well with the characters of Arrabldaea corchorloides.
Line 97a on page 271 of my key to the species and varieties of
Aegiphila in Brittonla 1 (I93J4) should read: 97a. Branchlets

So many persons have asked me to explain the sense in which I
use various descriptive terms for leaves and f j-owers in my publl-
