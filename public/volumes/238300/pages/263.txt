nemorensis, a cone-variant only, but as no cones
have been observed its authenticity is not yet es-
tablished.
Abies sibirica, Ledb.
SIBERIAN FIR n Asia
Ledebour - Fl. Alt. 1833
Bailey 82 (19^8)^; Parde 77 (1938)
The R. Douglas Sons Nursery of Waxokegan, Illinois
in 1905 supplied the lone Siberian Fir which now with
a 3-stemmed trimk reaches nearly 4-0 feet in height in
Highland Park. Its condition is only fair, without
lower branches, and in appearance it is not an orna-
mental tree.
Abies Veitchii, Lindl.
VEITCH FIR mts. of c Japan.
Lindley in Gard. Chron. 1861
den Ouden 79 (19-49)^; Pardi 78 (1938)
Named for its discoverer, John Gould Veitch, on
Mt. Fujiyama in 1861, and grown by the Veitch Nur-
sery from seeds from Japan in 1879, this fir, quite
fittingly, came to Highland Park as 3 good-sized (4')
plants from the Veitch Nursery in 1899. They have
prospered here and have reached the 60-70 foot height
of mature trees in the Japanese forests. Veitch Fir
has long been noted as showing the greatest contrast
in firs between the green of the upper surface and
the whiteness of the londer surface of the needles.

Wilson 62 (1916)
From the Wilson seed collection #7525 in the year
191-4 numerous seedlings were raised but the specimens
are now reduced to one tree in Durand-Eastman Park
whose cones borne in some abundance this year (1953)
show no purple tints at all. No other marked differ-
ence appears in the cultivated plants from typical
Veitch Fir with ?rtiich it is mingled in its native
stands.
