Hills 6,5 kilom, south of Siquirres, Limon Province,
150 m. Tree 25 m. high, with 7 dm, D,B,H,; 12 m.
clear; wood sample taken. This specimen, apparently
identical with the preceding number (3004.), both of
which are unfoirtimately sterile, represents an impor-
tant timber of Costa Rica, On preliminary examination
of the wood. Prof, Record thou^t it is of Theaceae,
but Dr. Standley says: "I still am unable to place
this" and states that he knows of nothing in Theaceae
to match it. Later (May 25, 1944) Dean Recoi^i wrote
me: "Dayton & Barbour 3OO4 (F,S, No, 95189) and Merker,
Scholten & Dayton 304I (F,S, Ser, No, 95190) are both
Humiria 1 Standley says: 'Both of the specimens are
sterile and can't be described as new, which I presume
they are.'" (18).
♦ 3129, Vantanea barbourii Standi, (22) 95235 --"Ira chiricana."
See Standley (22) and Barbour ( 3.4) ; also Figs. 11
and 12, I recognized this as a Vantanea and requested
Mr, Standley, if it proved new (as I suspected), to
name it in honor of Mr, Barbour, yA\o had been interes-
ted in it for some months. This important bridge tim-
ber of the San Isidro valley, hitherto unknown to sci-
ence, represents a genus and family new to the North
American flora.
Type locality: 1,6 kilom. north of San Isidro del
General, 0.8 kilom. west of Pan American Highway right-
of-way, San Jose Province. Gentle southern slope, 760
m., rain forest type, clayey loam; growing in patches
with alasan, guaba, etc. Tree 22 m. high, 3 dm. D.B,
H.; 12 m, clear; sizes up to over 30 m. Bark brownish
gray with longitudinal fissures. Strongest wood in
this locality (apparently getting scarcer), used for
heavy construction; pits in scalariform arrangement;
wood sample taken. Jxme 11, late fl. and early fr.
1018. Vantanea barbourii Standi. 95756 — in fruit. "The
(name 'nlspero' was given locally, and
(seems to be used south of Rio Herraosa"
