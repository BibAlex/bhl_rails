502 PHYTOLOGIA Vol. U, no. 8
as a rcadside weed, -^eavenworth says it is a pink-flowered herb
growing in moist soil along riverbanks. Pittier states that it
forms colonies in fertile places and waste land along roadsides.
Specimens have been misidentified in herbaria as B. prismatica
and as " Bouchea ehrenbergii Cham,", " Bruechea prismatica (L.)~
Kuntze", " Buechea prismatica (L.) Kvintze", Stachytarpheta jamad-
censis (L.) Vahl, " Stachytarphaeta jamaicensis (L.) Vahl",
" Stachytarpheta jamaicensis L.", "Stachytarpheta prismatica L.",
and " Stachytarpheta prismatica Vahl".
The Hinton 120$0 cited below has qviite the general aspect of
B. nelsonii, but the beaks on the cocci are not quite elongated
enough for that species. The C. IVright 3660 cited by me in Fedde,
Repert. U9: 103 (19U0) as from "Province undetermined" is actu-
ally from Las Villas, Cuba. The Curtiss s.n. [Havana, May 11],
also cited below, is incorrectly referred to by Grenzebach in
her monograph as "Curtiss & Vfest".
Because of their historic importance, the two specimens from
Linnaeus' herbari\im cited below are described in full as to
their annotations: The Jamaican specimen has no annotation on the
front, but on the back of the sheet one finds "Linn^ herb." in
pencil, "Jamaica" in ink (in one handwriting), "Bouchea Ehren-
bergii Cham." (in a second handwriting) also in ink, and, like-
wide in ink, "Stachytarpheta prismatica Vahl R. & S." in a third
handwriting. Finally, also in ink, in a handwriting that seems
to be that of Linnaeus himself, the nxanber "12". The second
specimen has on the front side of the sheet, on top, in ink the
word "Verbena", and, near the bottom, in pencil "Verb. U.
prismia. Sp. pi. 19 ■ Bouchea Ehrenbergii Cham, in Linnaea" and
in ink (in what appears to be Linnaeus' own handwriting) "pris-
matica U", followed in ink (in another handwriting) "autogr.
divi Linnaei". On the reverse side of the sheet one finds in
pencil "Linn5 herb." and in ink (in Linnaeus' own handwriting)
"Plum. phyt. 70. f . 1" and also in ink(in another handwriting)
"autogr. divi Linnaei". This is followed in ink (in still anoth-
er handwriting) " Verbena diandra, spicis laxLs, calycibus alter-
nis prismaticis truncatis aristatis, foliis ovatis obtusis.
Linn. Spec, plant. 19 .h", and, also in ink (in an unknown hand-
writing, apparently of later date) "Bouchea Ehrenbergii Cham."
This is followed in ink, in still another unknown hand, "Stachy-
tarp.ieta prismatica R. & S. (Verbena prismatica Linn.-Willd,)".
