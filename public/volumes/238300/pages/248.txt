These six collections show uniformity in botan-
ical characters, a constancy which has strengthend
confidence in the distinctiveness of the species,
Brunf elsia Mire has been confused with B,
hydrangeaefornTs (Pphl) Bontham, v/hich it resembles
superficially in its large oblsnceolate leaves. The
affinity is rather v;ith the B. bonodora -B. maritima
group, notably \Jith the Aristeguieta and the Hermann
specimens mentioned above. The calyx of B. Mire is
larger, but not as large as that of B, hy"Sraneae-
formis , from which it differs in the nervature of its
leaves, smaller glabrescent calyx, and in the great
length the corolla is exserted from the calyx. Bang
2352 was cited as B. hydrangeaef ornis by H, H, Rusby
in the Bulletin of The New York Botanicel Garden (I4.:
i;26. 1907). All the Rusby collections cited above
were similarly disposed by Britton in the sane Bulle-
tin (27:23. 1900). Material represented by 0, E,
V.n-iite 1072 was the subject of an histological exami-
nation by Heber W, Yovmgken in the Journal of the
American Pharmaceutical Association (llj: 195-200,
1925) , Professor Youngken, on basis of leaf anatomy,
identified the plant as B. hy dr ange a e f orml s . H, H.
Rusby had previously discussed the physiological
properties of the Mir^ in the same Joiirnal (13:101-
102, 192i^). The plant was reported used by the In-
dians of Central Bolivia as a paralysent of the vol-
untary muscles and as a remedy for cutaneous para-
sites. It vies said to induce profuse perspiration
capable of destroying all skin parasites, Thomas £,
Githens (loc, cit,) corroborated the claim of muscu-
lar paralysis and stimulation of the sv;eat glands.
The large oblanceolate lecvos, with wide areolae
formed by the prominent veins, and the larger calyx
separate B, Mire from the species of B, latlfolia
group, B, bonodora ^^fas proposed by Macbride in 1930
as based on an earlier nane for B, latlfolia. The
basonym was Besleria bonodora Vellozo (Fl, Flum. 261.
1825; Ic. 6:i:;0, 102?), a name pieced In the synonymy
