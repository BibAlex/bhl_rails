This series is begun with the aim of providing names for new
taxa and combinations whose publication would be unduly delayed
otherwise. Abbreriationa for herbaria follow standard practice.

Harms described his Streptocalyx hoppii as having appendaged
petals, thereby tacitly admitting that it was in the wrong
genus. The type, which was pre8\unably in Berlin, has not been
seen but the collections by Schultes and that by Lugo from the
type region e^ree closely with his detailed description.
