Type.- "Habitat ad flumina Cassiquiari, Vasiva et Pacimoni:
Spruce n. 3351 et 3319. In terra Surinamensi: Hostraann n. 739
et 739a." Lectotype selected by me: Spruce 3351 (isotype at
N.Y.B.G.). Type of M. amazonica ; "teraos especimens proveni-
entes das matas da estrada de f erro de Braganca." Possibly

Mus. Para 2527 , not collected by Huber, with sparse flowers
for past anthesis; in the hortus of Museu Paraense there are h
trees left by Huber with the name M. amazonica , but only one

Tor 2572. Type of M. maparajuba; "achei esta especie no rio
Capira," Par5. Photo of Huber 033 , Rio Capim, Acari-ucana,
27-VI-I897, "Maparajuba," at N.X.B.G.
Distrib.- Brazil (Amazonas, Par5, Maranhao), Venezuela,
probably Colombia. Exclusively on sandy soil, upland rain for-
ests and in varzea forests; prefers terra firme, but occurs in
inundated places; found along rivers with clear or "preta"
i black) water, not in varzea inundated by muddy or "branca"
white) water; the most frequent species of the Amazon area

Eyma (1936, p, 2^8) wrote that Hostmann 739 in the Utrecht
HerbariTim has not a single coroDla and the sheet of Hostmann
739a in Paris is not much better. These specimens are detei^
mined as M. bidentata by him. Ducke (1950, p. 2)40) rejected
the Hostmann collections from M. surinamensis . A photo of 739a
at Field Museum (ex Mus. Bot. Hauniense) looks like M. bideii^
tata. The original description of IL surinamensis agrees with
the Spruce plant.
A good example of variation in the staminodes of this spec-
ies can be observed in Ducke 189 from Amazonas. The staminodes
are either very shallowly dentate or deeply bifid. As many as
3 quite different staminodes can be found in the same flower.
The same staminode was observed to have one of the two lobes
0,h mm. and the other 2,0 mm. long.
Ducke examined a Spruce Cassiquiari isotype and knows typi-
