Long valued for Its July flowering, Bottlebrush
Buckeye by suckering grows into large clumps. It is
most impressive when there is opportunity for mass
effects to be viewed over a sweep of lawn, which is
descriptive of an era of landscapes now past for
private homes. In parks and other large-scale
plantings it should be introduced more frequently.

About August tenth, at least two weeks later
than the Bottlebrush Buckeye in Highland Park, comes
the flower display in Diir and -Eastman Park of this
form. Their longer flower stalks had been noted be-
fore, but it was not until recently that their later
flowering was fovind to check with Rehder 's published
forma. It is not known when or how these plants were
acquired, but it must have been soon after their
first introduction to cultivation in 1919.

Sargent wrote here that he was unable to estab-
lish Red Buckeye at the Arnold Arboretum; Bean men-
tions it as a rarity in English gardens; Pourtet,
however, calls it perfectly hardy at Barres. Be-
cause of its propensity to hybridize with other
species, it seems possible that it may not always be
represented by the true species, which may well be
rather tender. The most acceptable planting here is
a cl\amp of several stems thinly branched reaching 18
feet in height but scarcely ornamental. Other more
tree-like plants labelled for Red Buckeye are of
doubtful identity.
