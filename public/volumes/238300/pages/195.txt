habit. Our best tree of Oconee Buckeye is only 18
feet high, in addition to its slow-growing habit,
the felty, grayish undersurface of the leaves and
its red flowers distinguish it, A few handsome
golden brown, pink-veined leaves were hanging on one
tree last October fifteenth, but most plants were
bare of leaves.

A good number of trees of this variety are grow-
ing in Highland Park, some from the wild and others
from European and American cultivation. Though Fern-
ald in Gray's Manual of Botany, 8th ed., speaks of
this forma as rare. Horsey fo\and it to be common in
the Ohio valley and in the western Kentucky uplands.
When Sargent first separated this plant he selected
the Pikeville, Kentucky specimen of R. E. HoBsey for
the type specimen. Hence, if a geographical name is
to be associated with this plant, it should be Ken-
tucky rather than Carolina. R. E. Horsey collected
seed at Portsmouth, Ohio in September, 1915 from
which a tree grown in Highland Park now stands Just
under 30 feet in height. Autumn leaf fall varies
with some trees holding their leaves until the mid-
dle of October.
