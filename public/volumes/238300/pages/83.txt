108 PHYTOLOGIA Vol. U, no. 2
Distrib.- Ceara, Piauhy, Maranhao, Para. Frequent in almost
pure sand of dunes, in low plateaux and margins of marshy
grounds the length of the Atlantic (Ducke 19$0, p. 238). Culti-
vated at Museu Paraense (seed received from Piauhy) and in
Quinta de S. Cristavao, Rio de Janeiro.
Ducke (19^0, p. 235, 238) credits Chevalier with transfer
of the species to Wanilkara: " Manilkara triflora (Fr. All.)
Chev, = Mimusops cearensis Hub." I was unable to locate the
combination in the works of Chevalier. The latter did not
propose or submit the name to Ducke; the new combination in
Ducke 's revision was mentioned merely incidentally.
10. MANILKARA FJJFULA (Miq.) H. Lam, Blumea U''3%. 19ljl.
Mimusops rufula Miq. , in Mart. Fl. Bras. 7:l4ii. 1856.
Very much like M. dardanoi , which is possibly a variety of
this. See below for differences.
Type.- "Prov. Piauhiensi: Gardner n. 2910. PI. HamadrayasJ'
Isotype at Gray Herb.: "Pernambuco." Two photos and leaf frag-
ment at Field Mus.
M. rufula in the sense of Ducke is M. bella .
11. MANILKARA DARDANOI Ducke, An. Bras. Econ. Florestal 3(3):
2U3. 1950.
Leaves crowded toward ends of branchlets, petioles 0.5 - 1
cm. long, blades coriaceous, obovate, 6-9 cm. long, 2,5 - h
cm. broad, when young densely rufous-tomentose on underside
with spreading crisped hairs (up to 0,2 mm. long), becoming
glabrous except for some hairs occasionally persistent along
midrib on upperside, midrib elevated or flattened on upperside,
lateral nerves not raised. Pedicels surpassing subtending
petiole, 1 - 1.3 cm. long, densely rufous-tomentose with
spreading hairs, sepals li.3 - lu7 mm. long, corolla- segments
2.9 - li.3 mm. long, staminodes broad, about equal to filaments
in length, 1.3 - 1.7 mm. long, 2 - 3-plurifid at apex, base of
staminodes and filaments united into a short tube (0.5 mm.
high), filaments 1.2 - 1.8 mm. long, anthers 1 mm. long, ovary
glabrous, 6-celled, fruit brilliant scarlet and somewhat fus-
iform.
Tj'pe.- "loco alto (Estrada da Aldeia) prope urbem Recife
(Pernambuco) , in relictis silvae, specimina florifera et ster-
ile cum foliis novellis 2U-VII-1950 legit D4rdano A. lAraa
(15.599)." Type tree was destroyed.
I have examined authenticated M. dardanoi , Ducke & Lima 8
and Ducke 8-X-1951 from Recife. TFe leaves differ from those
of the Gray Herbarium isotype of M. rufula in the more rapid
and complete loss of indumentum on the underside. Some hairs
become grey and persist on the leaf undersurface of M. rufula
isotype and the depressed reticulation of veinlets presents
more of a blistered appearance to the leaf surface. The tom-
entum in M. dardanoi consists of slightly more spreading and
crisped hairs; the pedicels are somewhat thicker. Corollas
were lacking in the M. irufula examined. M. dardanoi and M,
rufula are alike in Their short petioles, the unraised lateral
nerves, and in the character of indumentum on the sepals.
