say is that there appears to be some kind of linkage between certain groups in
the proteid molecules which is not uncoupled by the enzymes in the body, and
that when it is uncoupled, as in acid hydrolysis, then it is impossible for it to
be coupled up again in the body. This combination, which the cells can neither
take to pieces nor put together again, must be present, in order that the other
component parts of the proteid molecule may gather about them and group
themselves round them when the synthesis of proteids is to occur. These con-
siderations appear to suggest that the synthetic processes here involved may be
the work of the same agent as the hydrolytic, the limitations in its hydrolytic
power determining the limitations of its synthetic activity, as in reversible
zymolysis.
Whether this conception of the matter is wholly correct we can not
say, but at all events it is a suggestion as plausible as any that can be
offered at the present time.
Just here we may advantageously consider the nature and propor-
tion of the chemical components present in the protein molecule so far
as has been ascertained by hydrolysis with acids. Kecently, much work
has been done on this subject, especially by Dr. Thomas B. Osborne at
New Haven. The accompanying table gives the results with eight
typical proteins from the animal and vegetable kingdoms, which may
be taken as representative of the present state of knowledge.

All the above data from vegetable proteins were furnished by Dr. Thomas
B. Osborne and represent his own work and that of his co-workers.
Perhaps the most impressive fact, certainly the one most quickly
discernible, is that a large fraction of the protein molecule, 28-50
