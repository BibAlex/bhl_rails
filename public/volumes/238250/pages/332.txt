SPRINGS AS A GEOGRAPHIC INFLUENCE

and texture of the formation, also because of its subjacency to horizons
that carry water freely.
In the Logan formation, I have mapped thirty houses with springs.
There is doubt concerning a few of these, an indefmiteness occasioned
by the absence of contacts. The Logan sediments suffered erosion con-
temporaneously with Pottsville sedimentation; furthermore, the Logan,
in comparison with its contact formations, the Black Hand and the
Sharon, weathers easily, producing gentle slopes. These two condi-
tions make it doubtful about the exact horizon of a spring near either
the top or the base of the Logan.
Sawed Shingles and a Few Boards are used in lengthening the Years of Service of
this Rough-hewn Log Spring house.
Slightly less than seventeen per cent, of the houses with springs
are found in the Sharon. The areal extent of all the exposed forma-
tions diminishes vertically, hence the number and the volume of the
springs decrease; the value of the land for farming also decreases with
altitude. A further fact concerning the springs of the Sharon is their
content of iron, making them less desirable than springs in either of the
lower formations.
