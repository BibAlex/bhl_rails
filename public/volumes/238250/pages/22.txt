days. Those bitten about the bead are the most difficult to cure. Yet
with all the drawbacks not more than five cases out of every fifteen
hundred prove fatal. It is natural that the French people should look
upon Pasteur as one of their greatest men and as worthy of the highest
honor. It is for this reason that they have responded so freely with
their gifts when additional means have been required for the work of
the institute. Since Pasteur's death his work has gone forward suc-
cessfully. One of his pupils, Dr. Eoux, has discovered a vaccine which
is said to be an almost sure cure for croup and diphtheria. Other
physicians are seeking through experiment and special study new and
better methods of treating what has hitherto been regarded as fatal
disease. It is needless to add that Pasteur's remedy for rabies is now-
made use of in every civilized country.
The great buildings of the institute are used chiefly for its patients,
yet in connection with them places are found for those who wish to
study its methods and watch its experiments. A special course of
study covering several months is open to all who wish to take it,
though those who do take it are expected to pay a small sum for tuition
and to meet their personal expenses. Perhaps no establishment in the
world has contributed more to the sum total of human happiness than
the Pasteur Institute, which is even now only in the beginning of its
career.
