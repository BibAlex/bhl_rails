wall adjacent stones are fastened together by heavy iron mortises in
the shape of a double wedge (X) fÂ° ur or fi ye inches broad, two linking
each pair of stones. Whether the lower layers of blocks are mortised
in the same way we were unable to determine, though a friend has
reported that he has observed these links also in the slabs forming the
footing-platform, but we saw none in the part we examined.
On the top of the bunding from Hangehow to beyond Haining,
about forty-five miles, there is a broad earth roadway, suitable for
riding or even driving, though the latter might be risky, a unique
country road. Back of the roadway there is a further embankment
some ten feet high and about fifteen or twenty feet thick, which com-
pletes the barrier to the encroachment of the boisterous tides. Prac-
tically all of the houses near the river are built on levels lower than
this bank.
The Haining Pagoda, which has been mentioned already, is ap-
parently not very old and was probably built by a Buddhistic believer
in fung shui as a protection to the bund and the city against the ravages
of the "serpent's head." It is a fair specimen of its class, and cer-
tainly forms the most prominent eminence on that section of the
Avail, and, together with the more recently constructed pavilion just
1m 'low it, serves well to mark a vantage point from which to view the
approach and passage of the wonderful wave which sweeps past at
everv tide.
