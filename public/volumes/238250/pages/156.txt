should be entirely kept from entering behind the wall. At Haining
the Chinese engineers have succeeded in accomplishing this very satis-
factorily in a twofold fashionâ€” viz., by a sea-foot proper and by fre-
quent projecting " buffers," a combination which, besides giving a sub-
stantial sea-barrier, also affords excellent and frequent refuges for the
junks whose masters must needs brave the dangers and difficulties of
navigation in a river so fiercely tide-swept as this is.
At the level of the sixteenth ledge from the top, in this step-like
face of the wall just referred to, i. e., about twenty feet below the top
of the wall, there extends outward a heavy granite platform several
layers deep and about fifteen feet wide. At the outer edge of this
several rows of piles are set close together and deeply driven into the
river-bed. Here there is a drop of four or five feet followed by another
shelving granite platform, somewhat wider than the first and similarly
edged with several rows of much heavier and more numerous piles.
Here there is a further drop of six or eight feet to a sandy beach which
for a yard or two is rock strewn and studded with piles, a ragged fringe
of which about ten feet farther out marks the outer edge of this re-
markable barrier.
At intervals of half a mile, at least in the immediate vicinity of
Haining, huge projecting buffers in semi-elliptical form have been built
of brush and piles. The ends of the brush, which has been stacked
and interwoven in horizontal layers, are presented on all sides and
down through the mass several concentric rings of stout piles have been
