FARM TENANCY A PROBLEM IN AMERICAN
AGRICULTURE
By Professor HOMER C. PRICE

THE per cent, of American farms operated by owners is constantly
decreasing. The census for 1900 shows that over one third of
the farms are operated by tenants and that in the last twenty years the
per cent, has risen from 25.5 in 1880 to 35.3 in 1900.
This tendency toward tenancy has been and is viewed with alarm
by the thoughtful American farmer. One of the boasts of American
life has been the independence of ownership of its people. American
agriculture in particular has been made up of a class owning their
own farms. Land has been in greater abundance than labor or capital
and has been dealt out with a lavish hand by the government. Since
1863, 233,043,939 acres of land have been given away in homesteads
of 160 acres each, under the " Homestead Act" of 1862. For the man
who wanted a farm there has been an opportunity to get one for taking
it up and establishing a home. And the distribution of this land has
not been confined to any one year, but quite uniformly distributed
throughout the last forty years, and since 1900 more land has been
given away by the homestead entries than ever before, as shown by
the following statistics :
Public Lands of the United States taken up in Homestead Grants
since 1900
Year Acres
1900 8,478,400
1901 9,479,275
1902 14,033,246
1903 11,193,120
1904 10,171,266
With these large areas of public lands being given away each year,
and with a farming population that is constantly decreasing as com-
pared with the population engaged in other occupations, why should
the farmers of our country be losing the titles to their farms? Is it
a harbinger of an American peasantry, and are we drifting toward
landlordism? When compared with European countries, the United
States is neither first nor last in the matter of tenancy of her farm
lands. In Germany 12.38 of the farm lands are cultivated by tenants,
in England 86 per cent., in France 47.2 per cent, and in the United
States 23.3 per cent, of the total farm lands.
The distribution of this tenancy in the United States varies greatly,
depending upon geographical location.
