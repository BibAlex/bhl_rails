The main business streets and the finer residential portions of the city
are kept in as good condition as almost anywhere else.
Thus far the reference has been to the physical and industrial
aspects. There are other elements worthy of note; lines of broader
development in which Pittsburgh has already attracted attention :
wherein she promises to exert, some day, an influence over a wide area.
These fields are represented by the Art Society, the Scientific Museum,
the Pittsburgh Orchestra, the Public Library System, the Technical
Schools, and the Astrophysical Observatory affiliated with the Western
University of Pennsylvania. One distinction must be named, the
observatory represents a field that has long since " arrived." Its work
is known to science the world over.
The Pittsburgh Art Society was born in 1873; and out of that
society of thirty-five years ago have been developed the Carnegie Art
Galleries and the Pittsburgh Orchestra. The Museum, the Art Gal-
leries and the Technical School are several parts of the Carnegie Insti-
tute, toward the upbuilding of which, together with the library, Andrew
Carnegie has given many millions of dollars. The orchestra is a sepa-
rate entity, now self-supporting.
