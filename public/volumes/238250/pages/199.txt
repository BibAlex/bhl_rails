Land Waste and Reclamation
Each year the rivers of mainland United States pour into the
seas a thousand million tons of richest soil-matter in the form of
suspended sediment — an impost greater than all our land-taxes com-
bined, and a commensurate injury to commerce in the lower rivers
which are rendered capricious and difficult of control by the unstable
load. Moreover, the greater part of the sediment is swept down during
floods which annually destroy and depreciate property to the average
value of scores if not hundreds of millions, besides preventing develop-
ment of the fertile lowlands; and furthermore, expert determinations
show that the organic contamination of running water varies directly
with the suspended sediment, so that muddy water is a common cause
' of disease and death. ISTow any comprehensive plan for waterway im-
provement will necessarily involve prevention of floods by means of
far-sighted forestry, intensive farming, judicious reservoir-construc-
tion, and other devices whereby the waters will be compelled to flow
even clearer and purer than they did before nature's delicate balance
between rainfall and slope and natural cover was disturbed by settle-
ment and industry. It is conservatively estimated that the benefits
resulting from the clarification and purification of the water will in
themselves balance the entire cost of the system of waterway improve-
ment required to relieve the existing congestion of traffic.
And the control of the waters involves reclamation of arid lands
by irrigation, and of certain swamp and overflow lands by drainage.
It is estimated that these means, extended to projects already in sight,
will fit 150,000,000 acres of highly fertile land for settlement, thereby
furnishing (in forty-acre farms with necessary villages) homes for
an additional population of 20,000,000 — or four times that number
under the intensive culture which finds " ten acres enough/' The
expense involved might by judicious administration be made incidental
to that required for improving the waterways for navigation (which
would hardly exceed that of a trans-continental railway line), while
the direct benefits, as illustrated by the operations of the U. S. Eec-
lamation Service to date, would amount to many times the cost.
Development and Conservation
Such are some of the conditions and values brought into view by
the recurrent congestion in transportation — for which relief is im-
perative, else the nation, must sacrifice its supremacy and by reason of
