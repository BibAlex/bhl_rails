THE WHITER PITTSBURGH

In the cultivation of the fine arts, the Art Department of the Car-
negie Institute has unquestionably given to Pittsburgh a great stimulus.
The galleries contain a fine permanent collection of paintings and sculp-
ture, the property of the institute, as well as numerous paintings which
have been loaned by private owners for an indefinite period. This
exhibit is open to the public daily during the greater part of the year,
and no charge for admission is made. Each year the department holds
a competitive exhibition of paintings, which is open to the artists of
the world; and these exhibitions have become of international impor-
tance. Hundreds of paintings are sent by noted artists of Europe and
America ; the efforts of the directors tending toward the elimination of
favoritism, and the fostering of a spirit of fairness. This broad policy
of the Art Society is influencing the artistic spirit at home and abroad.
The children of the public schools are encouraged to interest them-
selves in the art exhibits; and art talks are given by the director to
classes of children from the schools. Incidentally, Pittsburgh has in
the past contributed a few names to the world of art. In the list of
Samuel Pierpont Langley.
