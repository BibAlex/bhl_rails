A VISIT TO THE II AN GC HOW BORE
IOI
with fair weather and favorable tides reach Hangchow the next after-
noon anywhere after three o'clock. Three companies are now running
these trains, two Chinese and one Japanese. Everything is managed
in a creditable and business-like fashion, and one can make a fairly
comfortable trip at reasonable expense. It is possible, using this
launch service, to leave Shanghai on Friday night, see the Saturday
night and Sunday afternoon bores, and be back in Shanghai on Monday
morning. By private launch even better time can be made and a
record round-trip of sixty hours, allowing fifteen hours at Raining to
witness both a day and a night bore, and five hours of shooting during
the return, was made by some Shanghai enthusiasts in October, 1902.
On the other hand, the pleasures of house-boating in the region
traversed, especially during the fall months, should not be under-
estimated, and if one is not pressed for time a very comfortable and
interesting trip on a private boat, propelled by yulow and' pole and
landing you at the Haining Pagoda at the end of the third day from
Shanghai, will allow a full enjoyment of the various scenes which
enliven the river and canal banks throughout the Yangtse's delta.
A satisfactory compromise between these two plans may be effected by
taking a cabin passage on a launch train as far as Samen on the Grand
Canal, which is reached at noon of the day after leaving Shanghai, and
then hiring a native boat to be yulowed along narrow, well-shaded
canals to Haining, which under fair conditions should be reached by
six or seven o'clock that evening.
