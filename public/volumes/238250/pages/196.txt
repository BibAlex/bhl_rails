factors : Many of the problems were solved practically by Washington
and Clinton and their contemporaries through canal systems that
would unquestionably be in use to-day had not the railways better met
temporary needs ; most of the rest have been solved in European coun-
tries that are to-day better advanced than ourselves both in waterway
development and in that adjustment of transportation to production
on which national prosperity must depend. In the light of this
experience it would seem easy to return to and perfect Gallatin's great
waterway system; and in the light of present needs, it should begin in
the interior with a deep channel from the Great Lakes to the Gulf,
and in the East with an Inner Passage from Massachusetts to Florida â€”
and these main arteries should be coupled with passages skirting the
Gulf coast and with improved tributaries in such manner that standard-
ized barges may pass from Benton to Boston or to Brownsville, or from
any lake port to any sea port with some choice of routes : and even-
tually through the Minnesota and Eed Biver of the North to Lake
Winnepeg and Hudson Bay, in order that the grain-fields of the Cana-
dian plains may find outlet to the sea during a longer open season
than that of Hudson Strait. And at the same time the pressing need
of the Pacific Coast should be met; the treasure-houses of the Co-
lumbia and Snake should be unlocked and a way made into Puget
Sound, while the golden gardens of California Valley should be opened
to ships going down to the sea in order that the grains and fruits
now rotting in bin and on branch may be turned to human good and
national welfare. The details are innumerable; the demands irre-
sistible.
Among the waterways, three or four should be improved not merely
to meet commercial needs, but as a patriotic duty: First in importance
is the Lakes-to-Gulf project; for should disaster befall and Canada
pass into unfriendly hands, the enemy might within a week put war
vessels into the Lakes through Welland Canal or the still larger Huron
Canal (of which we hear little thus far), in which case catastrophe
could be averted only by a waterway of war-ship capacity from the
Gulf to Lake Michigan. Scarcely less important is the protected pas-
sage projected for the Atlantic slope, though since the baseless Cervera
scare the details need not be pursued; while the connection of the
Columbia with Puget Sound, and the extension of San Francisco and '
Suisun bays need no more than mention in connection with the mili-
tary possibilities of the day and the " national defense " of the founders.
The Value of Water in Itself
While navigation is the most pressing use for our waterways, there
are others of no less present value and future promise. Neither Wash-
