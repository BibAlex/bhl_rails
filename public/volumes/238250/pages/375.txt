Fig. 1. The Type of Pelion lyelli Wyman from the Carboniferous of Ohio. In the
collection oi the American Museum. Natural size

the other half of the slab containing the major portion of the cranial
elements was obtained by Mr. W. F. E. Gurley and it is now in the
collection of the University of Chicago. The illustration is made from
the latter specimen. This form is peculiar in the possession of horns
which projected hack ward over the neck. Jaekel suggests that these
horns were tor the protection of the external gills, but the Microsauria,
so far as we know, had no gills, at least in the adult state.
Geologically the record of the amphibians, as it has been given, is
the correct one, but chronologically it is not. Long before a single
specimen had been taken from the Linton beds Sir William Logan, in
1842, found evidences of amphibians in the Carboniferous of Nova
Scotia in some footprints later named by Dawson Hylopus logani.
These footprints Logan took with him to London and submitted them
to the famous paleontologist, Sir Richard Owen, who unhesitatingly
pronounced them to be " reptilian." Logan's discovery constitutes the
earliest recognition of amphibians in the Carboniferous. A few years
