152 POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY
effective work for freedom of conscience and secular education of the
children; for which, in many of the republics, the city councils have
established " municipal schools." The course of the Libre Pensador is
supported by the higher classes of the community as a veritable watch-
man on the tower of free expression, and is doing much to relieve so-
ciety of clerical scandals, which it trumpets with terrible denunciation
and directness of personality.
The extraordinary material development of territories rescued from
their Mexican slavery under clericalism and raised into the dignity of
our American statehood, allowing them all their natural advantages
for development, is an index of what the world may witness in the
redemption of other Latin American republics. The advance in every
higher condition of life in the Eepublic of Mexico, since her partial
emancipation from this same wretched rule, affords a great encourage-
ment to the moralist, philosopher and statesman, watching the progress
of the world in the inarch of free popular thought, applied to the gov-
ernment of states.
The writer is an American, with three hundred years of unmixed
American ancestry behind him, and he does not hesitate to declare his
belief, after having lived nearly a score of years in Mexico, Central
and South America, that if it should be the fortune of any considerable
territory of South America to rise into the dominion of English, French
or German civilization, it would denote a triumph of regenerating
thought over a condition of slavery that should never have been per-
mitted to establish a foothold in these continents. It would mean re-
publican states that we could respect as neighbors, our equals and our
coadjutors in advancing the conditions of liberty throughout the
western world, instead of proteges, whose frequent acts of barbarism
keep our country in constant apprehension of Monrovian interference
that may embroil the nation in a war with the states of Europe. And
for what? to sustain a people in maintaining republics? Nothing of
the kind; but to save some miserable band of politicians from the
punishment due their crimes against the illuminating ideas of this
twentieth century, fruit of the highest civilization.
