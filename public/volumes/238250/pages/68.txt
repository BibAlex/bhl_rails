Unlike the bores seen elsewhere, which generally occur inter-
mittently, the Hangchow bore ascends the river at every tide, though
its magnitude and speed vary considerably with the general state of the
tides, and semi-monthly maxima are attained at the third tide after
each new and each full moon. The latter affords a better opportunity
to witness the bore under the more impressive and majestic stillness
of midnight and the light and shadow of a moonlit scent'. These
semi-monthly maxima themselves attain greatest intensity at the

full moon (September 6 and 7) in close observation of one midnight
and two noon bores.
Although observers sometimes go to Kanpu beyond the mouth of
the Clrien-tang Kiang, and others content themselves with a view from
Hangchow, from the first of these places the bore is seen when not fu'ly
formed, its two initial sections not yet united, while at Hangchow
the effect, though still fairly remarkable, has completely lost its
grandeur; and the best and most easily reached vantage ground is at
the Haining Pagoda, though it is likely that at a point some five miles
below the pagoda the bore is of even greater grandeur. This is close
to where the two branches of the furious " Serpent's Head," as the
