value. Now, the vast inherent value of our forests is but a bagatelle
in comparison with the inherent value of our living waters; the time
is ripe for taking stock of this immeasurable resource; and it behooves
the people through the representatives in whom they repose confidence
to claim this greater heritage on which the lives of the generations
must depend.
The Utilization of Power
An ill-recognized value of running water resides in its power, a
quantity doubtless sufficient to drive mills and trains and boats, and
furnish light and heat and domestic motors for a century or two after
our coal is gone. Hitherto this resource has been neglected, partly
because the concept of inherent or potential value remained inchoate,
and power was not felt to exist until actually developed by dams and
races and penstocks; yet the realization that 40,000,000,000,000 cubic
feet of river water descending an average of 2,500 feet is a rich
possession can not long be delayed, for it exceeds 300,000,000 horse-
power, or thrice the pulling power of all the horses now living in
the world — even if the sum be tithed for safety it will still
reach 30,000,000 horse-power, which at $20 per year would be
worth $600,000,000 annually (or more each year than the estimated
cost of improving all the rivers of the country), equal — at 3 per cent. —
to a capital of $20,000,000,000. And the availability of water-power
entered on a new era with the perfecting of electrical transmission in
the last decade !
Though the time is not ripe for discussing utilization, a case may
be instanced: The boldest water-supply project in our history was
undertaken when Los Angeles, a city of only 150,000, bonded itself
for $23,000,000 to purchase a riverlet 250 miles away; it seemed an
appalling price for continued civic life, yet the people were ready to
pay ; and it was not until the plans for piping were nearly done that
the incidental value of the power was realized — and negotiated at
rates yielding ten per cent, on the bonds ! Suffice it to add that even
if the improvement of our waterways for navigation were to cost five
or ten times the amount estimated, the water-power developed inci-
dentally in connection with the works, if judiciously administered,
would alone pay the entire cost in from five to twenty years. Pic-
turesque streams and cataracts should be saved as scenic features, for
natural beauty is a national asset beyond material measure; but the
ignoble wild should be harnessed to the plow of progress.
Fortunately, while the founders failed to define the proprietary
interests in the running waters, they recognized their interstate char-
acter and granted the nation certain authority over them; and this
has been repeatedly confirmed by the courts and crystallized by statutes
