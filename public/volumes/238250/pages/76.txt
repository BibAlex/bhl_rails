A VISIT TO THE IIAXGCH0 1 \Y BORE

A Crude Bridge.
called " bore." Professor G. H. Darwin noted on the banks of the
Severn during the spring tide in September, 1897, that there was no
proper bore, but only a succession of waves up-stream, and a rapid rise
of water-level.
In the case of the River Seine, which has been dyked as far as
Eouen to admit vessels of twenty feet draught, it is said that there
is a bore (barre or mascaret) at every tide, ranging usually from eight
to ten feet. This is probably accounted for by the fact that after
Candebec and Quillebceuf, the estuary is set with extensive sand-banks
between which flows a narrow navigable channel.
These bores are relatively small compared with that in the Ch'ien-
tang Kiang, while the destructive bore of the great Amazon is robbed
of its impressiveness because it can not be well observed on account of
its very magnitude; moreover, with it as well as with the other rivers
it is only at spring tides and with certain winds that the phenomenon
is at all striking. On the other hand, the Hangchow Bore occurs at
every tide to a remarkable extent in any season and at certain times
assumes colossal proportions and is always easily observable. For com-
parison it may be interesting to note the following description of the
Amazon's bore, or proroca, by La Condamine :
During three days before the new and full moons, the period of the highest
tides, the sea, instead of occupying six hours to reach its flood, swells to its
highest limit in one or two minutes. The noise of this terrible flood is heard
five or six miles off, and increases as it approaches. Presently you see a liquid
promontory twelve or fifteen feet high, followed by another, and another, and
