La Sorbonne. Paris.
A government commission, after a careful consideration of the peti-
tion of the professors, reported in favor of granting their request.
Nothing came from the report. In 1846 there was another commission
and another favorable report. Still there was delay. In 1855 a de-
cree for immediate reconstruction of the buildings was passed and
a cornerstone of what was supposed would be a new and adequate
building was laid with great rejoicings. But nothing more was done
till 1871 when there was another commission and another favorable
report. Money for rebuilding was not secured till 1885. New and
enlarged plans meanwhile had been made, and the work of construc-
tion was put into the hands of a young man who had been in the
practise of his profession less than five years. But he had been care-
fully trained both in Paris and in Borne. The cornerstone of the now
Sorbonne was laid August 3, 1885, in the presence of Jules Grevy,
president of the republic, the minister of public instruction and the
faculties of the university. Four years later the edifice was ready for
dedication. It had cost 22,000,000 francs. It is a model of its kind,
severely simple yet beautiful in its adornments and its harmony. At
the dedication on August 5, 1889, there were present President Carnot
of the Republic, with the members of his cabinet, the officials of the uni-
versity, representatives of foreign countries and foreign universities
and members of the different academies connected with the institute.
For its purpose the building is said to be one of the finest in existence.
