capital city, the preservation of the West Lake as a water-supply, the
building of public roads, institutions of learning and canals, and, in
view of the present considerations the most worthy of all, the long
sea-wall which stands to-day as the greatest monument to his skill and
efficiency in caring for the public weal. Its erection was begun
probably about 911 or 915 a.d. It extends from Hangchow to Chuan-
sha near the mouth of the Whang-pu (the river on which Shanghai
is situated), a distance of one hundred and eighty miles. It is a
stupendous piece of work and deserves an equal share of fame with the
Grand Canal and the Great Wall of China, for its engineering diffi-
culties were certainly infinitely greater.
Unfortunately there appears to be no record of how these diffi-
culties were really overcome, although as usual the native historian

tides by having five hundred skilled archers shoot three thousand
specially prepared arrows directly into the oncoming billows. Each
man took up six arrows, one for each billow, and when they had shot
five arrows straight into as many lofty waves, the waters suddenly
turned and fled! Wbereupon the Prince quickly drove great piles
along the river bank, among which strong creels of bamboo were woven.
