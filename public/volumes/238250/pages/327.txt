coincidence in the past. Xo attempt can be made to answer the ques-
tion as yet, but it opens a most fascinating field of speculation and of
investigation. If the activities of the earth and of the sun are related
to one another in any such manner as is suggested above, the study of
the one will add vastly to our knowledge of the other. An examination
of solar changes, on the one hand, may enable us to foretell something
of what is about to occur upon the earth. A careful reading of the
geological history of the earth, on the other hand, may disclose the
history of the sun for millions of years past, and may shed light upon
the fascinating problem of the thermal history and ultimate destiny
of the body which, as knowledge increases, appears more and more to
be the arbiter of terrestrial life.
