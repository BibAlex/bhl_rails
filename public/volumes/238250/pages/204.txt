RESEMBLANCES AMONG ANIMALS 3°9
represent amazingly " a family of tiny birds with long necks and
swelling breasts and dropping tails, verily like an autumn brood of
bob-whites" (W. H. Gibson), Fig. 9. Had they been twenty times
their present size they might have run the risk of being described as
mimics !
Among other resemblances of this nature one recalls the spectacles
which appear on the neck of the cobra. Then there are the insect,

monkey and human figures in orchids and in various other plants,
pictured in flowers, parts of flowers and in fruit. The last sometimes
give striking and grotesque forms, as in the case of our common garden
snap-dragon, Antirrhinum. Here, Fig. 10, the seed pods look like
diminutive human heads which are arranged on the stalk in a way
which suggests the poles-of-skulls, or " medicine " ornaments of certain
savages. Peculiarly perfect is this resemblance, for there are pictured
not merely the cranium and face, but the dried and weathered
portions of scalp, eyelids, lips, as well also as temporal sutures. The
color of these seed pods, furthermore, is strikingly like that of mum-
mied heads. Meaningless resemblances occur also in various bones, as
in the case of the goat skull or the " ear-bone " noted above. Thus,
as Hugh Miller long ago discovered, there is a curious human figure in
the cranium of a Devonian fish, and the rabbit, even when " dead
and turned to dust " is not free from its arch-enemy, for its sphenoid
(Fig. 6) pictures the head of a fox so cunningly indeed that this bone
has long been used as a scarf ornament for the English hunter.
Instances of this kind need hardly be multiplied. They extend on
every side in the inorganic as well as the organic — from the simple
cloud figures conjured by Aristophanes or the various forms of
weathered rocks (like the " camel of Brignogan "), to the most curious
and complicated.
