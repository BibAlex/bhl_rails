Figs. 2-'j. The relative Frequency and Intensity of Seismic and volcanic Phe-
nomena at Periods of Sunspot Minima (2-5) and Maxima (6-9). The numeials above the
diagrams indicate years, those on the sides, percentages. In the diagrams compiled from
Jensen's data the full lines indicate seismic phenomena, and the dotted lines volcanic phe-
nomena.
8. The year preceding that of maximum spots.
The irregular periods numbered 3 and 7 are necessary because of
the variation of the length of the sun-spot cycle. Number 3 may vary
in length from 1 to 7 years, and number 7 from to 3.
