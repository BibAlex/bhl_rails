RESEMBLANCES AMONG ANIMALS
3°5
In point of fact, if we sift out the cases
in which mimicry and protective coloration
have been demonstrated beyond question, we
find that their number is by no means as
large as we at first assume. And of the
remaining cases, probable, or imperfectly
proven, we should, in fairness, leave open
the possibility that what seems protectively
colored or mimetic resemblance might in
the end turn out to be accidental and N eseCr>b, z>otfppe p < ieturing > iii

And in the present notice it
may be interesting to refer to these
meaningless resemblances in order to
show both that they are abundant,
and that they are excessively compli-
cated — in certain cases, even more
complicated than those which are
commonly regarded as typical, if not
brilliant instances of protective or
mimetic adaptation.
As an example of a meaningless
resemblance let us first refer to the
Taira-crab, a Dorippe, Fig. 1, on whose
back a human face appears strikingly
portrayed. This crab occurs rather

only after this time, local Buddhistic
tradition states, that a. face of a
Taira warrior appeared on each

Now, the resemblance in this case is
developed to an almost uncanny de-

oriental — even more Chinese or Co-
