A VISIT TO THE HANGCHOW BOR
BY Dr. CHARLES KEYSER EDMUNDS
CANTON CHRISTIAN COLLEGE
Introductory
THE most striking thing, from a geographical point of view, which
is to be seen along the China coast is the recurrent phenomenon
which we are about to describe. The rugged coast line, the many bays,
the chain of islands fringing the coast, the whole gamut of geological
and geographical forms which one encounters in an intimate coastwise
journey, are all very striking and grand, and yet they are static — pas-
sive, after all. Notable as they are, they are but silent witnesses of
those restless and resistless forces which have brought them into
being. But when one beholds the mighty Yangtse and attempts
to form an estimate of the volume of silt carried seaward in the
rush of its muddy waters, and tries to judge of its land-forming
as well as its land-denuding powers, one stands in the presence of
dynamic grandeur, which to our mind exceeds the passive greatness
as of the " everlasting " yet silent hills. It is this appreciation of
dynamic greatness which overwhelms an observer of the tidal bore
as it sweeps in from Hangchow Bay and rushes past Haining, a solid
wall of water from two and a half to three miles wide, perhaps ten,
twelve or even twenty feet high, with a speed of ten to twenty miles
an hour, according to the intensity of the tide. Imagine, if you can,
one and three quarter millions of tons of water passing by you each
minute, the rush to continue several tens of minutes, and you will
have no difficulty in believing that this inrush of water makes itself
felt still as a big wave at Hangchow, thirty miles farther inland, and
even for some miles beyond.
