OUR INLAND WATERWAYS 295
fact of his presidency, Theodore Roosevelt was as a Moses leading the
people from an " oppressed and degraded state of commerce " in which
they found themselves beleaguered, as did their forebears a century and
a quarter before. Nearly all the water craft of the river system were
assembled; railways abandoned schedules and stopped freight traffic to
accommodate specials ; entire towns were evacuated that the inhabitants
might gather on the river front. On the average each river town —
Keokuk, Quincy, Hannibal, Louisiana, St. Louis, Cape Girardeau, Ste.
Genevieve, Cairo, Memphis, and the rest — showed more spectators
standing out to salute the presidential party than its entire population ;
while day and night the air was rent with acclamations of voice, steam
whistle, shrieking siren, salvo of guns, and roar and rattle of fire-
works.
Individual members of the commission, singly or in groups, studied
the Ohio, the upper Missouri and its tributaries, the vast Columbia
Valley and Puget Sound, the California rivers, Eio Colorado, the
streams of the Gulf slope, and the waters and projects of the Atlantic
slope. And the interest of citizens grew in every state, until the au-
tumn of 1907 produced such a crop of conventions and such a volume of
support for waterway improvement as no other peaceful issue ever
evoked. The Irrigation Congress in Sacramento in September; the
Lakes-to-Gulf meeting at Memphis, the Upper Mississippi Improve-
ment convention at Moline, the Interstate Waterway convention at
Victoria (Texas), and the celebration of the opening of Hennepin
Canal at Sterling, in October; the Trans-Mississippi Congress at
Muskogee, the Atlantic Deeper Waterway conference at Philadelphia,
the Drainage Congress at Baltimore, the Gulf State Waterway con-
vention at Birmingham, and the Ohio Improvement Association meet-
ing at Wheeling, in November; the National Rivers and Harbors Con-
gress at Washington in December — these were among the national or
interstate conventions devoted either primarily or secondarily to water-
way improvement and attended by hundreds or thousands of delegates
from every state and territory and representing every industrial and
public interest of the country during the closing months of 1907.
And state executives have commenced to combine not only with their
constituents but with each other; at Sacramento there were five gov-
ernors, at Memphis eighteen, at Muskogee and Washington half a
dozen each and at several others from one to three.
Nor is this the end : Under their broad instructions the commission
found it needful to consider not merely the improvement of our rivers
but the use and conservation of related resources; and deeming the
proper administration of these a duty devolving jointly on the nation
and the states, they asked the president to follow Washington's example
by invoking the advice of our several co-sovereignties in a conference on
