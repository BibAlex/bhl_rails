OUR INLAND WATERWAYS 297
It may conservatively be stated that the inadequacy of transportation
facilities is little less than alarming; that its continuation may place an arbi-
trary limit on the future productivity of the land; and that the solution of the
difficult financial and physical problems involved is worthy the most earnest
thought and effort of all who believe in the full development of our country and
the largest opportunity for its people.
While we now have 26,200 miles of navigable rivers and some 2,800
miles of canals in operation (with nearly as much more inoperative
or abandoned) which during 1904 carried, respectively, 127,000,000
and 5,000,000 tons of freight, we have also 222,500 miles of railways
which during 1906 carried 1,631,374,219 tons — i. e., although the
United States has a more extensive and better distributed natural sys-
tem of inland waterways than any other country, and despite the fact
that water carriage costs on the average but a third or a fourth as
much as rail carriage, less than one ninth of our freight lines are
waterways, and only one twelfth of our commodities are carried by
water. And of our aggregate assets of say $107,000,000,000, our
steam railways have risen to some $16,000,000,000 or $18,000,000,000,
or nearly one sixth, which even at first sight seems out of proportion ;
and the disproportion becomes still more glaring when current pro-
duction is compared with railway earnings — the former in 1906 reach-
ing $7,000,000,000 to $10,000,000,000 (according to mode of estimate
of farm products) and the latter $2,325,765,167, or fully one fourth
as much. The case is clear; we are employing extravagant agencies
and paying exorbitant rates for transportation; the prices of our
staples depend too little on cost of production, too largely on cost of
carriage.
The condition is not new, only grown worse yearly; it led largely
to the establishment of the Department of Commerce and Labor, and
wholly to the creation of some of its bureaus; it has led to legisla-
tion in several states, and thence to conflict between state and federal
authority in a number of cases; and above all else it has led to such
paralysis of settlement and production as to check the growth of
the country. In a dozen states the " oppressed and degraded state
of commerce " is not an idle phrase ; it denotes a condition now in-
tolerable, and soon to be suicidal unless relieved, and that by measures
both prompt and permanent. Our productions are ample and our
ports sufficient to maintain a beneficial balance of international trade;
yet products and ports were but a burden unless the one can be laid
down at the other at prices permitting interchange with the rest of
the world. Our Panama Canal is a gateway to the nations — yet of
what profit to us unless our exports can be delivered on the sea-board
at a competitive figure, i. e., at a reasonable increase on the cost of
production ? The time has come to inquire whether Boston, New York,
