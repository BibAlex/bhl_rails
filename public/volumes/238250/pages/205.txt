In short, therefore, it is clear that if meaningless resemblances are
numerous and striking, one can accept protective resemblance and
mimicry only in instances which have been fully demonstrated. And
we may in the meanwhile mark as doubtful numerous cases which now
pass current in zoological literature. Among these would, I believe,
fall the famous leaf-like butterfly, Kallima, which Weismann has
adopted as the ne plus ultra of protective resemblance, for in the lack
of adequate experimental evidence even this form may prove to be a
meaningless resemblance, and not the product of selection. That it
may be, and probably is, of protective value at the present time can
as readily follow from an accidental resemblance which happens to
turn out to be valuable as from one which has been the product of

numberless selected variations. In fact, it is quite credible, it seems
to me, that accidental favorable variation may have furnished the basis
of many a useful resemblance â€” as some mutationists believe. And
there are no peculiar "adaptive characters" in Kallima which can
safely be construed as more complicated than the meaningless char-
acters of the Taira crab. For in what way is the resemblance of a
