Thomson wanted a receiving instrument which, unlike the ordinary
telegraph instruments used in post-offices and railway stations, could
render the interpretation of such suggestions possible in the hands of
an expert signaler, and he devised the mirror galvanometer speaking
instrument to obtain this result.
Another most important fact that his theoretical investigation
brought out was that no increase of battery power could counteract the
retardation in the signals produced by an impurity existing in the
copper conductor of a cable, and hence that every yard of copper wire
used in the thousands of miles of a long cable must be electrically
tested for resistance before being used.
But all this appeared to the electrician as arising from the igno-
rance of an inexperienced young man who had never erected a mile of
telegraph line in his life, and would not have been given a job in any
telegraph office. And so when signals through the 1858 Atlantic cable
became weak, and a message from the president to our queen took
thirty hours in transmission, although containing only 150 words, and
which would need only three or four minutes to transmit through any
one of the good Atlantic cables of to-day, the only remedy of those who
looked down on the theories of the young Glasgow professor was to use
Whitehouse's " thunder pump," a magneto-electric machine which pro-
duced a sudden large electromotive force when the armature of the
permanent magnet was jerked off the poles of the magnet. But these
shocks only sent sparks through the gutta-percha insulating coating
and hurried the poor cable to its doom, so that even the three words
per minute which would have been the utmost limit of speed possible
had this cable been entirely uninjured, were replaced by absolute
silence.
But Thomson energetically struggled on and, pursuing (as he told
me afterwards) a " Parnell-Biggar policy " at the board meetings of
the Atlantic Cable Company, obstructed all business until the directors
promised to have all the copper wire tested for resistance before being
made into cable; and thanks to Thomson for his theory of signaling,
to that engineer of energy and surprising resource, even when quite a
lad, Sir Charles Bright, to Captain Anderson of the Great Eastern,
and to all those who have followed in the history of submarine cable
development the London Stock Exchange is by cable to-day within
thirty seconds of Wall Street.
Thomson's work in connection with submarine telegraphy has been
epoch-making. But thirty-three years ago it was associated with what
I felt was a national loss. I give it in an extract from a long letter
