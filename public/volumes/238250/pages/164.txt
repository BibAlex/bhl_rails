THE HANGCHOW BOUE

by the report of Captain Moore, R.X., 4 who in 1888, in command of
H. B. M. ship Rambler and two auxiliary craft, undertook a thorough
survey of the river and estuary, which In- continued in 1892, and whose
\<-sels narrowly escaped total wreck.
The Birth of the Boke as shown by Observed Water Levels
In this survey observations of water-level were taken simultaneously
at three places: Volcano Island, away out at the mouth of Hangchow

Bay; Rambler Island, fifty-one miles farther in; and Haining, twenty-
six miles up the river. These measurements exhibit the nature of the
bore very clearly. At 8 :30 p.m. the water was one foot below mean
level at Volcano Island, twelve feet below at Rambler Island and
eight feet below at Haining. Thus the water sloped down from Hain-
ing outward to Rambler, and also downward from Volcano inward
to Rambler; the water was running up the estuary toward Rambler
Island, and down the river to the same point. By 9 :30 there was no
great change, but the water had risen two or three feet at Volcano
Island and at Rambler Island. By 10 o'clock the level was rising
rapidly at Rambler, so that there was a nearly uniform downward slope
