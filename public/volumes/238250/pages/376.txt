skull (Fig. 5). There is no pineal foramen in the dorsum of the skull
and it lacks a few of the characters of the other amphibians known
from this region.
Interest in the early Amphibia has not slackened in the later years
and there have been many contributors to the knowledge of the early
forms. There are at present nearly seventy-five species of Carbonif-
erous Amphibia known from North America and as many have been
recorded from the Carboniferous and Permian of Europe; many more
undoubtedly await discovery. The forms do not differ greatly in their
structure in the two continents and each has relatively the same amphi-
bian fauna, although the North American fauna is perhaps somewhat
older than the European one. Certainly the Branchiosauria are found
