New School Projection Lantern C
Every teacher today recognizes the advantages to teacher as
well as pupil of the wider use of the Projection Lantern in the
classroom.
Our Lantern C has been especially designed for school work.
It is a thoroughly high-grade Apparatus, and while equipped
with our latest improvements we can offer it at a price which
brings it within the reach of even the elementary school. The
construction of this Lantern is such as to permit the instant change
from ordinary projection to microscope projection, and thereby
adds greatly to its scope of usefulness.
The advantages of a Lantern in the social affairs of a school
ivill ajso readily suggest themselves.
This device is simple, efficient, portable — may be easily re-
moved from one room to the other — and practically covers the
whole range of school projection work. Price complete, $50 ;
with Acetylene Burner, $45. Send for descriptive circular.
