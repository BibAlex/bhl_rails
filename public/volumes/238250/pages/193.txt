the conservation of natural resources. Acceding to the request, the
president has invited all the governors of states and territories (each
with three advisers) to convene in the White House in May next and
discuss ways and means of conserving the waters and other resources
of the country with him and with those cabinet officers, justices of the
supreme court, senators, and representatives whose duties may permit
attendance — and nearly all the executives have already accepted and
named their coadjutors.
So the events of the young century strikingly duplicate those
immediately succeeding American Independence : Again questions of
commerce and interstate relations have become paramount — and in
multiplied magnitude and complexity; again it has become necessary
to take stock of those material possessions on which the perpetuity of
our people must depend — though now the possessions comprise not
only the land areas contemplated by the founders but the still greater
values residing in waters and woods and mines and soils, which were
inchoate then but have come into actuality and dominance through
the natural growth and orderly development of the nation; again it
seems necessary for a waterways commission to appeal from its own
court to an interstate conference representing that highest tribune, the
poeple — though now the appeal can not result in a federal constitution
(which came from the former in such perfection as to meet all later
needs), yet can hardly fail to bring about a closer readjustment of
the magnified sovereignties and multiplied possessions developed on
that fundamental platform. The president has expressed the feeling
that the May conference promises to be one of the most important
assemblages in our history; and the people and the press have con-
curred with a unanimity seldom evoked, and giving assurance that the
anticipation will be realized.
Nor is it to be forgotten that in advocating the development of
our natural channels of commerce, Eoosevelt is but following the foot-
steps of Washington and Jefferson, and Eoot but treading the path
blazed by his early predecessor Gallatin; though they are supported
in cabinet, notably by the progressive Secretaries Garfield and Wilson,
far more vigorously than were the pioneers — indeed, never before have
a people and an administration been so firmly united in efforts to
improve an " oppressed and degraded state of commerce " with the
attendant conditions of national prosperity.
The Need for Navigation
The most pressing demand of the day connected with our inland
waterways is for navigation and carriage of freight. The need is
urgent. The notably reserved and cautious Interstate Commerce Com-
mission has just declared:
