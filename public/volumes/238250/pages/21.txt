Kollin, where he kept and experimented upon sick sheep, horses,
chickens affected with cholera, mad dogs and guinea-pigs. At the
end of five years of study and experiment he was satisfied that his
remedies would prove effective for animals, but was skeptical as to their
efficacy with men. While in doubt a boy of nine by the name of
Meister, from Alsace, was brought to him for treatment. He had been
bitten eleven times, and his case was thought hopeless. Drs. Vulpian
and Graucher advised Pasteur to try his remedies on him. He might
live. He would die unless something was done for him. At about
the same time the boy Jupille, who had shown such bravery that the
academy had voted- him one of its prizes for " Vertu," came to him.
Both were cured. Great popular enthusiasm followed. People who
had been bitten by mad dogs and who had thought there could be no
help for them came every day to the rue d'Ulm where Pasteur was at
work. In 1886, of nineteen Eussian peasants, several of whom had
been bitten in the head, fifteen were cured. Quarters soon became too
small. Confident in his remedies, and in himself, Pasteur now ap-
pealed to the public for money for a new site, larger buildings and
opportunity for more extensive experiments. More than 3,000,000
francs were contributed. The new building, which was very plain,
was put up at Vaugrinau, and opened November 11, 1888, with great
eclat. The president of the republic was there and with him some of
the most distinguished men of the day.
More than one hundred persons every day are inoculated with the
healing vaccine. The course of treatment occupies about eighteen
