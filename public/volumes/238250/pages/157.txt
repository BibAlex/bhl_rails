place for bushes and small trees, they constitute a notable feature of
this very creditable piece of Chinese engineering. Some idea of the
destructive force of the bore may be had by inspecting the first buffer
east of the pagoda. It is about one third demolished, so that instead
of a well-rounded form it now consists of four or five distinct terraces,
which are probably constantly settling down and pushing the lower
terraces into positions affording less resistance to the tide. On the
other hand, the buffer just west of the pagoda is in splendid repair
and behind it high up on the topmost granite platform several junks
were enjoying a safe shelter.
The stones on the top of the wall are from twelve to sixteen inches
wide, sixteen to eighteen inches thick, and from three and a half to
four feet long, and most of the blocks used both in the wall and in the
platforms of the footing seem equally large. Along the top of the
