average 250,000 taels per annum, which has led many people of this
region to call this sea-wall " China's Second Great Sorrow," giving
place to only the Yellow Eiver as her " First Great Sorrow."
For purposes of management and repair the wall is divided into
three major divisions with a superintendent over each. These divi-
sions are again divided into many sections about a mile long, and for
each mile there are at ordinary times four to six watchmen who patroj
their section much as railroads are patrolled.
The first cost of construction must have been enormous, and the
mere existence of the wall suffices to show that it must have been of
vital importance and that the land it reclaimed and now protects must
have been of immense value to justify such an expenditure.
As it exists to-day its total length is one hundred and eighty miles,
and for one third of this distance it is faced, as at Haining, with
heavy blocks of granite and varies from twenty-five to thirty feet in
height above low water. Each successively higher layer of granite
slabs recedes about five inches, thus forming steps, a very welcome
arrangement when, after descending to get camera views of various
parts of the wall just before a bore was due, we had hastily to retreat
before the oncoming flood.
The main difficulty in maintaining an efficient sea-wall would seem
to be to have an outer footing adequate to break the first violence of
the incoming bore and to prevent the undermining of the foundations
of the main bunding â€” in fact it would seem essential that the tides
