built closely together — each house looking exactly like its neighbor.
Possibly the city's sponsors remembered the experience of Glasgow,
whence many examples and traditions were naturally derived. There
the evils of overcrowding bore their ill fruit until some time in the
sixties, when a great change was enforced. The inestimable benefit of

The tenement districts must still be spoken of apologetically, for
there are portions of Pittsburgh where the dwelling houses of the
poor and working classes are decidedly bad. But the city is no worse

the great industrial paradise has caused an influx of laboring classes
which no amount of intelligent study could have forestalled. As to
general cleanliness there is much to be hoped for, and expected. Not
all of the sections of the city are as well kept as they should be; but
nobody doubts that conditions are to be improved in the near future.
