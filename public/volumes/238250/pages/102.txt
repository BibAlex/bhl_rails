1. How many Germans are settled in the states represented by the
officer addressed?
2. Are they settled in collected colonies or scattered over the
country ?
3. Are they generally engaged in agriculture or in other pursuits?
With this circular a blank form for reply was enclosed, covering all
necessary ground for securing a comprehensive description of the con-
dition of German colonization in Latin America.
A general cordiality was encountered among members of the diplo-
matic and consular services in giving the information at their com-
mand, so that reports, more or less definite, were received from every
one of the republics. They are here presented in tabular form to aid
in a study that shall reach a fair understanding of one of the most
important problems facing the American people; one that will appear
the crucial problem of the twentieth century. It concerns the en-
franchisement of 60,000,000 human beings, the inhabitants of this
western hemisphere, and their consequent entry into a superior civil-
ization.
The tabulation proceeds from Mexico, our nearest neighbor, to the
most remote state of the southern continent, preserving thus a correct
spectrum of the geographical relations.
These figures will be a revelation to the alarmist, apprehensive
that Latin America is being submerged beneath a German population

area of 8,000,000 square miles of territory, already occupied by a native
population of more than 60,000,000, who have secured through war
their independence of foreign domination, which they show a disposi-
tion to guard with jealous watchfulness.
In the comments appended to their reports by consuls and ministers
there is the unanimous agreement that German immigrants constitute
