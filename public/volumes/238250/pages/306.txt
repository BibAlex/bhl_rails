TEE EDUCATION OF TEE COLORED RACE 457
civilized world. We assert that it is a fundamental duty of the United
States government to its own citizenship in the promotion of morality
and in the establishment of every department of industry, invention and
manufacture which ultimately tends to the improvement, progress and
prosperity of the nation as a whole and stands as a bulwark of strength
in the time of trouble.
Granting the correctness of statistics already given, every true
citizen of the nation will admit that the present conditions existing
for the education of southern children must be improved. The writer
has ventured to outline a method 7 by which this may be accomplished.
It is evident that if the United States government assumes the respon-
sibility of the education of the colored children of the south, the white
people, relieved of this burden, will be the better able to meet the
educational requirements of their own children.
There are 600 places in the southern states, not counting Virginia,
Maryland and Kentucky, which contain 1,000 people or over. In these
dwell about 3,000,000 people, white and colored. The other 14,000,000
are country people. This number is over 17,000,000 if the above-named
states are added. About 10,000,000 of these are native white Ameri-
cans with 3,500,000 children to be educated; and there are seven
millions of colored people with 2,500,000 children to be educated.
The area of this country is seen in the following table :

Virginia 42,450
North Carolina 52,250
South Carolina 30,570
Georgia 59,470
Florida 58,680
Alabama 52,250
Mississippi 46,810
Louisiana 48,720
Arkansas 53,850
Tennessee 42,050
Total 4877100
Kentucky 40,400
Texas 265,780
West Virginia 24,780
Maryland 12,210
Owing to the small proportion of colored people with respect to
the total population in Kentucky and West Virginia and the small
proportion of them in comparison with the great area of Texas, these
states are omitted from the present calculations. Other appropria-
T This method must be regarded as merely provisional. It is intended for
the most part to give an idea of the expenses necessary for an adequate educa-
tion of the colored race.
