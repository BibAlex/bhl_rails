passed them harmlessly by, merely drenching them with spray. The
flood following behind, however, quickly floated them off this place
of security, but with a few turns of the ropes, the junks were quickly
remoored and continued to ride safely on the racing tide. This ac-
complished, their loading was hastily completed, and within an hour
they were away for a fresh destination up stream, or, waiting two hours
longer, were able to effect an outward passage.
It was a curious sight to see the other junks, which previous to the

in amid the after-rush, past Haining toward Hangchow, with all sails
set but with their bows in every direction. On the days we observed
there were each time a baker's dozen of them, but sometimes as many
as thirty junks may be seen utilizing tidal energy for ascending the
river at a speed exceeding that of an ordinary steam vessel of equal
size. As soon as they could steer a little, they made for the shelters
behind the buttresses, where they allowed themselves to be stranded
by the falling tide.
Steam vessels, not being able to follow the junkmen's method of
avoiding the difficulties of navigation, can not use the river. The
imminent danger to which those attempting it would be exposed might
be inferred from the description we have given, and is clearly shown
