the invisible rays below the red) ; and Brashear undertook the solution
of the problem of producing accurate surfaces upon lenses and prisms
made of this substance. Its deliquescent character was a factor very
difficult to contend with, but a method was discovered by which sur-
faces were produced within a half light wave, answering to the most
critical demands of Langley's bolometric research. During a visit to
the Chicago World's fair, in 1893, some unusually fine rock-salt crystals
from mines in Poland were found in the Eussian exhibit, which were
secured for the Smithsonian Institution, from which some of the
largest and finest lenses and prisms were made. Langley's joy in

Brashear's success was boundless â€” and naturally so. The proportion
of invisible radiated heat, underneath the red part of the sun, is many
times greater than the visible rays. It is through the curious quality
of rock-salt lenses and prisms that it became possible to concentrate
the dark, lower heat rays, and to achieve the splendid results with the
bolometer.
Professor Langley's life work and the honors that have been heaped
upon him are so well known that to enumerate them would be super-
erogatory. The secretaryship of the Smithsonian Institution is the
highest gift of science in America, and this honor he held for nearly
twenty years, until his death in 1906. He was given the Eumford
Medal of the London Eoyal Society, and elected to a membership in
that body; was president of the American Association for the Advance-
