being narrower than the others, and the parts of the rosette
are differently arranged. But the similarity of the rosette of
both these and some other species to typical asymmetrical
Astcromphalus has led us to include ours in that genus. It was
unquestionably such intermediate forms as these that caused
Greville to unite Astcromphalus and Astcrolampra in one
genus.

This species has been listed from the Miocene shales of
California more than once; in fact, Schmidt's first figures (pi.
37, figs. 1-4) are from "California" and were published in
1876. We cannot find that Ralfs illustrated the species, and,
if not, California should be considered the type locality be-
cause, without figures, the best descriptions of diatoms are
almost worthless. At the date the Atlas was published
European workers had received comparatively little material
from California other than fossil and it seems fairly safe to
assume that Schmidt's was the latter. Therefore, we are in-
clined to consider Monterey Shale as the original type material
of this species, rather than that of Ralfs from the Gulf of
California.
We have two perfect specimens from the Miocene deposit
of Arroyo Hondo, Maria Madre Island. One has eleven
spines and the other three, yet they seem to be the same; the
number of spines in this genus is a dangerous criterion for the
separation of species. The smaller specimen with three spines
has practically no umbilicus, but specimens similar in this
respect have been figured heretofore. The species is very con-
vex in the center.
The specimen with three spines. No. 1891 (C.A.S. coll.),
is .1114 mm. in diameter; the one with 11 spines. No. 1892, is
.1476 mm. in diameter.
