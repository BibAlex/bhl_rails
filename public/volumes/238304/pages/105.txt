44. Coscinodiscus pacificus Grunow
Plate 16, figure 1
Coscinodiscus pacificus Grunow, Schmidt, Atlas Diat., pi. 60, 1877, fig. 13;
the identification of this figure from Barbados is by Fricke in the
Index to the Atlas, 1902, p. 7.
Si)ecimens from the deposit on Maria Madre Island agree
perfectly with Schmidt's fignre named above by Fricke. Four
rather large beads form a slight rosette in the center and this
seems to be the only distinguishing feature between C. pacificus
and C. radiatus Ehrenberg. This group of Coscinodiscus is
difficult to understand and there can be no doubt but that too
many names have been and are still being used. Diameter of
specimen figured (No. 1924, C.A.S. coll.) .1296 mm.
45. Coscinodiscus radiatus Ehrenberg
Plate 15, figure 12
This and various other so-called species of this section of the
genus are very difficult to decipher, but under C. radiatus w^e
have placed those coarsely-marked specimens from Maria
Madre Island with radial rows of beads, a "watch case milled"
effect, and no central pore or rosette of large beads in the
center. When this rosette is present and the "milling" still
perfect the diatoms appear to have been placed under C. oculus-
iridis; C. pacificus appears to differ from the latter only in the
imperfect "milling" arrangement of the markings. Diameter
of specimen figured (No. 1924, C.A.S. coll.) .0628 mm.
46. Dicladia pylea Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 16, figures 4, 5
Valve view of frustule a regular, elongated oval, with one
conical projection in the center of one valve, this projection
being rounded on the tip; the other valve has two conical pro-
jections equal in size and with some irregular branches of
silica at the tops. Major diameter .0678 mm.
Type: No. 1928, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene.
