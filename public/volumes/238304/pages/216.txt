Vol. XV] McLELLANâ€” BIRDS AND MAMMALS 315
A male in the collection taken on August 14, 1922, is ex-
periencing a renewal of the wing- and tail-coverts, as well as the
contour feathers. An immature in its first contour feathers,
taken on July 11, 1905, is much paler than the Guadalupe bird
in similar plumage. The under parts shade from white on the
throat to a very pale vinaceous-cinnamon on the under tail-
coverts. A female taken on July 11, 1905, is in worn plum-
age. A new third primary is the only indication of moult.
The measurements, in millimeters, of the Academy's series
are given below.

San Benedicto Rock Wren
Rock wrens were not numerous on San Benedicto. Mr.
Slevin found them on the southern slope of Mt. Herrera and
a few on the western shore. According to Mr. Wright, the
wrens were nesting at the time of the visit of the Ortolan.
Five males, three females (one immature), and one unsexed
bird were secured on May 12.
Two males, two females, and the unsexed bird are in worn
livery, but moult has not commenced. One male has new
feathers on the crown. Another has new flight feathers, and
moult on other areas is nearly complete, but many pin feathers
are in evidence on the crown and wing- and tail-coverts. A
third male is in fresh plumage, save for some worn lesser
coverts. This bird is a partial albino. Its plumage is much
grayer than that of the other fresh-plumaged male, and there
are patches of white on the upper parts. The under parts of
the immature bird approximate in coloration those of the San
Martin specimen in similar plumage, but the upper parts are
