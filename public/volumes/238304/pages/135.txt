I. Phyllodactylus tuberculosus Wiegmann
Four specimens (Nos. 58950-58953) were taken on Maria
Madre Island May 16-23, 1925. These were found under the
bark of trees, and on walls of deserted houses where they
were found at night while searching for insects.
2. Anolis nebulosus Wiegmann
Taken on Maria Madre and Magdalena islands. This little
lizard was found on the trees, vines, and stones in the ravines
and cafion bottoms. It was not found to be a common species
on either island.
The color in living specimens may be gray or light brown,
with irregular dorsal markings of black or orange, sometimes
forming bands on the tail. The limbs are cross-barred with
black. The under surfaces are whitish. Males have a large
dark red or yellow gular pouch extending along the belly to
a point midway between the hind limbs. One specimen (No.
59004) has a wide light dorsal stripe edged with black.
3. Uta lateralis Boulenger
Common on both Maria Madre and Maria Magdalena
islands. It inhabits the area back of the beach line where it
is found among the driftwood and fallen trees.
A male (No. 59049) was colored in life as follows: Upi>er
surfaces grayish, with four regular rows of black oval blotches
between the limbs ; limbs barred with black ; a yellow streak
along the side of the head from the snout to the fore limb;
throat light blue; belly blue with obscure black spots.
The femoral pores in twenty specimens vary from ten to
thirteen; being 10 eight times, 11 nineteen times, 12 seven
times, and 13 six times. Males have enlarged postanal plates.
