Surirella patens Schmidt, Atlas Diat., pi. 4, 1874, figs. 16, 17; "Carpen-
teria Bai."
Specimens which agree essentially with those of Schmidt
are common in the Miocene deposit on Maria Madre Island.
The central hyaline space in his figures is bordered on each
side with a longitudinal row of dots which extend from end
to end; in our specimens these rows are not continuous, there
being a blank space in the center. This would hardly seem
sufficient difference to warrant specific separation. Each of
the large transverse bars of silica has three rows of minute
beads, which, except under proper magnification and illumina-
tion, appear as striae. Our photograph shows the true charac-
ter of these markings. Length of specimen figured (No. 1986,
C.A.S. coll.) .0946 mm.; width .0375 mm.

Plate 21, figure 3
Valve long and slender, subrostrate truncate at the ends ;
very convex, the cross section being as shown at a in figure 3 ;
longitudinally the valve is also very convex in the center ;
markings consist of heavy transverse rows of beads which
leave a narrow longitudinal hyaline line through the center;
this line, however, does not reach to the ends of the valve but
tapers out to nothing at about .01 mm. from the ends; the
rows of beads are not uniformly placed as in S. ulna (Nitzsch)
but they often bifurcate. Length .2236 mm. ; width .01492
mm. ; number of rows of beads in .01 mm. at center of valve, 8.
Type: No. 1987, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene.
The great convexity of the valve in cross and longitudinal
sections and the coarse, close-set lines of beads separate this
