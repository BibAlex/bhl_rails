Vol. XV] HANNA & GRANT— MIOCENE MARINE DIATOMS \^\
nitidus^^ from the Barbados fossil deposit. This latter does
not appear to deserve separation from C. nitidus. Diameter
of specimen figured (No. 1921, C.A.S. coll.) .0314 mm.
42. Coscinodiscus nitidulus Grunow

Coscinodiscus nitidulus Grunow, Schmidt, Atlas Diat., pi. 58, 1877, fig.
20; "Campeche Bay," Gulf of Mexico.
A single specimen of this delicate diatom was found in the
Maria Madre Island Miocene material. It differs from
Schmidt's figure only in having the beads roughly arranged
in radial rows while in his they are more or less in zones,
there being three radial rows in each. But since the arrange-
ment is not well marked in either form it is believed to be un-
important. Diameter of specimen figured (No. 1922, C.A.S.
coll.) .0475 mm.

A few typical specimens of this widely-spread species were
found in the Maria Madre Island Miocene deposit. They
appear to be identical with the form Grunow called C. oculus-
iridis niorsiana^^ but for which there seems to be little reason
for acceptance. The subspecies originally came from Miocene
material from Santa Monica, California. Diameter of speci-
men figured, No. 1923 (C.A.S. coll.), .1454 mm.
