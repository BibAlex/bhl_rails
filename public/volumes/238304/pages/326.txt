This is smaller, more obtusely conical, and less common
than the following species, from which it can be promptly dis-
tinguished by its two columellar plaits.
32. Tornatellides clarionensis Dall, new species
Plate 35, figure 9
Shell reddish brown with six moderately rounded whorls;
suture distinct, not deep; base evenly rounded, perforate; a
very slender thread-like rather than sharp pai ietal lamina and
a feeble plait on the pillar, often invisible from in front, but
stronger in the young; axis slender and twisted; height, 4.0;
diameter, 2.25 mm.
Type: No. 2208, Mas. Calif. Acad. Sci. ; collected by the
Academy expedition on Clarion Island rather abundantly, at
the east end, at an elevation of 500 feet, also at 1,040 feet, and
near sea level at Sulphur Bay.
Doctor Pilsbry states that this is a species of the T. simplex
group of Polynesia. It differs from all Hawaiian and Poly-
nesian species but not more than they differ among them-
selves. This, T. mexicana, and T. chathamensis Dall, of the
Galapagos Islands, are the only species recorded from off the
American shores, but it would not be surprising if future col-
lectors should discover the genus on the continent.
Genus Succinea Draparnaud, 1805
