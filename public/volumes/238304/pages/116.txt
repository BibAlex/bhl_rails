Monterey and Santa Monica, California, fossil deposits, and

seems problematic.

71. Navicula regata Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 18, figure 13
Valve small, slightly constricted in the middle, roundly
pointed at each end ; marked with a double row of transversely
elongated beads or bars on each side of the median area, the
latter with a faint row of dots on each side of the raphe which
is not placed on a heavy bar of silica. Length .0418 mm. ;
width .020 mm.
Type: No. 1959, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene.
This minute species seems to be closest to one from Cam-
peche Bay, Gulf of Mexico, figured by Schmidt*- and ques-
tionably referred to N. donkini Schmidt. But the latter and
all other constricted diatoms of this section of Navicula ap-
pear to have the raphe placed on a heavy rounded bar of silica ;
details of markings are likewise very different in the new
species.

Navicula smithii Brebisson in W. Smith, Brit. Diat., Vol. 2, 1856, p. 92. —

Schmidt said that his figure, cited above, was a typical valve
of the highly variable N. smithii and our Maria Madre Island
fossils are closer to it than any other we have found. The
