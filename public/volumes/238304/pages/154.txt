EXPEDITION OF THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF
SCIENCES TO THE GULF OF CALI-
FORNIA IN 1921
MOLLUSCA OF THE FAMILY TRIPHORID^
BY
FRED BAKER
Owing to the inability of Dr. G. Dallas Hanna, Curator of
Paleontology of the California Academy of Sciences, to ac-
company this Expedition, the writer was chosen to take charge
of the collecting of mollusks. He joined the party on the
S. S. Mazatlan at San Pedro, California, and left it over
three months later at Yuma, Arizona. For the itinerary of
the Expedition reference should be made to the General Ac-
count^ by Mr. Joseph R. Slevin, in charge of the Expedition.
Dr. Hanna has already reported on the land and fresh water
mollusks taken by the Expedition.^ The Polyplacophora were
referred to Dr. S. Stillman Berry for study and report and it
is expected that his papers will appear in due time. .
It was originally planned to make a single report on the
marine mollusks, but unavoidable delay has made it seem bet-
ter to treat one or more famiHes in separate papers in order
to get the results in the hands of specialists as early as possi-
ble. The present paper is the first of this series.
