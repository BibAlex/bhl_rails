Items of Interest
The Academy's income from rent during 1926 was
$92,097.78, this being the largest annual income enjoyed
since the lease of the Market Street property in 1909. For
1927 a gross income from rents of about $89,000 is expected.
Interest charges on a mortgage loan, now $225,000, will
reduce this income by $12,375 leaving a net anticipated in-
come for 1927 from the Commercial Building of $76,625.
Other sources of income will increase this amount to about
$81,000.
