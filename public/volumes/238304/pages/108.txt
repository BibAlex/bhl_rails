Vol. XV] HANNA & GRANT— MIOCENE MARINE DIATOMS I45
be considered as transverse costae divided in two parts longi-
tudinally, with three or four on each side of the central nodule
divided into three parts (in another specimen the longitudinal
rows number three through the valve on each side of the cen-
tral area) ; pseudo-raphe very distinct and almost equal in
width throughout. Length of type .0962 mm. ; breadth
.0117 mm.
Type: No. 1933, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925; Miocene.
This elegant species is similar to only one known to us,
G. marinuni (Ralfs), which has the transverse costse broken
into four beads, is more pointed terminally and less convex
medially.
The species is named for Mr. Hershel L. Driver, of Los
Angeles, California, an enthusiastic student of micro-
organisms.
51. Glyphodesmus sigmoideus Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 16, figure 10
Valve slightly asymmetrical, swollen at each end and
slightly convex in the center; central and terminal nodules
distinct; pseudo-raphe distinct and sigmoid in shape cor-
responding to the asymmetry of the valve; markings consist
of about 50 heavy transverse costae on each side of the pseudo-
raphe, each one being broken irregularly into beads. Length
of type .0520 mm. ; breadth at end .0079 mm. ; at center
.0061 mm.
Type: No. 1934, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene.
G. williamsoni W. Smith^^ ap])ears to be the closest related
species to this, but that fonn is much less swollen terminally,
is not convex in the center, and lacks the slight but constant
sigmoid outline of the form being described. Very few valves
were found, but probably most of them were lost in the clean-
ing operations due to their small size.
