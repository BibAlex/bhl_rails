[Proc. 4th Ser.
The exceptional facilities afforded by the Ortolan and the
willingness of the Navy Department to cooperate in every way
possible made it seem desirable to visit a few other places than
the Revillagigedo Islands. Full details and reasons will be
found set forth in later pages and it will suffice here to
enumerate the points visited. They are: Guadalupe Island;
Alijos Rocks; Revillagigedo Islands; Tres Marias Islands;
Mazatlan; Cape San Lucas; Magadena Bay; San Bartolome
Bay; Cedros Island; and San Quintin Bay.
