scapular region a few worn olive-green feathers among the
fresh black ones.
77. Astragalinus psaltria hesperophilus Oberholser.
Green-backed Goldfinch
A flock of about 30 goldfinches was noted on Cedros Island,
June 5. They appeared to be very wild. One specimen was
secured. It is apparently an immature just passing into adult
plumage, moult being in progress on the body feather tracts.
The primaries have not been replaced and the white margins
of the outer ones have been completely worn away.
78. Passerculus rostratus guttatus Lawrence.
San Lucas Sparrow
An adult male of this si)ecies was taken at Magdalena Bay
on May 29. The bird is in worn plumage, but no feather re-
newal has commenced.
79. Junco insularis RidgAvay. Guadalupe Junco
Juncos appeared to be scarce on Guadalupe Island, but it is
possible that they were more numerous at elevations higher
than those visited by the Academy's party. A male and female,
taken near shore on April 21, were the only ones seen. The
male is undergoing a postnuptial moult, a feather renewal in-
volving all areas being in progress. The female is in greatly
worn livery, but moult has not yet begun.
80. Amphispiza bilineata deserticola Ridgway.
Desert Sparrow
At Magdalena Bay, Desert Sparrows were more numerous
than elsewhere. They were scarce at San Bartolome Bay, and
their numbers had greatly diminished on Cedros Island since
1922. The specimens taken on Cedros were found near the
spring at the top of the island.
Seven males (one juvenile), two females, and one unsexed
bird were obtained at Magdalena Bay, May 30; two males.
