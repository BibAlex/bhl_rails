\0L. XV] McLELLAXâ€” BIRDS AND MAMMALS ^QC)
a female, and one unsexed bird were gotten at San Bartolonie
Bay, June 2 ; and a male and female were collected on Cedros
Island, June 4.
With two exceptions, the birds from Magdalena Bay are
experiencing a postnuptial moult. In some cases feather re-
newal has affected only the plumage of the throat and crown,
in others, it has progressed to include all the feather tracts.
The juvenile has recently gained its definitive plumage. The
birds from San Bartolome Bay are in about the same stage
of moult, but those from Cedros Island are a little behind and
have but pin feathers on the crown and throat.
81. Amphispiza belli (Cassin). Bell's Sparrow
Although Bell's Sparrow was not very abundant on San
Martin Island, three males, six females (one immature), and
two unsexed birds were obtained on June 8. A male and
female were also taken at San Quintin on June 7.
Postnuptial moult is well under way in all but three adult
birds. All areas, including the wing (coverts and remiges)
and tail, are included in the feather replacement. Two imma-
ture birds in their first contour feathers show no indications
of assuming winter dress.
82. Pipilo carmani Baird. Socorro Towhee
Towhees were very abundant on Socorro from sea level to
an altitude of about 2700 feet. Most of the specimens were
secured near the spring at Grayson's Cove. Twelve males
and two females w^ere collected on May 4 and 10. All the
birds are in worn plumage. A few had not commenced to
moult, but the remainder had feather renewal in progress on
the crown and throat. In two cases moult has advanced to
affect all the body feather tracts.
83. Cardinalis cardinalis igneus Baird. San Lucas Cardinal
Several cardinals were seen in the scrub about Cape San
Lucas on May 28. One adult male w-as collected.
