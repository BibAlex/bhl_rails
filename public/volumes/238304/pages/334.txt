A CRITICAL INSPECTION OF THE GNATCATCHERS
OF THE CALIFORNIAS
BY
JOSEPH GRINNELL
Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California
In further process of critically determining the collections
of birds accumulating from the San Pedro Martir region of
Lower California, I have come to the gnatcatchers (genus
Polioptila). Two groups are involved, the Black-tailed series
and the Blue-gray series. In making this inquiry, there have
been available to me not only the extensive materials in the
Museum of Vertebrate Zoology but also certain important
specimens in the private collection of Dr. Louis B. Bishop,
and, through the courtesy of Dr. Barton Warren Evemiann,
Director, the pertinent specimens in the Museum of the Cali-
fornia Academy of Sciences. From the United States Na-
tional Museum, through the kindness of Doctors Wetmore
and Richmond of its staff, there have been sent on for my ex-
amination the examples in that Museum from the Cape district
of Lower California including the two Ridgway types.
With respect to the Blue-gray Gnatcatchers first : A western
subspecies, Polioptila cacndea obscura, has been recognized
almost universally since first pointed out by Ridgway (1883,
p. 535). The form was named in an "editorial" footnote, by
September IS, 1926
