This faunal list, while not large and unquestionably not
complete for the fonnation, is extremely important, since its
affinities are western North American, and Maria Madre
Island is the southernmost point from which such a fauna has
yet been reported. A large majority of the species occur in
the Pliocene of Southern or of Lower California. None shows
relations with either the Caribbean,^ Panamanian, or Peru-
vian provinces.
The composition of the fauna indicates an upper Pliocene
age, certainly no older than the Pliocene of Cedros Lsland,
Lower California, and the San Diego formation of Southern
' O. megodon of the present fauna has been rei)ortâ‚¬d from the Tertiary of the
Caribbean region.
