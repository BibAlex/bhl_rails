Correlation
The inadequacy of previous collections from these deposits
until recently has prevented any definite correlation or de-
termination of their age. Veatch'** in 1860 gave a brief ac-
count of the general geology of Cedros Island and referred to
"fossiliferous sandstones of a late Tertiary age". The first
account of Tertiary fossils from Cedros Island is in the origi-
nal descriptions of Pecten cerrosensis, P. vcatchii, Ostrea cer-
roscnsis {^O. megodon), and O. veatchii (=0. vespcrtina) ,
by Gabb^*^ in 1869. He considered the deposits to be of Mio-
cene age. DalP'* in 1874, described Waldheimia kennedyi from
"beds of Miocene age, Cerros Island, Lower California", and
in 1898-'^ referred to the beds on Cedros Island as of either
Miocene or Pliocene age. Arnold" in 1906 considered the
beds on Cedros Island to be of Pliocene age, and equivalent to
the Purisima formation of central California. In 1919, J. P.
Smith"'^ correlated the Pliocene of Cedros Island with the Car-
rizo formation of Imperial County, California, and considered
both to be equivalent to the Etchegoin formation of the San
Joaquin valley. Kew-^ in 1920, described Dendraster pacificus
from the Pliocene of Pacific Beach, California, and of Cedros
Island, and apparently considered the deposits at these two
localities to be equivalent, and of upper Pliocene age. Darton^"
in 1921 in a paper on the Geology of Lower California, de-
scribed marine post-Miocene deposits exposed in the Arroyo
