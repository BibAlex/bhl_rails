Individuals of this coarsely-marked species are common in
the Maria Madre Island deposit. The number of short trans-
verse ribs at the stauros varies from two to four. Cleve placed
this form under N. directa questionably and stated that he had
not seen such a diatom as Gregory figured with radial striae.

65. Navicula lyra Ehrenberg
Plate 18, figure 5
Numerous specimens of this protean and widely distributed
species occur in the Maria Madre Island deposit. The range
of variation is much more circumscribed in the series studied
than is the rule among living specimens. The specimen figured
is representative of the series and corresponds very closely
with what Schmidt called "subtypical."^^ Numerous variations
have been named, based on differences of shape and sculpture,
but it appears that our specimens may remain satisfactorily
under the species name.^® Length of specimen figured (No.
1952, C.A.S. coll.) .1170 mm.; width .040 mm.
66. Navicula madrae Hanna & Grant, new species

Valve elongate, indented on the sides with a gentle concave
curve ; roundly pointed terminally ; heavily marked through-
out ; raphe spindle shaped, rounded at both ends and with a
