300 CALIFORXIA ACADEMY OF SCIEXCES [Proc. 4th Skr.
Five males, nine females, and four unsexed birds were col-
lected on May 4 and 9,
Feather renewal is in progress. In some cases the first pin
feathers are appearing on the throat, other birds have al-
most completed the moult. The feather replacement experi-
enced by the birds at this season seems to be a complete one,
as the contour feathers, rectrices, remiges, and wing-coverts
are all involved.
50. Amazona oratrix tresmariae Nelson. Tres Marias Parrot
Tres Marias Parrots were seen in pairs and flocks in various
parts of Maria Madre, and there were a number of them about
the water hole on Maria Magdalena. The fruit of various
species of Ficus was rii>e at the time of the visit of the Ortolan,
and the parrots were to be found congregated in the neigh-
borhood of the fruit-bearing trees.
The abundance of these birds is rather surprising in view
of the fact that the Tres Marias Parrot is held in high regard
as a pet because it learns to talk with great fluency. The con-
victs at the settlement on Maria Madre have built up a flourish-
ing trade with the mainland, and great numbers of young
birds are captured each year to supply the market.
No specimens were secured.
51. Psittacula insularis Ridgway. Tres Marias Lovebird
Lovebirds did not appear to be very common on Maria
Madre, and they were not noted at all on Maria Magdalena.
Some examples were collected from a flock feeding in a fig
tree in the neighborhood of Arroyo Hondo, others were found
in a fig tree near the trail leading across the island.
Four males and two females were taken on May 17 and 22.
The si>ecimens are all moulting birds. An immature male
is acquiring its first nuptial dress. Some of the birds have
feather renewal only well begun, others have it considerably
advanced. Apparently this moult is complete, as the body
plumage, remiges and wing-coverts, and rectrices are all in-
volved.
