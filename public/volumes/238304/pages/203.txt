43. Cerchneis sparveria phalasna (Lesson).
Desert Sparrow Hawk
Mr. Tose saw one sparrow hawk on Guadalupe Island,
April 19.
44. Polyborus cheriway pallidus Nelson.
Tres Marias Caracara
Caracaras were very abundant on Maria Madre, particularly
in the vicinity of the settlement. One specimen was taken on
May 22, but the skin was not preserved.
45. Pandion haliaetus carolinensis (Gmelin). Osprcy
Although Ospreys did not appear to be as numerous as
they were in 1922, they were still common on Cedros Island.
No specimens were secured.
46. Tyto alba pratincola (Bonaparte). American Barn Owl
Doctor Hanna and Mr. Wright discovered the kitchen mid-
den and feathers of a barn owl in a cave on San Martin Island.
47. Micropallas graysoni (Ridgway). Socorro Elf Owl
Socorro Elf Owls were found in the dense growth on the
lower levels of the island. They appeared to be less rare than
they were formerly supposed to be. Mr. Slevin obtained three
in a tree at the bottom of an arroyo near Braithwaite Bay.
Sailors obtained two downy young, but the location of the
nest was not recorded.
Five specimens are in the collection, â€” an adult male and
female, one unsexed bird, a juvenile female, and a downy
young, all taken on May 10.
The remiges and rectrices of the adult birds are worn, and
a few pin feathers are appearing on the crown and throat.
The juvenile female is in the hemiptyle stage and worn fila-
ments of down still adhere to the feathers. The plumage of
this juvenile lacks the intensity of color possessed by the adult.
