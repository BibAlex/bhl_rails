each tenninating inwardly in a knob ; each rib is marked with
a double row of faint beads. Length .080 mm. ; width
.0270 mm.
Type: No. 1953, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925; Miocene.
The species is similar to the one figured by Schmidt from
the Moron Deposit of Spain^" ; that form, however, has a
greater number of beads along the raphe, more ribs along the
margins and more secondary beads on each rib. The Maria
Madre species is common in the deposit and does not agree in
detail with several allied forms from the Monterey Shale of
California, such as N. vagahiinda Brun, N. sideralis Brun, etc.

Plate 18, figure 7
Valve broadly oblong, rounded on the ends, sides almost
straight; raphe narrow and straight; central nodule circular;
surface marked with slightly radiating lines of beads, those
nearest the margin being largest ; in the center of the valve
the dots are also so arranged as to make arcs of circles, the
convex sides outermost ; the valve is decidedly convex but
unevenly so. Length .0743 mm. ; width .0379 mm.
Type: No. 1954, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene,
A search of the literature has failed to disclose any
species comparable to this. It is very rare, and long search
failed to disclose a more perfect specimen than the figured
type, but it is believed to be worth describing since all the
essential characters are preserved.
"9 Schmidt, Atlas Diat., pi. 70, 1881, fig. 74; Fricke, in the index to the Atlas,
1902. stated that this Moron diatom was Naiiciila gemmata fosilis Pantocsck.
