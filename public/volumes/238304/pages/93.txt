Individuals of what appears from the published figures to
be this variable species occur not infrequently in the Maria
Madre Island deposit. A few minor differences have been
noted, but they do not appear to be of sufficient importance to
warrant specific separation. A. marylandica originally was
described from the Miocene deposit at Nottingham, Mary-
land, but has since been found widely distributed. The speci-
men figured, No. 1889 (C.A.S. coll.), is .0790 mm. in
diameter. .
16. Asteromphalus dubius Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 13, figure 2
Valve divided into ten equal sectors with division ribs ap-
proximately equal in size; beaded zone equal to one-half the
radius ; the beads of each sector arranged in three rows 60°
apart; rosette divided into 10 parts with heavy ribs between;
these ribs are not radially straight and near the outer ends
there are angular turns in various directions ; two divisions of
the rosette are larger than the others and these two meet in
the center of the valve. Diameter .060 mm.
Type: No. 1890, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene.
The species is distinct from all others known to us although
closely approaching A. moroncnsis Greville,^- from a deposit in
Spain. That species has nine sectors, one of the dividing ribs
