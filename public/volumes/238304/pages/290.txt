La Salada, some distance to the south of the present region,
and listed a few species found there. In 1922 Heim^" published
an account of the Tertiary of the southern part of Lower Cali-
fornia in which he gave the name Salada to the beds exposed
at the Cattle Ranch, La Salada. He gave no faunal list and
made no mention of the occurrence of Pliocene on Cedros
Island but stated that the Salada formation extended some dis-
tance to the north of the type locality. Israelsky", in 1923 de-
scribed three species of echinoids from the beds on Cedros
Island, and referred them to the Pliocene.
The first statement of the occurrence of Pliocene beds in the
Turtle Bay region appeared in 1924"^ on a geological map of
Lower California compiled from the results of the Marland
Oil Company. On this map and in the accompanying report,
all the Marine Pliocene of the peninsula was referred to the
Salada formation. Hertlein^'' in 1925, writing on pectens
from Lower California chiefly collected by the geologists of
the Marland Oil Company, correlated the beds on Cedros
Island with the San Diego fonnation of Pacific Beach ; he ap-
plied Heim's name Salada to the deposits at Turtle Bay and at
Elephant Mesa, and suggested the. equivalence of those beds to
those on Cedros Island. The writers concur entirely with
Hertlein's conclusions, except that they do not accept extension
of the name Salada to regions remote from the type locality of
that formation, until the fauna of the type locality is more
fully known. Hanna^*^ in 1925 and in 1926, referred to the
Pliocene beds on Cedros Island and at Turtle Bay.
The present study of collections far larger than those be-
fore available to Hertlein, while little altering the general cor-
relation of these beds, furnishes a basis for a fuller discussion
of the character and relations of the fauna.
In the preceding list of species the records from Cedros
Island, Turtle Bay and from Elephant Mesa are combined.
The deposits at these points are approximately equivalent in
