The land birds consist of a sparrow and a wren, neither one
abundant. Pelicans, western gulls and cormorants nest in
very large numbers.
Mr. Wright and I went back 100 yards into a lava cave
and found a pile of at least five bushels of bones of small mam-
mals. A few barn owl features gave a clue to the cause of the
accumulation.
California sea lions occupy the beaches of the west side.
No recent rain had fallen and as a consequence annual
plants were not available, but Messrs. Mason and Solis suc-
ceeded in getting about 25 species of perennials. Among these
were the beautiful endemic Dudleya and four or five species
of cactus. One of the latter forms a carpet over some large
areas and is very difficult to walk over.
Mr. Duhem captured one of the snakes belonging pre-

failed to get. According to Mr. Slevin, this was a very de-
sirable addition to our collection.
The little harbor (Hassler Cove) formed by the boulder
spit is a haven for small motor-driven fishing craft. Some
Japanese had a camp on shore where they were drying and
baling seaweed to be shipped to San Diego, presumably for
the manufacture of agar-agar.
Piled high on the beach was a portion of a wreck of a motor-
boat which had burned to waterline at no very distant date.
June p — The work at San Martin Island completed the
modified program we had outlined after the accident to the
Ortolan and San Diego was reached at 8 :45 a. m. Our re-
duced speed and increased fuel consumption had left us only
about one day's steaming supply when we went to the oil dock
at La Playa.
I proceeded to San Francisco by rail from San Diego.
June 10-12 — The Ortolan left San Diego at 7 a. m. June 10
and the last lap of the journey was completed at 6 :30 p. m.
June 12 when the ship tied up at the pier in San Francisco and
the party disbanded. Much to the pleasure of all of us, Messrs.
