VoT.. XV] DALLâ€”LAND SHELLS 479
inner lip springing from the imperforate umbilical depression;
major diameter, 3.1 ; height, 2.8 mm.
Type: No. 2199, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci. ; collected by the
Academy expedition on Socorro Island at 2,000 feet elevation,
a single adult but bleached specimen, and another (No. 2200)
on Maria Magdalena in fresh condition. It differs from all the
figured allied species in having a rounded rather than a
pointed apex.
21. Guppya montanicola Dall, new species
Plate 35, figures 10, 11
Shell small, pale straw-color, smooth, with about four and
one-third whorls; upper surface finely radiated by delicate
striae starting from the suture and becoming obsolete near the
periphery, the base marked only by feeble incremental lines;
spire low, whorls rounded but not inflated ; base moderately
convex, the umbilical depression shallow, imperforate; aper-
ture narrowly semilunate, the lips sharp, hardly expanded, the
inner lip starting from the umbilical pit and widely separated
from the outer one by the body of the whorl ; major diameter,
2.5; height, 2.2 mm.
Type: No. 2201, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci.; collected by the
Academy expedition on Socorro Island, on the north slope of
Mount Evermann, between 2,000 and 2,800 feet above the sea
level.
This is well distinguished, even in the young, from the pre-
ceding species by its depressed form. The juvenile specimens
sometimes show a minute umbilical perforation.
22. Guppya capsula Dall, new species
Shell minute, translucent brown above, lighter olivaceous
below, not polished, of three and a half turbinate well-rounded
whorls; apex dome-like, suture well marked, base evenly
rounded, perforate; aperture rounded; lips sharp, not reflected,
interrupted by the body; surface only marked by faint incre-
mental lines; height, 1.2; maximum diameter, 1.1 mm.
