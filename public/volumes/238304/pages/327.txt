4g5 CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES [Proc 4th Ser.
Type: No. 2209, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci. ; collected by the
Academy expedition on Clarion Island, at 1,040 feet elevation.
This appears to be very abundant. Some years ago the
Fish Commission steamer Albatross touched at Clarion Island
and collected a large number of this species, but, as they were
put in formalin, they arrived totally disintegrated.

Shell small, polished, very pale greenish-yellow, of nearly
three whorls usually covered thickly with the animal's excre-

larities of growth ; whorls well rounded, suture deep ; aperture
oblique, margins thin and sharp; not united over the body by

Type: No. 2210, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci.; collected on So-
corro Island, on the north slope of Mount Evermann at 2,800

This appears to be rare, as only seven specimens, old and
young, were obtained.

35. Proserpinella hannae Dall, new species
Plate 36, figures 6, 7, 8
Shell small, depressed, white, of three and a half smooth
whorls; periphery evenly rounded, suture distinct, not deep;
spire very slightly convex, base in the young with an umbilical
depression, in the adult covered with a flattish layer of enamel,
which extends about one-third of the way from the axis to the
periphery of the whorl ; the last whorl is slightly depressed as
it approaches the aperture, which is recessively oblique; outer
lip entire, not sharp nor notably thickened, with a small ex-
cavated curve where it approaches but does not quite reach the
umbilical pit ; body with a very thin wash of enamel and nearly
midway of the whorl a low lamella entering the whorl some
