7. Diomedea nigripes Audubon. Black-footed Albatross
One Black-footed Albatross was seen at sea north of Mag-
dalena Bay on May 3 1 .
8. Puffinus opisthomelas Coues, Black-vented Shearwater
The lights of the fishing party brought one Black-vented
Shearwater on board the Ortolan as she lay at anchor in
Melpomene Cove, Guadalupe Island, on April 19.
The foreneck and sides of breast of this specimen are
strongly sufifused with gray, and the lining of wing is mottled
with the same color.
A fully developed tgg was found in the oviduct.
9. Puffinus auricularis C. H. Townsend.
Townsend's Shearwater
Burrows of Townsend's Shearwaters were found in great
numbers at an altitude of about 800 feet under the grass
hummocks on the northern slope of Clarion Island.
Not many of the burrows were occupied. A few contained
eggs, but more had young nearly half grown.
This shearwater had not been previously reported as breed-
ing on Socorro, but on May 7, Doctor Hanna** discovered
burrows and fragments of a recently killed bird which was
believed to be one of this species. The burrows were at an
altitude of about 3000 feet in the vicinity of the steam vents
on the eastern slope of Mt. Evermann. The soil proved to be
so exceedingly hard that few burrows were excavated and no
other specimens were obtained. The birds were believed to be
numerous, however, as they were heard at night flying over
the camp.
Three males, four females, and two downy young were
gotten on Clarion on April 30. Several eggs were obtained on
April 30 and May 1, but only two were retained in the col-
lection. One was addled, and the other was in an advanced
stage of incubation.
