REVILLAGIGEDO ISLANDS
1. Uta clarionensis Townsend
An abundant species about the lowlands and rocky ridges
in the vicinity of Sulphur Bay, Clarion Island. This lizard
was found among the outcroppings of lava in the brushy
areas and seemed to be confined strictly to the lower levels
as none were observed on the plateau or higher parts of the
island.
A male (No. 58190) was colored in life as follows: Body
with irregular dorsal and lateral black markings; tail and
limbs cross-barred with black; ground color a rich cobalt
green. Females are brown above, show less of the black mark-
ings of the male, and have a yellowish lateral stripe extend-
ing from the ear opening to the hind limb. Under surfaces
are whitish. Both Van Denburgh^ and Townsend" si>eak of
the coloring as bluish, similar to Uta auricitlata from Socorro
Island, but these descriptions are evidently from alcoholic
specimens as all those now in the Academy's series have lost
the green coloring and have changed to a light blue.
The femoral pores in twenty specimens vary from ten to
fourteen; being 10 four times, 11 ten times, 12 sixteen times.
13 eight times, and 14 once. Males have enlarged postanal
plates.
2. Coluber anthonyi (Stejneger)
A common species about the sea bird colonies and cactus
patches in the vicinity of Sulphur Bay. Clarion Island. It
was found mostly in the dense thickets and apj^eared to be
confined chiefly to the area close to and encircling the sand
beach. Of the sixteen specimens taken none were found to
contain any food.
