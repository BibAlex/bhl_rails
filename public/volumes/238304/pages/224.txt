Calyx herbaceous ; floor of corolla throat either
with plaits or two lines of hair; filaments
with 2 rows of tack-shaped glands 6. Maurandya
Calyx membranous, purple ; floor of corolla
throat without ridges or lines of hair; fila-
ments lacking glands 7. Rhodochiton
I. LINARIA
The position of our native species in the genus Linaria has,
I think, not been questioned. I have not gone into the generic
position of some of the introduced ones, such as L. elatine
(L.) Mill., L. cyuibalaria (L.) Mill., and L. minor (L.)
Desf., such a study scarcely being within the scope of this
paper. Though I key these out in Linaria, such action should
not be interpreted as an expression of opinion concerning the
status of Kicksia, Cymbalaria, and Chaenorrhinum.
