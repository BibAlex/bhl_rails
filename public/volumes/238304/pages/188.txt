THE RELATION OF FORAMINIFERA TO THE
ORIGIN OF CALIFORNIA PETROLEUM*
BY
THOMAS F. STIPP
Diatomaceae are generally regarded by geologists as being
the source of most of the petroleum of California. In 1867.
J. D. Whitney, in a paper read before the California Academy
of Sciences, called attention to the organic origin of the oil of
the Pacific coast. The following is quoted from his paper :
"In conclusion, it may be remarked that the marine infusorial rocks of
the Pacific Coast, and especially of California, are of great extent and
importance. They occur in the Coast Ranges, from Clear Lake to Los
Angeles. They are of no little economical, as well as scientific interest;
since, as I conceive, the existence of bituminous materials in this state,
in all their forms, from the most liquid to the most dense, is due to the
presence of infusoria — the proofs of which statement I will, at some
future time, endeavor to set before the Academy."^
Diatomace?e at that time were classed with the Infusoria,
their distinction not then being clear, but it is evident from the
context of the article that Wliitney referred to the Diatomaccie
as being the source of the petroleuuL Whitney's paper is
