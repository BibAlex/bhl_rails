Vol. XV] McLELLANâ€” BIRDS AND MAMMALS 31 J
were taken on Maria Madre, May 15, 16, and 23, and a male
and female on Maria Magdalena, May 20 and 21. The ex-
amples are apparently in nuptial plumage. One of the females
has the gray of the nape still somewhat obscured by greenish
margins.
88. Virco hypochryseus sordidus Nelson. Tres Marias Vireo
This species appeared to be rare on the Tres Marias, and
but one specimen was taken on Maria Madre, May 23. The
bird is apparently in prenuptial dress.
89. Compsothlypis pitiayuma insularis (Lawrence).
Tres Marias Parula Warbler
This warbler was probably the most abundant species on the
Tres Marias. At the time of the visit of the Ortolan, its
metropoleis were at Arroyo Hondo, on Maria iSIadre, and the
water hole on Maria Magdalena. It was found, however, in
the scrub near shore and in the various arroyos.
Five specimens (three males and two females) were col-
lected on Maria Madre on May 15, 16, and 23. A pair was
also secured on Isabel Island, May 24.
Two females taken on Maria Madre appear to be in fresh
body and wing feather, the rectrices exhibiting more wear.
Tlie remainder of the specimens have the plumage more worn,
but only one, which has pin feathers on the forehead, has com-
menced to moult.
90. Compsothlypis graysoni Ridgway. Socorro Warbler
The Socorro Warbler was found to be very numerous, par-
ticularly in the vicinity of the spring near Grayson's Cove. It
occurred, however, wherever the heavier growth extended, re-
gardless of elevation. Twelve males, one female, and two un-
sexed birds were taken on May 3. About half the specimens
have the feathers of the head and cervix margined with olive
yellow. The remainder of the birds are in somewhat worn
dress, lack the olive yellow margins to the feathers, and are
acquiring new plumage on the forehead, crown, and throat.
