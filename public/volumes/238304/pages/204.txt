48. Speotyto cunicularia rostrata Town send.
Clarion Island Burrowing Owl
Burrowing owls were common on Clarion Island. They
had been nesting in the cliffs, and burrows were found under
vines and cacti. No eggs were discovered, and the young birds
were all able to fly^^. Insects seemed to be the staple food.
Three males and eight females are in the collection.
One male appears to have completed its postnuptial moult.
Two females are in worn dress, and show no indications of
feather replacement. The contour plumage of a male and
two females is in good condition, save for that of the head,
upon wdiich pin feathers are showing. Three other birds are
in worn plumage, but new. feathers are appearing on crown
and throat.

Large flocks of paroquets were seen in the hinterland of
Socorro, and several pairs of sup|>osedly breeding birds were
observed about Grayson's Cove. No nests, however, were
discovered. The fruit of Bitmelia socorrcnsis seemed to be a
favorite food of this paroquet.
