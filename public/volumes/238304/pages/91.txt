The most common diatom in the Maria Madre Island de-
posit is an Actinoptychus which we have considered to be
nndiilatus. The specimen figured is characteristic of the forms,
and, although great variation was noted, this average-sized one
is .0553 mm. in diameter. It is No. 1883 (C.A.S. coll.).

Our specimens from Maria Madre Island Miocene do not
seem to differ from the above sufficiently to warrant specific
separation. The one figured, No. 1884 (C.A.S. coll.), is .1174
mm. in length and .0192 mm. in breadth.
13. Amphora maria Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 12, figure 6
Valve asymmetrical, cresentic, ends rounded knob-like;
concave margin gently convex in the region of the central
nodule; convex side with a zone of heavy, transverse, costae,
easily resolvable into beads under proper illumination ; between
this zone and the raphe there is a blank space followed by a
row of coarse beads close to the raphe ; on the concave side a
row of heavy transverse costae starts with each end but these
decrease in length to finer and finer beads toward the central
nodule which they do not reach. The type is .1080 mm. in
length and .020 mm. in breadth.
Type: Xo. 1885, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925; Miocene.
