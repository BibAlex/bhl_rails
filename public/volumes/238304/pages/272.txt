nae ::1:10; ocelloccipital line : greatest diameter of lateral ocellus ::4:3.5;
elevated portion of malar space crowded out or nearly so ; head with
whitish and black hairs ; front rather indistinctly, longitudinally striate,
not elevated into a welt along the fovea; fovea at most : ocellocular line
::10:14; foveal band wanting; distance between fovea and ocelli : ocel-
locular line ::4:14; fovea gradually attenuated below its middle and con-
tinued to a point apparently between the clypeal and the antennal line,
filled with dark seal-brown hairs; vertex and temples along the upper edge
of the eye and sides of front along the fovese with black hairs ; face dull-
ish, with distinct punctures that are as many as five puncture-widths apart ;
clypeus in the middle not elevated above the apical margin, nearly planate,
sculptured like the face except that the punctures are smaller; clypearea
wanting; clypeus thinly hairy, its sculpture not at all hidden by hairs; la-
brarea unituberculate, its width at base : length down the middle : :6 :4,
width at apex : length down the middle : :2 :4 ; labrarea at base : dis-
tance between lower corners of clypeus ::6:18; labrum with a fringe of
golden hairs, without a median longitudinal crista between the labrarea
and apical edge of labrum; joint 3 of antennae :4 + 5 ::10:7, joints 4
& 5 thicker than long, the succeeding joints as thick as long or little
longer than thick except joint 12 which is distinctly longer than thick;
antennae blackish throughout ; mandibles nearly typical, slender, extend-
ing to beyond the lower angles of the clypeus, black except for the apex
which is dark reddish ; palpi atypical, slender ; thorax covered with an
abundance of pale ochreous almost white and whitish hairs that are as
long on the dorsulum, where they are pale ochreous, as are the whitish
hairs on the mesopleura; dorsulum dullish, finely reticulated and dis-
tinctly punctured like the face, but not so closely ; notauli represented
by an impressed shining line ; mesopleura densely sculptured nearly
rugose, indefinitely punctured ; scutel hairy and sculptured much like the
dorsulum ; metanotum hairy and sculptured like the dorsulum except that
the sculpture is denser and less distinct ; tegulae dark brown, partly
polished ; wing base partly blackish brown ; subcosta blackish brown ;
stigma pale brownish stramineous, rest of veins dull stramineous ; legs
blackish, except for the tarsi which are more or less brownish, covered
with brownish golden and ochreous hairs ; scopa typical, its hairs pale
ochreous, almost white, the- hairs at base above decidedly darkened; hind
metatarsi at most apparently a little wider than mid metatarsi; pro-
podeum with its enclosure poorly defined, dullish and finely reticulated
and with a few basal plicae ; rest of upper face of propodeum finely
reticulated, coarsely pitted and covered with fine whitish hair ; propodeal
pleura coarsely sculptured, wrinkled ; abdomen with its tergum dullish,
finely reticulated and finely punctured, the punctures from two to six
or more puncture-widths apart on the first tergite, hardly closer on the
succeeding tergites ; second, third and fourth tergites without an apical
hair band; apical edge of first, second, third and fouth tergites with a
pale stramineous border, second tergite with its elevated portion down
the middle : depressed portion ::12:15; fifth tergite shining, reticulate,
its coarse punctures closer together than the punctures on the other
