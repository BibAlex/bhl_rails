moult progressing on upper and under wing-coverts and rec-
trices. In no case did moult appear to be complete. The one
immature bird in the collection shades from mummy brown on
the head to a cinnamon brown on the rump and upper tail-
coverts. The under parts are suffused with tawny-olive, deep-
est on the under tail-coverts. The under tail-coverts are
immaculate.
107. Thryomanes insularis (Lawrence). Socorro Wren
Socorro Wrens seemed to be abundant. Many were noted
about the spring near Grayson's Cove, and they also occurred
among the trees on the slopes of Mt. Evermann to an elevation
of at least 2700 feet. Nine specimens (three males and six
females) were collected. An adult male and female are in
completely new livery. The remaining examples have the
plumage somewhat worn, but show no indications of moult.
108. Pheugopedius felix lawrencii (RidgAvay).
Lawrence's Wren
Lawrence's Wren is exceedingly abundant on Maria Madre.
It is commonly a denizen of the second growth scrub.
Three adult males and an adult female are in the collection,
taken on May 15 and 16. They are all in somewhat worn
plumage, but exhibit no signs of moult.
109. Auriparus flaviceps lamprocephalus Oberholser.
Cape Verdin
A number of these birds were noted about Magdalena Bay,
and four males, an adult and an immature female, and three
unsexed immature birds were collected on May 29 and 30.
One female was taken at Cape San Lucas on May 28.
The plumage of the adult birds shows a good deal of wear,
but moult has only just commenced. Pin feathers are present
on the throat and breast of two individuals, and a third has
just gained a new proximal primary and two new rectrices.
The bird from Cape San Lucas has a pair of fresh rectrices,
and new feathers are appearing on the crown. The immature
birds are wearing the first definitive feathers.
