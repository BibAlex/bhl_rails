Our specimen, which agrees in minute detail with the ori-
ginal figure of Grunow as well as the one in Schmidt's Atlas,
was picked out of the Maria Madre Island deposit and others
were seen. It would seem to have very little in common with
N. powellii Lewis,** although Cleve united it subspecifically.
Likewise, there appears to us to be no substantial reason for
placing the species in a new genus as Heiden has done in
Schmidt's Atlas. It is a striking sj^ecies of Navicula but does
not seem to differ basically from many others of that genus.
Length of specimen figured (No. 1963, C.A.S. coll.) .1140
mm. ; width .0190 mm.
78. Nitzschia hondoensis Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 21, figure 5
Valve slightly sigmoid in outline; with a longitudinal row
of heavy quadrangular beads near but not adjacent to the
superior margin ; surface otherwise covered with minute dots
in transverse rows and at the same time in irregular, diagonal
rows toward the inferior margin. Length .1522 mm.; width
.010 mm.
Type: No. 1964, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene.
The species belongs to a group of which A^ sigum Smith
is the most familiar,*'^ but the Maria Madre Island fossil is
broader, and the row of coarse beading is set away from the
margin a f>erceptible distance, not adjacent to the margin as in
"Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila. 1861. p. 65, pi. 2, fig. 6.
"Schmidt, Atlas Diat., pi. 336, 1921, fiÂ«s. 1-6.
