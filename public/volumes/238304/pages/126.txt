Stictodiscus californicus Greville, Trans. Micr. Soc. London, n. s., Vol.
9, 1861, p. 79, pi. 10, fig. 1.— Schmidt, Atlas Diat., pi. 74, 1882,
figs. 4, 5.— WoLLE, Diat. N. Am. 1894, pi. 75, figs. 5-8 (not well
drawn).
This common west American species, first described from
the Miocene Monterey Shale, is also common in the deposit on
Maria Madre Island. It has not, apparently, been found living
on the west coast, but has been considered to be one of the best
markers of the widespread Miocene diatomaceous shale.
Diameter of specimen figured (No. 1984, C.A.S. coll.)
.0908 mm.
98. Surirella newmani Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 21, figure 1
Valve ovate, narrowly rounded on the ends with a narrow
lanceolate median hyaline area bordered by 10 heavy, radiat-
ing, flat-topped ribs ; each of these in the median section bears
two or three bars parallel to the rib ; border undulating, very
heavy and with some transverse striations ; with a lens of 2
mm. equivalent focus and N. A. 1.32 it was barely possible
to resolve the beads on the bars mentioned. Length .060 mm. ;
width .030 mm.
Type: No. 1985, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene.
This species comes close to an unnamed figure of Schmidt^*
from Campeche Bay, Gulf of Mexico, and which Fricke^**
stated was a doubtful "variety" of S. comis Schmidt. We
cannot agree to that identification and, even if correct, our
specimens dififer sufficiently to be recorded as distinct. It is
not uncommon in the deposit on Maria Madre Island.
The species is named for Mr. P. E. Newman, a micro-
scopist of great skill of San Francisco, California.
