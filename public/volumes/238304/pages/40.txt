data upon which to compute the periods of rain, we had to take
this chance. One of the objects of this expedition was to sup-
ply this deficiency, in so far as possible from a brief visit.
Bright sunshine which greeted us throughout our stay had
evidently prevailed for a long time. Most of the vegetation
looked to be autumnal ; leaves had fallen, seeds were ripe, and
apparently the perennials were the only ones in bloom to any
great extent.
It is my belief that the rainy season begins in September or
October, and ends in January. The land birds were not nest-
ing and the young ground owls were fully grown and flying. It
would seem that fresh eggs could not be had later than Febru-
ary. The same is true of the wrens.
The suggestion is therefore made that future expeditions
try to arrange to reach Clarion about January.

nacle about 60 miles west of Socorro Island. This rock is
about 100 yards long; the two ends, about 100 feet high, are
connected by a low isthmus not over 20 feet above the sea. At
