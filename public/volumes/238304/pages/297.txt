Examination of a large number of specimens of both typical
Pecten bellus Conrad and P. Iieniphillii Dall, from both Upper
and Lower California, has convinced the authors that these two
forms are merely extremes of an unbroken series, and belong
to but one very variable species. The name bellus takes pre-
cedence by right of priority.
P. hemphillii has been said to differ from P. bellus in that
the left valve is flat or concave in the former, rather than
somewhat convex as in typical P. bellus, and in that the radi-
ating ribs on both valves of Dall's species are more numerous
and more highly elevated. In the series examined by us we
find great variation in the combinations of these characters;
no two adult specimens are exactly alike in appearance, and
the extremes are perfectly united by intermediate forms. The
number of ribs on the right valve varies from 14 to 18; the
ribs vary greatly in width, elevation and prominence, and the
convexity of the two valves is in no wise constant. Young
examples, up to an altitude of 20 mm., are all very similar in
appearance.
