Type: No. 1977, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925; Miocene.
So far as we can determine no ovate Podosira has hereto-
fore been described, yet in the absence of characters which
would ally this little diatom with any other genus, we prefer
to leave it here for the present. Possibly it belongs to a group
which has not been generically segregated, yet warrants such
disposition. Specimens of the species are rare in the deposit.
90. Podosira polita Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 20, figure 5
Valve circular, convex, densely covered with minute bead-
ing except for a ragged, rugose, area in the center; the beads
have an imperfect watch case milled arrangement and are in
radial rows which form distinct zones, the rows of each zone
set at an acute angle to those adjacent. Diameter .0362 mm.
Type: No. 1978, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925; Miocene.
This beautiful species seems to be related to P. subfilis
(Bailey) but has much coarser beading than that species.
Moreover, sitbtilis has a perfect watch case milled arrange-
ment of beads, this has not.
91. Porpeia quadriceps Bailey
Plate 20, figures 6, 7
Individuals of this protean species are common in the Maria
Madre Island deposit. Several variations have received names
such as quadrata, ornata, rohusta, and inflexa, but, as Mann^-'
has pointed out, they have little to distinguish them and may
best all be united under the earliest name, quadriceps. Dr.
Mann also gave numerous references to the literature where
