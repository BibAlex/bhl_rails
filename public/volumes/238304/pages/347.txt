51Q CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES [Proc. 4th Ser.
composition effected by Mr. Frank Tose, have resulted in one
of the most artistic and interesting groups in the Museum.
The continued appreciation and approval by the public of
the exhibits maintained by the Academy in its museum and in
the Steinhart Aquarium is evidenced by the attendance which
continues large.
What has been accomplished in the several departments of
the Academy will appear more fully in the reports of the Di-
rector of the Museum and of the several curators to which
reference should be had. For their faithful cooperation and
service as for that of all employees of both the Academy and
the Aquarium I desire to express the appreciation of the
Academy.
It gives me pleasure, too, to note the courtesies extended
from time to time in a professional way both by Attorney
Edward Hohfeld and by Architect Louis P. Hobart who have
when called upon been generous with professional advice.
In closing I can only say that the Academy will continue to
serve within its means and holds itself ready to extend its
activities along scientific lines to an extent limited only by the
funds that may be placed at its disposal.
