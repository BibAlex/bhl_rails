As first pointed out by Arnold there can be little question
that the O. veatchii of Gabb, originally described from the
Pliocene of Cedros Island, and generally common in the Plio-
cene of southern California, is identical with O. vespertina
Conrad. It has not generally been recognized that the types
of Conrad's species came from San Diego, where the fomi
commonly known as O. veatchii is abundant.
O. aniara Carpenter is also probably identical with O. ves-
pertina, but absolute proof of identity cannot be given. The
name was applied by Carpenter to specimens in the C. B.
Adams collection of living Panama shells, and referred to
other examples from Mazatlan sketchily described by Carpen-
ter", under the title "Ostrea sp." As nearly as can be made
out from this description, without figure, O. aniara was meant
to represent a fairly large, plicate oyster, similar in general
characteristics to the present species.
O. haitensis, a species of the Caribbean Miocene is quite
similar to O. vespertina, but not certainly identical.
O. vespertina was found abundantly on Cedros Island,
around Turtle Bay, and near Elephant Mesa. It has previ-
ously been reported in the Gulf of California, from the Pleis-
tocene of Lower California, from the Saugus. the San Diego
and the Pico of southern California, from the upper Pliocene
of Maria Madre Island, Mexico, and the Pliocene of Coyote
Mtn.. Imperial County. California.
