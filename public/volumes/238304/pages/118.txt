der of disk sparsely covered with beads irregularly arranged
except for a short space near the center of each side where they
seem to be in short radial rows. Length .0859 mm. ; width
.0474 mm. ; width of zone of striae bordering raphe .0038 mm. ;
width of zone of striae at margin and in the center of the
valve .0034 mm.
Type: No. 1947, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene.
This delicate species partakes of the characters of A^. cali-
fornica in shape and arrangement of border and raphe zones
but the striae are very much finer, in fact an oil immersion lens
is required to resolve them into beads. It also has scattered
beads over the disk somewhat as in A^. prcetexta but is like-
wise much more delicate than that species.
The species is named for Mr. Thomas F. Stipp of San
Francisco, California, in recognition of his interest in mi-
croscopy.
76. Navicula subspectabilis Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 19, figure 3
Valve broadly ovate, rounded at the ends, similar to N.
spectabilis; zone of beading at the margin with only 50 trans-
verse rows of beads (spectabilis has 70 to 80 rows) ; large lyri-
form blank space, unmarked, broad, and with only a faint indi-
cation of projections medially of the marginal beaded zones.
Length .0445 mm. ; width .0267 mm.
Type: No. 1962, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene.
We regret the necessity of adding a new name to the over-
burdened group of which A'^. spectabilis is a member, but we
have been unable to find a figure or description which appears
to be sufficiently close to these small specimens to include them.
Besides the small size, the sparseness of the bead-rows is the
chief distinguishing feature.
