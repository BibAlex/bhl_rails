A. cornutum var. typicitm occurs mostly in the Sacramento
Valley while the var. Icptalcum is in the San Joaquin Valley.
The characters given by Gray in his description of leptalcum
scarcely seem sufficient for specific distinction, especially since
various intermediate conditions are to be found. The South
Fork specimen cited above has the small filaments narrow for
typicuni,h\x\. the large ones are pubescent toward the tips. A col-
lection at Mariix)sa, Congdon in i8g8 (C) has the short fila-
ments broad but all glabrous. A collection from Big Tree
Grove, Yosemite Lenunon (F), which comes from the region
for leptalemn, has the the large filaments pubescent. Another
intemiediate is from Rush Creek Mill, Fresno Co., McCardle
in i8p3 (Ca).
A. enmrginatum Eastw. is, I am confident, merely an eco-
logical fonn with wider leaves than normal. Even narrow-
leaved plants tend to have some emarginate leaves and the ten-
dency becomes quite marked when the leaves widen. I have
seen but two specimens that had been referred to emargina-
tiini: the type from Fresno, Jcnncy 216 (Ca), which has the
flowers of leptaleum, with the shorter filaments narrow and
with all quite glabrous. The other plant was a single one
mounted on the same sheet with several plants of typicum,
Chico, Bidzvell in i8j8 (G). This plant had been labelled
