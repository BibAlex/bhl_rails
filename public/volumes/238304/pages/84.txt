BY

AND
WILLIAM M. GRANT
The diatoms described in the following paper were collected
in May, 1925, by G. Dallas Hanna and Eric K. Jordan, mem-
bers of the expedition sent out by the California Academy of
Sciences. The collection consists of many samples of diato-
mite of high purity, obtained in the east bank of Arroyo
Hondo, a large wash which empties into the sea on the north
end of Maria Madre Island, one of the Tres Marias Group,
off the west coast of Mexico. The exposures are about two
to three miles inland from the shore.
The diatomaceous shales outcrop here and there for a con-
siderable distance along the creek and it was estimated that
the thickness of the deposit was close to 1000 feet, the dips
being from 15° to 30° and in general northerly direction.

a thickness of approximately 400 feet have the same northerly
