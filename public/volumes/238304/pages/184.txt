not be sure that some of them are not based on immature
teeth or teeth from other parts of the mouth. These different
forms, however, correspond fairly closely to different divisions
of Miocene time. The species are also divisible into two
groups differing in size of the tooth, those of large size having
a much greater number of serrations. It is notable that one
species with large teeth and another with smaller ones have
been found in each of the principal subdivisions of the Cali-
fornia Tertiary which are accessible for study.
After the above was written, Stanford University received
from Mr. L. M. Clark, a student in Geology, a very large tooth
of Car char odon temhloris from the Temblor formation of the
Miocene at El Toro, in Orange County, California. This
tooth is very much like the type. The serrations are fine, even
and close-set, about 150 on the convex t(\gt, about 130 on the
concave.
Median height of crown. 3^^ inches; of entire tooth, 5
inches ; slant height of crown, 4J/^ inches ; slant height of whole
tooth, 5^ inches.
This specimen represents a shark which was, in life, not less
than 120 feet in length and therefore one of the very largest
of all fishes.
2. Carcharodon morricei Jordan, new species
Plate 26, figure 2
In the Miocene deposits of Shark Tooth Hill, occurs an-
other species of Carcharodon, distinct from all others known,
unless these relatively small species of the different periods of
the Miocene, Pliocene, and Pleistocene, are all regarded as
variants of Carcharodon arnoldi.
The type of Carcharodon morricei is a tooth of moderate
size, the crown \y2 inches high, the total height 2 2/5 inches,
the slant height of crown 1^ inches, of the whole tooth lYz
inches, its form rather narrowly triangular, the height of the
crown greater than its width at base which is 1 2/5 inches.
The thick base of the tooth is scarcelv lunate, a feature in
