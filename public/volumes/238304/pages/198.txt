An egg- one-third incubated was taken on June 7 on San
Martin Island, where this species was nesting in large numbers.
20. Fregata aquila (Linnaeus). Man-o'- war-bird
The first Man-o'-war-bird observed by the Ortolan party
was noted by Mr. Musser on April 23, when the vessel was
about half way between Guadalupe Island and Alijos Rocks.
On Clarion Island many Man-o'-war-birds were seen on
the cliffs, and in flight after boobies, but there was no indica-
tion of nesting. They seemed to be absent from Socorro, but
they occurred about Roca Partida, and were found nesting^®
in large numbers on the high central plateau of San Benedicto.
Many of last year's young were seen about the nests, and the
rookery was strewn with dead birds of this age. Several fresh
eggs were secured from the nests, and the one preserved in
the collection was only slightly incubated.
Frigate Birds were seen about Maria Magdalena, and they
were found nesting on Isabel Island on May 24. The nests
were weak platforms placed in the tops of low trees. Most
of the eggs had hatched.
The collection comprises one immature female from Clarion
(April 28) ; one adult and four immature males (one marked
female, two unsexed), and two immature females from San
Benedicto, May 12.
The adult male from San Benedicto has postnuptial moult
in progress. The flight feathers are being renewed and moult
is advanced on the head and back, but only slightly so on the
neck and under parts.
Two immature males (one unsexed) from San Benedicto
wear the plumage of the adult bird, save for the grayish
feathers of the breast. Moult has commenced on both birds,
but the new feathers on the breast still have a grayish cast.
Two younger males (one labeled "female" and one unsexed)
have the head and forebreast cinnamon, the breast and sides
more or less dark colored, and the abdomen white. New
