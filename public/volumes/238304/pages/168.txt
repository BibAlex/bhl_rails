MOLLUSCAN FAUNA OF THE PLEISTOCENE OF
SAN QUINTIN BAY, LOWER CALIFORNIA
BY
ERIC KNIGHT JORDAN
Assistant Curator, Department of Paleontology
A large Pleistocene fauna from northern Lower California,
at a considerable distance to the south of the well-known de-
posits of San Pedro and San Diego, is of interest inasmuch as
it forms a step in the southward extension of our knowledge
of the Tertiary and Quaternary of the west coast. In the fol-
lowing paper it is intended to present a list, as complete as
possible, of the known Mollusca of the marine Pleistocene of
San Quintin Bay, together with a discussion of the strati-
graphic relations of the assemblage. Four new species are
described.
The material which forms the basis of this report was se-
cured by Dr. G. Dallas Hanna, Curator of Paleontology in the
California Academy of Sciences, as a member of the 1922 ex-
pedition to Guadalupe Island. Four days were spent by him
