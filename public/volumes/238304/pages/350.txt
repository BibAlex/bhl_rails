Vol. XV] EVERMANNâ€” DIRECTOR'S REPORT FOR 1926 5^3
Cooperation with Public and Private Schools, with
OTHER Institutions, and with Individuals
Cooperation of the Academy with public and private
schools, other institutions, and with individuals, continued
during the year as in the past. Thirteen portable habitat
groups have been in circulation during the school year in the
Berkeley public schools where the value of proper nature
study appears to be most fully appreciated in the Bay region.
Additional loan exhibits will be made available whenever there
is a demand. Loans of specimens of birds or other natural
history objects have been made to a number of schools, insti-
tutions and individuals. Lists are in our files.
