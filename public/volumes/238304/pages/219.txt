110. Polioptila plumbea (Baird). Plumbeous Gnatcatcher
One individual of this species was taken at Cape San Lucas
May 28. The bird is in good plumage, save for the remiges
and rectrices. One secondary and one tertial appear to be
new, and a central rectrix is being developed.
111. Polioptila californica Brewster. Black-tailed Gnatcatcher
Gnatcatchers were fairly common at Magdalena Bay, and
two males and a female were taken there on May 30. One
adult and an immature male were also taken at San Quintin
on June 7.
One male from Magdalena Bay is undergoing a postnuptial
moult. The feathers are little worn, but pin feathers are
present on the crown and underparts. The central rectrices
and proximal secondary appear to be new. The other male is
in worn plumage, but no moult has commenced. The plumage
of the female is less worn, but pin feathers are appearing on
the crown and upper tail-coverts. The adult male from San
Quintin has a patch of pin feathers on the breast, the only in-
dication of feather renewal. The immature bird has no re-
placement in progress.
In the cases of one male and female from Magdalena Bay,
the black on the outer web of the outer rectrix is barely per-
ceptible, and the colors of the upper and under parts are in-
termediate between those of P. californica and P. plumbea. A
male and an unsexed bird, taken at Magdalena Bay, July 25,
1922, exhibit the same characters^\
112. Planesticus graysoni (Ridgway). Tres Marias Robin
Robins were common on the Tres Marias, particularly about
Arroyo Hondo, on Maria Madre, and the water hole on Maria
Magdalena.
Three specimens were taken on Maria Madre on May 17.
The flight feathers are in good condition, but the contour
plumage is somewhat worn. Moult has not commenced.
