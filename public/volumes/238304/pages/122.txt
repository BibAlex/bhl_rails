\'0L. XV] HANNA & GRANTâ€” MIOCENE MARINE DIATOMS ^53
87. Podosira adriatica (Kiitzing)
Plate 20, figure 2
Specimens which agree with Van Heurck's'^'' figure of this
species are not rare in the Maria Madre Island deposit. The
California fossil, P. febigerii Grunow, is similar in structure
but appears from the figures to be more heavily marked and
uniformly convex. Diameter of specimen figured (No. 1975,
C.A.S. coll.) .060 mm.
88. Podosira clarki Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 20, figure 3
Valve minute, strongly convex; border wide and radiately
striated ; surface except central zone marked by numerous ele-
vated protuberances ; also a series of minute beads uniformly
dispersed in a series of imperfectly radiating sectors ; these
beads also have an imperfect "watch case milling" arrange-
ment; central rosette small but distinct. Diameter .0360 mm.
Type: No. 1976, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene.
This minute species is so distinct from other Podosira with
its many large protuberances that comparison can hardly be
made with any. A lens with high numerical aperture is neces-
sary properly to resolve the beautiful markings.
The species is named for Dr. Bruce L. Clark, Professor of
Paleontology, University of California, who has often aided in
work with the diatomacese of California.
89. Podosira ovoidea Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 20, figure 4
Valve oval very convex, apparently hyaline throughout ;
central area less elongate ovate than the valve and bordered
by a single row of long, sharp spines ; margin narrow and
crenulated. Length .0247 mm.; width .0171 mm.
