55. Melosira sulcata Kutzing
Plate 17, figure 2
There appears to be no adequate means for the separation
of the many variations of Melosira which center around the
name sulcata. No two valves ever appear to be exactly aHke
and it has been said that even in the same chain of individuals
there are differences. Our Maria Madre Island specimens are
exceedingly beautiful and differ from the published figures in
certain details, but they differ among themselves just as much.

Our specimens agree precisely with the description and
figures of this species from Cami)eche Bay, Gulf of Mexico,
we can find no other described form with which it can be
united. As he pointed out, the costae are strictly unbeaded
and therefore the specimens are not admissible with such as
N. pcnnata or A^. longa. One of our Maria Madre Island
specimens is .0529 mm. long and .010 mm. wide.

Si>ecimens which agree in general with the above figures
are not rare in the Maria Madre Island deposit. The zones of
beading shown in our figure are there represented as lines, but
this may perhaps have been due to imperfections in the early
objectives. Also the figures cited show the hyaline area stip-
pled with dots; we do not see structures subject to such inter-
pretation on specimens mounted in styrax. In spite of these
differences it seems that our si>ecimens are very probably
californica. Length of specimen figured (No. 1939. C.A.S.
