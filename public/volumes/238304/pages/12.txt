Vol. XV] HANNAâ€”REVILLAGIGEDO ISLANDS EXPEDITION 5
emy and all of its integral departments for the fine spirit of
cooperation shown by every one in the Navy Department di-
rectly concerned. It is realized by all of us that considerable
sacrifice was necessary in the withdrawal of the Ortolan from
the proposed maneuvers in the Pacific and the detail of the
vessel to other duty.
Appreciation is also due to the hearty cooperation cf the
representatives of the Government of Mexico who accom-
panied the expedition.
And lastly, it should be stated that the responsibility for the
smooth-working, machine-like organization which left San
Francisco on April 15, 1925, rests with Dr. Evermann, Cap-
tain M. M. Nelson of the Ortolan, the members of his crew,
and the scientific staff. I am sure that all participants will
long cherish happy memories of the two months spent on
virgin islands in a tropical sea.
Purpose of this Report
The purpose of this report is to give as briefly as possible
the details pertaining to the organization of the expedition;
an itinerary ; and a running narrative with general infonnation
and facts of interest. The detailed studies based upon the
large collections obtained will naturally follow in separate re-
ports by various specialists. The reader is therefore referred
to these latter for definite data pertaining to the species of
animals and plants inhabiting the region.
Organization
The arranging of ^ the details of the expedition consisted
largely of selecting a scientific personnel and the requisite
equipment. The first was a relatively simple matter, and after
due consideration of all conditions which could be foreseen
the following persons were chosen to represent the various
departments :
1. Botany. Mr. H. L. Mason, then Professor of Botany
at Mills College, California.
2. Entomology: Mr. Hartford H. Keifer, Assistant Cura-
tor, California Academy of Sciences.
