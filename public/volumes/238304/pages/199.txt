21. Guara alba (Linnaeus). White Ibis
Two birds of this species were noted flying overhead at
Magdalena Bay on May 29.
22. Ardea herodias subsp.
Since no specimens of great blue herons were secured dur-
ing the voyage, the exact status of the birds seen must remain
in doubt.
Great blue herons were noted by Mr. Wright and Captain
Nelson near Sulphur Bay, Clarion Island, on April 28 and
29, but none was seen on Socorro.
Three of these herons were seen by Mr. Tose on Maria
Madre on the shore north of the settlement. They were also
noted on Maria Magdalena by Doctor Hanna. On Isabel
Island, also, they were present.
On May 29, birds of this species were observed at Magda-
lena Bay.
23. Nyctanassa violacea (Linnaeus).
Yellow-crowned Night Heron
Yellow-crowned Night Herons were present on Socorro in
small numbers. They frequented a patch of Opuntia to the
east of Braithwaite Bay, and Doctor Hanna^^ found that they
nested there. In the evening they visited the spring near Gray-
son's Cove to drink. Crabs seem to play a large part in the
food of these birds.
Birds of this species were also noted on the shores of Maria
Magdalena.
Four specimens were secured on Socorro on May 3 and 11.
An unsexed bird is evidently just passing into fully adult
plumage. A few dark feathers are still retained on the fore-
