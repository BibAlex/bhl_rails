The characters in general are the same as those of a fossil
from Sendai, Japan, called C. formosa Brun by Schmidt,-^
but the beading of the Maria Madre Island species is very
much finer and the rows radiate from the central area only
part way to the border ; the outer zone has the beads in rows
which t^ke various diagonal directions.

Coscinodiscus curvatulus Grunow; Schmidt, Atlas, Diat., pi. 57, 1877,
Fig. 33; "Monterey," California; probably from a Miocene fossil
deposit.
Apparently the fossil deposit at Monterey, California, is the
type locality of this species and our specimens from the Mio-
cene of Maria Madre Island could hardly come closer to perfect
agreement with the figure in Schmidt's Atlas than they do,
although his figures from other localities are not so close. The
curved radial rows of beads dividing the disk into sectors and
the additional rows in each sector parallel to the division row
are very characteristic features, possessed by no other diatom
than this group. Differences in living specimens from other
localities pertain to width of border and size of beads, both
characters of relatively little value in this group.

This remarkable diatom is not uncommon in the Miocene
deposit on Maria Madre Island. Its chief distinguishing
feature is the excentrically placed central area. Diameter of
specimen figured (No. 1913, C.A.S. coll.) .0558 mm.
