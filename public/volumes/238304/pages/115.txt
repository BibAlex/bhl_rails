68. Navicula pandura Brebisson
Plate 18, figure 8
Navicula pandura Brebisson, Schmidt, Atlas, pi. 11, 1875, figs. 1, 2, 4, 8, 9.
Coarsely-marked diatoms with double rows of mimite beads
on the costae are common in the Maria Madre Island deposit.
They agree in shape and sculpture with the figures cited, but
it must be said that some uncertainty attends the identification
of any diatom belonging to this group. Cleve*" was not able
to make satisfactory distinctions and united a great many
names, including pandura, as "varieties" under A'^. crabro.
Length of specimen figured (No. 1948. C.A.S. coll.) .1280
mm. ; width .040 mm.
69. Navicula pelagi Schmidt
Plate 18, figure 9
Navicula pelagi Schmidt, Atlas Diat., pi. 7, 1875, figs. 25, 26.
D. (iploneis) fusca var. pelagi A. S., Cleve, Kongl. Sv. Vet. Akad. Hand.,
Vol. 26, No. 2, 1894, p. 93.
Si:>ecimens which agree almost exactly with the original
figures of this species from Campeche Bay, Gulf of Mexico,
are common in the Maria Madre Island fossil deposit. They
show no indication of intergradation with A^. smithii in the
same deposit.
70. Navicula praetexta Ehrenberg
Plate 18, figures 10-12
Navicula prcetcxta Ehrenberg, Ber. Akad. Wiss. Berl. 1840 (1841), p.
214.— Ehrenberg, Microgeologie, 1854. pi. 19, fig. 28.— Schmidt,
Atlas Diat., pi. 3, 1874, figs. 30-34; pi. 129, 1888, figs. 7-8.— Mann,
Cont. U. S. Nat. Herb., Vol. 10, No. 5, 1907, p. 352.
This beautiful diatom is one of the most common of the
naviculoid forms in the Maria Madre Island deposit. Cleve
recognized two fossil subspecies, abundans Schmidt*' from
"Kongl. Sv. Vet. Akad. Handl., Vol. 26, 1894, p. 100.
"Atlas Diat., pi. 129, 18B8, fig. 8.
