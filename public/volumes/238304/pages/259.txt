on the outside with slender, several-celled hairs, glabrate with-
in, calyx-segments linear-lanceolate, the 3 upper ones subequal,
straight, 10-13 mm. long in flower, the 2 lower ones curving
upward. 9-12 mm. long, in fruit sometimes up to 2 cm. long;
corolla 3-4.5 cm. long, glandular-puberulent without, tube
greenish white with bluish tinge, swollen at base in front, 5-7
mm. long, 5-6 wide, glabrous within at base, hairy above,
throat of same color, sometimes tinged with yellow, 10-13
mm. wide, glabrous within, with 2 prominent pale plaits, limb
dark purple, reflexed, lobes 7-8 mm. long, suborbicular ; sta-
mens much as in scaiidais, but more heavily villous below the
genicula; pistil as in scandcns; capsule globose, ca. 1 cm. long,
the 2 valves projecting slightly beyond insertion of persistent
style, dehiscence terminal, rather irregular; seeds oblong, etc.
as in scandens.

was available: Hort. Cantab., 184^ (G, NY), 1836 (G) ;

Lindley's description gives the length of the corolla as 3 in.
and is followed by Bailey, 1. c. I have seen no material with
flowers more than half this length. The species is very close
to M. scandens and may be sufficiently distinct from that spe-
cies for varietal rank only.
