branching above ; leaves thickish, alternate, rather crowded,
linear, sessile, acute, 2-9 cm. long, 3-7 mm. wide, gradually
reduced up the stem, becoming linear-subulate bracts less
than 1 cm. long in the inflorescence, midrib of leaf ending in
rather obscure gland-tip ; inflorescence a secund, spicate rather
crowded raceme 1-7 dm. long, pedicels ascending, 3-7 mm.

into subequal, ovate-lanceolate, acuminate segments ( the 2
lower slightly wider and shorter than the others), 6-7 mm.

by the capsule, but still with connivent tips; corolla "red-pur-
ple," 16-18 mm. long, closed at throat, corolla-tube and throat
scarcely distinguishable, tubular with broad saccate spur which

tips, geniculate and especially hairy above the base, anther-sacs
divergent, confluent, each ca. 0.5 mm. long; pistil equaling
stamens, glabrous, curved, slightly bifid at apex ; capsule rather
thin-walled, strongly oblique, 7-8 mm. long, 4-5 wide, sub-
