P. ez'Ci'nuDuii differs from P. hakci Hertlein in possessing
more numerous ribs which are flatter and much closer together.
From P. purpnratus Lamarck, P. cvcnnaniii can be dis-
tinguished by the much greater number of ribs in the new
species.
This species is named in honor of Dr. Barton Warren
Evermann, Director of the Cahfornia Academy of Sciences, in
recognition of his notable scientific and executive accomplish-
ments.

A large number of specimens of P. hakci. in a much better
state of preservation than the original lot, has shown that this
species is closely related to P. purpuratus Lamarck, yet the
two species are clearly distinct.
P. liokci reaches a much larger size than does P. purpnratus.
The shell of P. hakei appears to be uniformly thicker than that
of P. purpuratus of equal size, and it is neither as distinctly
suborbicular nor as flattish on the umbo as are typical exam-
ples of Lamarck's species. P. hakci shows considerable vari-
ation in globosity. The specimen here figured tends to be flat-
tish while the young specimen figured by the junior author
(These Proceedings. Vol. 14, No. 1, pi. 4, fig. 2), is a much
more globose form. Furthermore, the anterior ear of the right
valve of P. hakci is apparently larger than it is on P. purpura-
tus; on some young individuals of P. hakci the anterior ear of
the right valve bears only three radiating' ribs, as do many of
the young of P. purpuratus, but differences in the ribbing on
