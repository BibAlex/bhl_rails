73. Carpodacus mexicanus dementis Alearns.
San Clemente House Finch
Only a few house finches appeared to be present on Cedros
Island, but a male and female were collected on June 3. Both
birds are in greatly worn plumage, but lack any indications of
feather renewal.
74. Carpodacus mexicanus ruberrimus Ridgway.
San Lucas House Finch
Although a number of house finches were observed at Cape
San Lucas, no specimens were included in the collection.
75. Carpodacus amplus Ridgway. Guadalupe House Finch
House finches are still abundant and widely distributed on
Guadalupe Island. A number were nesting in the cholla. The
nests examined were lined with goats' hair. Three were found
containing eggs, and one held almost fully fledged young. By
dissection of the birds, it was evident that the breeding season
was far from over. \Yhile some of the birds were unmis-
takably nesting, other females had ova practically undeveloped,
and other birds were almost ready to lay.
Eleven adult and two immature males and nine females were
taken on April 21. Three sets of eggs (incubation unrecord-
ed) were obtained on the same day.
All the birds are in somewhat w'orn plumage, and four of
the males are renewing the feathers of the head and throat.
76. Astragalinus psaltria psaltria (Say). Arkansas Goldfinch
This species was found to be abundant at Arroyo Hondo, on
Maria Madre, and it was also present about the water hole on
Maria Magdalena. An adult male and two unsexed birds (a
female and an immature male) were taken on Maria Madre
on May 17 and 20. A moult involving the body and flight
feathers is in progress. The adult male has a few feathers on
the interscapulars and rump showing indications of olive- ,
green, and the immature male retains on the cervix and inter- /CO^'
