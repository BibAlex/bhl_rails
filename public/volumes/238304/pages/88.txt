its assumption is unwarranted. Schmidt devoted plate 90 of
his Atlas to other modifications of the same group, but none
of those figured approaches our specimens as closely as those
named. In his form A. griindleri minor^ from "Santa Moni-
ca'' Monterey Shale, he illustrates the fact that alternating
segments even in the same diatom may bear one or two spines.
The presence of the ocellus on the marginal zone is of impor-
tant significance.
We take pleasure in naming this diatom after the late Pro-
fessor Jose M. Gallegos, a distinguished naturalist of Mexico
and a member of the Academy expedition of 1925.
7. Actinoptychus glabratus Grunow
Plate 11, figure 7
Actinoptychus glabratus Grunow, Van Heurck, Syn. Diat. Belg., PI. 120,
fig. 6, 1881.— Schmidt, Atlas Diat., pi. 153, figs. 7, 12, 1890.
A complete frustule," divided and mounted on one slide was
found in the material from Maria Madre Island. We have
hesitated somewhat in referring it to the above species al-
though it is very close to Schmidt's figure 12, cited above, of
a specimen from Guano in Peru ; he made the identification
questionably. The specimens bear a decided resemblance to
A. janischii Grunow, (Van Heurck Syn. Diat. Belg., pi. 122,
fig. 6. 1881 ; Schmidt, Atlas Diat. pi. 153, figs. 8-10, 21, 1890)
and there seems no reason why they might not very properly
come under that name if it be valid. We doubt the validity if
janischii and glabratus has precedence; therefore we have used
the latter name. Tlie species from the Monterey Shale of
California, originally figured under three varietal names by
Grunow, is believed to be distinct. Dr. Mann,^ in 1907 recog-
nized janischii as distinct and put glabratus as a synonym
under A. splendens, but all available figures of the latter which
he cited seem to be distinct from the other two names. Diame-

' The splitting of this frustule gives us an opportunity to state that the two valves
are identical and there was no trace of an internal accessory plate.
