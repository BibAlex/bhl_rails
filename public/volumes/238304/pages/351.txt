Use of the Library and Collections
BY Investigators and Students
Use of the Academy library and collections by students and
investigators continues to be one of the ways in which the
Academy is doing real service to the general public as well as
to specialists. The library is growing more and more valuable
every year. During the past year many important reference
works have been added and a number of popular books on
travel and the various sciences have been acquired. On the
library reading tables are kept many of the current publica-
tions of learned societies throughout the world, also many of
the scientific journals and outing magazines. Members of
the Academy are invited to visit the library and make use of
the facilities which it affords for information and aid in other
ways.
