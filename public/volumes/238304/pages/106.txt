Vol. XV] HANNA & GRANT— MIOCENE MARINE DIATOMS I43
The species occurs frequently in the Maria Madre Island
deposit ; all other members of the genus known to us are much
longer in zonal view than this one.
Mangin^** has stated that the various forms of Dicladia are
only sfatospores of diatoms, normally belonging to other gen-
era. In a fossil deposit, however, the determination of the
parent species becomes problematical and it seems best, for the
present at least, to record the Dichdia as distinct.

Several specimens of this elegant diatom were found in
the Maria Madre Island deposit. They are very similar in
every way to what Cleve and Schmidt have called "form
typica." Cleve placed nine species in the genus Dictyoneis and
under marginata he placed seven named subspecies ; the species
must therefore be very variable although our specimens do not
indicate this. For typica he gives the following widely separ-
ated localities: Mediterranean Sea; Levant; Delaware (type
locality) ; Florida ; West Indies ; Colon ; Gulf of Mexico ; Java ;
all living; and fossil at Szakal, Hungary. Other named forms
were listed from the fossil deposits of New Zealand and Japan,
but this is apparently the first record of any member of the
genus from the eastern Pacific. Although the general dismem-
berment of the genus Navicula as proposed by Cleve is not
acceptable to most diatomists, Dictyoneis is so different from
the usual fomi that the retention of that name seems to be
justified. Length of specimen figured (No. 1929, C.A.S. coll.)
