In general, there are some slight geographic tendencies to
variation in this species, but they are so poorly defined as
hardly to merit taxonomic recognition. For instance, in the
valleys south of the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mts.,
occur plants with the largest flowers, 13-15 mm. long, and with
the largest, thickest capsules, 8-9 mm. long. To the north and
especially to the south of this general region, the flowers are
smaller, 8-10-12 mm. long, and the capsules slightly more
slender and 7-8 mm. long. And, from the Cuyamaca Alts,
south and west, there is a definite tendency for bluish flowers,
while, to the north of the Cuyamacas and Fallbrook and
Del Mar, the flowers are mostly whitish. In the material cited
above, such collections as Johnston's at Lakeview, Mun:: 9^35>
9844, 961'/' are quite intermediate. The most of the si)ecimens
cited above from Fallbrook, Escondido, Soledad, San Diego,
Alpine, Tecate, Potrero, etc., are quite blue-flowered and may
be referred to A. coulterianum forma orciittianum* (Gray) n.
comb. To my way of thinking orcuttianmn cannot deserve
more than such rank ; I have spent much time trying to w-ork
out characters that would enable me to maintain orcuttiannni
as a concept of higher rank. Flower-size as used by Gray is of
small consequence, Munz & Hilend 802^, for example, having
blue but much larger flowers than do many of the white-
flowered plants. The relative lengths of upper and lower lips
vary widely. Nor do the seed-characters used by Gray help.
At the time that Gray died there was at the Gray Herbarium
only one sheet of the large and white-flowered plants that had
seeds of any maturity (Parry & Lemnion 28p) ; this particular
specimen has the seeds less deeply pitted than usual. The bulk
of the large white flowered more northern plants have see<^ls
quite indistinguishable from the blue-flowered more southern
ones. The Ncvin specimen from Capistrano, for which Gray
