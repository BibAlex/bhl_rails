Plate 36, figures 12, 13, 14
Shell smaller than P. pygmccum, with a flat spire and three
and a half whorls ; the nucleus is transparent, the rest snow
white; sculpture of more prominent and less close-set axial
ribs; suture moderately deep; whorls and aperture rounded,
the peritreme thin, not expanded ; the umbilicus wide, shallow,
showing a large part of the three whorls. Diameter of shell,
1 mm.
Type: No. 2205, Mus. Calif. Acad Sci. ; collected on Maria
Madre Island, near the village on the east side, by the Acad-

The differences between this and the typical P. pygmceiim
seem too great for mere varietal rank.
