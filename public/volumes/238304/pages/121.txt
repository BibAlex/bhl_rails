Plagiogramma tesselatum Greville, Quart. Journ. Mic. Sci., Vol. 7, 1859,
p. 208, pi. 10, fig. 7.— WoLLE, Diat. N. Am. 1894, pi. 45, figs. 18,

Except for the slight constriction medially (and this is not
constant), the fossils referred to this species are typical tes-
selatum as figured by Schmidt (fig. 48). It is the most com-
mon form of the genus in the deposit on Maria Madre Island
and, from the published records, seems to be almost wholly
confined to the east coast of North America, and especially
the Caribbean region. Dr. Mann,*^ however, lists it from the
Galapagos Islands, although he stated that the central area was
round in the specimens instead of rectangular as usual. In our
specimens the area is rectangular as are, likewise, the coarse
beads. Length of specimen figured (No. 1973, C.A.S. coll.)
.1160 mm. ; width .0180 mm.
86. Pleurosigma manni Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 19, figure 11 ; plate 20, figure 1
Valve narrowly lanceolate, not siginoid, very thin and deli-
cate ; raphe almost straight ; rows of beads in two series set at
about 120° to each other; dots heavy, easily seen with an eight
millimeter apochromatic objective and 15x ocular. Length
.2272 mm. ; width .0454.
Type: No. 1974, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene.
A few other straight diatoms belonging to Pleurosigma are
known, but apparently none combines the characters of this
one. Although fragments are very abundant in the Maria
Madre Island deposit, this diatom is so excessively delicate
that it is almost impossible to secure perfect examples. Some
have even been deformed by pressure in the bedded material.
The species is named for the distinguished diatomist. Dr.
Albert Mann of Washington, D. C.
