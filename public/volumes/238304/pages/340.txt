REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE ACADEMY
FOR THE YEAR 1926
BY
C. E. GRUNSKY
President of the Academy
The hope entertained by the officers of the Academy that
from some source or other funds would be contributed during
the year for needed extensive additions to our building- in
Golden Gate Park, has not been realized. The Academy is
still waiting for some one of means to duplicate what was
done in its earlier history by James Lick and establish an en-
dowment not only to provide housing for research work and
for exhibits but also to permit of a broadening of the scope of
the research work which, within the means provided, is being
so well done in the sex'-eral departments of the Academy under
the direction of able and hardworking curators and their
assistants.
It is with pride that the Academy may point to its record
and there is every reason to believe that it will never lose the
high rank to which the achievements of its scientific stafif
have raised it.
The Academy does not depend upon income from member-
ship dues for revenue with which to carry on its activities and
no attempt is therefore made to extend materially the list of
