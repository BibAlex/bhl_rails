Matancita Wood Rat
The collection contains a male and female of this wood rat
taken at Magdalena Bay on May 30.

Two of these wood rats were taken in traps set close to the
spring near the top of Cedros Island, June 4.
10. Neotoma martinensis Goldman.
San Martin Island Wood Rat
The rubbish heap of an American Barn Owl contained an
almost complete skull of tlie endemic wood rat of San Martin
Island. From the number of mandibles and other bones at-
tributable to this species contained in the mass, it would appear
that wood rats are fairly common on the island.

The trapping on Maria Madre resulted in the addition of a
Black Rat to the collection.
12. Ammospermophilus leucurus peninsulae (Allen).
