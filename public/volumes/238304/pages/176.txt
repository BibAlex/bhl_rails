Vol. XV] JORDANâ€” MOLLUSCAN FAUNA 251
little shell is not identical with any of the figured MarginellidcB
from western America, and apparently cannot be identified
with any of the species recently described, without illustra-
tion, by Dall. The evenly egg-shaped form, the low but un-
covered spire, and the presence of five plaits on the inner lip
are distinguishing characters.
The species is named in honor of Mrs. Ida S. Oldroyd, to
to whom the writer is much indebted.
4. Melanella loleta E. K. Jordan, new species
Plate XXV, figure 6
Shell small, rather broadly conic, smooth, brilliantly pol-
ished ; spire of about eight, slightly inflated and rounded post-
nuclear whorls that enlarge rapidly anteriorly ; sutures slightly
impressed; periphery of last whorl moderately inflated,
smoothly rounded ; base very short, rounded ; aperture broadly
ovate; outer lip thick but sharp-edged, shallowly sinuate close
to junction with preceding whorl, slightly protracted just an-
terior to periphery, and again slightly retracted at junction
with basal lip; junction of basal and inner lips slightly pro-
tracted ; inner lip short, nearly straight, strongly reflected and
appressed to the base posteriorly ; parietal wall covered by a
rather thin callus. Length, 3.69 mm.; width, 1.77 mm.
Type: No. 1849, paratypcs Nos. 1850 and 1851, Mus. Calif.
Acad. Sci., from Loc. 910 (C.A.S. coll.), San Quintin Bay,
Lower California, Pleistocene ; G. D. Hanna, collector.
Another specimen was also examined from the same locality.
The more broadly conic form, slightly inflated whorls, and
shorter base of this species distinguish it from other west
American Melanellas. In outline it recalls certain species of
Sabinella Monterosato, but the inner lip is not of the character
common to the latter genus.
