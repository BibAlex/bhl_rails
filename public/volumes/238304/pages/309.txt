more or less profoundly, radially plicate ; surface sculptured by
concentric growth lines, and by very fine, wavy, minutely
prickly, radial striations. Right valve slightly arched; byssal
foramen closed or nearly so, but leaving an elongate oblique
semi-triangular pit near the beak, which almost communicates
with the interior; auricular crura very strong, diverging from
the beak at an acute angle varying somewhat in different speci-
mens. Left valve flat or concave, never convex as is the right;
without byssal foramen, but usually broken slightly at the
beak ; interiorly with two strong ribs radiating from the umbo,
but fitting outside of the auricular crura, and hence diverging
at a somewhat greater angle. Length 114 mm.; width 95
mm.; thickness 15 mm.
Type: No. 2110, paratypes, Nos. 2111, 2112, 2113, 2114, and
2115, Alus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Loc. 945 (C.A.S. coll.),
southeast of Turtle Bay, Lower California; upper Pliocene.
Fourteen other specimens of this species were examined
from the same locality, and one was found at Loc. 928 (C.A.S.
Coll.), Bernstein's abalone camp, Cedros Island, Lower Cali-
fornia ; upper Pliocene.
Placunanomia hannibali is related to P. californica Ar-
nold, from the Etchegoin lower Pliocene of central California,
but is distinguished by having a generally flatter and more
regular shell with very fine rather than heavy radial sculpture.
P. cuniuigii Broderip. from the recent fauna of western Mexi-
co and the upper Pliocene of Maria Madre Island is very
strongly radially plicate, and lacks all radial sculpture. P. han-
nibali is most nearly related to P. lithohleta Dall, of the Mio-
cene of the Caribbean region, but seems to attain a larger size
than that species, and to be fitted with larger and heavier
auricular crura.
This species is named in honor of Mr. Harold Hannibal, in
recognition of his work on the paleontology and stratigraphy
of western North America.
