In three examples the throat feathers exhibit distinct dark
shaft hnes, and one has the under tail-coverts largely white.
The axillaries of one female have no trace of dark color.
Moult is in progress. One of the birds seems to have re-
cently undergone a complete feather renewal, some of the
greater coverts and scapulars alone showing wear. A few pin
feathers are present on the throat. Two others in slightly worn
plumage have new feathers appearing on the cervix, back, and
breast. Two birds have the plumage much abraded, and a
general renewal of the contour feathers is is progress. The
remiges and rectrices are in fair condition ; the secondaries
appear to have been recently replaced. Of the downy young,
one is in the protoptyle state and the other has the mesoptyles
developed on the back.
10. Puffinus cuneatus Salvin. Wedge-tailed Shearwater
Thousands of Wedge-tailed Shearwaters were nesting on
the Ash Heap on San Benedicto Island, and six unsexed speci-
mens were obtained (May 12).
The specimens are all of the dark phase. The plumage is
fresh, only the scapulars exhibiting signs of wear.
The average length of culmen in five specimens is 39.32
mm. ; the maximum. 40.10; the minimum. 37.''
11. Oceanodroma leucorhoa kaedingi Anthony.
Kaeding's Petrel
In following the nomenclature of the A. O. U. Check-List
(3rd ed.) and Supplements,^ the name kaedingi has been used
for the petrel which came on board the Ortolan at sea south
of Guadalupe Island on April 23. The nppQV tail-coverts are
extensively white, not interrupted medially by darker. The
measurements are as follows: wing. 152 mm.; tail. 82.75;
fork of tail, 20; culmen, 16; tarsus. 23.5 ; middle toe and claw.
24. Thus in regard to both color and measurements the speci-
men in hand differs from the typical kaedingi.
