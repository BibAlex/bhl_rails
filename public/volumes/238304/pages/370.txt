Vol. XV] EVERMANN— DIRECTOR'S REPORT FOR 1926 539
Steinhart Aquarium
It is a pleasure to report satisfactory conditions at the Aquarium during
the year 1926.
The two outstanding recommendations made by the Superintendent in
his report for 1925 — that a green-house be built on the roof in which
aquatic plants for use in the various balanced aquariums can be cultivated
and where small tropical fishes can be bred for experimental purposes, and
that additional tanks be supplied with warm salt water, — have been
granted. These now form distinct permanent improvements.
That the Aquarium is well regarded by the people of California is at-
tested, not only by the large attendance (953,797), but by the fact that
during 1926 gifts which total 4,826 in number have been received. These
range from starfish to sea lions, and include a number of alligators. A
complete list with the names of the donors will be found in our files.
In the fall of 1926 Dr. Barton Warren Evermann, Director of the
California Academy of Sciences and of the Aquarium, visited some of the
aquariums of the eastern United States and returned with many helpful
suggestions.
In the month of October Mr. Robert J. Lanier of the Aquarium staff
returned from New York where he spent his vacation, bringing with him
66 live specimens of eastern fishes, chiefly gifts from the New York
Aquarium. Mr. H. Walton Clark secured in the Mississippi Valley and
brought to the Aquarium 316 specimens of live fishes.
This is the first time that such fishes as the Red-winged Sea Robin, the
Queen Trigger-fish, the Pearl Roach, Darters and many others have ever
been seen in the far west. These are now swimming about in our tanks.
The total number of live specimens in the Aquarium tanks December 31,
1926, was 8,096, an increase of 976 during the year. These are divided
among the animal kingdom as follows:
Mammals 10 specimens of 4 species
Birds 1 " 1 "
Reptiles 114 " 25 "
Amphibians 53 " 9 "
Fishes 7570 " 252 "
Invertebrates 348 " 10 "
Total " 8096 specimens 301 species
The above is exclusive of 120,000 Grayling hatched during the year
and turned over to the California State Fish and Game Commission, and
of 2,000 Salmon and Trout eggs now in the hatchery. A list of all fishes
lost during the year will be found in our files.
We suggest the following improvements for the coming year:
That the court in front of the building containing the seal pools be paved
with cement and properly drained; that many more fishes from the south
be added, especially from the vicinity of the Santa Barbara Islands, and
that the Aquarium library be built up.
Alvin Seale, Superintendent.
