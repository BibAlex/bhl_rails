keeled and the longitudinal dorsal series of scales in 14 2/2
rows. This species was found to be very rare on Cerros Island.
On a previous expedition of the Academy a specimen was
caught in a mouse trap.
13. Verticaria hyperythra beldingi (Stejneger)
Twenty-one specimens (Nos. 59310-59330) were collected
on Magdalena Island, May 29-30, 1925. All these specimens
have the four supraocular plates and the large collar scales.
Eighteen are typical V. h. beldingi having the double dorsal
line, while only three (Nos. 59317, 59318, and 59323) have
the single dorsal line characteristic of V. h. schinidti.
14. Cnemidophorus bartolomas Dickerson
Two specimens (Nos. 59558-59559) were collected at San
Bartolome Bay, June 2, 1925. Neither of these specimens
agree with the description of the type^ in dorsal coloration,
showing none of the alternating of the spots in the dorsal rows.
Van Denburgh^ was doubtful as to the distinctness of this
species from C. rubidus. Of the two specimens before me the
dorsal coloration of No. 59558 resembles that of C. t. stejne-
geri, while that of No. 59559 resembles C. rubidus. The gular
region of the former shows less of the black markings cliarac-
teristic of C. t. stejnegeri, while the latter has the black throat
markings found in specimens of C. rubidus from Magdalena
Island. More material and further study may prove this
species to be an intergrade between C. rubidus and C. t.
stejnegeri.
15. Cnemidophorus multiscutatus (Cope)
Eight specimens were taken on Cerros Island, June 4-5,
1925. All show the black spotting on the lower surface of the
tail.
16. Cnemidophorus rubidus (Cope)
A single specimen (No. 59389) was taken on Magdalena
Island, May 30, 1925. It has the black throat markings of
specimens from this locality.
