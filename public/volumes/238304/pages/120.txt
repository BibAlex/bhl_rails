83. Plagiogramma hymenoptera Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 19, figure 8
Valve deeply constricted in the center, swollen on each side
of this constriction and again between this and the ends, thus
making three constrictions on each valve; central stauros broad
and square with a pyriform central nodule; surface covered
with rounded beads, sparsely but uniformly arranged in trans-
verse and longitudinal rows except at the ends where the beads
are still sparse but irregularly arranged ; a spatula-shaped pro-
jection at each end, in place of a spine or stauros. Length
.1009 mm. ; width .0162 mm.
Type: No. 1970, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene.
Schmidt** has figured some specimens from Macassar Strait
which resemble the present species in general form ; he referred
these questionably to P. constrictum Greville, a heavily-ribbed
species which they hardly resemble at all ; our si^ecimens have
a larger stauros than those of Schmidt, whicli also lack the
spatula-shaped terminal stauros.
84. Plagiogramma insolito Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 19, figure 9
Valve small, broad, sides straight, ends pointed ; central area
oval, terminal areas pointed; no internal septae; beads roundly
rectangular, in horizontal and longitudinal rows; terminal
areas marked with fine radial striations. Length of type
.0675 mm. ; width .020 mm.
Type: No. 1971, paratype No. 1972, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci.,
from Arroyo Hondo, Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias
Group), Mexico; collected by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925;
Miocene.
This heavily-marked species appears to have no close rela-
tive except P. tesselatum, a comparison with which shows the
distinction at once.
