though none is exactly typical of that species. The writers are
convinced that the right valve figured by Hertlein as P. pur-
puratus from Turtle Bay is /'. hakci Hertlein (Vol. 14, No.
1, PI. 4, fig. 2).
A suborbicular disk, moderately small anterior ear on the
right valve, ornamented with three or four radiating ribs, and
numerous closely spaced flat-topped or T-rail shaped ribs
which are laterally fringed with lamellae, are characteristic
features of P. purpuratus.
P. purpuratus is now living from Coquimbo, Chile, north-
ward to Ecuador, and is also known from the Pliocene and
Pleistocene of Coquimbo.

Pecten (Plagioctenium) subdolus Hertlein, Proc. Calif. Acad. Sci., 4th
Ser., Vol. 14, No. 1, p. 20, pi. 5, figs. 2, 4, 7; Pliocene, Pacific Beach near
San Diego, Calif.
Pecten subdolus is distinguished by having usually a rather
thin shell, with somewhat low rounded ribs, and rounded in-
terspaces ; both the ribs and interspaces in perfect specimens
are usually ornamented by fine radial striae. These characteris-
tics easily distinguish the species from P. callidus Hertlein.
The specimen figured for P. cerrosensis by Arnold*^ but
later referred to P. subdolus by Hertlein, can not be identified
with this species and is not P. cerrosensis Gabb; it is apparent-
ly a variant of P. hakei Hertlein.
P. subdolus was found on Cedros Island, and near Turtle
Bay. It is abundant in the San Diego upper Pliocene of Pa-
cific Beach, Calif.
