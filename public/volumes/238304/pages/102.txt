35. Coscinodiscus evermanni Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 15, figure 3
Valve circular, large and heavy; central area depressed
below a huge rounded marginal zone the diagrammatic cross
section being as shown in figure 1 ; there is no suture between
Fig. 1. Diagrammatic cross section of Coscinodiscus evermanni, n. sp.
central and marginal areas as in Craspedodisciis and no break
in the arrangement of the markings as in Creszvellia; coarse
markings arranged essentially as in C. radiatus, these being
a group of slightly larger beads in the center but no central
pore ; each bead on the marginal zone has a circle of fine punc-
tag or secondary markings as in C. aster omphalns and many
other species, but no such structures could be found on the
beads of the central area with a 4 mm. (N. A. .95) objective;
the hoop connecting the valves is marked with beads of uni-
form size set in diagonal rows, at 90°. Diameter of type
.1556 mm.; width of central area about .10 mm.; diameter of
largest paratype .1564 mm.; diameter of smallest paratype
.1176 mm.
Type: No. 1914, paratypcs Nos. 1915, 1916, Mus. Calif. Acad.
Sci., from Arroyo Hondo, Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias
Group), Mexico; collected by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925;
Miocene.
This robust species is very common in the deposit on Maria
Madre Island but perfect specimens are hard to find ; the large
size causes most of the valves to be broken, either in the bed-
ding or in the cleaning processes. Hoops are abundant but
almost always detached from the valves. The species is a con-
necting link between Coscinodiscus and Craspedodisciis and is
much like Craspedodiscus coscinodiscus Ehrenberg^" but the
central zone in that form is much narrower. We have in-
cluded it in Coscinodiscus because of the lack of a definite
