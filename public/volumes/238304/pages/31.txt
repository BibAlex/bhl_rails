[Proc. 4th Ser.

in calmer weather than we saw. Between North and South
Rocks, a distance of about 150 yards, there is a reef, just

Its top is jagged and has two lava pinnacles. South of it
but close by there is a rock just awash.
The three main rocks form an approximately equilateral
triangle with shallow water enclosed between. Shoals also
extend about 100 feet to the south of East Rock.
In this shallow water we succeeded in placing six shots of
