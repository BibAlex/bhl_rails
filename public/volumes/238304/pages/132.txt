EXPEDITION TO THE REVILLAGIGEDO ISLANDS,
MEXICO, IN 1925, III
NOTES ON A COLLECTION OF REPTILES AND
AMPHIBIANS FROM THE TRES MARIAS AND
REVILLAGIGEDO ISLANDS, AND WEST
COAST OF MEXICO, WITH DESCRIP-
TION OF A NEW SPECIES
OF TANTILLA
BY
JOSEPH R. SLEVIN
Assistant Curator, Department of Herpetology
The following notes are based on a collection of reptiles
and amphibians made on the Academy's expedition to the
Tres Marias and Revillagigedo islands, in the spring of 1925,
on board the United States Ship Ortolan, Lieutenant M. M.
Nelson, U. S. Navy, commanding.
The expedition besides making investigations among the
Tres Marias and Revillagigedo islands, also made stops along
the west coast of Lower California, and some of the adjacent
islands.
As larger series of specimens from these regions than have
heretofore been available for study were gathered, and as a
new species and new records were obtained, it was thought
advisable to publish the following notes in hopes that they
may be of use to future students who may be interested in the
herpetology of western Mexico.
