This species more closely resembles Triphora panamensis
(Bartsch) than any other from this coast, but it is a strikingly
marked species, differing from panamensis in the number of
nuclear whorls, in the distinctness and greater width of the
spiral channels and sutures, in the very definite variegation of
the spiral keels and channels, in the occurrence of the inter-
calated keels on the last turn, and in the extension of the peri-
pheral keelsi into the preceding sutures.
The species is named for Dr. G. Dallas Hanna, Curator of
Paleontology of the California Academy of Sciences.

Plate 24, figure 9
Shell sinistral, small, elongate-conic above, tending to be-
come spindle-shaped ; nuclear whorls light brown, postnuclear
whorls dull yellowish white; nuclear whorls four, increasing
rapidly, the first eroded, the second rounded, nearly smooth,
the others with two closely spaced spiral cords, the posterior
near the middle of the whorl, the other close to the suture,
crossed by many discrete, rather sharp, slightly retractive
axial threads, of which there are about 26 on the last whorl,
producing indistinct tubercles at the points of intersection and
enclosing shallow, squarish depressions; transition to post-
nuclear whorls rather abrupt, the two nuclear spiral cords
forming the anterior keel and a posterior keel beginning almost
at once near the preceding suture; postnuclear whorls eight
and a quarter, the first four with two moderately sharp spiral
keels, the anterior the larger, rather widely spaced, crossed
by strong, but narrow, axial ribs, producing small, prominent
tubercles at their intersections, which are quite generally sub-
cuspidate, especially on the anterior keel, which is subtruncate
posteriorly, and enclosing proportionately large, irregular pits
which tend to become squarish on the lower whorls ; beginning
rather abruptly on the fifth postnuclear whorl a median keel
separates from the anterior keel, soon taking a median posi-
tion which it maintains to the aperture, becoming nearly equal
to the other two keels in about two turns, all the keels from
that point, with slight variations, continuing nearly equal;
axial ribs slightly protractive, varying little in number from
