The considerable inflation of the valves, and the rounded
ribs separated by fairly wide interspaces distinguish this
species. It occurs on Cedros Island, at Turtle Bay, and near
Elephant Mesa, and has previously been found living from
Monterey, Calif., to Payta, Peru, in the Pleistocene of southern
and Lower California, the San Diego Pliocene at Pacific
Beach, near San Diego, California, and has been reported in
the Saugus, upper Pliocene formation in southern California.

4th Ser., Vol. 14, 1925, p. 19, pi. 3, figs. 1, 2, 5; Pliocene, Turtle Bay.
P. cristobalensis is easily recognized by its numerous, high,
rather narrow, square ribs, separated by deep, square inter-
spaces, and by the presence of unusually strong, sharp concen-
tric lamellae ornamenting the bottoms of the interspaces and
the sides of the ribs. This species has been found on Cedros
Island, at Turtle Bay, and near Elephant Mesa.
