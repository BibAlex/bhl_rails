of which show a fairly well defined medial sulcus ; interspaces
as wide as ribs ; both ribs and interspaces finely longitudinally
striate, and crossed by concentric lines of growth ; ears much
as those of right valve, and similarly ornamented, except that
the anterior ear of the left, carries six or seven radiating rib-
lets between which are intercalated minute raised lines. Length
50 mm.; height 48 mm.; diameter approximately 15 mm.;
length of hinge line approximately 40 mm. ; apical angle 103Â°.
Type: No. 2101, paratypes Nos. 2102, 2103, 2104, 2105, and
2106, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Loc. 945, Southeast of Tur-
tle Bay, Lower California; upper Pliocene; G. D. Hanna and
E. K. Jordan, collectors.
30 other specimens were examined from the same locality.
The large size, the flattish right valve, the flat-topped ribs of
the right valve and the striations of the ribs of both valves
characterize this large Leptopecten. Some specimens attain a
length of about 70 mm., and a height of about 60 mm., or
more.

Pecten calli is especially abundant in the Pliocene of Turtle
Bay, and after examination of a large series of specimens,
certain characteristics of the species are better known than
previously.
The type specimen of the si^ecies is a left valve. The writers
are now convinced that the Miocerje sliell figured by Hertlein"
as a paratype of P. calli, and from wliich a description of the
right valve was drawn, does not belong to this species. A
right valve, undoubtedly of P. calli. is figured in this paper.
Right valves of this species vary considerably in convexity;
usually they are moderately convex, and markedly so at the
umbo. The hinge line is about two-thirds as long as the shell.
They bear 18-21 ribs, which are rather high and prominent,
