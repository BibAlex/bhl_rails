suture between central and marginal zones which is typically
developed in Craspcdodiscus. The edge of the valve is turned
down at right angles to the disk as in Endyctia; thus a com-
plex of characters is displayed which makes a correct generic
assignment almost impossible.
The type slide contains three fairly complete specimens,
which show approximately the variation in size.
The species is named for Dr. Barton Warren Evermann,
Director of the California Academy of Sciences, who was
responsible for the organization and despatch of the expedition
of 1925 to West Mexican Islands.

"Cuxhaven."
This species, according to Schmidt's figures, has the bead-
ing arranged in radial rows and also there is produced a
"watch ca.se milled" effect similar to C radiatus; in addition,
there are some radial "pyrotechnical" markings as in Actino-
cyclus pyrotechnicns, thus making an exceedingly beautiful
diatom. The species appears to be rare in the Maria Madre
Island deposit. Diameter of specimen figured. No. 1917
(C.A.S. coll.), .0687 mm.

Plate 15, figure 5
Coscinodiscus concavus Ehrenberg, Schmidt, Atlas Diat., pi. 59, 1877,
fig. 16; "Monterey," California; probably from a Miocene fossil
deposit. This figure, Dr. Mann stated, does not belong to C. con-
cavus of Ehrenberg (Cont. U. S. Nat. Herb., Vol. 10, No. 5, 1907,
p. 248).
Valve flat, coar.sely marked with a network of hexagons,
the size of these decreasing slightly at the margin; the disk is
roughly divided into sectors by a few almost straight radial
rows, the remaining rows in the sector being approximately
parallel to the central radial; this makes a secondary series of
rows of beads in parallel arcs which cut the margin of the
