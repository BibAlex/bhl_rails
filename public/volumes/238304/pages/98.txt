Vol. XV] HANNA & GRANT— MIOCENE MARINE DIATOMS J33
minutely beaded on top; border zone of each side with several
dense, siliceous bars, irregular in shape, projecting inwardly;
surface of valve sparsely covered with round, heavy beads;
from the center of each side, a rounded elevated ridge projects
inwardly, all three meeting in the center. Length of each side
.140 mm.
Type: No. 1904, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene.
This large and handsome species is related to few others that
we can find. Biddiilphia tahellaria (Brightwell) and the sub-
species diplosticta Grunow^^ are similarly constructed but differ
greatly in details, particularly in the fine beading found on the
surface of the valve and the lack of the three radiating ridges
mentioned above at the end of the description. The two fos-
sils, B. dobreana novcB-seelandicB (Grove & Sturt) and B.
majus (G. & S.^^) from the deposit at Oamaru, New Zealand,
are likewise similar in general construction but differ even
more in detail.
The species is named for Messrs. Charles and Frank Riedy
of San Francisco, in recognition of their long continued inter-
est in microscopy and the former San Francisco Microscopical
Society.

Zygoccros tuomeyii Bailey, Amer. Jour. Sci. Arts, Vol. 46, 1843, p. 138,
pi. 3, figs. 3-9.
Biddulphia tuomeyii (Bailey) Ralfs in Pritchard, Hist. Infus. 4th ed.
1861, p. 848, pi. 6, fig. 10.— Schmidt, Atlas Diat., pi. 118, figs. 1-7;
pi. 119, figs. 1-7, 15-17, 1888.
If all of the various forms figured by Schmidt as B. tuomeyii
are that species, then our Maria Madre Island ones are also,
unquestionably. And since ours resemble those he gives from
eastern north America, the type locality, more than any others,
it is very likely that our identification is correct even though
the assemblage be broken up into several species, ultimately.
