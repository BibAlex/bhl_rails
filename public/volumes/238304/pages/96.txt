Hondo, Maria Madre Island. These agree fairly well with
this species, originally described from the Miocene of Califor-
nia. The presence of the large spines at the corners makes it
necessary to place it in the genus Biddulphia. In Grunow's
original figure the cells are larger than in our specimens and
the sides are a very little straighten Each cell or bead is sur-
rounded by a row of minute dots as Grunow showed. The
specimen figured, No. 1899 (C. A. S. Coll.) is .1236 mm. long
on each side.
24. Biddulphia deodora Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 14, figures 1, 2
Valve quadrangular, sides concave, corners acutely rounded ;
border narrow and marked by numerous short spines; spin-
ous corner processes marked with about six coarse dots ; sur-
face with numerous large square beads arranged in radial
rows ; a central circular area having a much fewer number.
Length of each side of type .0340 mm.
Type: No. 1900, paratype No. 1901, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci.,
from Arroyo Hondo, Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias
Group), Mexico; collected by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925;
Miocene.
The above is a description of the type specimen. A para-
type containing five points and smaller marginal spines has
been selected because the two appear to be the same species.
These come closest to a small pentagonal form figured by
Schmidt^* as Triceratium antillarum Cleve, but we do not
find the definitely bounded circular space indicated for it.
25. Biddulphia jordani Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 14, figure 3
Valve very small, triangular, margins almost straight, angles
bluntly rounded; border zone very heavy as in B. montereyi
(Brightwell)^"; surface with sparse, very heavy beads, irregu-
larly arranged except over the border zone where there are
rows of three, each pointing toward center of valve : corners
