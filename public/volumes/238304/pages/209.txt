70. Icterus spurius (Linnaeus). Orchard Oriole
At Cedros Island, June 3, there was taken a female Orchard
Oriole in much worn plumage. A few new feathers are ap-
pearing on the throat and breast.
71. Icterus graysonii Cassin. Grayson's Oriole
Arroyo Hondo, on Maria Madre, and the water hole on
r^Iaria Magdalena were the gathering points for these orioles
at the time of the visit of the Ortolan. The birds were abun-
dant at those places, and they also occurred about the set-
tlement.
With one exception, the four males and one female collected
exhibit more or less wear of plumage. One male is in fairly
good feather, and has a central rectrix not fully developed.
72. Carpodacus cassini Baird. Cassin's Pur})le Finch
Mr. Tose took one Cassin's Purple Fincli in a garden in the
settlement on Maria Madre (May 16).
The bird is a male with the feathers of the cervix, back, and
breast much worn. Fresh feathers and pin feathers are present
on the throat.
