New Geographic Names
During the progress of the expedition it was found that
some physiographic features of considerable importance were
without names. Some of these mil be referred to on later
pages of this report and others will appear in the technical
reports. In order that the new names which we proposed to
bestow might receive official sanction before their adoption by
us, Mr. C. E. Giamsky, President of the Academy, addressed
the following letter to the Ambassador of Mexico at
Washington.
' A full list of the charts published by the Hydrographic Office of Western
Mexico and Central America may be found in the publication "H. O. No. 84 Mexico
and Central America Pilot (West Coast)" sixth edition, Washington, Government
Printing Office, 1920, and the supplement to the same published in 1923.
