28. Gastrocopta pellucida hordeacella Pilsbry
Pupa hordeacella Pilsbry, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila. for 1890, p. 44,
pi. 1, figs. G, H, I, J, K, Arizona and Florida.
Collected by the Academy expedition on the island of So-
corro, from the low lands at Braithwaite Bay, Grayson's Cove,
and at elevations of 2,000 and 2,800 feet on the slope of
Mount Evermann. Also on Clarion Island from Sulphur Bay,
near the sea level and at elevations of 500 and 1,040 feet
above the sea.
The distribution of this species and the variety is extremely
widespread, as indicated by Martens. It has been reported
from the Gulf States, Mexico, Guatemala, Panama, Ecuador,
and most of the Antilles.
Genus Vitrea Fitzinger, 1833
29. Vitrea indentata Say
Helix indentata Say, Journ. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., vol. 2, p. 372, 1822 —
Gould, Invert. Mass., p. 181, fig. 109.
Hyalinia (Glyphyalinia) indentata (Say) Martens, Biol. Centr. Am., p.
117, 1892.
Collected by the Academy expedition near the village on the
east side of Maria Madre and at another unspecified locality
on that island ; also on Maria Magdalena. rather abundantly.
I have not been able to examine V. paucilirata Morelet, but
from the figures and descriptions it would seem doubtfully
distinct from the present species.
At first sight the fresh individuals from the Tres Marias
impressed one as having the indented radial lines less numer-
ous and more deeply cut than in the northern Uidentata, but
on careful study of specimens of the same size no valuable
differences could be observed. The island specimens on the
whole seem larger on the average than those from the United
States, but not extremely so. The very wide range of this
species is well known. It is recorded from Canada to Texas
and from the boundary to southward from the Federal Dis-
trict of Mexico.
