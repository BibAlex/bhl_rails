Vol. XV] HANNAâ€”REVILLAGIGEDO ISLANDS EXPEDITION 93
Contreras, Gallegos and Solis came on to San Francisco with
the ship and spent several days visiting points of interest
thereabout.
Little did we think that when we said goodbye upon their
departure it would be our last opportunity to see our most con-
genial companion of two expeditions, Professor Jose M.
Gallegos. He returned to San Diego for a brief period, then
went to Mexico City to prepare for aiding in the eradication
of the grasshopper plague of certain sections of his country.
Investigations were necessary in Guatemala and while on his
way there he was stricken with fever in Beliz, British Hon-
duras, where he died on September 24, 1925. Words cannot
express the sorrow felt by all of his Academy friends upon the
receipt of this sad news.*
* On March 10, 1926, after the foregoing pages were in final proof, another
member of the expedition was taken from us. In an automobile accident near Gilroy,
California, Mr. Eric Knight Jordan received injuries which resulted fatally a few
hours later. Mr. Jordan and an assistant, Mr. Leo G. Hertlein, had just started upon
a field trip for paleoutological work in southern California, when the accident
occurred.
On October 1, 1924, Mr. Jordan, at the age of 20, became connected with the
California Academy of Sciences as a scientific assistant in the Department of Paleon-
tology, and on April 1, 1925, he was appointed Assistant Curator of that department,
which position he held at the time of his death.
Eric Jordan was a young man of unusual promise and, had he lived, would un-
doubtedly have attained eminence in paleontological science. In his death science
and the California Academy of Sciences have suffered irreparable loss.
