95. Stephanogonia pretiosa Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 20, figure 10
Valve circular, pyramidal with 1 1 slightly unequal and un-
marked facets ; top truncate and this portion with a very few
irregularly scattered dots of minute size; the flat angular faces
bordering the central area are separated by heavy bars of
silica. Diameter .0214 mm.
Type: No. 1982, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene.
Van Heurck'"'- stated that the genus Stephanogonia com-
prised a very few species, all fossil. We have examined figures
of apparently all that have been described but find nothing
very closely approaching the form here treated. It is possibly
closest to S. octinoptychiis Ehrenberg as figured by Van
Heurck,^^ but that species is ovate in shape and heavily spinose
around the margin ; moreover it is punctate throughout the
valval area.

A very few specimens which seem to be referable to the
above species were found in the fossil material from Alaria
Madre Island. The one figured, No. 1983 (C.A.S. coll), is
.0565 mm. in diameter.
