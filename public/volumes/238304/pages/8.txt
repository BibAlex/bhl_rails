EXPEDITION TO THE REVILLAGIGEDO ISLANDS,
MEXICO, IN 1925
GENERAL REPORT

Curator, Department of Paleontology
Introduction
Early in January, 1925, at a conference of the Director and
curators of the various departments of the Academy, it was
decided that suitable and desirable field work for the ensuing
season could be done on the Revillagigedo Islands, Mexico, if
arrangements could be made to go there with a reasonable
degree of economy. ^ A tentative plan of organization was
drawn up which met the approval of all concerned and steps
were taken to secure a suitable means of transportation.
The Revillagigedo Islands lie about 840 miles a little east of
south from San Diego, California, and 240 miles a little west
of south from Cape San Lucas, Lower California. They are
several degrees south of the Tropic of Cancer ; they extend in
an east west line about 250 miles and close to the nineteenth
parallel of north latitude. The group consists of four islands
in order of size as follows : Socorro (with the small detached
Oneal Rock) ; Clarion; San Benedicto; and Roca Partida.
