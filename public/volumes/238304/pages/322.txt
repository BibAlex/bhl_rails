Collected by the Academy expedition on Socorro Island at
an altitude of 2,000 feet, where the species appears to be
abundant.
A careful comparison of British specimens of P. pygmceuin
with specimens of P. niinutissumim from Lea's collection
leads to the conclusion that Binney was justified in uniting the
two, as the differences seem within the limits of specific vari-
ation. With those which seem comparable with P. pygmcriim,
from the Academy collection, are several forms which under
high magnification appear distinct, if not extreme variations,
which value it seems prudent to allow them at present.
Form A. (var. rotiindum.) — Similar to the tyi)e in sculp-
ture and with a small subcylindric umbilicus, but with three
rounder whorls, more elevated spire, and larger than typical
pygnKruni with the same number of whorls.
Type: No. 2203, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci. ; collected on Maria
Magdalena Island, Tres Marias.
Form B. (var. alheolum.) — Larger than typical pyguKcuin,
shiny white, the sculptiire subobsolete, the spire less elevated,
the end of the last whorl nearly on a level with the antecedent
whorl (while in pygmccimi it is depressed), the umbilicus
wider and more funnel-shaped. Whorls three and a half, the
shell larger than typical pygmcciun of the same number of
whorls.
Type: No. 2204, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci.; collected on Maria
Magdalena Island; the species was also taken on Maria Madre
Island, near the village on the east side, and on Socorro
Island between 2,000 and 2,800 feet elevation on the slopes
