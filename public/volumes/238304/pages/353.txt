Entomology. — Edward P. Van Duzee, Curator of Ento-
mology, reports commendable progress in his department.
The most notable event of the year in connection with this
department was the acquisition of the Koebele Collection of
insects, estimated to contain about 100,000 specimens, result-
ing from the many years of very active field collecting by the
late Albert Koebele in California, Hawaii and elsewhere.
The Academy is deeply indebted to Mr. Walter M. Giffard
of Honolulu for his successful efforts in securing this valua-
ble collection. Mr. Giffard is a Life Member of the Academy
and is constantly alert to opportunities to enrich the Acad-
emy's collections.
