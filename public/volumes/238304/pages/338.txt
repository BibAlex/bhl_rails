Vol. XV] . GRINNELL—T\HE GNATCATCHERS 499
Measurements. — Average, minimum and maximum, in mil-
limeters : Polioptila melaiiura margaritae, 7 adult examples,
4 males and 3 marked female, from Santa Margarita Island
and Magdalena Bay: Wing, 467 (44.1-48.7); tail, 46.4
(45.5-48.0) ; exposed culmen, 9.1 (8.4-9.7). P. m. calif ornica,
20 examples, 10 of each sex, from Los Angeles County, Cali-
fornia: Wing, 46.2 (44.0-49.9); tail, 49.8 (46.0-53.4); ex-
posed culmen, 9.3 (8.8-10.1).
Range. — A section of the Lower Californian peninsula ex-
tending at least from Santa Margarita Island and closely ad-
jacent mainland, north to Rosarito and Santana, latitude about
29° (see Thayer and Bangs, 1907, p. 138). Santa Margarita
Island is very close to the mainland, indeed only 4 miles, with
islets serving as stepping stones between; so that there is no
reason to expect any effect of insularity upon its bird-life.
Remarks. — The range of the California Black-tailed Gnat-
catcher, Polioptila melanura calif ornica Brewster, in north-
western Lower California extends south from the United
States boundary over the lower Pacific slopes as far as the
vicinity of El Rosario, latitude 30°, as shown by specimens
actually in hand. There are other record stations for Black-
tailed Gnatcatchers in Lower California, for instance Cedros
Island ; but in absence of specimens their subspecific status re-
mains in doubt. The Plumbeous Black-tailed Gnatcatcher,
Polioptila melanura melanura Lawrence, extends its range into
the northeastern (Colorado Desert) section of Lower Cali-
fornia, south at least as far as San Felipe Bay, whence newly
collected specimens are at hand. (See accompanying map.)
The species and subspecies of the genus Polioptila as oc-
curring in Upper and Lower California may now, in ac-
cordance with the analysis given above, be listed as follows :
1. Polioptila caerulea amoenissimn Grinnell.
Western Blue-gray Gnatcatcher.
2. Polioptila caerulea obscura Ridgway.
Cape San Lucas Blue-gray Gnatcatcher.
3. Polioptila melanura melanura Lawrence.
Plumbeous Black-tailed Gnatcatcher.
