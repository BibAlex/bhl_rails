Genus Zonitoides Lehman, 1862
30. ? Zonitoides socorroensis Dall, new species
Plate 36, figures 9, 10, 11
Shell minute, polished, brownish, subtranslucent, with four
whorls, having much the aspect above of a small Z. arhoreus
Say, but with a relatively more widely coiled umbilicus; the
spire is low and in profile appears flattish ; the sculpture is
much the same as in Z. arhoreus, both showing under high
magnification microscopic pittings or obscure punctations over
the entire surface ; the other characters reproduce Z. arhoreus
in miniature; major diameter, 3.5; minor diameter, 3.0;
height, 1.2 mm.
Type: No. 2206, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci. ; collected on So-
corro Island on the slopes of Mount Evermann at the eleva-
tion of 2,000 to 2,800 feet above sea level, by the Academy
expedition.
This may not be a Zonitoides but seems nearest to that
genus in shell characters. There is some slight variation in
the convexity of different individuals.

31. Tornatellides mexicana Dall, new species
Plate 35, figure 6
Shell light brown with about six well-rounded whorls ;
suture conspicuous, surface smooth and shining with faint in-
cremental lines; base rounded, perforate; pillar with two
strong but not high plaits, the parietal lamina thin and sharp;

continuing obliquely up the spire; height, 3.5; diameter, 2.0
mm.
Type: No. 2207, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci.; collected by the
Academy expedition on Socorro Island on the north slope of
Mount Evermann, Socorro Island, at an elevation of 2,000 to
2,800 feet.
