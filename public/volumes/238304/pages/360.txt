the schools during the school year. Field Museum of Natural
History now has more than 1000 such cases or exhibits. New
ones are being added at frequent intervals. The endowment
was originally $250,000, but Mr. Harris and his family were
so impressed by the splendid results that they recently in-
creased their gift by $125,000.
I am informed that the Chicago school authorities regard
"The N. W. Harris Public School Extension of Field Museum
of Natural History" as the greatest and most effective single
agency in the education of the youth of Chicago.
The California Academy of Sciences is ready to put into
operation a similar agency here in San Francisco whenever
an endowment is provided. Is there not some public-spirited
man or woman in California who will seize this opportunity
to do a really great thing for the children of San Francisco
and California?
There are several ways in which friends of the Academy
can help it financially, a few of which may be mentioned :
1. Unconditional gift, the money to be used by
the Academy in any way the Trustees think proper.
2. Conditional gift, to be used for a specific pur-
pose specified by the donor.
3. As an Endozument, only the income from
which may be used and only for the purpose named
by the donor. Endowments may be established in
any one of several forms, as follows :
a. The endowment may be established at once,
the money invested, and the income used as it
becomes available.
b. The endowment may be provided in the
donor's will, and the normal income from the
amount paid to the Academy annually, the en-
dowment not to pass to the Academy until the
donor's death.
c. The donor to provide in his will for an endow-
ment the income from which will not be avail-
able for the Academy's use until after the estate
has been distributed.
