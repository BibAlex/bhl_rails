PENINSULA OF LOWER CALIFORNIA AND
ADJACENT ISLANDS
The reptiles and amphibians of this region have been studied
at length by Van Denburgh/ but inasmuch as there are now
new records to be added to the fauna, tlie following data are
given in order to bring the list of the known species to date,
and to complete the report on the herpetology of the
expedition.
\. Hyla regilla Baird & Girard
Fifty-two specimens (Nos. 59626-59677) were collected on
Cerros Island, June 3, 1925. This little tree-toad was found
to be abundant along a small stream at the southeast end of the
island.
2. Coleonyx variegatus (Baird)

in the bottom of a dry wash on Cerros Island, June 4. 1925.
3. Crotaphytus wislizenii Baird & Girard
One specimen was taken on Cerros Island, June 4, 1925.

Academy to Cerros Island but was found to be very rare.
4. Callisaurus crinitus Cope
One hundred and sixty-one specimens (Nos. 59396-59556)
were collected at Turtle Bay, June 1, 1925. This lizard was
found to be very abundant along the sand beaches at the

the swarms of kelp flies about the dead seaweed.
