HANNA & GRANTâ€” MIOCENE MARINE DIATOMS
135
Individuals of this huge, coarsely-marked species were
rarely found in the Maria Madre Island deposit ; they seem to
require no close comparison with other forms for recognition.
31. Cocconeis contrerasi Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 14, figure 10
Valve broadly oval with raphe greatly sigmoid ; central and
terminal nodules minute ; densely and uniformly beaded over
the disk, the beads arranged in somewhat radial rows ; border
narrow. Length .0391 mm. ; breadth .0340 mm.
Type: No. 1908, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene.
This beautiful species belongs to the group of which C.
dirupta Gregory is perhaps the most common representative,
but the differences are very evident upon comparison with
such figures as Schmidt's.^*
The species is named in honor of Professor Francisco Con-
treras, a distinguished naturalist of Mexico and a member of
the Academy's expedition of 1925.
32. Cocconeis triumphis Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 14, figures 11-13
Valve broadly ovate with narrow hyaline border; raphe,
a narrow lanceolate blank area reaching to the ends and
crossed at the center with a transverse and narrower blank
strip; otherwise the disk is covered with fine beads uniformly
distributed in rows, radiating irregularly from the median
area toward the margin, but, before reaching the latter, the
beads assume positions in diagonal rows of various angles and
directions producing chiefly a wavy appearance. Length of
type specimen .0620 mm. ; breadth .0461 mm. ; length of para-
type (No. 1910) .0347; breadth .0270 mm.
Type: No. 1909, paratypes Nos. 1910, 1911, Mus. Calif. Acad.
Sci., from Arroyo Hondo, Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias
Group), Mexico; collected by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925;
Miocene.
