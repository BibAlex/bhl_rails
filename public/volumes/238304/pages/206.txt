52. Trogonurus ambiguus goldmani (Nelson).
Goldman's Trogon
Like most of the birds on the Tres Marias, trogons were
most numerous in the vicinity of water. The Maria Madre
specimens were secured at Arroyo Hondo, and in the heavy
timber by the trail leading across the island. The only trogons
noted on Maria Magdalena were near the water hole.
On Maria Madre four males (three adults and one imma-
ture) and one female were collected, and four males and one
female were obtained on Maria Magdalena.
The plumage of most of the birds exhibited little wear.
Moult, however, was in progress. In most cases only the con-
tour feathers seemed involved, but one bird is developing new
lateral rectrices and the secondaries seem new. An immature
bird is just gaining its first nuptial plumage.
53. Dryobates scalaris lucasanus (Xantus).
San Lucas Woodpecker
The collection includes two birds of this species, — an imma-
ture male in the first contour feathers, and a female in much
worn plumage. The female is acquiring a new central rectrix,
the only indication of moult.
The specimens were obtained at Cape San Lucas (May
28).
54. Dryobates scalaris graysoni (Baird).
Tres Marias Woodpecker
The Tres Marias Woodpecker seemed to be fairly common
and generally distributed on Maria Madre and Maria
Magdalena.
The collection includes two immature birds (marked females,
but acquiring red feathers on the pileum) from Maria Madre,
May 15 and 16, and two males (one unsexed) from Maria
Magdalena, May 19 and 20. New feathers are appearing on
the crown, throat, and breast. The immature birds have the
feathers of the under parts a good deal worn, and one has an
inner primary not fully developed.
The under parts of the adult birds are streaked, not spotted.
