A few specimens in the collection appear to belong- to this
species. They agree with Arnold's figure of the type of P.
mendenhalli in possessing an unustially long hinge line, valves
which are little inflated and are unusually long in proportion
to their height and right valves which are evenly rounded at
the umbo, and broadly rounded on the ventral margin. They
can be distinguished from P. invalidus and P. callidus by these
characters. None of our specimens has quite as broadly
rounded ribs as is shown by Arnold's figure of the type of P.
mendenhalli.
Examination of many specimens of true P. cerrosensis Gabb
proves that P. mendenhalli is not related to that species, but it
is far closer to P. ini'alidns, P. callidus, P. suhdolus, and P.
circularis.
This species was found at Cedros Island and at Turtle Bay.
It has previously been known from the Imperial Pliocene
formation of Imperial County, California, from Santa
Rosalia, Lower California, and from the San Diego Pliocene
of Pacific Beach near San Diego, California.
