figures of the various forms may be found. The specimens
figured herewith are mounted on one slide, No. 1979, C.A.S.
coll. ; height in side view .0256 mm. ; length in end view .070
mm. ; width in end view .0169 mm.
92. Rhaphoneis amphiceros Ehrenberg
Plate 20, figure 8
Rhaphoneis amphiceros Ehrenberg, Schmidt, Atlas Diat., pi. 269, 1911,
figs. 45, 46, 50-55.— WoLLE, Diat. N. Am. 1894, pi. 2,7, figs. 18-22.
Typical specimens of this variable species are not uncom-
mon in the Maria Madre Island deposit. Length of specimen
figured (No. 1980, C.A.S. coll.) .050 mm.; width .0248 mm.
93. Rhaphoneis cocconeiformis (Schmidt)
Plate 20, figure 9
Coscinodiscus cocconeiformis Schmidt, Atlas Diat., pi. 58, 1877, figs. 23,
28; Monterey [California, type locality, probably Miocene
deposit.].
Our specimens from the Maria Madre Island Miocene de-
posit are identical with the figures Schmidt drew from speci-
mens from ''Monterey." These are circular forms with mark-
ings precisely as in Rhaphoneis and wholly unlike any other
Coscinodiscus; therefore it seems inconsistent to retain them
in the latter genus. The total absence of raphe or pseudo-
raphe definitely excludes them from Cocconeis. Diameter of
specimen figured (No. 1981, C.A.S. coll.) .0730 mm.
94. Rhabdonema adriaticum Ktitzing
Rhahdonema adriaticum KiJTZiNG, Bacill. 1844, p. 127, pi. 18, fig. 7. —
Schmidt, Atlas Diat., pi. 217, 1899, figs. 17-29; pi. 221, 1900, fig.
14._Mann, Cont. U. S. Nat. Herb., Vol. 10, pt. 5, 1907, p. 321.
A single group of valves firmly attached was found in the
Maria Madre Island deposit. In side view, all that can be
seen, the specimen resembles the figures of adriaticum more
than any other species.
