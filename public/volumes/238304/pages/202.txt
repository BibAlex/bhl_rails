\0L. XV] McLELL ANâ€” BIRDS AND MAMMALS 297
both Black and Turkey vultures were represented on the Tres
Marias at the time of the visit of the Ortolan, as, during the
days the author spent on Maria Madre in October, 1925, the
flocks haunting the beach in front of the settlement comprised
both species.
40. Buteo borealis calurus Cassin. Western Red-tail
On April 19, Doctor Hanna saw two red-tailed hawks flying
over the cliffs on Guadalupe Island,
41. Buteo borealis socorroensis Ridgway. Socorro Red-tail
Red-tailed hawks were fairly common and not at all wild
on Socorro Island. A pair was seen near Grayson's Cove,
and many others were in evidence about the steam vents. On
one occasion a pair was disturbed in a feast on a three weeks
old lamb. The crop of one of the examples contained nearly
the whole of a Grayson's Dove. One nest was placed in the
face of a cliff near Braithwaite Bay; another, discovered by
members of the Ortolan's crew, contained a young bird about
four weeks old; a third nest, in a lava bubble on the wall of
an arroyo, was noted by Mr. Slevin.
Several specimens were obtained by various members of the
party. The collection includes the skins of three males and
one female, taken on May 3 and 11.
One of the males is in greatly abraded plumage. Two others
have commenced their postnuptial moult, fresh body and flight
feathers appearing. Two of the birds are melanistic ones.
42. Buteo borealis fumosus Nelson. Tres Marias Red-tail
Red-tailed hawks were said to be numerous on Maria
Madre. They were quite fearless and so easily approached that
one was killed by a shot from a collecting pistol. No speci-
mens of this species are included in the collection.
