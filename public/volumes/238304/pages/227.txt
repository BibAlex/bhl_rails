glandular-pubcrulent, ascending to appressed, each subtended
by a minute subulate bract ; calyx glabrate to glandular-puberu-
lent, 5-parted into subequal herbaceous, lanceolate segments
2-3 mm. long with scarious margins and divergent tips ; corolla

2.5-4 mm. long, 1-2 mm. wide, glabrous within, with slender
spur at base, upper lip reflexed, 4-5 mm. long, lobes oblong,
2-3 mm. long, lower lip spreading, deflexed, 5-10 mm. long,
with the well formed palate convex, 2-ridged, pubescent, ex-
tending to base of lobes, lobes broad, suborbicular, 3-4 mm.
long, middle one projecting beyond others ; stamens glabrous,
didynamous, 2-3 mm. long, included, filaments slightly dilated,
scarcely geniculate, anther-sacs divergent, confluent, less than
0.5 mm. long, 5th stamen very rudimentary, represented by
filament-base only; pistil glabrous, 2-3 mm. long, stigma

Corolla, exclusive of spur, from 7-9 mm. long; seeds smooth.
Type locality: Probably southern New Jersey (Pennell,
Torreya 19:151. 1919). Herbarium material of this and of
the next variety is so abundant that no attempt is here made
to cite specimens, especially as the whole matter has been so
adequately discussed by Pennell (Proc. Phila. Acad., 1. c. ).
I have seen sheets that I would refer to the var. typica from
