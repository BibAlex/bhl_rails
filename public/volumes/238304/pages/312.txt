Arnold it is distinguished by the presence of more spiral ridges
on the whorls. From F. perelegans Nomland, F. wrighti is
distinguished by possessing somewhat stronger sculpture and
a less recurved canal and a less prominent siphonal fasciole.
From F. carisaensis Anderson, it is distinguished by a more
elongate outline of the shell. The prominent spiral sculpture
on the early whorls distinguish F. zvrighti from the young of
F. belcheri Hinds, F. magistcr Nomland, and F. ponderosiim
Gabb.
This species is named for Mr. John T. Wright, collector of
birds and mammals on the expedition of 1925, who frequently
and generously assisted in the collection of fossils.
30. Haliotis cf. rufescens Swainson
A specimen of an abalone shell was found in the Pliocene
of Cedros Island, in place and associated with Pliocene fossils.
Unfortunately the friable condition of the matrix and brittle-
ness of the shell makes complete cleaning of the specimen
impossible.
The shell is a little thinner than that of typical H. rufescens
from the recent west American fauna, and the spiral sculpture
is more regular. It is not H. fidgens Philippi, for in that
species the holes are small, more numerous, and their margins
are little elevated, while on our specimen the holes are few,
large, with elevated margins, and very similar to those of H.
rufescens. The known recent range of H. rufescens is from
Bodega Bay, California, southward to La Paz, Lower
California.
