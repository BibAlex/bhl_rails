84. Cardinalis cardinalis mariae Nelson. Tres Marias Cardinal
The cardinal is one of the common birds on Maria Madre.
It seemed to be particularly abundant in the Arroyo Hondo
vicinity.
Four adult males, one adult female, and one unsexed bird
(an immature female) were secured on May 15 and 16.
In the cases of two males, the gray deciduous margins of
the upper parts are still in evidence. The plumage of the un-
sexed bird is greatly worn on all areas, the rectrices being re-
duced almost to the rachises. A few pin feathers about the
nostrils of this bird are the only signs of feather replacement.
One male has evidently met with an accident, as the inner
secondaries and the tertials are being renewed on one wing.
85. Piranga ludoviciana (Wilson). Western Tanager
The only Western Tanager seen on the Tres Marias was a
male collected on Maria Madre on May 15. The first nuptial
plumage is being assumed, and replacement is nearly complete.
86. Piranga bidentata flammea (Ridgway).
Tres Marias Tanager
This is one of the abundant birds on the Tres Marias. It is
to be found most commonly in the second growth scrub near
the shore. At the time of the visit of the Ortolan, many of
them were seen near Arroyo Hondo, on Maria Madre, and at
the water hole on Maria Magdalena. Four adult males anrl
two females were taken on Maria Madre on May 15, 16. 17,
and 23. The plumage of all the specimens shows wear. The
'"mirrors" on the tertiaries are almost completely worn away.
There are no indications of feather renewal.
