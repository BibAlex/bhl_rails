^gQ CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES [Proc. 4th Ser.
Type: No. 2202, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci. ; collected on
Socorro Island, on the north slope of Mount Evermann at
from 2,000 to 2,800 feet elevation, by the Academy expedition.
Two of the specimens contained a spherical shining white
egg, seemingly rather large for so minute a shell. The species
appears to be rare, as only a few specimens were obtained.
The figiu-es of Helix punctum Morelet, given by Martens, re-
semble it.

A few specimens were collected on Socorro Island at an
elevation of 2,000 feet above the sea, by the Academy
expedition.
The variations notable in individual specimens from the
northern United States seem quite sufificient to cover the dif-
ferences betw^een the northern and Mexican shells.

A single specimen from Socorro Island at an elevation of
2,000 feet was obtained by the Academy expedition. It agrees
exactly with specimens sent by Berendt from Mirador, Mexi-
co, where Strebel collected it. It appears not to be the shell
figured by Crosse & Fi.scher under this name and seems to be
a sufficiently good species.
