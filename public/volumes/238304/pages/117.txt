This species approaches both A'', lyra and A^. hennedyi, the
Maria Madre Island fossils agreeing almost exactly with

Like A^. pandura, there are a great many coarsely-marked,
constricted diatoms in the Maria Madre Island deposit which
have the costse divided into single beads by longitudinal fur-
rows. Many variations have been named which have this
general form of sculpture, but it appears that for the present
it would be best to follow Cleve*^ as nearly as possible and
group them under A^. splendida. Length of specimen figured

75. Navicula stippi Hanna & Grant, new species

Valve ovate, flat, almost twice as long as broad ; raphe
straight, narrow, bordered on each side almost to the central
nodule by a band of fine transverse striae ; margin bounded by
a narrow zone of fine radial strire of uniform length; remain-
