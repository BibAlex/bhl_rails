row of small spines on each side extending to the ends but
not around the long, rounded margin. Length of type .1516
mm. ; breadth .1030 mm.
Type: No. 1936, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene.
This huge species is exceedingly abundant in the Maria
Madre Island deposit but the valves are so delicate that per-
fect specimens are very difficult to secure. It belongs to the
group once named P aimer ia Greville,^^ but which is not be-
lieved to be separable from Heniidiscus proper.

Plate 16, figure 13
Valve with margin convex throughout, greatly thickened
on one (dorsal) side; ends not produced; ventral side regu-
larly rounded, with an ocellus near the margin but no spines ;
disk covered with close-set beading, which is largest in the
center and decreases in size gradually to the margins; beads
not arranged in radial rows but somewhat like watch case
milling; border zone narrow and crossed by fine radial lines.
Length of type .050 mm. ; breadth .0366 mm.
Type: No. 1937, Mus. Calif. Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo,
Maria Madre Island (Tres Marias Group), Mexico; collected
by Hanna & Jordan, May, 1925 ; Miocene.
In the absence of radial rows of beads and projecting (gib-
bous) ends this species differs from the well-known Euodia
gibba Bailey (H. cuneiformis Wallich) ; it is found commonly
in the Maria Madre Island deposit. A species found in the
Monterey Shale of California is very similar to this and may
be the same ; it has been referred to H. gibba or H. cuneiformis
in the past, but an examination of the original figures of these^"
shows that, while they are probably one and the same as most
authors^® have contended, they can hardly be the same as these
fossils unless an enormous amount of variation from the type
be admitted.
