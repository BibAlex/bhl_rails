The three immature unsexed individuals are in much worn
Hvery. They are probably young of the previous year, for,
although the under tail-coverts are white, the rump is still
dark. A moult involving all areas is in progess. In all cases
the new rectrices are dark colored.
The immature female is probably a bird experiencing its
second postnuptial moult. The head, neck, and underparts are
white, save for a slight clouding; the rump is dark, and the
incoming feathers only partially white; the feathers of the
back are broadly margined with white; and the newly acquired
rectrices are dark.
The downy young is still in the protoptyle stage, but pure
white mesoptyles are well developed.
The eggs in the collection were all obtained on Clarion
Island on April 27. Some of the eggs were fresh. In others
incubation had begun, and in others it was advanced.
17. Phalacrocorax auritus albociliatus Ridgway.
Farallon Cormorant
Cormorants were reported to be breeding in large numbers
on San Martin Island on June 8. One set of half incubated
eggs (said to be those of the Farallon Cormorant) was ob-
tained.
18. Phalacrocorax penicillatus (Brandt). Brandt's Cormorant
The one Brandt's Cormorant in the collection was a mem-
ber of a small breeding colony on the north side of Outer
Island, Guadalupe. It was taken by Captain Nelson on April
21.
19. Pelecanus californicus Ridgway. California Brown Pelican
On the southward voyage, brown pelicans were seen off
the Santa Barbara Islands, April 16. On Maria Madre they
were seen on the beach to the north of the settlement, and on
Maria Magdalena they were roosting in trees near shore. Peli-
cans with young almost as large as the adults occupied a rocky
area near the highest part of Isabel Island on May 24.
