Santa Barbara" formations of southern California, which are
of upper PHocene age but are a Httle younger than the Plio-
cene of Pacific Beach. Many species in the present list are
found in the Pico formation (Lx)wer Fernando of English^*,
and of various authors, Fernando of J. P. Smith^^, Pico of
Kew^^), Lower Pliocene, in southern California. The simi-
larity of the present fauna to that of the beds at Pacific Beach
is, however, more striking than to that of the Pico. Beyond
community of a few wide ranging and non-diagnostic species,
the present fauna is not related to that of the Jacalitos or
Etchegoin formations of the San Joaquin valley region, nor
similar in aspect to that of the Pliocene of Coyote Mountain,
in Imperial County, California^**.
The writers, therefore, consider the Pliocene beds of Cedros
Island and of the Turtle Bay region to be approximately equiv-
alent to the San Diego formation of Pacific Beach, and to
represent either approximately the middle of the Pliocene or
the lower part of the upper Pliocene.
Considered as to climatic relations, the present fauna pre-
sents a mixture of warm and cool water types, with warm
water fonns in the majority, a condition similar to that today
prevailing in the waters about Cedros Island and Turtle Bay.
The presence of abundant Lyropecten, Plagioctenium, Amu-
sium, Pecten ss., Placunanomia, Area, Spondylus, fluted
Ostrea, Astrodapsis, and Clypeaster indicates that when these
beds were deposited the waters were at least as wann as they
are at present in the region. On the other hand the effect of
gradual cooling in Pliocene time in western North America,
described by J. P. Smith^'', is shown by the occurrence here of
many central and southern California upper Pliocene forms,
particularly Patinopectens and such species as Laqueus cali-
fornicus vancouveriensis. Probably at the time of deposition
of these beds the climate in the region did not differ greatly
from that of the present.
It is yet impossible to draw any conclusions as to distribu-
tion or relationship of Pliocene faunas in Lower California as
