not appear to be present on Socorro, but there were breeding
birds on San Benedicto on May 12.
One bird in immature plumage was taken on Alijos Rocks
on April 24, and six adult males and two downy young (male
and female) were collected on Clarion Island on April 27
and 28.
A postnuptial moult involving the body plumage has com-
menced in all the Clarion Island birds. Two of the males are
also developing new rectrices. The immature bird from Alijos
Rocks has the dark color of the head broken by patches of drab
feathers. The young are clothed in pure white down.
In dried skins the colors of the soft parts vary considerably.
The bill is horn color in some specimens and straw yellow in
others. The tarsus and toes vary from dirty flesh color to
mustard yellow.^" In life, according to the color sketch made
by Mr. Tose, the culmen approaches a deep chamois.
The twelve sets of eggs in the collection from Clarion Island
(April 27 and 28) were in various stages from slightly to
well incubated, and a few were fresh. The heavily incubated
eggs discovered^^ on San Benedicto Island (May 12) were
not retained in the collection.
14. Sula nebouxii Milne-Edwards. Blue-footed Booby
Blue-footed Boobies were noted on the beach on Maria
Madre on May 17, and on outlying rocks on Maria Magda-
lena^* on May 21. They were very numerous on Isabel Island
where they nest under small trees. No eggs were found, but
young, in nearly every state from newly hatched to almost
fully grown, were present. The older ones were observed at
the southwest beach learning to swim.
Two adult males were collected on Isabel Island on May
24. Postnuptial feather replacement has affected the remiges
and rectrices, and also the plumage of the back.
