instances being replaced, but flight feathers also are being
developed in seven cases. One specimen has acquired fresh

not fully grown.
33. Zenaidura graysoni Lawrence. Socorro Mourning Dove
Mourning doves were very numerous on the island of So-
corro, being particularly abundant on the higher wooded levels,
and ranging almost to the top of the island. They were so
fearless that no difficulty was experienced in catching- them
alive. At the time of the visit of the Ortolan the fruits of
Bumelia socorrcnsis and Prinius capiiU entered very largely
into the diet of these birds.
Ten males (two immature), eight females (one immature),
and one unsexed juvenile were collected on May 7 and 9.
A postnuptial moult involving all areas is in progress. Two
immature males are acquiring adult plumage. The unsexed
juvenile (evidently a late fall bird) has new feathers appear-
ing on the crown and throat, and new remiges are developing.
34. Leptotila fulviventris capitalis Nelson. Tres Marias Dove
The Tres Marias Dove seemed to be common on both
Alaria Madre and Maria Magdalena. It was noted particularly
in the vicinity of Arroyo Hondo, and at the water hole on
Alaria Magdalena.
A male and three females (one immature) were collected
on Maria Madre May 17 and 20.
One female has not yet begim to acquire nuptial dress, the
other and the male are in an advanced state of moult, a com-
plete one being in progress. The immature female has a few
feathers of the adult present on the crown, and the inner two
primaries have recently been renewed.
