Department of Fishes
During the year 1926 the Curator and the Assistant Curator have given
such time as they could devote to the department chiefly (1) assisting
Dr. David Starr Jordan in the preparation of a report on the Giant
Mackerel-Like Fishes, Tunnies, Spearfishes and Swordfishes' of the World;
(2) studying (with Mr. Tsen-Hwang Shaw), a small collection of fresh-
water fishes from Eastern China^; (3) sorting, tagging and accessioning
the Ortolan collection of fishes; (4) caring for the collections; and (5), most
important of all, working upon a revised Check-List of the Fishes of North
and Middle America upon which Dr. Jordan and the Curator have been
engaged at intervals for a number of years. Mr. Clark, the Assistant
Curator, has given much of his time to this work. He has also given
considerable attention to breeding certain species of small aquarium fishes.
From September 18 to November 1 the Assistant Curator was in Iowa,
Illinois and northern Indiana making collections of live fishes for the
Steinhart Aquarium, and the Curator was in the East from October 9 to
December 17 visiting museums and aquariums in New York, Philadelphia,
Washington and Chicago.
