San Diego Wren
One San Diego Wren (a male) was secured at San Quintin
on June 7, and four males were taken near the spring at the
summit of Cedros Island on June 4. In all cases the plumage
was greatly worn, but moult had not commenced.
106. Troglodytes tanneri Townsend. Clarion Island Wren
These wrens were common on Clarion Island. Most of the
specimens in the collection were taken in the vicinity of Sul-
phur Bay, where they frequented the scrubby growth and
patches of cactus. Although they were most abundant near
the shore, they occurred on all parts of the island. According
to the notes of Mr. Tose, the specimens collected showed little
indication of nesting. On April 28, however, Doctor Hanna^Â°
found a nest containing four half-grown young.
Twenty-one males (one immature), 12 adult females, and
two unsexed examples were taken on April 26, 27, 28, and 29.
Postnuptial moult is well under way in these specimens. A
few individuals have pin feathers just appearing on forehead
and throat, others are gaining new tertials, also. Still others
have renewed the contour feathers and remiges, and have
