10. Actinoptychus solisi Hanna & Grant, new species
Plate 12, figures 1-3
Valve circular with 14 to 18 sectors, each alternating one
being provided with a short spine at the outer end; central
area blank ; markings in two series ; first a set of large rounded
protuberances, too massive to be called beads, arranged ap-
parently in no very definite form and scattered uniformly but
sparsely throughout the valve, the smooth central area ex-
cepted ; the other set of markings consists of a series of small
but distinct, round beads set in two series of rows at angles of
about 50° with the radii and uniformly distributed over the
ornamented area; outer ends of non-spine bearing sectors
raised out of the plane of the remainder and therefore appear-
ing as blank spaces in photographs. Diameter of type .1352
mm.; of paratype No. 1881 .0654 mm. ; of paratype No. 1882
.190 mm.
Type: No. 1880; paratypes Nos. 1881, 1882, Mus. CaUf.
Acad. Sci., from Arroyo Hondo, Maria Madre Island (Tres
Marias Group), Mexico; collected by Hanna & Jordan, May,
1925 ; Miocene.
The species belongs to a group of which A. incisa Grunow
is the fonn most familiar to western students, on account of
its being a common species in the upper part of the Monterey
Shale. But in no specimen of that species we have seen has
there been more than a faint indication of the system of large
secondary markings so evident on A. solisi. Moreover. A.
iiicisa invariably has blank spaces of greater or less extent fol-
lowing the median lines of alternating sectors from the central
hyaline area; A. solisi has none.*
The species is large and very handsome and we take pleas-
ure in naming it for Sr. Ing. Octavio Solis, Director of the
botanical garden of Chapulte[>ec and a member of the Academy
expedition of 1925.
