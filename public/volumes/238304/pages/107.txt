Dr. Mann has stated in his 1925 paper on Phihppine Dia-
toms that this species belongs to Endyctia and not Coscinodis-
cus. A study of specimens from the Miocene fossil deposit at
Monterey, California, the type locality, leaves little room for
doubt as to the correctness of this disposition. Our specimens
from Maria Madre Island Miocene are unquestionably the
same as those from Monterey in our collection. Great vari-
ation in size is shown. The smaller specimen figured (No.
1926, C.A.S. coll.) is .0974 mm. in diameter; the larger (No.
1927) is .100 mm. in diameter.

Individuals of a species we believe to be this are common in
the Maria Madre Island deposit and have four to six spines.
The form was originally described from the Nottingham,
Maryland, fossil deposit. Diameter of specimen figured with
four spines (No. 1931, C.A.S. coll.) .1242 mm.; diameter of
specimen figured with six spines (No. 1932) .1646 mm.
