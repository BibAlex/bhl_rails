vents increases when the temperature rises, while that of optically
active liquids decreases.
Guye and Astonl examined some fifty organic liquids, and found
that in all cases except that of amyl alcohol the rotatory power
diminished with rise of temperature. This exceptional case they
explained by the dissociation of i:)reviously associated molecules.
The rotations of the only four terpenes which were optically
active were measured over a range of from 20° to 60^ by means
of a Ptilfrich polarimeter, fitted Avith a device for varying the
temperature of the tube by means of a bath, and the experimental values
are .shown in the accompanying table, while the molecular rotatory
powers - ajlAld.M.- have also been calculated and plotted against the
temperature.
The rotations of d- and 1-pinene are little affected by tempera-
ture change, but slowly decrease as the temperature rises. That
of d-limonene falls 0.134O for every degree rise of temperature,
while phellandrene again shows its abnormal character by a marked
increase of rotation.
In every one of its physical properticvS then, the curious nature
of this terpene, as obtained from the oil of Eucalyptus dives, is
expressed. It appears as if it must either be a mixture of two
terpenes inseparable by distillation, whose equilibrium is upset by
temperature change, or, as seems more probable, the molecules may
be associated at the lower temperatures, as in the case of amyl
alcohol.
Furtlier work may shed more light on this interesting terpene.
