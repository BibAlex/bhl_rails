Report Laniell. pi. 1. figs. 1 — le.. the type of which is in the
British Mus. of Nat. Hist., is soniewiiat siuiihir. We deemed it
advisable to have a comparative examination of our new species
with it, and forwarded specimens to Mr. G. B. Sowerhy, who re-
plied as follows, 8-1-1 i: — "I examined type of Dosinia deshayesi ;
I can understand some of your small ones j^assing for the young
of it, but is certainly a distinct sjaecies; its form is different, and
it is iiattei-; the ligamentary area is much narrower, and the
character of the concentric lamellae different. It is also certainly
distinct fiom D. histrio, which runs into t^nrieriafa. I think you
may safely describe it as a new species." Further confusion has
been added to the puzzle since one of us i-eceived from a South
AuvStralian correspondent a St. Vincent Gulf left valve under the
name of D. brazieri ; the author was not given, and diligent seai'ch
through literature failed to reveal any description under such
name : we conclude, therefore, that D. hrazieri is manuscript.
A medium-sized specimen has been selected for the type. The
series studied, ranging from 8 mm. to 45 mm. (paratype), exhibit-
ing some slight variation in contour. The colour rays in some
specimens are very clearly defined, while in others almost absent.
We have here to express our many thanks to Mr. F. Chapman
for his excellent illustrations of the species.
