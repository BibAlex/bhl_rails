It lias no piilf at /\= +1, while \= — 1 is not a singular value.
The series is therefore convergent for |A.1=1- In (36) we may put
\=±1 and thus obtain the densities of the simple strata which
satisfy respectively the boundary problems

The series for the solutions (21) may be obtained from that equa-
tion by substituting the values of PC'^p) and Q(pO). Further, if
Ao=I, the functions II+^{ts) and Cr-^^{ps) given by (20) have no
pole at \=1, while \=i — 1 is not a singular value. The series are
therefore convergent for jA| = l, so that the terms decrease indefi-
nitely. It follows that
giving the electric distribution^. <j>r{t) in terms of the iterated
functions hn(ts) : the limit assuming one of m different values,
according to the surface upon which -'j lies: Similarly fiom the
convergence of the second series (20) for lA|=l, it follows that

§8. — Solution of fhe second hnundary problem for both inner
and outer regions in terms of (t single function. — In the second
boundary proljlem the values A=±l correspond to the inner and
outer regions respectively. The former of these values is the only
pole involved. The boundary problem (19b) becomes, for Ao=U
and A=±l equivalent to the sepai-ate problems represented by
^ ' ^ ^(t+)=~i(t) for A=+l
dn
'^^{r)=HO for A=:-l
where in the former the boundary function i{t) is subject to the
usual integral condition. The solutions to the problems given by
(18) may be written
(39) r(p)=/Gll(pO)i(e)dO
and
v{p}=/vtl(pe)t(e)de
