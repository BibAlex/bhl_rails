Rostral latus. extreniL' apex wantiiifj:. Length, 8 nun. ; width at
base, 2.25 mm. ; thickness of carina at apical end. 1 nun.
Scutum. Length, minus apex, 7.75 nun.; greatest width, 9 una.
AffinitieK. — The above species shows a remarkable resemblance to
Scolpellmn quadratum, Dixon sp.,l a form which occurs in the
Londinian (Eocene, London clay) of Bognor, in Sussex and Hanip-
stead, near London, England. As in .S'. subqitadrafum, the lines
of growth start from the apex as noted by Darwin for that species.
From the living Scalpellitm rntilutn, Darwin, 2 this carina differs
in the flat, ungrooved roof, and strongly arched growth-lines.
A species of Scalpellam (S. jidieuse, Ortmann^), has been de-
scribed from tlie Miocene of Patagonia, in which the outer surface
of the carina is convexly rounded, and not flattened as in our
species.
Observations. — The largest specimen (holotype) is incomplete,
but probably wanting only 5 or 6 mm. The specimen was originally
found in two parts, washed from a large quantity of clay, and
it was only when examining the material in detail that the two
parts were found to fit together.
Occurrence. — Bore 4, 163-170 feet, holotype and parat^-pe
(Carina and Scutum), — (Kalimnan or Janjukian). Bore 10, '310-
320 feet, paratype (rostral latus). (Kalimnan or Janjukian).

Observations. — The identification of the Mallee specimens of the
above, consisting as they do of only separated compartments, would
have been practically impossible but for the other and more com-
plete examples from the Kalimnan of Beaumaris in the
