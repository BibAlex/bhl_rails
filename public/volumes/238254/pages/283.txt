Boat-shaped Australife presented hy Mr. Charles DWlton to
Geolor/ical Museum of the University.
Measurements. — The weight determined by the chemical bahiiice
is .4632 grams.
The specific gravity determined by Joly's spring balance is 2.4.'').
Length of australite is 20 mm. or || inch.
Breadth of australite is 9.5 mm. or | inch.
Maximum thickness is 3 mm. or yL- inch.
Breadth of australite, excluding the flange, is 4 mm. or wV inch.
Appearance of Australite.
General characters. — The specimen is more or less boat-shaped. It
is elliptical in outline, with an upper surface, whose central part is
approximately cylindrical, and with a flange curved upwards, im-
parting a general concave appearance to the upper surface. Much
of the flange has been lost by fracture, but in one place appears
to be unbroken, and there the outer rim of the flange is slightly
curved back, and appears to be fluted. The specimen is bottle-
green to black in colour.
Concave or upper surface.
The central convex or cylindrical portion has a slight constric-
tion or " waist " developed half-way Ijetween the extremities. The
latter taper off towards a point. The surface of the central por-
tion shows small hemispherical pits, but most prominently de-
veloped, especially near the junction with the flange are long, semi-
cylindrical grooves, running generally parallel to the longer axis
of the australite, and curving in at the " waist," and outwards
beyond it. A few short grooves run nearly at right angles to
these across the central convex portion. The flange does not show
a constriction to a " waist," and exhibits on its surface small
hemispherical pits.
Convex or lower surface.
This shows a few longitudinal grooves near the flange, but the
general surface is covered with a large number of pits, some small
and hemisphei-ical, others large and flatter, as if adjacent pits
had become confluent.
