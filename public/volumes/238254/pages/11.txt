2 E. C. Joshua :
the wheel papillae and aggregations are not c(Mi8tantly met with,
and that in ninnerous individuals the distril)uti(iii of the wheels
conld only be described as scattered everywhere, thus coni])ining in
one species the characters of two genera. So gi'eat an authority
as Dendy will have neither of these genei-a, and adhei-es to tlie
original genus Chiridota for the reception of all these wheel-bear-
ing forms. Personally, I think that the genus Cliiridofa nuiy be
usefully sepai-ated from the sigmoid bearing genera on account of
its members exhibiting bracket shaped ossicles ; there would appear
to be no species having an ossicle which could "be described as
intermediate in form between a sigma and a bracket.
Verrill's genus Leptoxi/napta is used for the species doJahrifrra
iStimpson, Clark (3) having definitely pointed out the propriety
of this course.
The following is a list of the species dealt with : — ■
Stlvliopiix nioUis (Hutton).
St icJiopiis s/zniilans Dendy.
Citcintuind /uronsp/cua Bell.
Cnciiinaria niiifanx, sp. n.
Phyllophoru^ iJenritidiuK Dendy.

GENUS STICHOPUS.
Sticiiopus mollis (Hutton).
For syiiouyniy see
1907. Sticiiopus mollis, Dendy and IJindU- (To; and
1887 Holothuria victoriae. Bell (1);
191.3. Sticiiopus mollis, Erwo Willy (S).
After Trading Bell's act'ount of his Il.,lotliinia \ictori;te. and
examining tlie hgures he gives of its spicules. I havr no hesita-
tion in synonymising it with Hutton 's species.
