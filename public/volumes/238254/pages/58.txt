-may be readily distinguished from C. polita, not only in the
narrower extremities, but also in the angularly tumid outline of the
carapace in edge view. It is extremely abundant in the washings
from the Mallee bores, and occurs from the Miocene upwards.
Occurrence.— Boi-e 2, 198-200 feet (Kalimnan). Bore 3, 260 feet,
-circ. (Janjukian). Bore 4, 163-170 feet (Kalimnan). Bore 9, 256-
263 feet; 315-325 feet (Kalimnan or Janjukian). Bore 10, 230-254
feet (Kalimnan). Bore 11, 175-197 feet; 197-199 feet; 219-260
feet (Kalimnan). 349-353 feet; 540-542 feet; 554-556 feet; 558-560
feet (Janjukian).

Observations. — As a recent species this is one of the deeper
water forms of the genus Cytherella. It has been noted from Tris-
tan d'Acunha; Port Jackson; from Challenger Sta. 167 in the
Southern Ocean between Sydney and Nevr Zealand ; off the Ki
Islands; and in the Straits of Magellan.
Egger records the above species from the west coast of Aiistralia at
"357 metres.
Occurrence.— Bove 6. 114-150 feet (Kalimnan). Bore 9, 256^263
feet (Kalimnan or Janjukian). Bore 11, 267-270 feet (Janjukian).
Cttherella subtruncata, sp. uov. (Plate TX., Figs. 48a, b).
Descrij)tion. — Carapace, from the side, compressed oblong or sub-
rectangular, with broadly rounded extremities; dorsal margin
nearly straight, slightly concave in the middle, ventral broadly
concave, antero- and postero-ventral angles rather more produced
than the dorsal; encircling border or flange fairly conspicuous on
the ventral edge. Median surface depressed. Seen from below,
compressed, elongate, pyriform, the contour depressed in the
middle, anterior extremity compressed and rounded, the posterior
inflated and much thicker. Surface smooth.
