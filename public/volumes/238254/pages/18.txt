tentacles, the two v^'iitial of wiiieh are about half the length <>f
the dorsal. Each tentacle has 1)ut four digitations, the two
proximal of which are about one-third of the lengtli of the disTal.
Deposits of two kinds, consisting of wheels meusui-ing SO ^ in
diameter, and sigmoid bodies (Figs. 4 a and e), 130 /a in length.
The wheels have six spokes; the rim is hexagonal, its innei' margin
is coarsely serrated around its whole circumference. The sexes are
apparently separate. The genital glands are unbianched. There
is a single polian vessel, and one madreporal canal, which is fused
to the dorsal mesentery. Mi-. Koebuck collected several specimens
from beneath stones at Torquay, and I have since met with tliem in
the same locality. The animal would appear to ])e very close to the
European species, Trochodofa reiitisfa, Semon. However, the pro-
portion of the digitations on the tentacles and the form of the wheel
ossicles differ from the illustrations of these structures, given respec-
tively by Clark (3) and Ludwig (16) for venu'^fa. I have, unfor-
tunately, been unable to refer to Semon's original paper. The
variation in the size of the tentacles is quite constant, and has been
•determined by the examination of numerous specimens, both in a
living and preserved condition. They increase gradually in size
from the venter to the dorsum.
