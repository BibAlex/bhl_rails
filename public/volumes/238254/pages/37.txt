26 Frederick- Cha^mian :
of small pittings or areolations. the margins of which tend to form
a rudely polrgonal network. These pittings are much finer an(J'
closer than seem to be indicated in the woodcut given bv Ameghino,
of Ceratodu< iheringi.x from the Upper Cretaceous of Patagonia.
The splenial portion at the base projects from the tooth for about
4.5 nmi., and is flange-like. At the junction of the tooth with
the splenial, the lower surface is rather deeply excavated.
Dimension^.— IjQTxgth. of tooth when complete, about 35 mm.
Length of second anterior denticle from its junction with the base,
6 mm. Length of anterior denticle, approximately 17 mm. when
complete. Greatest height of tooth as distinct from the splenial
bone. 10 mm.

Bel-at ion ships. — A British form, Ceratodii^ di^auris. Agassiz,-
from the Rhaetic of Aust Cliff, shows, in the figure given by L. C.
Miall,^ four denticles, as in the present species. The denticles in
the specimen mentioned, however, are more trenchant than in the
present species.
Ceratodus aru4. Smith Woodward.* sliows a nearer relationship-
than other described forms, in having four denticles, and in these
being comparatively short.
An Upper Cretaceous species from Patagonia. C. iheringi,
Ajiiegliino.-' appears to be a palatal tooth. It has more salient den-
ticles, five in number, and. according to Ameghino. shows closer
alliance with the European mesozoic species than with the living
Australian C (yeoceratodtis) forateri.
Dr. Emile Haug has described a Cretaceous species of Ceratodus
{C. africavu^.) from Djoua. near Timassanine. in the Sahara.^
which differs from the Triassic European examples- in the presence
of crenulations upon the anterior side of the tooth, and of six ridges
instead of five, characters which approach those of the living lung-
fish. Cerafodvs (Xrorerafodus) forstrri. of Queensland.
