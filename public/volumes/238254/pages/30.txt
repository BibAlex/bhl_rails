Introduction.
Most of the specimens with which this work was carried out wer ■
collected by Mr. C. French, at Port Esperaute. N.W. Tasmania,
and sent to Mr. Kershaw, at the National Muesum, who kindly gave
them to me to work out their anatomy.
Two other specimens, one of which was immature, were collected
by Miss Raff, M.Sc, at Mount Wellington, Tasmania.
Caryodes dufresnyi Avas named and first described l)y Leach as a
Helix; Zoological Miscellany, vol. 2, pp. L53, L54. pi. 120.
A short account of the anatomy, mostly of the reproductive
system, has been given by Semper, in Reis. im Philip., vol. iii. p.
102, pi. xvi., f. 7.
Mr. C. Hedley, F.L.S., has given us a description and a figure in
the Proc. Linn. Soc, N.S.W. (2), vi., 1891, p. 19, pi. ii., f. la, pi.
iii., f.l; and some further information as to its systematic position
in the Rec. Austr. Mus., ii. 1892, p. 29.
Other descriptions, chiefly of the shell, have been given by
Quoy and Gaimard, in the Voyage of the Astrolabe, vol. ii., j)]. x..
f.l; and by Adams, in the Genera of Recent MoUusca, vol. 2, pp.
146 and 153.
After having been described by Leach as a Helix, Caryodes
dufresnyi was described as Bulimus dufresnyi. The genus BuUmus
according to Cox, possesses the following characteristics : — " Shell
oblong or turreted, aperture with unequal longitudinal margins,
toothless or dentate; columella entire, revolute externally or
simple; peristome simple or expanded." While Semper adds: —
" A parallel ridged jaw. Teeth similar, in straight or curved rows.
Shell long, with thick mouth edge. The kidney is, in spite of the
long lung, as short as the pericardium; it is three cornered.
