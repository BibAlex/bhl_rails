The following contribution is descriptive of certain features in
the geology of portion of the Parish of Queenstown. Unfortunately,
the field-work was not completed, owing to the transference of the
writer to England, and as a result no geological map of the area
has l)een prepared liy him. Tlie cliief purpose of the paper is to
present the results of a study of the chemical and petrological fea-
tures and metasomatic alteration of an hitherto undescribed in-
trusion of (juartz diorite near Queenstown. Furtlier, attention is
drawn to the former richness and future possibilities of an almost
forgotten goldfield. Previous references to the geology of this area
are scant, and are of no great importance. The following papers
