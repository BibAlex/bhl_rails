A^eiv and Rare Fossils. 33
Gulicia (Miocene) and Parma (Middle Pliocene). Egger obtained
it from the Miocene of Ortenburg. Lienenklaus found the same
species in the Middle Oligocene of Jeurre. It has also occurred
in Pleistocene deposits in Scotland, as recorded by Brady, Crosskey
and Robertson. In Australia its present occurrence as a fossil is
in Miocene (Janjukian) strata. In some of the examples found
here, the rugosities of the carapace tend to become papillate.
In the living condition ('. caiialiculata was found by Dr. G. S.
Brady in dredgings from Hobson's Bay, where the present writer
has also found it in abundance, and in no wise differing from Reuss'
fossil form. Brady also found it in the " Challenger " dredgings
off East Moncoeur Island, Bass Strait, 38-40 fathoms; and in Port
Jackson. N.S. Wales. 2-10 fathoms. The example figured by Egger
(loc. cit. pi. iv.. figs. 15, 16) from the "Gazelle" dredgings, Sta.
90, 18' 52' S, 116° 13 E, off Western Australia, appears to be
identical with Brady's Cythere foveolata, which has a broader
carapace, and is not so rugosely ornamented.
Occurrence. — Bore 9, 256-263 feet (Kalimnan or Janjukian).
Bore 11, 219-260 feet; 260-265 feet (Kalimnan); 446-448 feet; 546-
548 feet; 548-550 feet (Janjukian).

Ohxerrations. — The fossil valves from the Mallee bores approach
the living specimens veiy closely, both in form and ornament. The
polygonal surface wrinklings ai-e, if anything, slightly coarser in
the fossil examples. In some features it approaches botli C . luh-
bockuina, G.S.B. and C. demissa, G.S.B.
In the fossil condition C. crispata has hitherto been known only
from the Pleistocene of Scotland, Ireland and Norway. It is a
widely distributed form at the present time, being known from tho
shores of Great Britain, Norway and the Mediterranean; and in
the southern hemisphere in Port Jackson (2-10 fathoms), off Boobv
Islands (6-8 fathoms); and in Hong Kong Harbour (7 fathoms).
This species has been lately recorded by the writer from
" Endeavour " dredgings off South Australia at 100 fathoms.
Occurrence. — Bore 11, 544-546 feet; 654-556 feet (Janjukian).
