G. crinitus, thecae x 7.
G. crinitus
As stated above, I am not sure that tlie reference to Goniograptus
is correct, l)ut I hesitate to form a new genus for its reception, till
a complete hydrosome is found. The form of the thecae is much
more primitive than that of the typical species of Goriiograpfiis.
Horizon. â€” Upper Bendigonian and Lower Castlemainian, but
commoner in the loriner.
