foraminit'era, still liviii<:- in the Australian afea. Ixit in lower
latitudes compared ^vitll their niioeene ancestors, this obviously
pointinfr to the existence of a waiiner climate in those times.
The length of the fossil specimen is .55 nun., whilst the recent
example from Port Jackson measuied .4mm. Dr. Egger's
"Gazelle" specimen measured still less, being .21 mm. in length..
Occurrence. — Bore 5. 189-190 feet (Janjnkian).

Ohservatioiis. —
The geographical distribution of this species extends from the
West Indies southwards to the Southern Ocean at Kerguelen Id..
and thenee to the Admiralty Ids.
This species has been recorded^ in the fossil state under the name
of Paracyprlit decora, from the Govt, well-boring in the Murray
River Flats, 30 miles N.W. of the Nor'-West Bend of the Murray
River. The age of the fossil from that locality is probably Kalim-
nan (L. Pliocene, " Miocene " of Prof. Tate). The present recorded
specimens range from Janjukian to Kalimnan. The Mallee
examples approximate to the living specimens in size.
Occurrence.— Bove 9. 256-263 feet; 315-325 feet, Kalimnan or
Janjukian). Bore 10. 160-186 feet (Kalimnan). Bore 11, 542-544
feet (Janjukian).
