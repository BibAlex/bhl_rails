Fhysicat Chemistry of Essential Oils. 155
Summary.
Simple mixtures of two terpens compounds follow the " Mix-
ture Law" quite closely. The divergences, at any time small, are
eliminated by the use of the " Molar Fraction Fox-mula."
For such mixtures the proportions of the constituents can be
calculated from the properties of the mixture, but whex'e one con-
stituent is niistal)le. as in phellandrene oils, such deductions are
unreliable.
These measurements w^ere made in the research laboratories of
the University of Melbourne, for the use of which we have to thank
Professor Masson.
Our thanks are also due to Professor Osborne for the use of his
polarimeter. and especially to Mr. H. G. Smith for his generous
gift of pinene eucalyptus oils.
Part II. — 7%e Physical Constants of some Terpenes and oxygenated
derivatives thereof, and their variation with temperature.

Some measurements which had been made in the course of the
last paper, and the fac-t that he had on hand samples of a number
of terpenes prepared for that research, led one of the authors to
make a so-ies of measurements on the influence of temperature
change on the three chief physical constants of terpenes — Density,
Kefractive Index, and Rotation.
The terpenes employed are, in the main, those whose purifica-
tion has been described in the joint paper ; the others were as sup-
plied by Merck and Kahlbaum, and, with two exceptions, their
purity as indicated by their constants and by the usual tests was
such as to render it unnecessary to submit them to the somewhat
uncertain processes involved in further purification.
