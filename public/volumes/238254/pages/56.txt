New and Rare Fossils. 49
Fain. CYTHERELLIDAE.
Genus CYTHEKELLA. Jones.
Cytiikhklla AURicuLUS, sp. nov. (Plate IX., Figs. 4:2a, h ; 43).
Description. — Cai-apace oblong, eonipiessed. Seen from the
side, valves subquadrate, with a marginal raised rim and depressed
central area relieved in the median line by a raised longitudinal
and crescentic bar. In the young example figured the central
raised band starts from the dorsal margin, and continues to curve
down and round, all but enclosing a central suboval space; dorsal
margin neaily straight, with a median concavity, ventral broadly
concave: ijoth extremities widely rounded. Edge view narrow
oblong, relieved l)y the marginal and median prominences. The
genei-al, depressed surface of the valve is roughly granulate, the
marginal and central bars smooth.
Dinntxioiis. — Length of lai'ger type specimen. .71 mm.; width,.
.41 iiiiii. ; thickness of carapace. .'■') mm.
Length of smaller type specimen, .5 nnn. ; width, .27 mm.
Affinities. — There is one living species, Cytherella latimnrginata,
G. S. Brady, 1 which resembles the above in having an encircling
fillet around the margin, but the centre of the valve is occupied by
a long, rounded protuberance, instead of a narrow curved bar as
in C. auriculus, the latter more nearly reseml)ling the contour of an
ear, hence the name.
The closest affinity lies, however, with some Cretaceous forms
well known from the English and European Chalk, the central type
of which is Ci/tlierella n'iUiamsoiiiaiKi . Jones. 2 This species has the
central bar broken to some extent, whilst the restricted character
of the central ornament, especially in our smaller figured type, is
perhaps more nearly approached in V ijthereUa chapmani, Jones, 5
from the Gault of Godstone, Surrey, England.
It is extremely curious to find this species and the previously
mentioned Cytheropteron postiunbo/iaf inn of the Austi-alian Miocene
so closely approaching their Cretaceous analogues.
Occurrence. — Bore 11, 219-260 feet (Kalimnan).
