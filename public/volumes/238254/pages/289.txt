1. Materials required on whicli to found a Diagnosis
of Contagious Abortion.
The materials which may be examined are : —
(1) Vaginal or Uterine Exudate after Parturition.
(2) Foetus or Foetal membranes.
(3) Blood serum.
(4) Milk.
In animals which have recently aborted (1) and (2) are applic-
able, but in animals from which these were not secured, or in
others in which it is desirable to diagnose infection in the absence
of abortion, or at a time remote from the act of abortion, the most
•commonly used material is (3) Serum. This is of especial value
because of its being easily obtained from cows at all stages of the
disease from shortly after infectidn onwards; also from male
animals, proving that they are susceptible to infection, and from
laboratory animals, such as guinea-pigs. The drawback is the
difficulty of obtaining the serum from a whole herd in the country
where dairymen would have to collect the samples.
It was because of this difficulty that investigations have been
made as to the possible use of (4) Milk. As far as I have been
able to ascertain, this material, on account of its physical proper-
ties, has not been used to any extent for the agglutina-
tion test. In some respectts milk itself is an unsatis-
factory material, and for that reason Avhey, prepared by
the artificial clotting of milk, has been used. Although
these investigations ai-e incomplete, they furnish evidence
strongly suggesting that it will be found satisfactory for
diagnosis. Should this be so, milk, from its ease of collection,
would be the ideal material for examination in the case of lactating
animals.
