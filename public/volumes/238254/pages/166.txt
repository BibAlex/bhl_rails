2. — The Action of Tannic Acid on the iodine tent for dextrins
formed during diastatic action o?i starch.
A final concentration of 1% tannic acid was found to have no
effect on this test, as used in Greenwood and Rothera's, and the
following experiments. This is because the conditions involve an
excess of iodine. The interference of tannic acid with the starch
and dextrin colours is due apparently to its forming' a combination
with the iodine, and naturally ceases when the iodine is in excess.
3. — Action of Tannic Acid on the diastatic hi/droli/sfs of starch.
Filtered starch solution was used throughotit the expei-iments,
which were done at a temperature of 38^ — 40^0.
Experiment 1. (Tubes each contained 15 c.c. of mixture.)
Using a 2.5% solution of taka diastase, which proved rapid in
action, the following mixtures were made up, and tested for com-
parative rates of action.

This was done, using taka diastase, with weaker concoctions
of tannic acid than those used in Experiment 1.
