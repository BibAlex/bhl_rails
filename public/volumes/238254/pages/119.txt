and general mining features, and very little space in them is
devoted to purely geological questions.

A. — Silurian Sediiuents.
These are the northern extension of the same folded sei-ies of
sandstones, shales, and gritty beds that occur near Warrandyte and
Diamond Creek, and with the exception of the igneous rocks near
Yow Yow and One Tree Hill, they cover the whole of the area
described in this paper. The strike of these beds is consistently
east of north, varying from north IQO east to north 5()o east. As
in the sediments of the country to the south near Wai-randyte and
Diamond Creek, fossils are relatively .scarce, and the only ones
found by the present writer were two specimens of Chonetes allied
to Chonetes melbournensis, wliich latter form is restricted to the
Melbournian division of the Silurian. These fossils were discovered
in black, sandy, occasionally gritty shales from the nmllock-tip
of a shaft on the Victoria line of reef. One Tree Hill. Selwyn has
recorded fossils similar to those occurring in the gritty beds near
Warrandyte, from Watson's Creek about six miles north of War ran-
