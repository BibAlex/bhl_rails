This is an identity in A, and P+^(<s) does not contain X. We may
therefore put X— 1 giving
/P+Hts)dt=l
which may also be deduced from (31) in virtue of the properties of
the distribution <^r(0- This last relation combined with (33')
shows that
(34) /H+Hts)d(=0
while from (32) and (33) it follows that
(34') {1-Xyil[ts)dt = l A,±l.
This may also be proved from the first of (8), multiplying by df
and integrating over the boundary.
^7. — Expansions. — The second member of the equation (19a)
assumes, when X,, =1. the form
E(0 = f (0 -./■£ {0)<l>riO)de = f (0 - Gr
r= I, 2, . . . . , m
according as f is on the 1st, 2nd . . . ?»th surface.
The series (22a) now becomes, by (29)
(35) v{t) = [i{t)-Gr] + X[f,{t)-Gr]+X\Ut)-Cr]+ ....
and since v(^) noAv possesses no pole at X= +1, while X= — 1 is not
a singular value, this series is convergent for |Aj = l. The terms
therefore decrciise indefinitely, and we have for the constant Or
the value!
n= cc
=Lt j'i{6)hn{et)de
n=cc
whei-e f is on tlie rth surface. The constant C,- assumes m different
constant values, one on eacli of the surfaces.
In (35) we may put A= + 1 and tluis obtain tlie moments of the
strata, which satisfy i-espectively the boundary problems.
W(<-)=-[f(0-C,]
W{t+)=i{t)-Or
The singular value A — I also corresponds to the second problem
for the inner region. The second member of (19b) for this pole
takes the form
V{t)=i{t)-/'P{te)i{e)d6
^i{f)-MnfHO)dO = i(t)
provided the usual condition for the inner region, viz.,
/i{e)dO =
be satisfied. The function /u(^) represented by (22b) now becomes
(36) fL{t) = i{t) + Xi,'{t)-i-X\'{t)+
