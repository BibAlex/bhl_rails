Dimensions. — Lengtli, .73 mm.; width. ..'^65 mm.; thickness of
carapace, .29 mm.
Affinities. — The above species differs from Dr. Brady's C. trun-
cata^ in having a depression in the median face of each valve, and
in the swollen and truncated posterior extremity in edge view.
The allied C. truncata has been recorded from Torres Strait.
The present fossil species is from a Kalimnan (Lower Pliocene)-
horizon in both cases.
Occurrence. — Bore 10, 225-230 feet (Kalimnan). Bore 11, 175-
197 feet (Kalimnan).
Super-Order CIRRIPEDIA.
Fam. LEPADIDAE.
Genus SCALPELLUM, Leach.
SCALPELLUM SUBQUADRATUM, sp. uov. (Plate X., Figs. 49^-0?;
50 and 51«, b).
Description. — Carina (holotype). — Elongate, strongly bowed in-
Avardly, with roof flat, gradually and evenly widening from apex
to base, and very slightly convex towards the basal margin ; surface
smooth except for faint growth-lines. Sides generally flat, thus
giving a square-sided appearance to the valve, and also showing
indications of a median groove. Basal margin broadly rounded.
Inner surface of valve deeply concave. Inner edge of carina crenu-
late near the apex, and cut through by short channels near the base.
Another specimen (paratype), and probably the rostral latus, is
narrow, of slightly thinner build, and showing strongly arched
growth-lines along the length of the valve; inner surface concave
and smooth.
Scutum (paratype). elongate triangular; occludent margin per-
fectly straight, basal, angularly rounded; tergal margin slightly
concave, with a nodulose edge. A longitudinal ridge runs from the
apex to the base, and close to the occludent margin. Superficial
growth-lines and shaded colour-patches very distinct. Inner sur-
face shoAvs the pit for the adductor scutorum, above which is a deep
fold running to the apex, and marked by some linear and sinuous
lines of growth.
Dimensions. — Carina (liolotype), extreme apex wanting. Length,
20 mm.; width at tlie base, 4.5 mm.; thickness of carina near
apical end, 2.25 mm.
