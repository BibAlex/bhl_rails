This paper contains descriptions of five neAv species of univalves
-and two new species of bivalves.
EULIMA VICTORIAK, Sp. nov. (PI. XIV^ Fig. 1).
Shell small, thin, rather attenuated, subcylindrical. opaque-
white, with a glossy surface. Whorls seven, commencing with a
large, blunt, dome-shaped apex ; the whorls are flatly convex, and
of fairly regular increase. Suture scarcely discernible. Aperture
ovate, pointed above. Labrum regularly curved, thin, and very
prominent about the centre. The labium resolves itself into a
rather broadly reverted lip.
Dimensions of fype. — Length, 2.1; breadth, .6 mm.
Locality. — Dredged off Wilson's Promontory.
Observation. — The specific differentiation of this genus is one of
the most difficult to study, requiring patient investigation ; how-
ever, the cylindrical form and dome-shaped apex serve to dis-
tinguish the present shell from its Victorian congenors. The nearest
approach is perhaps E. fricata Hedley from Tasman Sea. Rec.

Lriostraca kilcundae, sp. nov. (Pi. XTV., Figs. 2 and 3).
Shell minute, light-brown colour, smooth, shining, sufficiently

rounded doTue-sliaped apex. Following this are five flatly convex
