1. — Introduction and Physiography.
The area described in this paper consists chiefly of an elevated
series of ancient volcanic rocks, probably Devonian in age. The
relief is marked, Mount Donna Buang and other peaks rising to
more than 4000 feet above sea-level, Avhilst the bed of the Yarra at
Healesville is less than 300 feet above the same datum. The Silurian
sediments on the north side of the Victorian Main Divide which
passes through this area, have an average elevation of between 1000
and 1200 feet, but they rise to more than' 2000 feet above sea level
in places. Within the area described the divide is entirely in
volcanic rocks. The northern streams, of which the most important
is the Acheron river, flow into the Goulburn river, whilst the
Bouthern streams all drain into the Yarra river. Waterfalls are
present near the heads of most of the streams. They are principally
determined by joint planes in the volcanic rocks, e.g., Stevenson's
falls and the Acheron falls. The Mever's creek falls, however, are
