Observations. —
The above species has been met with in fossil deposits only (mce
■previously, namely, at Batesford, near Geelong, in beds of Janjuk-
ian age. In the Mallee bores the continuity of the fossil series
with the living form is seen in the fact that examples occur in both
Janjukian and Kalimnan. beds. The fossil specimens are slightly
smaller, but otherwise typical, with tlie exception that the dorsal
margin is rounder and the posterior acumination sulcated, as in
B. victrix,^ from which species it differs in its more elongate shape
.and less strongly arched dorsal margin. It probably points to an
ancestral type from which both living forms have diverged through
• differences in environment.
In the living state B. amygdaloides has a fairly wide distribu-
tion, for it ranges from the coral islands of the Pacific and Torres
Strait to Port Jackson, and even as far south as Mqncoeur Id.. Bass
Strait. Its bathymetrical range is doAvn to 160 fathoms.
Occurrence. — Bore 4, 180-190 feet (Janjukian). Bore 10. 310-
320 feet (Kalimnan or Janjukian). Bore 11, 542-544 feet (Jan-
jukian).

Observations. — As Dr. Brady has already pointed out,''^ the
recent specimens from Simon's Bay, South Africa (15-20 fathoms),
and from the E. of New Zealand (150 fathoms), differ from
