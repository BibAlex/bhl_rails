Branches of hydrosome 10 to .30 mm. long, slightly increasing
in width for the greater part of their length. Dorsal margin of
branch straight, thecal margin curved. Branches diverging usually
-at from 20° to 30o, but the angle sometimes greater in a small
variety. Thecae 11 or 12 in 1 cm., inclined at from 30^ to 50^,
four times as long as wide, free for nearly half their length. Aper-
tural margin normal to the axis of the branch, concave, with a
slightly mucronate denticle.
The description is drawn up from Victorian specimens. 1 have
previously recorded D. nn/rrhisoni from Basin Creek, (V)imadai,
but am of opinion that the single specimen on which the iec<»-d was
founded is D. hifidus, and that I have not seen D. miirrliiaoni .

Horizon. — Confined to the lowest zone of the Castlemainiaii and
uppermost zone of the Bendigonian.
