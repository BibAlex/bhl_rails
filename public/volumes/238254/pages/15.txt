6 E. C. Joshua :
There are five typical specimens of this species in the collec-
tion of the National Museum. Melbourne. They are presumed ta
have been collected in Victorian waters, but exactly when and
where is not indicated. Whitelegge (20) records the animal from
Port. Jackson, X.S.W.
COLOCHIRUS DOLIOLUM (Pallas).
For localities and synonymy, see
Erwe Willy (8).
Young specimens of this Colochirus are frequently found from
the shore down to al)Out five or ten fathoms. Tlieir spiculation
exactly agrees with the mature form, but the dark, brown, pig-
mented areas, which occur in the older animals, are only repre-
sented by very faint yellow bands, which rapidly lose their colour
in spirits.
GEXUS PSOLIDIUM.
PsoLiDiUM CONVERGENS Perrler.
1905. Perrier R. (18), Psolidium convergens.
Locality. — Flinders.
I secured three specimens of this apparently rare species at
Flinders; they agreed well with Perrier's description (18).
GENUS CAUDINA.
Caudina chilensis (J. Muller).
For synonymy, see
Clark (3).
Localities.— We^teA-u\)0\-t Bay, Mordialloc.
The above localities furnished two specimens which, though dif-
fering widely in appearance, I assign to this species. The larger,
picked up after a storm at Mordialloc, measures 100 x 40 mm. ;
.it tapers sharply posteriorly, but cannot be described as caudate,
colour yellow, blotched with brownish pink ; TJie spirules are inoi-e
massive than those typical of chil('>isi-'<. the lioles being smaller,
and the cross being frequently lost by fusion with the disc. The
whole ossicle seems to have undergone a process of hypertrophy.
The other specimen, from Westernport Bay. is fairly typical.
Some temptation existed to regard these two specimens as belong-
ing to distinct species, but fortunately the writer has recently
had an opportunity of examining a collection of over forty speci-
