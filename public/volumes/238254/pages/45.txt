figs. ia-f.
Ohservations. — The living species diffei-s from our fossil examples
in having the intersections of the angular excavations beset with
short, blunt spines. In the fossils the angular pittings are strongly
developed, and it may be surmised that the spines, if any existed,
were fine and have been abraded.
C. dasyderina has been recorded by its first describer from 20
widely separated localities, all of which sh(jw deposits of a more
or less deep sea nature.
Occurrence. — Bore 11. 552-554 feet; 554-556 feet (Janjukian).

Ohservations. — ^The fossil specimens exhibit the merest trace of
the posterior spines of the border sometimes seen in the living
examples. Recent specimens were dredgd from Port Jackson at 2
to 10 fathoms; and from Noumea, New Caledonia, 2 to 6 fathoms.
In the South Sea Islands it occurred between tide-marks.
Occurrence.— Bove 10, 160-186 feet; 225-230 feet (Kalimuan).

Ohservations. — -It will be seen on reference to the splendid series
of figures given by Dr. Brady that this species is very variable,
owing to the passage of the aculeated surface in the younger stages
into the strongly ribbed and excavated ornament of the older
stages. In the senile condition it somewhat resembles C . normani,
but the latter has a more olilifiuely truncated antero-dorsal angle.
