Altliougli the acid and staix-li solutions were mixed before add-
ing to the dia.stase, the concentrations of tannic acid were strong-
enough to cause a precipitate to form in the diastase solution.
(This Avas //of the case with taka diastase in Experiment 1.)
In 12 minutes the control a was well into the red, while the
olhe)-8 were all ))hR'. In 20 minutes d was beginning to show
traces of violet, the others being still l)lue.
The effect on saliva was parallel, a precipitate being formed br
.025% of tannic acid.
Experiment J/. (Tuljes each contained lO c.c. of mixture.)
This was done with weak taka diastase.

These were left in a water bath overnight. The temperature-
started at 40OC.. but fell to 36oC. during the night.
On te.sting, after 18.\ hours, the control a liad finished, d gare
a very slig\ht colour, r gave more colour (red), whilst h gave a
very red l)rown.
In this experiment, ctnicentrations of tannic aiid, which gave
an acceleration in the short expei-iments. heio gave a very definite
retardation.
The following experiments were done to determine whether this
retardation was due to actiiui (ni the ferment oi- on the starch.
