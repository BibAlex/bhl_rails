Examination of interior of Avstralite.
The australite was immersed in water in a watch glass, and
examined under the microscope.
On focusing beneath the surface of the australite, it was
noticed that the pits or bubbles were internal, as well as external,
and were in places arranged roughly in rings. A few still smaller
gas bubbles, with dark borders, were also noticed. The specimen
was entirely glassy and isotropic, except for slight evidence of
strain polarization.
Conclusion.
The three australites above described are remarkable, and I
think constitute more or less distinct types from any hitherto
described. The best and most complete reproduction of different
types of australites is given by Mr. E. J. Dunn,i and includes
button shaped, ellipsoidal. dumb-lDell shaped, and almost spherical
forms.
To these must now be added the " pine-seed " type, the " boat-
shaped " type, and the discoidal type.
The three specimens described are remarkable also for their small
dimensions and light weight. I believe the disc-shaped specimen
from the Stony Creek Basin in the Grampians is the smallest and
lightest australite hitherto described.
DESCRIPTION OF PLATE.
A is the pine-seed type of australite. (Nat. Miiseum collection).
B is the disc-shaped type of australite. (Geol. Dept. Univ. collec-
tion.
C is the boat-shaped type of australite. (Geol. Dept. Univ. col-
lection.
Below each australite is a drawing of a transverse section through
the australite, and a drawing of the upper surface, showing
the flange and peculiar distribution of grooves. Millimetre
and inch scales are shown.
