wise fairly smooth, excepting for a few striae pai'allel with tlie
ventral and anterior margins.
Dimetisiom. — Length, .6.*U mm. ; height, .:J4G mm. ; thickness of
carapace, .308 mm.
Affi/itfies. — The above species resemljles a weak form of Cytherura
ruditi, G. S. Brady, ^ that is, having minute pittings instead
of polygonal excavations, and without the faint flexuous ribs of that
species. The marked distinction of Ciiilwruni i)tnit'nen>si>i in having
a more rounded contour separates it from Brady's living species.
which came from the Arctic Seas and, doubtfully, from the Straits
of Magellan. Since Brady's recorded occurrence, ('. riulis has been
found by tjie writer in soundings from the Antarctic taken by
Capt. J. K. Davis in the " Nimrod " (British Antarctic Expedition,
1907-9). That specimen also showed a polygonal rather than the
punctate ornament of the present species.
Occurrence. — Bore 11, 267-270 feet (Janjukian).

Ohner vat ions. — Since the discovery of the originally described
specimens in the Batesford Limestone, this species has been found
in some abundance in the lower strata of the Mallee bores.
In the original description, I noticed the relationship of this-
form with Cytheropteron wellingtoniense, Brady. There is still
another species showing close affinities which occurs fossil in the
Cretaceous of Basdorf in Mecklenburg, namely, C. triangulares
Reuss sp.2, a species which also occurs in the Cainuzoic (London
Clay) of Copenhagen Fields and Piccadilly, London. This species
differs in having the alae less salient posteriorly, otherwise, as seen
in edge view, the two forms are very similar.
Occurrence.— Bovi^ 2, 211-240 feet (Janjukian). Bore 10, 310-
320 feet (Kalimnan or Janjukian). Bore 11, 438-440 feet; 440-442
feetj 442-444 feet; 444-446 feet; 457-458 feet; 5-18-550 feet (Jan-
jukian).
