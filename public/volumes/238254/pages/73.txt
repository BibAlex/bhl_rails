I have seen Imt few gonangia, and cannot say wliat may be tlie
extent of their lial)itual variation. Those whieh appeal' typical
somewhat resemble those of 0. (inr/ulata, but that species is readily
. distinguishable from the present by its smooth peduncles.

0. compressa has the hydrothecae of the same type as those nf
'0. caliculata, but they have the perisarcal thickening more pro-
nounced. Most obseT-vers figure thick-walled and thin-walled hydr
thecae, which are probably different aspects of the same individi;.:i
The chief distinction between this species and 0. caliculafa is in tht
peduncles. These in 0. calicitl(i1a> are twisted in a somewhat irre-
gular spiral; the undulations may fail here and there, but are
rarely a' sent altogethei'. In O. ronipresfia the stalks are iioich
stouter, with thicker walls, while they are never imdulated, though
they may be divided, especially near the hydrotheca, by several
distinct constrictions. Their thick perisarc appears nan-owed in at
the point of origin, so that their diameter at this point is little
more than that of the internal canal, and altogether they closely
resemble those of the genus Silicularia.
Various ft^rnis of gonangia have been figured, some cuni ,i
others m(n-e elongated; Clark describes them as "largest at h-
