Ohsercafivus. — This species is found in the living condition in
as widely separated areas as the West Indies and the Japanese
Sea. At Torres Strait it was found in 155 fathoms.
The fossil example here depicted differs in no essential details
from the valves of the living form.
Occurrence. — Bore 5. 163-175 feet (Kalimnan or Janjukian).

Ohserratioiis. — This species has been recorded in the living con-
dition from the West Indies; Wellington Harbour. New Zealand,
in the tow-net ; and from the mouth of Rio de la Plata. 13 fathoms.
Cytherella polifa is one of the best distributed of the cytherellids
in the Mallee washings. The fossil examples agree in practically
all points with the recent, with the exception that the former tend
to exhibit a broader antei'ior border.
Occurrence. — Bore 5, 153-175 feet (Kalimnan or Janjukian).
Bore 8, 210-219 feet (Kalimnan or Janjukian). Bore 9. 315-325
feet (Kalimnan or Janjukian). Bore 10, 160-186 tV>et ; 195-225
feet (Kalimnan). Bore 11, 457-458 feet; 546-548 feet (Janjukian).

Ohser rat ion s: .—'T\ie living examples were found at Port Jackson
at 2-10 fathoms; and off Ascension Island, 42 fatlioins. As in many
other instances in the Mallee fauna, this si)ecies has survived in
Australian waters fi'om Miocene times. The fossil examples are
identical in all points \\ith the type of the living form. '". pulchra
