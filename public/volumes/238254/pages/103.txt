The present paper contains the descriptions of some new species,
as well as of some that it seems advisable of re-figure. Most of
the specimens are from my own collection, others were collected by
the officers of the Department of Mines at localities on which I
have reported. Two fine specimens are the property of the National
Museum, Melbourne, and others were found by Mr. T. S. Hart, at
Daylesford.

The following description is drawn up from examples from Burn's
Reef, Ghewton : —
Branches diverging at 180°, so that even from the beginning
they are in the same straight line. Width over first theca 0.5 mm. ;
at 3 cm. L5 nun., the increase in width being gradual and con-
tinuous. Thecae 10 in 1 cm., inclined at 35° to 40o. Apertural
angle 100° to llOo. The gradual increase in the width of the
branches, and their lying in one straight line, aie very charac-
teristic of this species.
Horizon. — Castlemainian.

Branches diverging directly at 180^, somewhat lax, and perhaps
somewhat reclined. Width at fir.st theca 1 niiii.. at 4 cm. 1.3 nun.
