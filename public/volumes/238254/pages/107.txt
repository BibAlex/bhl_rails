GONIOGKAPTUS MACER T. S. Hall. (PI. XVII., Fig. 15).
(Geo/ Mag., i8gg, p. 449, ^figs. g, 10).
" Hydrosoine slender. Primary branches about 1 nun. in length,
;and forming an angle of 180° with each other. Secondary branches
diverging at about 90° from each other, and then bending in a
zig-zag manner at intervals of about 1.5 nun., and giving off ter-
tiary branches from the salient angle. Tertiary branches from
two to four in number. After giving off the final tertiary branches
.the secondary branches, as well as the tertiaries, may reach a
length of 30 to -40 mm., and are fairly rigid. Sicula about 1 mm.
in length, slender, and very slowly tapering. Thecae 8 or 9 in
10 mm., overlapping by half their length. Apertural margin
slightly concave, forming an angle of about IIQO with the axis of
the branch. Outer margin inclined at about 25° to the axis of the
branch, gently curving towards the distal extremity."
Horizon. — Rare in the Upper Bendigonian series, common in the
lower zones of the Castlemainian.
There is a fine slab in the collecticm of the Mining Department
(No. 9587), from Bendigo (71 Bo.), which shows about twenty
examples of the species. I give a new figure of the type.
GoNiOfjRAPTUS sPECiosus n. sp. (PI. XVIIL, and Text Fig. 1).
Hydrosome, when complete about 35 cm. in diameter, since the
distance from the sicular position to the extremity of the final
branch given off is 17.5 cm. United length of the primary branches
(" funicle "") is 3 mm. Length of longest branch measured (a
final branch) is 14.5 cm. The number of tei-tiary branches in the
Thecae ■< 7.
