Of the cicadas described beh)w. two belong to the distinc-
tively Australian genus Macrof ri stria ^ and come fi'oni Xoi'thern
Australia, having been given to nie by Mr. Chas. French, junr.
Government Entomologist. One of them is remarkable for its re-
semblance to Thopha Sessiliba, Dist. so closely resembling it in
general appearance that it might even be mistaken on a passing
glance. Tlie otlier is not remarkable in any way except for its
almost uniform chestnut colour. In this it resembles M. ingrnsig-
nata, Dist., but it is distinct from this species in its more .sessile
eyes, its nai'i'ower thorax, and the lack of the Ijlack basal area and
membrane to the tegmina. I have named it after Mr. Fiench. The
• other tAVo belong to the genus Psalfor/a. one of tliem cominir from
Lord Howe Island.
