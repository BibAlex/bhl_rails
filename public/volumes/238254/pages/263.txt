Introductory Note.
The series herein discussed comprises examples of cephalopod
shells, some of which have been in the collection for many years
In the case of the genus Nautilus the fossils are generally fragile, or
are only known as casts, so that it is often impossible to get quitf
perfect representatives which would serve as complete types. These
specimens, imperfect as they are, nevertheless afford many charac-
ters of differentiation which will serve to distinguish the several
forms; and, indeed, the only named Australian Tertiary species
of the genus Nautilus {N . geelongensis), was originally described
from an imperfect cast by Mr. A. H. Foord in his British Museum
Catalogue of Cei^halopoda. It seems, therefore, in the interests of
systematic work upon Victorian Tertiary fossils to place on record,
without further delay, some of the chief of our cephalopod fossils of
this latest geological era.
The present collection comprises the following forms : —
Aturia atistralis, McCoy.
Nautilus halcomhensis, sp. nov.
,, geelongensis, Foord.
,, altifrons, sp. nov.
felix, sp. nov.
Notosepia cliftoni, gen. et sp. nov.
