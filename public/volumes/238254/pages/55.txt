■Cythrropteron batesfokdiense, Chapman., var. aculeata, var. nov.
(Plate VIIL, Fig. 37).
Description. — This variety is sufficiently well marked to merit
a distinctive name, since it has a more compressed carapace, and a
sharp ventral margin. Towards the posterior extremity, the ven-
tral border carries a series of short, strong prickles. The related
Eiuopean cainozoic form, C . triangulare sometimes shows very fine
. aculeations on the ventral edge.
Occurrence. — Bore 11, 453-454 feet (Janjukian).
Cytheropteron postumbonatum, sp. nov. (Plate VITI., Figs. 38),
Description. — Carapace oblong, compressed at the extremities.
Seen from the side, the valveis tumid in the central area, depressed
around the margins; anterior extremity with a subangular margin,
posterior rounded; surface in anterior third swollen into a pear-
shaped inflation, behind which is a deep furrow joining the mar-
ginal depressed areas, whilst posteriorly the valve is again inflated,
and towards the ventral side this prominence is produced into a
short recurved hornlike process. Edge view subovate, compressed
at the ends, with the post-ventral process pointing outwards and
backwards.
Surface of valve ornamented with numerous obscure pittings and
fine parallel striae towards the dorsal margin.
Dimensions. — Length, .5 mm.; height, .21 mm.; thickness of
carapace, including the process, circ. .4 mm.
Affinities. — ^The appearance in the Australian Cainozoic of this
modification of a well-defined Cretaceous group of Cytheroptera is
extremely interesting. C. postiimhonatuw is most closely allied to C.
umbo7iatvm, Williamson sp.,i a well-known member of the English
Chalk and Chalk-mai-1 of Norwich, Woolwich, Dover and Charing.
The Danish and British variety, C. umhonatum, var. acauthoptera,
Marsson var. 2 from the Island of Riigen, Norfolk, Dunstable and
Antrim, is distinguished from the specific form in having a much
longer postero-ventral spine and a prickly rather than a punctate
