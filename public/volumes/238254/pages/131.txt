The Si/stems l-Pii^eiie-Cineol and d-Pinene-Gineol.
Of greater complexity is the case involving a partial replacement
of one of the terpenes by an oxygenated substance of allied struc-
ture. Cineol is such a substance, and with it the deviations from
the simple proportionately become noticeable.
These deviations, as in the case of the specific rotatory power,
may be due to a disturbance of the equilibrium, between active
and racemic terpene, brought about by the cineol, a possibility
supported by the fact that the refr activity is not affected.
It is in the density, however, that the divergences from the
simple proportionality become most marked, and here it can be
shown that the influence is molecular rather than structural, by the
fact, that when the theoretical densities .are calculated from the
molar fractions they again agree with the observed. In the simpler
case of d- and l-pinene the molar and weight fractions, of course,
coincide, since the two molecular weights are the same.
The cineol was obtained from Bosisto's 01. Eucalyptus B.P. by con-
version into the phosphoric acid compound and regeneration with
soda, after squeezing out the terpenes under pressure. The pro-
duct was then distilled with steam, and its constants were —
