380 H. R. Seddon:
Results : —
A, B, and C. agfj:lutinati(>ii and clearing.
D and E, agglutination.
F, slight agglutination.
G, H, J, and K, no agglutination.
Set lb.
Another ten tubes were put up similarly to above (8et la), but
with 0.1 CO. of emulsion (i.e., double quantity) added.
Results : —
A, agglutination and clearing.
No agglutination in other tubes.
Note: — In these two sets of tubes actual dihitlon of serum in
total fluid (neglecting the small amount added with the emulsion)
was the outstanding test.
Set Ha.
Serum and carbolised saline were placed in tubes as in Set 1. : —
A. B. C. 1). E. F. G. H. J. K.
Serum (1 in 50) - 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.25 c.c.
Carbolised saline - 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 1.25 1.5 20 2.5 1.75 c.c.
The bacterial emulsion was added to the whole of tlie fluid in
each tube (not to 1 c.c. of each dilution).
Emulsion added (0.05 c.c), and tubes incul)ated as in Set la.
Result :—
Agglutination and clearing in all tuljcs from .\ to J, in-
clusive.
No agglutination in K.
Set lib.
Tubes put up similarly to last set (Set 11a), l>ut wiih 0.1 c.c. of
emulsion (double (piantity) added.
Result : —
Agglutination and clearing in .\, l{, (', 1), and E.
No agglutination in other tubes.
The actual dilution of tlie serum in tliesf tulies, tlierefoi-e, is
the same in l«)th tests (Sets 1. and 11.), but tlie aitual (nnoiinf of
serum in each tube is not the same in coii-espoiidingly lettered
tubes in each test. (See Table 1.)
With each set, control tithes were put uj), containing (1) scrum
and saline, and (2) emulsion and saline.
