All these species come from Central Africa, and all belong to
the dominant African genus Platypleura. The first one, P. nir/ro-
marginata, is distinguished by its immensely dilated pronotal
angles, being allied to Butler's P. quadniticoUis, but differing in
the lighter colour of the liead and thorax, and the generally yellow
venation of wings and tegmina. It is also smaller than Butler's
species.
The second species, P. s/kiunha, is the smallest of this genus, I
think, so far recorded from Africa, It is a very distinct little
species, being placed in Distant's divison of the genus, in whicli tlie
tegmina and wings are wholly opaque. The only hyaline or trans-
parent portions are the first discoidal and a small spot in the
second discoidal areas, a postcostal spot in the radial area, a
fascia extending along the basal halves of apical areas, except the
■seventh, some minute spots at the extreme apices of these areas, and
the tegminal and wing margins. The general effect of the tegmina
is of a broad fuscous wing, with two transparent fasciae running
diagonally along the apical half.
The third species, P. longirostris, is closely allied to P. adouma,
Dist., but may be at once distinguished by the yellow colouration
of the wings. It somewhat resembles Walker's P. signifera,
but differs by the fact that its tegmina and wings have no
parent spots, and that the margins, whicli are very narrow, are
coloured right to the edge. The rostrum, also, is very much longei-.
The genus Platypleura, besides being widely distributed over
Africa, Asia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, lias Ijeen recorded by
Mr. W. W. Froggatt, from Northern Australia, a typical species
having been taken by Mr. J. 0. Tepper, and named after him.
