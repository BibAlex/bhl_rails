in moist air and examined by the members of thu committee. The
average temperature was IS^-lSo C. Dr. Rothera brought Graven-
stein apples for testing. I preferred Yates' Pippin, which is a
hard-fleshed, resistant apple, much less sensitive to poisons but
always unaffected by distilled water if properly prepared.
The results of the test are as follows : —
Series A. — Yates' Pippin.
Controls.
Di stilled water.
(1) No pits, browning or signs of poisoning on any of the pre-
pared spots.
(2) No pits, browning or signs of poisoning on any of the pre-
pared spots.
Copper Sulphate.
(3) 1 per 100,000. Well-defined brown pits 1-2 mm. deep on all
prepared spots.
Lead Nitrate.
(4) 1 per 100,000. Doubtful. i
Mercuric Chloride.
(5) 1 per 10,000. Large pits 1-3 mm. deep.
(6) 1 per 100,000. Small brown pits 1-2 mm. deep on all the
prepared spots.
(7) 1 per 1,000.000. Doul)tfnl.i
Series B. — All Gravenstein apples except in the case of 6 (b), 8 (b),
9 (b) and 10 (b). wliere Yates apples were used.
Coiitroh.
Distilled irater.
(1) No browning, pits or signs of poisoning on any of the pre-
pared spots.
(2) Light brown irregidar pits beneath three contiguous prepared
spots, possibly over a slightly bruised area, the other nine spots
quite unaffected.
1. I could see distinct signs of poisonin{f on these apples, but as Dr. Rothera could not, they
are given as doubtful. Lead nitrate rapidly destroys oxidase and penetrates slowly. Lead nitrate
pits are always pale, copper sulphate ones much dai-ker.
