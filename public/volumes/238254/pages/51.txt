Genus KRITHE, Brady, Crosskey and Robertson.
Krithe eggkki, sp. nov. (Plate VIII., Figs. 29a, b).
Description. — Valve, seen from the side, narrow, subreniform,
anterior extremity rounded, posterior bluntly pointed at the ven-
tral angle ; dorsal margin arched, ventral slightly sinuous. The
anterior margin is bordered by a flange of unusual width for this
genus. Surface minutely punctate. Edge view of carapace ovate,
compressed anteriorly, broad at hinder end.
Dimensions. — Length, .615 mm.; height, .27 mm.; thickness of
carapace, .27 mm.
Affinities. — This species is related to Krithe producta, G. S.
Brady,! but is much narrower, and has a conspicuous, flange-like-
anterior border.
Named in honour of Dr. J. G. Egger, who has already described
more than one new species of this genus.
Occurrence. — Bore 11, 260-265 feet (Kalimnan).

vol. i., pt. iii., p. 119, pi. xxviii., figs. 5«-/. ; pi. xxix.,
figs. ']a-d.
Ohser rat ions. — The " Challenger " recorded this species from-
Port Jackson, New Soutli Wales, at 2-10 fathoms, and from Booby
Island, Torres Strait, 6-8 fathoms. I have lately obtained it from
a sounding east of Tasmania, 777 fathoms, dredged by F.I.S.
" Endeavour."
Typical specimens occur in both Janjukian and Kalimnan strata
in the bores, showing the species to have been established in Aus-
tralian seas as eai-ly as the Miocene.
Occurrence. — Bore 7, 142 feet 3 inches-155 feet (Kalimnan).
Bore 10, 105-225 feet ; 225-230 feet (Kalimnan). Bore 11, 444-446
feet (Janjukian).
