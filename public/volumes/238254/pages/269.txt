Dimensions. — Approximate lengtli of type specimen (including
impression of the anterior part of the pro-ostraciim), i;^2 mm. ;
width of anterior extremity of pro-ostracum, 6-5 mm. ; thickness
of ventral lip of alveolus in tyjje specimen, 8 mm.; approximate
length of mucro, measured dorsally from the basal sinus at junc-
tion with the pro-ostracum, 13.5 mm. Distance from centre of
alveolus to edge of lip, 21.5 mm.
Relationships. — Piesumably on account of the thickened ventral
lip of the alveolar border, and the strong mucro, the present species
has been listed by some Australian authors in the genus Belosejv'a.
Although characters such as those mentioned, agree witli BeIo.'ie/>ifi.
yet the latter genus is distinct in several essential characters, and
these mav be tabulated as follows : —
Belosepia
Notosepia
Sepia
(Middle Eocene).
(Oligooene).
(Livii,.?).

straight.
It is especially noteworthy that young individuals of .Xotosepin,
in having a recurved mucro, point to the older Belosepia type of
shell; whilst the straight mucro of the adult form agrees more
nearly with that of the living Sepia, in which it is normally
straight, or only slightly l)ent.
Observations. — A large portion of the inner surface of the an-
terior region of the pro-ostracum in the type specimen, was for-
tunately preserved in collecting the specimen, and this materially
adds to our knowledge of the form of the complete sepion. The
pro-ostracum is thin and expanded, as in Sepia, and bordered by
a wrinkled sub-chitinous membrane.
