Victorian Fossils, Part XVII. 359
Practica,lly all the specimens of .V. cliftoni in the collection had
lain on the sea-bed for some considerable time before being
covered up, for the intei'ior of the pro-ostracum generally carries
attached organisms, as polyzoa and Dinii/o (right or attached
valves).
Occurrence and Horizon. — The type specimen was presented to
the Museum by Mr. F. P. Spry, and was collected by Mr. H. Lodge
at Clifton Bank, Muddy Creek, from the upper, broAvn polyzoal
marls of Balcombian age. It also occurs in the lower, blue marls
of the same series. There is a specimen in the Dennant coll., from
the same locality, and several examples in theMuseum coll., found
by the late Mr. W. Kershaw, at Balcombe Bay and Grice's Creek,
Port Phillip. These latter examples are of slightly thinner build,
indicative in all probability of their deeper water habitat, as
compai-ed with the deposits at Muddy Creek.
