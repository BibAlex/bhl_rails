NeiD and Rare Fossils. 35
Brady records this species from many localities, chiefly in deep
water, as in the West Indies, ofi Sydney, and Papua. Egger notes
it from Kerguelen Island, and Table Bay, S. Africa.
I have lately found this species in dredgings made by the F.I.S.
" Endeavour," from E. of Tasmania at 777 fathoms, and off South
Australia at 100 fathoms.
It is very interesting to note that this species is one of the most
abundant in the Mallee fossil material, as it is in many deep-Avater
dredgings at the present day. It is, moreover, an almost restricted
southern form. The Mallee specimens frequently have their valves
united, pointing to tranquillity of the water during the deposition
of the calcareous Miocene ooze.
Occurrence.— Bore 1, 215-244 feet (Janjukian). Bore 9, 256-263
feet; 315-325 feet (Kalimnan or Janjukian). Bore 10, 310-320
feet (Kalimnan or Janjukian). Bore 11, 219-260 feet; 260-265
feet (Kalimnan); 267-270 feet; 272-315 feet; 438-440 feet; 457-
458 feet (Janjukian).
Cythere flexicostata, sp. nov. (Plate VII., Figs. 14a, h).
Description. — Valve, seen from the side, elongate, pyriform;
broad anteriorly, with a deep flange-like border, highest in the
anterior third ; ventral and dorsal margins nearly parallel for some
distance, but tapering posteriorly to a blunt point; dorsal margin
convex, and interrupted by a short crest-like spine, ventral margin
straight; the posterior extremity is armed with a few ragged spines.
In edge view the valve is thickest in the posterior third, where it
terminates in a strong salient spine, falling abruptly and concavely
to the posterior, and gradually to the anterior, extremity. Surface
of valve ornamented with, six or seven longitudinal, sinuous costae,
which are more or less persistent from end to end of the valve;
they pass over the central boss or tubercle, and increase in strength
below and above the median area, being carried over on to the
anterior flange, and posteriorly take a sudden bend dorsally, pass-
ing steeply down to the blunt, spinous hind margin. Between
the costae there are faint pittings or excavations.
Dimensions. — Length of valve, .92 mm.; height, .44 mm.; thick-
ness of carapace, about .6 mm.
Observations. — So far as I can find, there is no described species
which shows a decided relationship to the above. Tlie general
form suggests a remote resemblance to the genus Bythocythere,
