3. Quantitative Factors in the Agglutination
Reaction.
(rt) Not simply a matter of dilution, but a quantitative reaction^
An unfortunate terminology has crept into descriptions of agglu-
tination methods — probably a relic from the descriptions of the
so-called Widal reactions with the serum of typhoid patients — in
which frequent use is made of the term " dilution," to express
the amounts of serum (or other diagnostic fluid) necessary to bring
about agglutination.
The following experiments show that the sensitiveness of the re-
action is to be measured by accurate determination of the minimal
quantity of serum employed; in other words, it is not simply a
matter of dilution, but a quantitative reaction.
Experiments. — To determine whether —
1. The relation of the quantity of pure serum to the quantity
of fluid in a tube (i.e., degree of dilution), or
2. The amount of pure serum in the tube,
is the determining factor in agglutination of a particular serum.
Serum collected from a cow thirteen days previously was used, a
basal dilution of 1 of serum to 49 of carbolised saline being made
(1 in 50).
The emulsion was standardised in accordance with the usual
method, and found to lie of a standard " 10 X."
Set la.
Ten tubes were put up, as follows : —
A. B. C. 0. K. F. G. H. J. K.
Serum (1 in 50) - 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.25 c.c.
Carbolised saline - 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 1.25 1.5 2.0 2.5 1.75 c.c.
Total volume - - 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 1.75 2.0 2.5 3.0 2.0 c.c.
Eelationship of serum
to fluid- - lin 50 75 100 125 150 175 2(X) 250 300 400
Of each of these dilutions 1 c.c. was put in a tube, and the tubes
similarly lettered so tliat the amounts of pure serum in these tubes
were : —

0.02 0.012 0.01 O.OOS O.OOG 0.0056 005 0.004 0.0(J3 0.0025 c.c.
Emulsion (0.05 c.c. Standard 10 X) was then added to each tube
and tlie tubes incubated till next day, when readings were taken.
