Parameter Values of Potential Tlieory : 1 69
Regarded, however, as a function of p, G(qp) is a double stratum
potential of moment XG{gB), together with potentials g{qp) and
— Q(gp). From the boundary properties of these we deduce
(16) ^G{gt + )={1 + \)G{gt) - XMi^t)
lG{qt ) = {l-\)G{qt)+XMqt)
Finally H{sp) regarded as a function of p is the sum of potentials
h{sp), —'P(sp)IXg, and a double stratum of moment X/I(s$). From
which it follows, in virtue of (14) that
(17) I H{st + ) = ( 1 + X)II{ St) - V{st)
il{{st-) = ( 1 -X)II(.st) + P{st)
§3. — Solution regular at a singular parameter value. — We are
now in a position to find solutions to the boundary problems (1),
with second members modified, having no singularities for the
characteristic number X^. If we define the functions W{p) and
V{p) Ijy
(18) ^w{p)=/i{d)H{ep)de
lv{p)=fG{pd)i{e)de
we find on suljstituting the values of H{Op) from (8) that W{p) is
the sum of potentials of double strata of moments f(;;), -/"f (^)P^0^^5
and X/'i{6)JI{6t)d6 respectively.
Hence we find that
h[W{t+) - ir(^-)] -u[ir(^+)+ w{t^)]
= i(t) -/i{e}F{et)dd + xfi {6)H{et) do
- xf{ f {(f>)h{(f>t) -ft {d)F(e(f>)h{cf>t)de + xfi{e)H{0(fi)h{(jit)de]dcf>
In virtue of (8) the second member disappears except for the first
two terms. So that W(p) satisfies the boundary condition.
(19a) i,[Wit+)- n'{t-)] - hx[ W{t+) + w{t-)]=f{t) -fi(e)F{dt)dd
In this all the function.s are regular when A=/\„ ; so that
this equation admits the solution W{p) which is regular even
when X is put e(|ual to the singular value A^. It has been shown
elsewhere^ tliat for this value of the parameter tlie first problem (1)
does not admit a solution by double stratum unless the condition
/f(^)P(^0^^ =
is satisfied, in whicli case the solution is obviously TI (/?).
Similarly substituting the value of G{pd) given by (8) we find
that V{p) is the sum of potentials of simple sti'ata of densities i{t),
-j"P{te)i{e)d6 and X/H(te)i (0)dO. From the boundary pro-
perties of simple strata it follows that
= i{t) -f P{td)i{e)de-\-xfH{te) f {e)de
- xf/i{tcf>) [f (<^) -/'P{ci>e)t(6)dd+x/Ji(<fiO)i{0)dO]d<f>
