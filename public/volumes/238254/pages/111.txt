TKTIlAaHAPTllS VVrnTKLAWl H. .sp. (PI. XVII., Fig. ]G).
Hydrosome slender. Primary branches at 180°, dividing at the
fifth theca. Length of branch, about 4.5 mm. Secondaries diverg-
ing at 90°, faii-ly rigid. Width of Itranclies nearly 0.5 mm. Sicula
long and narrow, length 1 mm., ])readth 0.2 mm. Thecae 10 in
1 cm., indenting the branch about half its width, inclined at 15^,
very slightly expanding. Apertui'e normal to the axis of the theca.
The great length of the " funicle,'' slightly over 1 cm., and the
slender nature of the branches are well marked cliaracters.

MONOURAPTUS APLINI n. sp, (PI. XV II., Fig. 17).
Very minute, curved towards the ventral side. The most com-
plete specimens from an open U-shaped figure. Thecae 18-20 in
10 mm. ; apparently coiled in a rounded mass and i^pening later-
ally. Sicula about 1 ram. long and narrow.
This is tlie commonest graptolite in the beds just below the
Keilor bridge. The section was discovered by Aplin in 1854. and
was the first known graptolite locality in Australia. Unfortunately,
the fauna is in a very bad state of preservation, or sixty years
would not have elapsed before any species were described from the
locality.
M. aplini is closely allied to M. exigaits, Nicholson, and .1/.
nodifer, Tornquist, but its minute size separates it from them.
Locality. — Keilor, Aplin 's section.
Horizon. — Silurian, Melbournian.

The conical spiral foi'm. and the produced aperturjvl angle of
this species are unmistakable. The only two specimens I liave seen
are on the same slab, and are those figured. The specimens are
