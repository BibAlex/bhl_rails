iilKnit huiufral anglo (but still smaller than the spines of the other
i-o\vs). spinose, l)ecoming smaller posteriorly and passing into mere
granules. Sides with the upper three interstices distinctly granu-
late. Beneath subglabrous, with small, setigerous punctures; fifth
segment more strongly convex than the others. Legs simple, tibiae
not notched, tarsi spongiose beneath.
2 Of more ovate form; with elytral tubercles smaller, those of the
first row more numerous, and the anterior ones reduced to mere
granules; apical ventral segment with a strongly raised rounded
prominence, highest in middle, but occupying nearly the whole
segment.
Dimensions. â€” <? 15 x 5.5 mm. ; 2 16x7 nan.
Specimens of this species, taken by Mr. T. G. Sloane at Portland,
Victoria, in 1887. have been long in my collection, and lately Mr.
J. E. Dixon has forwarded me a long series (48) from the same
locality. Though variable to a slight extent in size, there is little
other difference to be detected in the series. The crest over the
eye at first sight appears single, but I believe it is really composed
of two conjoined tubercles; the species being therefore related to Ac.
Adelaidae and Ac. approximatxis.
It differs from all of this group in the relatively narrower pro-
thorax, and in the more numerous and more closely set elytral
tubercles.
