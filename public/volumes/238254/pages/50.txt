rence in the fossil state.
C. scintillulata was dredged in the Straits of Magellan by the
■" Challenger," at 55 fathoms.

Observations. — A single specimen of this form, typical in neaily
;all its characters with the recent form, but not so spinous at the
■extremities, and with more parallel sides, occurs in the Janjukian
•(Miocene) of the Mallee bores.
The " Challenger " obtained it from Heard Island and Kerguelen
Island in the Southern Ocean, and in Torres Strait. Egger's
■" Gazelle " specimens came from the west coast of Africa.
