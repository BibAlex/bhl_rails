but the well-marked anterior border and position of the spines aiii.
tubercle suggest an affinity with forms like C>/fhere rastromar-
ginata.

Ohservations. — The present fossil occurrences show this com-
paratively rare form to have existed as early as the Miocene. Our
specimen matches exactly that figured by Dr. Brady from an Aus-
tralian sounding at 17 fathoms.
Occurrence. — Bore 10, 310-320 feet (Kalimnan or Janjukian).
Bore 11, 562-564 feet (Janjukian).
Cythere lepralioides, G. S. Brady. (Plate VII., Fig. 16).
(Jythere lejrralioides, G. S. Brady, 1880, Rep. Chall. Zool.,
vol. i., pt. iii., p. 94, pi. xix., figs. ba-d.
Ohservations. — The Mallee specimeils came from a Kalimnan
horizon (Lower Pliocene). They are fairly typical as compared
with the living form, the specimen here figured being a somewhat
extreme variety with an unusually broad posterior extremity.
Brady records this species from two localities only, viz., Simon's
Bay, S. Africa (15-20 fathoms), and off the Cape of Good Hope
(150 fathoms). I have lately determined this species from " En-
deavour " d'redgings taken east of Tasmania at the exceptional
depth of 1122 fathoms.
Occurrence. — Bore 6, 114-150 feet (Kalimnan). Bore 8, 210-219
feet (Kalimnan or Janjukian). Bore 10, 195-225 feet (Kalimnan).
Cythere lubbockiana, G. S. Brady. (Plate VIT., Fig. 17).
Gi/there lubbockiana, G. S. Brady, 1880, Rep. Chall Zool..
vol. i., pt. iii., p. 68, pi. xiv., figs. 6a-d.
Obserraf/ons. — This is a shallow water species in modern de-
posits, being recorded by Dr. Brady from Booby Island, in 6-8
fathoms.
It occurs in the Mallee bore at a distinctly Janjukian (Miocene)
horizon, as well as in samples which have a mixed Janjukian and
Kalimnan (Lower Pliocene) fauna.
