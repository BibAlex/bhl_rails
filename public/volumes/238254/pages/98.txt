AND

[Eead July 9th, 1914].
In this paper we have added 21 more species to the catalogue,
including two neAv genera, namely, Cithna and Foramelina. and
the total number catalogued now reaches 1052.
We have continued to use the generic names previously adopted,
as, although alterations have been made and suggested by various
writers, we defer making changes until a pronouncement has been
anade by recognised authority as to the validity of the alterations.
