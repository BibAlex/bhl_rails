For several years I have been studying the geographical distri-
bution of the Marine Flowering Plants, as it seemed to me that it
miglit have some general value hoth from a phylogenetic and a
geological point of view.
We owe most of our kiiowledge on these plants to the late P.
Ascherson, who, during a series of years, contributed to their
study, and A\as much interested in their geographical distribution.
Some considerations will show why I think this phytogeographical
study may be of more general interest.
The marine flowering plants — or sea-grasses — belong to two
monocotyledonous families — viz.. Hydrocharitaceae and Potamo-
(jetonaceae, Iwth of which are included in the cohort Helohime.
Tliis cohort consists of several families, nearly all of which are
water-plants (or swamp-plants). They are very distinct from the
other monocotyledons, and undoubtedly represent old types.
Sometimes it has been urged that from this cohort most of the
othei- Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons have originated. Be that
as it may, the Helobieae fni'm an especially well-marked group
within which the families show a progi'ession from types with
many fi'ee superior carpels to otheis with one syucarpous infei'ior
ovary. In all the families, genera witli one or a few species pre-
vail, and within the whole cohort only one genns. Potamogeton (the
Pondwoed). is really rich in species. It seems as if, in most cases,
the developing power of the genera has been checked.
The sea-grasses belong to —
(1.) 3 genera of Hydrocharitaceae — viz.: Halophila, Enhalus
And Thulassia, all widelv different from one another: and to
