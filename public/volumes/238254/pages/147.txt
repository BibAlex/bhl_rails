ii. If p is a point of the iuiier region, </ of the outer, and t a
point on the boundary.
(24) (1+A)G(;.^)=(1-X)G(^/.)
G(tp) = {l-\-X)G{pt)
G{t^)={l-k)Q{^t)
From (23) and (6) we deduce immediately that if p and q are
both in the same region, or both on the boundary,
(25) ( Q{p^) = QU/p)
If, however, p and ^ are in the inner and outer regions respectively,
we find on substituting from (G) in the first of (24), multiplying by
Aq— A and putting A=:Ao
(26) ^{\+X,)Q(p^) = {l-X,)q{^p)
I (1+a)6'(m)=(1 -^)G(^p)+j^^-Q(n')
Similarly from the second and third of (24) we find
(27) ( Q{tp) = (l+X,)Q(pf,)
I Q(^.;)==(l-A„)Q(./0
and thence
(28) S 0{fp) = {\ +X)G(pt)-X,q(pt)
( G{t^) = {l-k)G{^/t)+X,Q{^/t)
II. — The ordinary pofeiti led.
§6. — Integral Relatione. — The preceding properties are common
to ordinary and generalised potentials. We know, however, that
while the values A:= + l, Avhich correspond to the problems for the
inner and outer regions separately, may both be characteristic
numbers for the ordinary potential, they are nofl singiilar for the
generalised. The properties arising from the existence of these
poles are then peculiar to the ordinary potential. Other special
relations arise from the fact that foi' this potential the function
h(tp) satisfies ihe integral relation2
(29) /h{tp)dt=2, 1, or
according as p is within the closed surface, on the l)oundary or
outside, and the integration is extended over the boundary. W©
shall find furthci- on a cori-esponding formula for the generalised
potential from which tliis may be deduced by putting A;=0.
Let us suppose that tiie boundary consists of m independent
surfaces each possessing at every ])oint a definite tangent plane
and two definite principal radii of curvature. The value A=l
