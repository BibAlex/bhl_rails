Conclusio/is to be drawn from ((bore.
1.— Using the same quantity of emulsion in eacli tube, tube^
2^ossessurg the same ddvtion {but different quantities) of serum do
uot furnish parallel results. (Compare Set la. with Set Ila., Set
lb. and Set lib., etc.)
2. — Using the same quantity of emulsion in each tube, tubes
containing/ the same qtiantit/j of serum do furnish parallel results.
3. — The agglutination titre varies with the quantity of emul-
sion used, for, as is evident in the table (I.) — -
(a) With 0.05 c.c. of concentrated emulsion (10 X), the
minimum amount of this serum which will produce
agglutination is 0.006 c.c.
(b) Witli 0.1 c.c. of concentrated emulsion (10 X), the mini-
mum quantity of serum required is 0.02 c.c.
Experiments were then carried out to test the effect of dilution
on an agglutination system.
Tubes were put up, containing : —

Test 1. — Volume of fluid in each tube made up with carbolised
saline to 1 c.c.
Test 2. — Volume of fluid in each tube made up to 2.5 c.c.
Results, both tests : —
A and B, agglutination and clearing.
C, agglutination.
D, no agglutination.
Test 3. — A tube was put up, containing 0.02 c.c. pure serum
and 0.05 c.c. emulsion (10 X), and carbolised saline added tip to
20 c.c.
Result : — Agglutination.
These tests show that the dominating factor is the quantity of
serum in each tube, and not the degree of dilution. Of course, if
equal quantities of each dilution be taken for testing, the quantity
of serum in the tube will vary as the dilution (as is shoAvn in Set
la.). On the other hand, in the practical application of the agglu-
tination test the important figure is what may be termed the " end-
point " — i.e., the smallest quantity of serum which will produce
agglutination witli n standard quantity of emulsion. The neces-
sity, therefore, arises for taking for all tests an exactly similar
