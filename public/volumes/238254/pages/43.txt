'S'Z Fredericl' C/uipmau. :
Bosquet's Cretaceous fossils in having the carapace liigher in pro-
portion to the length, and in having a more acute posterior
angle. Bosquet remarks in his description^ that the valves are-
obliquely oval and rounded at the two extremities. The feature of
a sub-acute posterior angle is so constant in both the Cainozoic
and living Australian examples that it necessitates a separation of
these forms from the Cretaceous specimens.- They may, therefore.
appropriately bear the name Bairdio australis.
The earlier record of the above spec-ies as a fossil is by G. S.
Brady (in R. Etheridge, as B. orafa. Brady). It came from the
Kalimnan deposits (Lower Pliocene) of the Murray River Flats,
South Australia.
In the Mallee Bores the above species was obtained from both
Janjukian (Miocene) and Kalimnan beds. They are all isolated
valves, and thus similar to the living examples dredged by tlie
" Challenger."
Occurrence. — Bore 9, 256-263 feet (Kalimnan or Janjukian).
Bore 11, 260-265 feet (Kalimnan). 540-542 feet; 542-544 feet:.
548-550 feet; 552-554 feet; 554-556 feet (Janjukian).

Observations. — This distinct little species has had a world-wide
distribution from Miocene times to the present day. Reuss-
described it from the Cainozoics of Bohenua, Austria (Miocene),
