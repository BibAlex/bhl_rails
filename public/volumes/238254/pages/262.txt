Bittrr Pit. 349
made over slightly bruised areas, which will subsequently give an
imitation of irregular pit formation. It was owing to the occa-
sional unreliability of the controls that I abandoned in my first
paper the use of pale-skinned, soft-fleshed apples. Even in sucli
■cases, however, an element of doubt only creeps in in determining
the lowest limits of the poisonous concentrations. In the stronger
solutions every prepared spot shows a brown pit whicli has a well-
defined area centric to the prepared spot, and does not spread
beyond a sharp boundai'v zone. If when using a soft-fleshed or
pale-skinned apple, an occasional prepared spot on the control
develops an apparent " poison " pit; this is usually a pale colour.
If it is due to a bruise it will be irregular and not centric around
the spot. If it is due to too deep a cut admitting micro-organisms
it will slowly develop further in moist air, but the other prepared
spots will be unaffected. If it is due to an invasion of fungal
hypae, it will spread rapidly through the whole apple and the pulp
will become soft and watery.
I might perhaps add that if red-skinned, hard-fleshed apples are
used, this method forms the best possible class experiment to
demonstrate —
(a) the indifference of the plant-cell to distilled Avater ;
(b) the importance of the cuticle;
(c) the extreme sensitivity of the pulp cells to metallic poisons.
For class experiments the best solutions to use are 1 gram per
100,000 of mercuric chloride or copper sulphate, and the method
can be used to some extent to test the freedom of distilled water from
small amounts of soluble metallic poisons.
