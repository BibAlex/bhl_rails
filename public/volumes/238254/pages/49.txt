Observations. ^T\\e " Challenger " examples came from Bass
Strait, and off Honolulu. Egger obtained it between Fiji and
Samoa, and from the Western Australian coast.
This is its first occurrence in the fossil state. It occurs in the
bores in the Kalimnan (Lower Pliocene) strata, or even below that
series. Like several other species of ostracoda occurring in these
borings, the form persists in the present Bass Strait fauna, not
many miles removed from the site of the old Murray Gulf.
Occurrence. — Bore 8, 210-219 feet (Kalimnan or Janjukian).
Bore 11, 170-175 feet; 199-209 feet; 219-260 feet (Kalimnan).
Cythere scabrocuneata, G. S. Brady. (Plate VIII., Fig. 25).

Observations. — The figured specimen is a ([uadrate and coarsely
papillate variety of the above species, but it is impossible' to
separate it from its associated typical examples from the same
series, some of which are identical with the living forms. This is
another species still living in Bass Strait, having remained per-
sistent in nearly the same area from Janjukian (Miocene) times. It
has also been recorded from recent dredgings in the Inland Sea,
Japan, and in Wellington Harbour, New Zeal-and.

446-448 feet; 457-458 feet; 544-546 feet; 552-554 feet (Janjukian).
