were put in being 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, O.G, 0.8, and 1 c.c. respectively.
Similarly in regard to the serum — for those tubes shown as con-
taining 0.04 c.c. of serum and over, the basal dilution of 1 in 5
was used, the quantities of this that were put in being 0.2, 0.4,
0.6, 0.8, and 1 c.c. respectively; for those tubes shown as contain-
ing from 0.002 to 0.02 c.c. of seium a basal dilution of 1 in 50'
was used, the quantities being 0.1, 0.2, O.G, 0.8, and 1 c.c. respec-
tively; for those tubes shown as containing less than 0.002 c.c. of
serum, a basal dilution of 1 in 600 was used, the quantities of this
that Avere put in being 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 c.c. respectively.
In each tube the total quantity of fluid was made up to (approxi-
mately) 2 c.c. Control tubes were put up, (1) of serum, and (2)
of emulsion, and in each case remained unchanged.
These tests show that the cjuantities of emulsion and of serum
combining to produce agglutination bear a direct relationship to
one another. The result is particularly striking if one takes the
extreme results (" the agglutination and clearing," end-point,
shown by -H +), which are found to form a straight line when
plotted as a graph.
It will also be noted that this arrangement is kept up over the
whole length of the series.
One further point is evident from this table (Table 2) — namely,
that there is a partial inhil)itioii with certain proportions of emul-
sion and serum, as may be seen from looking at the tubes contain-
ing :—
2 c.c. emulsion and 0.2 c.c. serum;
1 c.c. emulsion, and 0.2, 0.16, and 0.12 c.c. serum;
0.8 c.c. enmlsion, and 0.2, 0.16, 0.12, and 0.08 c.c. serum;
0.6 c.c. emulsion, and 0.12, 0.08, and 0.04 c.c. serum;
0.4 c.c. emulsion, and 0.08 and 0.04 c.c. serum;
And 0.2 c.c. emulsion, and 0.04 c.c. serum. i
Comparing these with tubes lower down in the same column
where the amount of serum is less, we find that where the smaller
quantities of serum are used there is again complete agglutination
and clearing. Further, where larger quantities of serum are used,
there is also agglutination and clearing, the inhibition thus being
apparently zonary. This is well seen in the columns of tubes con-
taining — 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2 of enmlsion.
Further, in the table, this zone of inhibition is found to lie
approximately parallel to the agglutination end-point; it seems,
1 An enclosing line is used in the table to make these tubes more evident.
