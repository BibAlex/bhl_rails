Section No. HlOl, one mile S.W. of Muroondah Weir. — Sharp
rhombs of dolomite occur in places, associated with secondary
quartz and iron oxides. Microscopic veinlets of banded silica and
carbonates intersect the rock.
Fragmental rocks, tuffs and flinty breccias whose fragmental
character is only revealed on weathering, also occur to the south
and south-west of Mount St. Leonard.
E . — Rhyoliies.
With the single exception of Professor Skeats' reference to quartz
l^orphyries and porphyrites occurring near Narbethong and MaryB-
ville, there is no mention, in the literature of the area, of extrusive
rocks more acid than the dacites. However, at Archer's Look-out,
St. Ronan's Well, near Lindt's Hermitage, the Acheron river
above St. Fillan's, and at several other points north of the main
divide, normal rhyolites outcrop. These rocks are characterised in
hand specimens by abundant quartz phenocrysts, and by the paucity
of femic minerals. Rhomb-shaped sections of glassy or pearly ortho-
clase can be recognised in nearly all hand specimens of these rocks.
Fluxion banding is often well developed. A chemical analysis of
the rhyolite from Archer's Look-out was made by the writer in the
geo-chemical laboratory of the Royal College of Science, London^
