Introduction.
During a visit to the Grampians in February, 1913, in conn-
pany with Mr. W. H. Ferguson, of the Geological Survey, I paid
a visit to the Stony Creek basin, near Hall's gap, from which
a considerable quantity of alluvial gold has been obtained. From
the gold-bearing gravels and sands a large number of australites
has been found from time to time. The gravels are quite shal-
low, and I understand that some of the australites have been
obtained from a depth of a few feet below the surface. I was
not successful in my search, but Mr. Charles D'Alton. of Hall's
Gap, showed me some which he had found, and generously pre-
sented to me for the Geological Museum of the University, two
small forms, of remarkable character.
Last Aveek Professoi- Baldwin Spencer, C.M.G.. F.R.S.. Director
of the National Museum, showed me another remarkable form
of australite, from Western Victoria, recently presented to the
National Museum by Mr. H. Quiney.
Professor Spencer kindly allowed me to describe this specimen,
with the tAVo presented to me by IMr. D'Alton.
