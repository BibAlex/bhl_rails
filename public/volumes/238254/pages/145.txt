In virtue of (7) and (8) the second member reduces to the first two-
terms; so tliat V(p) satisfies the boundary problem.
All the functions involved are regular for the singular value X = Ao,
so that F(/j) is the solution of the problem (19b) regular even when
X is equal to this singular value. The problem (lb) does not
admit a solution by simple stratum only, Avhen X=Ap, unless the
condition
/F{te)i{e)d$=:0
is satisfied, in which case the required solution is obviously V(p),
Tlie problems (19), derived from (1) by altering the second member,
we shall speak of as the modified problem for the singular value Ao-
The functions H(t-p) and G{2)t) bear the same relation to the solution
of the modified problems that 'H.(fp) and G{pf) bear to the original
problems (1).
iil. — Expansions. — From the formulae (8) and (18) we may ob-
tain, by the method of successive approximations, expansions for
the various functions in ascending powers of X. These are cer-
tainly true for | X | < 1, and in particular cases even for jXl^l.
For the present we shall assume that the absolute value of X is less
than unity.
Thus from (8) in virute of (7) we find
(20) [H{ts)=^[]i{ts) - IP(^«)] +x[a,(<s) - \-;P{ts)]
G{ps)=[g{ps) -q{ps)-\ + x]^l,{ps)- ^ q{ps)\
+ >^'[0.{ps) -\.^{Vs]+ ••••
where the suflixes denote functions formed by successive operations
h,{ts) = /h{t6)h{es)de,
h.lts)=/K{te)h{es)dd, etc.
and
g,{ps)=/c,(j^e)h{e.)d6,
r,.Xps)=/g,{p$)Hes)de, etc.
If Ave extend the notation and repbue •>-• by any point p we may
write
h^(t/>)=/ h(te)h(ep)d6,
h,,{fp)=/hn^,{fe)/i{ep)de, etc.
