Specific gravity at loo C. =0.8783.
Rotation ajj = — 3.20.
Refractive index at 15o C. = 1.4680.
Between 215° and 285o only 1 per cent, came over, leaving no
less than 16 per cent, in the still, boiling above the latter tempera-
ture. This residue contained some paraffin, the remainder con-
sisting, perhaps, largely of polyterpenes.
A portion of the crude oil was distilled to 190oC., and the
Eucalyptol 'determined in this by the resorcinol method. The
result showed 10.2 per cent, of Eucalyptol to be present in the crude
oil.
