Observations. — By comparing the Mallee specimens with many
other complete examples from Victoria, so far as regards the
parietes and in one instance where the opercnlar plates have been
preserved, one is enabled to draw some satisfactory conclusions as to
the identity of the very abundant remains of ])arnacles in the
lH)rings. The compartments are all separate, excepting one
instance, "which is here figured. Like the preceding species, this
form also occurs in the Patagonian Tertiaries at San Julian, and
the scutum tlierein found (loc. cit., fig. 'M) is comparable with a
specimen lately worked out of a fossil barnacle from Beaumaris,
wliich I refer to the above species.
At first sight one would be inclined to place the fossil forms in the
genus Chthamalus, as was done in the Dennant collection, but bear-
ing in mind the distinctive features of the two genera, which have
reversed characters as to disposition of alae and radii, the rostrum
of Balanus posse.ssing radii and not alae as in Chthamalus, as
Darwin pointed out, the separation is at once easily made.
All the Mallee examples have the walls of the parietes strongly
folded, but some specimens from Ascot, western Victoria, in the
Dennant collection, identified as Chthamalus sfellatus, have nearly
smooth parietes.
The separated compartments of this species of Balanus are common
in many of the bores, and seem to make their appearance at the
top of the Janjukian, where, in Bore 9 at 315-325 feet, they are
exceedingly conmion.
Occurrence. — Bore 6, 114-150 feet (Kalimnan); 158-161 feet
(Kalimnan or Janjukian). Bore 8, 165-180 feet; 180-199 feet; 204-
210 feet (Kalimnan or Janjukian). Bore 9, 254-256 feet (Kalim-
nan); 256-263 feet; 315-325 feet (Kalimnan or Janjukian). Bore
10, 254-296 feet; 310-320 feet (Janjukian). Bore 11, 197-199 feet;
199-209 feet (Kalimnan).
