Four Tables have been compiled by the writer, showing : —
Table I.— Verbal Suffixes

Table III.— Passive Suffixes
Table IV.— Adjectival Suffixes I
After each Table instances are given of words which show tlu
presence of such Suffixes witli remarks thereupon, and such con-
clusions are drawn as seem to be warranted by the evidence adduced.
2.— Object of the Enquiry.
(a) To collect instances of Verbal and Noun Suffixes occurring
in languages where their presence has not been recognised hitherto,
(b) To form a theory that will give a satisfactory explanation of
the formation of the Gerundives and of the Passive Suffixes in
Polynesian.
Note. — n is sounded as ng in singer. Abbreviations : v. — verb;
v.i. — verb intransitive; v.t. — verb transitive; adj. — adjective; n—
