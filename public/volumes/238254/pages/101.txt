Hah.— Vovtsea, Port Phillip.
Observation. — Size of type: Length, 9; latitude, 5; altitude, 2'
mm. Tate and May place this as a synonym of M. niyrita,
Sowerby, a species that it strongly resembles, but it may be dis-
tinguished therefrom by its much finer sculpture, the undulating
outline of the outer edge, and it is usually marked by "two red
lines on the back forming a cross." We therefore consider it
worthy of rank as a species.
M. nigrita, was well known to Mi-. Beddonie. We have an ex-
tensive series from other States, and have no difTiculty in separating
it from M. crucis.
