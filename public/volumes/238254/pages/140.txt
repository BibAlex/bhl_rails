1. The influence of temperatuie change on tlie density, refrac-
tive index, and rotation of a nunil)er of terpenes and allied sub-
stances has been studied.
2. In the cases of density and refractive index the temperature
coefficients all lie close together, while the divergences from a linear
relation are slight.
3. Laevo-phellandrene, as obtained from the oil of Eucalyptus
dives, is in all its relations somewhat abnormal, and the suggestion
is made that it may form associated molecules at the lower tempera-
tures.
The thanks of the author are due to Dr. Heber Green for the
interest he has shown in this research.
