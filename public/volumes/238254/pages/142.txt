Pdva/meter Values of Potential Theory. 165
Pleiuelj's work' is (.(HitiiitMl to the ordinary potential and deals
chiefly with the pole \=+l. The present paper extends the in-
vestigation to the generalised potential, and also to the general
pole Ao. For this charaeteristic number, which may be any what-
ever, more general relations are established connecting the resi-
dues and the functions H{tj)) and G(pq), which correspond to the
modified problems. The boundary discontinuities of these func-
tions and their derivatives are investigated, and also certain
theorems of reciprocity. Expansions for the various functions are
found as power series in the parameter A.
In the tirst part of the paper the investigation applies to the
ordinary and generalised potentials alike. In the second part
the ordinary potential is considered separately, and results pecu-
liar to Laplace's equation are obtained which depend either upon
the fact that A=±l are here characteristic numbers, or upon the
special value of the integral of h(tp) extended ovei- the boundary.
Values for the boundary integrals of the different functions are
investigated. Further from the convergence of the above expan-
sions when |Al = l a value is deduced for the conductoi' potential.
It will also be shoAvn that the solutions of thti second boundary
problem for the inner and outer regions ai'e expressible in terms
of a single function.
Finally the case of the generalised potential is considered
separately. The value is found of the integral of Ii(tp) extended
over the boundary, in terms of the potential of a space distribu-
tion of matter. Further relations are found connecting the boun-
dary integrals of the other functions involved.
