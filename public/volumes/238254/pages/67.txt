Trophosonie consisting of smooth or undvilated peduncles of vary-
ing length, springing from a creeping hydiorhiza, and supporting
each a single hydrotheca; hydrothecae campanulate. with the lower
part compressed, but usually circular above, the perisarc vaiying
much in thickness, but always greatly thickened inwards near the
base so as to form a " floor " on which the hydranth is supported;
hydranth radially symmetrical, with al)out 24-32 tentacles and a
large tiumpet-shaped hypostome.
Gonothecae very variable in form within the limits of a species;
gonozooid a modified medusa^ having neither tentacles nor diges-
tivH cavity, l)ut provided with four branched radial canals, and
sometimes with marginal sense-organs.
The sub-genus Orthopiixls, w^hich was proposed by Agassiz for
the reception of the single species Ciytia {Orthopyxis) poteritim (a
species Avhich had already been described by Hincks under the name
of Campminlaria c(dicidnta), has been disi-egarded by later ob-
servers, most of whom have been content to rank the species under
Ciytia or Campnnularia.
In l.'^S.'? Von Lendenfeld desci-ibed as the type of a new genus
and family a species which he called Evcopella campanrdaria, and
which, he claimed, was distinguished from all previously known
hydroids by the possession of a gonozooid medusoid in character
but totally destitute of manubrium and tentacles. Aliliongh re-
ferring to Agassiz' work he failed to notice that the characters on
which he based his new genus were precisely those of the forii)
desci-ibed in great detail by the Ameriian luitiii alist.
