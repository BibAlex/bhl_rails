Levinseii leiuarks that the sub-marginal V>and is douljtless due to
a regeneration; tlie fact, however, that it is always present, and is
constant in its position, seems in itself sufficient to negative that
view. It is. like the marginal liand. a thickened ridge surround-
ing the hydrotheca internally, and it not iinconnnonly corresponds
to a slight external constriction. It varies in the extent to which
it is thickened. Ijeing sometimes feebly developed, especially in the
newly-formed hydrothecae; and in any case, it is somewhat less
robust than the border-thickening, at least in the vicinity of the fotir
marginal points. The marginal band is at least as strongly ma)-kcd
at these points as elsewhere, the secondary band does not usually
form pionounced points like the marginal one, but is more bluntly
rounded at those positions.
The hydrotheca is without a fully-developed diaphragm. l)ut there
is an internal perisarcal ring just above the base. Higher up there
is a zone of thinly scattered bright points.
