The method of integral equations has been successfully applied
to the boundary problems requiring the determination of poten-
tials, Vs{p) and \(p) satisfying the boundary relations^ —

respectively, whether the potentials are ordinary2 corresponding to
Laplace's equation, or " generalised " corresponding to the equa-
tion —
(•2) v-'U-FU =
The latter potential I have considered in a paper^ recently com-
municated to the Quartei-ly Journal. It is shewn that solutions to
the problems can be uniijuely determined, except for certain singu-
lar values of the parameter, in the form of potentials of double and
simple strata respectively, given by'* —

\ Y{'p)=/(A{pt)t{t)dt.
At a singular i^a'-ivnietei' value A,,, however, the solutions become
intinite, since each of thy functions ii(fp) and (^{pt) has a simple
pole, unless certain conditions are satished. It will be sliewn that
the parts H{tp) and (T{pt) of these functions remaining finite at the
pole Ay, form tlie corresponding functions for the solutions at this
pole of the problems (1), which, however, must be modified"' in their
second members. The residues P(^//) and <.}(pf) of B.{t p) and G:{pt)
respectively, also play an important part in the following argu-
ment.
