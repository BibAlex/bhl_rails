The deposit following agglutination sliovild l^e siich that it can
be easily distinguished l)y the naked eye, even though, as is fre-
quently tlie case, the whole of the organisms be not sediniented.
In the absence of deposit — i.e., in a negative agglutination re-
action, there should be surli a cjuantity of emulsion that a tulie
containing it can l)c easily distinguished from a tul)e not contain-
ing any emulsion.
It is (if interest here to note the naked eye ap]ica)'ance of the
emulsion controls to the sets of tutes under review.
In four of these controls the total volume of fluid was made up to
2 c.c, with carbolised saline: in the other four to 20 c.c.

Of tho.se enndsion controls containing 2 c.c. of total fluid, it
will be seen that (1) and (2) above possess sxich a degree of cloudi-
ness that they are readily distinguishable to the naked eye as
containing emulsion.
These tubes contain 0.05 c.c. and 0.02") r.c. respectively.
In Sets I., II., and III., of agglutination results I'ecorded above
the smallest deposit (positive agglutination), wliich is easily read
(tubes containing 2 c.c. of fluid), is that where there is 0.025 c.c.
of emulsion.
In Set IV.. tlie oidy tu])c where (although tliere was tlio same
quantity of serum in each tu])e), agglutination was manifest in
24 hours, was that one in wliicli tlierc was 0.05 c.c. of emulsion in
the tube.
With tliis large volume of fluid (20 c.c), no smaller quantity
gave a completed reaction in 2-1 liours.
From tliese experiments, therefore, it has l)een conchuled that tlie
optimum amount of enudsion to use- is 0.05 c.c. of " Standard
10 X '' emulsion (or 0.5 c.c. of " Standai'd X " cnuilsion).
This amount, 0.5 c.c. of " Standard X " emulsion has, thei'e-
fore, been ado])ted foi- use in all pi-actical diagnostic tests for the
reasons that —
