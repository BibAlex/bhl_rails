is always sinj^ular. We shall assume that the surfaces are all
exterior to one another, so that X. = — 1 is not a characteristic
number. The functions P(^s) and Q{ts) assume simple values at the
pole Ao=l. For the functions i/'i(«), ^i{s), • . • , >/'/«(*) are such that
i/',.(,s-) is equaP to + 1 over the rth surface and zero over all the
other surfaces; while 4)r{t) is a distribution of electricity over
the surfaces giving constant values over each of the surfaces
and rli)-oughout each of the vi inner regions. This distribution
<f)r(/) has a total charge +1 over the rth surface, and zero over
each of tIic otlieis. It tliere-fore represents the electric distribution
over the ;/( surfaces regarded as conductors, due to unit charge on
the rth sui-face. Hence, if we use an index to denote the particular
value of the pole A..,.

We may prove several interesting properties of the functions in-
volved in (5), (7) and (8), making use of the relation (29). If in
the first of (7) we replace p by a boundary point «, multiply by dt
and integrate over the boundary we find
/P(fs)dt = XjP{Os)dO
Hence
(32) /P(ts)dt=0 Ao±l.
By the .same process we deduce from (5) thaf^

Substituting from (6) and putting Ay = 1 we have

* In (32) X may be replaced by a i)oiiit p. The same may be done in (33) and (34') provided the
second member be changed to 2 for p in the inner reyion, and to for p in the outer region. Cf. § 10.
