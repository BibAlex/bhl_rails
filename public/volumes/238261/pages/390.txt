§ 7. XiMENESiA, Gray. Heads large ; involucral bracts narrow,
herbaceous, 2-3-seriate, subequal or the outer often more. elongated and

* Pales very narrow, almost filiform, persistent: petioles winged: rays short:
apparently perennial.
28. V. nana. Dwarf, canescent-pubescent, branched from near the
base; branches 1 to 1.5 dm. long, procumbent: leaves chiefly opposite,
oval, obtuse or obtusish, irregularly and more often obtusely dentate,
3 to 5 cm. long, nearly half as broad, narrowed below to winged peti-
oles ; these entire or bearing two to four spreading teeth near the stem :
peduncles solitary, terminal upon the branches : involucral bracts oblong
to lance-linear, 8 mm. long, subequal : rays deep orange, seldom over 8 or
10 mm. in length: achenes suborbicular, broadly winged, villous ; wings

Tliere has been an unfortunate confusion in the labelling or mounting
of Wright's no. 1407, cited by Dr. Gray as the type of his var. nana.
The plant mounted with the label no. 1407 (which shows evidences of
erasure and change) is V. encelioides, var. cana, while the plant which Dr.
Gray really described is undoubtedly the one here taken as V. nana.
