317. — A common plant in muddy or wet places nearly throughout eastern
North America, growing from Whycocozmah, Cape Breton (Alacoim),
Kent County, New Brunswick {Fowler), Piscataquis County, Maine
{Fernald, no. 251), Ste. Clotilde, Quebec {St. Cyr), and Ottawa,
Ontario {Macoun), to Minnesota ( Woods, Sandberg, no. 6G9, Taylor),
Iowa {Butler, Fink), and Kansas {Norton, no. 545) southward to the
Gulf of Mexico. Reappearing in the northwestern United States and
British Columbia: Green River Hot Springs, Washington {Piper, no.
G280) ; Clarke Co., Washington {Suksdorf, no. 2328) ; Pitt River,
British Columbia {Hill). Some northern specimens not otherwise dis-
tinguishable from typical E. obtusa have castaneous scales.
Var. jejuna. — Figs. 13, 14. — Culms capillary, suberect or gen-
erally decumbent or spreading, 1 (rarely 2) dm. or less high : heads
smaller, fewer-flowered, 2 to 5 mm. long ; scales more spreading : achene
1 The number and character of the stamens have sometimes been given promi-
nence in distinguisliing species of Eleocharis. When the achenes are well matured,
however, the stamens are too often shrivelled or entirely gone, so that the differ-
ences found in them are hardly satisfactory criteria for determining species.
