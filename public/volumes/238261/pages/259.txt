analysis this bromine was precipitated with an excess of silver nitrate
and weighed. In analyses 2, 3, and 4 the cobalt was leached with pure
water, and after filtration the bromine was determined in the filtrate.
The solutions of the cobalt in dilute nitric acid proved almost entirely
free from bromine, that obtained from analysis 4 being entirely so. The
silver bromide from these solutions was combined with that obtained
from the aqueous extracts and weighed. As it was hard to believe that
cobaltous bromide could be enclosed by the reduced cobalt in such a way
as to remain unreduced and yet to go completely into solution with ap-
parent ease, it was obvious that some foreign bromide must be present.
Accordingly the filtrate from one of the precipitates of silver bromide
