Succession on the Coast. — At the beginning of a cycle the subaerial
forces of degradation enter upon a new piece of work. Similarly the sea
has to begin anew its attack upon an initial coast. A series of coastal
forms would be expected to result, and these may be grouped in stages
analogous to those of land forms. On account of the many variables which
control topographic form, it would not be expected to find the inland
area and the coast of the same region in homologous stages of develop-
ment. The general surface of a coastal plain may be in youth or ma-
turity when its coastline has advanced to adolescence. Because the
coastline has reached an adolescent stage of development, it does not
follow that the surface of the coastal plain further inland is also in
adolescence.
The initial stages of coast and inland surface begin together, for both
are controlled by a relative change in position of land mass to sealevel.
In making out the initial and sequential stages of shore development from
an inductive study of coasts and shores, the writer has tried to follow
the principles used by Professor Davis in his studies of the stages of land
forms, aided by his critical suggestions during the progress of the work.
The thesis of this paper is : The forms of any coastal bp:lt may
BE GROUPED IN THE APPROPRIATE STAGES OF A CYCLE. TlIESE FORMS
WILL BE CONSISTENTLY RELATED TO THE ASSOCIATED LAND AREA OX
THE ONE HAND AND TO THE SEA BOTTOM ON THE OTHER. WhEN CON-
SIDERED TOGETHER, THE FORMS OF A COASTAL BELT INDICATE THE
RELATIVE TIME SINCE THE LAST CONSIDERABLE UPLIFT OR DEPRES-
SION, AS WELL AS THE RATIO EXISTING BETWEEN THE SEVERAL ACTIV-
ITIES, IN THEIR DYNAMIC EFFECT UPON THE FORMS OF THE COAST AND
THE SHORE.
Rising, raised ,' sinking, sunken. — In considering any of the conse-
quences of continental oscillations, care must be taken to discriminate be-
tween the movement of the land during historical time or the geographic
to-day, its movement during the immediate past of geographic time, and
the last movement of any considerable amount. Because there is good
evidence of either a geologic or a geographic character, that a given land
has moved either up or down during the period of more careful observa-
