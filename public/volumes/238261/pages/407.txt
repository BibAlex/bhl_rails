Doubtful Species.
v.? ^STUANS, Lam. Diet. iii. 262, DC. Prodr. v. 618 {Inula ccstic-
ans, L. Spec. ed. 2, ii. 1236), known from Plum. ed. Burm. t. 41, f. 2,
is wholly doubtful and probably not of this genus. It has very numer-
ous long narrow linear rays and a multiseriate involucre.
V. ARGENTEA, Bcrtol. Fl. Guat. 435, if (as described) with neutral
ray-flowers and triangular upwardly villous acheues, is probably au
Encelia.
V. ARGENTEA, Gaud. in Freyc. Yoy. Bot. 463, is a very imperfectly
characterized plant of the Marian Islands.
V. CONYZOIDES, Trew, PI. Ear. 8, t. 6 (1763), without locality, does
not appear to have been recognized by any subsequent author. We have
not had access to the work in which it is figured.
V. DECURRENS, Veil. Fl. Flum. viii. t. 114, represented with race-
mose heads and a pappus of several capillary bristles, is surely not of this
genus.
V. HuMBOLDTir, Spreng. Syst. iii. 577. V. heliantJi aides, HBK.
Nov. Gen. &, Spec. iv. 204, not Michx. AVe have seen no material of
this species and are unable to place it satisfactorily. It is supposed to
come from Ecuador, and is probabl}^ related to V. elegans, but has leaves
''glabrous above." The Mexican plants referred to this species by
Khitt are doubtless distinct.
v.? ILICIFOLIA, Poir. Diet. viii. 459, of San Domingo, with opjiosite
short-petiolate coriaceous dentate leaves, is still doubtful.
V. INVOLUCRATA, Rich. Tent. Fl. Abyss, i. 409, is of Abyssinia and
of doubtful generic affinities.
V. Mameana, Andre, Rev. Hort. xiv. 16, f. 5 (1885), is a horticul-
tural species described from the stem and foliage alone. There is no
satisfactory evidence that it is of this genus.
