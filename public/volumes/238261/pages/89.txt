chloride was the cause of his faihire to obtain trinitrophenylmalonic ester,
although this does not appear from the statemeut in his papers.
Some experiments on the action of aniline on trinitrophenylbromraa-
louic ester yielded only viscous unmanageable products ; and boiling it
with water gave no more promising results.
We have also tried several times to detect the presence of trinitro-
benzol in the secondary products of the action of sodium malonic ester
on picrylchloride, but without success. It seems, therefore, that the re-
placement of the chlorine of the picrylchloride by hydrogen does not take
place under these conditions to any great extent, if it occurs at all.
