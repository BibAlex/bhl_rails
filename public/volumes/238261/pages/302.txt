DALY. — ETCH-FIGURES ON AMPHIBOLES. 411
Etch-Figures on the Clinopinacoid of Aluminous
Amphiboles.
The cohesional properties of the plane (010) on any one of the akimi-
nous amphiboles are simpler than those of the same face on actinolite, in
that we find the development of only one kind of figure on the former
though etched in exactly the same fashion. It corresponds to the light
type on the actinolites in several respects, being a parallelogram with
the obtuse angle situated in the upper left hand corner and the non-
appearance of the adventitious third pair of figure-faces. The equiva-
lence is not complete because of the slight elongation in a vertical sense,
and because of a greater obliquity of the figure-faces to the plane (010).
(See Fig. 8 on page 406, and Plate I. Fig. 26, and Photograph 14.)
We have seen that the pits on (110) of the hornblendes vary some-
what with the chemical composition ; the same is true of the (010)
pits. A number of specimens from different localities undoubtedly
with considerable, though unknown differences in the proportions of
the constituent oxides, were etched, and two of the elements determined
in each case, as recorded in the table : —

There can be no question, in view of the facts of the foregoing table,
that there is a lack of uniformity in the crystallographic zones into
which the figure-faces on (010) of hornblendes fall. The differences in
outline and orientation are so salient as to impress the eye at once on
seeing them in the microscope. Now those hornblendes (V. 26, V. 33,
V. 34, V. 40, V. 54) which had the edge A B not far from being sen-
sibly perpendicular to the trace of the cleavage were also characterized
by (110) pits of the Wolfsberg sub-type, and those so far studied (V. 32,
V. 42, P. 55) that showed important variations from that orientation
carried pits more allied to the Kragero sub-type, if not identical with it.
More detailed investigation in the future with carefully analyzed material
