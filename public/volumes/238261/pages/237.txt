umn headed " 62|°." This table is regarded as capable of more general
application than the one published by Harker,* inasmuch as his refers
only to that small class of amphiboles which have the acute optical angle
situated about the axis of elasticity lying next to the vertical axis (op-
tically 2)ositive, represented by pargasite). It will be observed that for
amphiboles with small optical angle (up to 60°), any one of the three
variables may be determined if the other two are known, but that, con-
sidering the instrumental errors of reading, the larger values of the
optical angle cannot with much safety be determined on account of the
slow variation in the corresponding angles of extinction on (010) and
(110). When 2 Fis equal to 70°, p and 0' are for any negative species
nearly equal.
The following is the similar table (Table II.) for pyroxenes, where the
cleavage angle is taken at 92° 54'. It is simply a slight extension of
that of Harker. t

We are not yet, however, in a position to make universal use of cleav-
age pieces for the purpose of finding the value of p. There are many
