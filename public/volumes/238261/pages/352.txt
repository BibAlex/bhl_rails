WOLFF. — HARDYSTONITE. 481
Its systematic position is perhaps not clear without crystallographic
material. Having an oxygen ratio of 4:3 it would belong among the
intermediate silicates (Dana's System, 6th ed.), and its tetragonal system
and cleavages would place it near ganomalite (Pb3Si20,). Some genetic
connection with clinohedrite * (HoCaZnSiOg) may be surmised, as both
minerals come from the same workings, and the writer is informed that
a white mineral, probably hardystonite, has been found there in con-
siderable quantity. It is hoped in a future visit to the mines to obtain
further light on these questions.
