Properties of Bromdinitroresorcine DietJnjlether^ melting at 81째-82째,
C6H(C2H50)2Br(NO.)2.
It forms when crystallized from alpohol white needles or slender prisms
terminated by two planes at an obtuse angle to each other, which turn
brown on exposure to the light. It melts at 8l째-82째, and is very soluble
in benzol, or chloroform ; soluble in methyl alcohol, acetone, glacial acetic
acid, or carbonic disulphide; slightly soluble in cold ethyl alcohol, more
soluble in hot ; slightly soluble in ligroin. Alcohol is the best solvent for
it. It is not acted on api)arently by strong hydrochloric acid, either hot
or cold ; strong sulphuric acid does not act in the cold, but when warm
dissolves it with a brownish red color; strong nitric acid does not actiu
the cold, but gives a colorless solution with it when hot.
That this bromdinitroresorcine diethylether was not the only organic
product of the reaction of sodic ethylateon trichlorbromdinitrobenznl wmc
