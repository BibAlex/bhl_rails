result. The table below includes all of the five possible ratios obtainable
from our work, series I. and IV. being rejected because they were merely
preliminary : —
(Series II.) 58.995
(Series III.) 58.987
(Series V. and VI.) 58.998
(Series II. and V.) 58.994
(Series III. and V.) 58.992
Average .... 58.993
This table, although giving an interesting statement of the possible
combinations, does not yield a fair average, — for Series V. is introduced
three times, Series II. and III. each twice, while Series VI., which is at
least as accurate as the others, appears only once. A fairer method
would probably be to avoid all hypotheses and combinations, and assign
to each of the four series equal weight, as follows : — ■
Series II. (uncorrected) Co = 58.995
Series III. (uncorrected) Co = 58.987
Series V. (corrected) Co = 58.992
Series VI. (corrected) Co = 59.004
Final Average . . . 58.995
Obviously it makes but little difference which method we adopt : the
averages are essentially identical. The highest individual experimental
result among all these determinations was 59.021, and the lowest 58.955,
the average variation from the mean 58.995 being 0.012. Because
these results are less concordant than one could wish, and the conclusion
is somewhat less positive than that reached in the case of nickel, the
atomic weight of cobalt is being further studied by radically different
methods in this Laboratory.
In a recent article,* Professor Winkler calls attention to some possible
errors, in the work upon both nickel and cobalt published last year.
That the disagreement between his results and ours is due to the metliods
employed by him in his work upon these two elements has been suf-
ficiently shown in the preceding paper upon the atomic weight of nickel.
In addition, however, his several suggestions concerning our own work
should obviously be reviewed and discussed in detail.
His specific criticisms are four in number. First, he suggests that the
