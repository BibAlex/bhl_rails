In order to justify the use of this solid electrode one must show that
it always gives the same potential, and that this is equal to the true
potential existing between metal and solution. The first experiments
were made with a cell whose electrolyte was cadmium sulphate and
whose electrodes consisted of electrolyzed cadmium, of medium fineness,
which had been washed successively in dilute suli^huric acid, distilled
water, and absolute alcohol, and then dried. The two electrodes being
exactly similar, the electromotive force of the cell should be zero. Tlie
actual electromotive force, therefore, indicates the amount of deviation
in potential of electrodes of this kind. Several such cells were measured.
The largest electromotive force found was .0004 volt, the majority being
about .0001 to .0002 volt. Better results were obtained with metal
which, instead of being dried, was washed in the electrolyte. The differ-
ence of potential under these circumstances never exceeded .0001 volt
when proper care was used in preparation. Moreover no greater difference
was found when two electrodes made of entirely different samples of
electrolyzed cadmium were used. Since, therefore, the same potential
is obtained from such electrodes, whether the metal be in a finely divided
spongy state, or consist of a coarser network of crystals, this may safely
be considered the true potential of metallic cadmium. Similar experi-
ments were made with zinc, with equally satisfactory results. The data
given below illustrate the constancy of these electrodes. The electrodes
were usually not tested for any considerable length of time, the cells
being prepared anew for each series of observations, which only lasted
a few hours. Table IV. gives the electromotive forces of cells where
finely divided metallic cadmium was thus pitted against a dilute cad-
mium amalgam containing one per cent of cadmium. '
