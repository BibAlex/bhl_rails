This species has a more southern range than the preceding, from which
it is witli difficulty distinguished, not being known on the Atlantic coast
north of North Carolina, though in the west it occurs as far north as
Nebraska and even Iowa. It is not known west of eastern Colorado,
except in the south, where it occurs in New Mexico ; and it is found
throughout Mexico.
