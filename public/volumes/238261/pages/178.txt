Depression : Adolescence. — The type example of adolescent sliore development
following depression is in Germany on a coast of moderate relief upon the south-
ern shore of the Baltic (Germ., 1, 3, 8, 15, 16, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 43, 44, 45, 46,
47, 48, 49, 50, 65, 66, 70, 71, 72, 73, 92, 93). Beaches occur at the foot of the
cliffs, and the cliff lines are gently curving. The transportation of material takes
place practically all alongshore, wings have grown out from the headlands, and the
bays are nearly all enclosed by bars. Deltas occur at tlie bay-heads and are
growing forward, but the bays are not as yet filled by laud waste and sand blown
in from the bars. Upon the inside of the bars there are cuspate projections of
sand, while nips are seen upon the mainland itself. At a distance of from 3 to 10
kilometers offsliore there is a depth of from 20 to 25 meters, which seems to repre-
sent the submarine platform. Offsets, overlaps, and stream deflections are not
strong in either direction, but show a slight alongshore action toward the east or left,
thus indicating a dominant current from the right. This dominance appears to be
stronger toward the eastern side : witness the wing growing eastward from Putzig
headland, the inlet to Frische bay nearer the northeast end of the bar, and the
inlet to Kurische bay crowded way over to the northeast end close to the mainland.
One feature very typical of adolescence which is not well shown along the
northern coast of Germanj' is island-tying. There are several areas, which were
possibly isolated portions of the mainland at the beginning of the cycle, that are
now completely connected with the mainland by sea and river aggradation, but
there are no typical tombolo-tied islands,* so common elsewhere. Tlie reason for
the absence of such islands seems to be that this shoreline is one developed upon
a drowned coastal plain, not deeply dissected and somewhat masked by glacial
aggradation. The writer's interpretation of the late history of this region is that,
after the elevation of tlie Tertiary and Pleistocene strata of the North German
plain, the dissection of the land advanced to adolescence. Then followed a mod-
erate depression by which the adolescent valleys were drowned, but the land was
not sufficiently dissected to allow the formation of many islands.
Another example is the west coast of Central America, gulf of Nicoya to
Burica point (H. 0., 1016, 1017).
