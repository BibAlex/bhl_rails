KnowUon, no. 231). A few specimens, cited by Dr. Britton under
E. 3ngelmanni, I have not seen, but some of them may well belong to
this variety, which is not recognized by him.
Var. robusta. — Figs. 41 to 44. — Culms stout, about 3 dm. high :
the pale obloug-lanceolate heads becoming 2 cm. long, 3.5 or 4 mm.
broad : achenes distinctly larger than in the other forms, the thicker
tubercle less flattened, resembling that of E. obtusa, about one third as
high as the achene : bristles as in the species. — Missouui, Montier,
where it is said to be common, June 30, 1894 (B. F. Bush, no. 585) ;
vSpringfield, 1889 (/. W. Blankins/u'p) ; pond, Lawrence Co., June 19,
1890 (W. J. SpiUman) ; ravines in the Ozarks, Shannon Co., July 6, 1890
{B. F. Bush, no. 42) : essentially the same plant collected in western
South Dakota, Sept., 1892 (Z). Griffiths).
++ -^ Heads ovate-lanceolate to oblong-lanceolate ; the acute or merely bluntish
scales more spreading.
E. monticola. — Figs. 45 to 50. — Culms erect, 1 to 2.5 dm. high :
heads G to 9 mm. long, 2 to 3.5 mm. broad: scales chestnut-brown or
purplish with paler midribs and margins : achenes and tubercles resem-
bling those of E. Engehnanni ; the bristles equalling or slightly exceed-
ing the achene. — E. obtusa, Watson, Bot. Calif, ii. 222 (as to Plumas
County and Oregon plants), not Schultes. E. ovata, var. Engelmanni,
Britton, Jour. N. Y. Microsc. Soc. v. 103, in part (as to Lemmon speci-
men). — Plumas County, California, 187G (J/rs. Mary E. Pulsifer Ames) ;
northern Sierra Nevada of California (71 G. Lemmon, no. 485); Mult-
nomah County, Oregon {Howell, no. 408). Distinguished from the
more eastern and southern E. Engelmanni principally by its more ovoid
darker heads, and less appressed acutish scales, and like the latter species
losing the elongated setulose portions of its bristles in
Var. leviseta. — Figs. 51, 52. — Bristles represented only by their
short naked bases. — In muddy j^lsices, valley of Ca-ur d'Alene River,
Kootenai County, Idaho, July 14, 1892 {Sandberg, MacDougal & Heller,
no. 649) ; and in a muddy place west of Killarney, Manitoba, Aug. 1,

-f- H- Tubercle distinctly narrower than the achene.
E. DiANDRA, Chas. Wright. — Figs. 53 to 58. — Culms slender, erect,
2 or 3 dm. high : heads ovoid, obtuse or acutish, 4 to 6.5 mm. long, 2 to
3.5 mm. wide : the small pale brown ovate or oblong-ovate scales acutish
or blunt, ascending but scarcely appressed: achenes small, broadly obovate
or inverted pyriform, capped by a compressed tubercle resembling that
