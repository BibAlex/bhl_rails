8. V. SCABRA, Benth. PI. Hartw. 41. This species is reduced by
Mr. Hemsley and by Dr. Gray to V. teti'aptera, but from a drawing
by Klatt and Bentham's brief characterization of the involucre we iden-
tify with the species Palmer's no. 377, from Tequila, Jalisco, which with
its few broad herbaceous involucral scales is surely distinct from V. te-
traptera. The type of V. scabra was collected by Hartweg at Zita-
quaro in Eastern Michoacan.
•^ •«- Leaves, at least the lower ones, sinuate-lobed and borne on a distinct though
broadly winged petiole.
