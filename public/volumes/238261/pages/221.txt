upon one of the ends may break altogether the electric circuit of which
the column of bars should form a part. In later work it seemed better
to rub the ends with fine emery paper, and then wipe them upon smooth
hard-finished paper to remove adhering particles of dust.
Bars 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 17, 19, and 23, the numbers indicating their
order from one end toward the other of the slice from which they had
been cut, were placed in the order just given, end to end in the appar-
atus shown by Figure 5. The resistance of the column, which in the
case of soft iron bars had been about 2 ohms under a pressure of 1.8
kgm., was now found to be surprisingly large. It diminished with in-
crease of pressure, but even with a pressure of 3 kgm. was at first, June
30, about 16.5 ohms. Under a nearly continuous application of this
pressure it gradually grew less, until, on July 2, it was about 5 ohms,
after which it changed but little, although it appeared to be somewhat
greater on July 4.
With this set of bars, and with the method already described, the follow-
ing results were obtained : —

On November 4, 1898, observations were made in the same way with
ten cast iron bars taken from the same set as those used in June and
July ; whether the same bars or not, could not be told. The result was :

It should be remembered that the end to end method of experimenta-
tion with short bars of cast iron was adopted because of a doubt as to
the availability of the thermo-electric test made by a different method on
a 10 cm. bar cut crosswise from the cast iron slab. This earlier method
had given : —
