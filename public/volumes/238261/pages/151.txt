Tlie indications from riglit-angled abutment at both right and left sides of
Laholms bay (Swe., 8, 13) are that the bar is built mainly from the bottom with but
little transportation along the sides of the bay. The stream deflections from either
side of the bay toward a probable oldland island now included in the bar indicate
currents toward the centre. This is in marked contrast to the last example, taken
from the same coast.
Nearly as typical an example is in Dingle bay (Ireland, 172) where the bottom
action is dominant, though there is indication of some transportation from the
right side of tlie bay.
There are many cases of bay filling of this type along the Irish coast (Ireland,
7,9, 15, 51,62, etc.).
Dundrum and Dundalk bays on the west shore of the Irish sea (Ireland, 61,
70, 71, 81, 82).
Drakes bay, California (Fig. 21), is a broad open bay, with a bay-bar growing
near its head. Delta filling is now progressing between the nip and the bar.
Another typical example of the head of a broad bay being aggraded by sea
and streams working together is seen in the gulf of Taranto, Italy. From tlie
swinging outline of the shore the sea action is seep to be stronger tiian the river
action, the deltas are either rounded or stunted. The dominant direction of current
is seen by the offsets to be from the left (Ital., 212, 201, 202).
At the southwest corner of this gulf where the Crati river enters, the shore is
also aggrading. Here the several streams form a great confluent delta, whose form
is modified by the sea (Ital., '221, 222, 229, 230).
In Wachusett cove, Alaska, the curve of the shore at the head of the bay was
nearly satisfactory to the sea forces, acting therefore sea and river fill at the same
point. The great rise and fall of the tides, 18 feet, doubtless prevents the forma-
tion of a bar across the mouth of the cove from Bluff point (C. S., 734).
Nateckin bay, Alaska (C. S., 821).
In the upper portion of tlie valley of San Francisquito bay, Lower California
(H. 0., 638).
Harbor of Acapulco, Lower California (H. O., 872).
San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua (11. O., 934).
Manzanilla and Santiago bays, Mexico (II. O., 915).
Filling is shown on west coast of Central America (H. 0., 1016, details in
1025-1033).
Todos Santos bay, Lower California (II. 0., 104G).
Several bays on the east coast of Scotland are of this tj'pe, Lunan, Montrose,
Aberdeen, Cruden (Scrot., 57,77, 87). The beaches abut sharply against headlands
of irregular shorelines, an indication of bottom building.
Sinclairs and Dunnetbays (Scot., 116) similarly indicate growth from the bottom.
Several beaches on Tiree island (Scot., 42) are of this type.
Magilligan Foreland, Figure 22. â€” Magilligan point (Ireland, G, 12) is
a bay-bar which combines some of the characteristics of tidal cusps witli
the normal bay-bar ^features. From the cliff on the left of the bay a
gently curving beach extends to the end of the point, indicating growth
by alongshore transportation from the left. McKinneys bank points up
