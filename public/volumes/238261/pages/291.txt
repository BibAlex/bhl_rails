discoverable rule governing its development, and I even doubt that it
is always the same face. We might suppose that B G is composed of a
large number of minute planes, and that, for some at present unknown
reason, there is a selection of now one, now another, of these multitu-
dinous facets, which grows rapidly and becomes prominent as a fourth
figure-face of the pit.
Pargasite, carinthine, gamsigradite, syntagmatite, and barkevikite (see
Plate I. Fig. 20), each from its classic locality, give figures that are equiv-
alent with those just described for basaltic hornblende. The differences,
if any, from the Wolfsberg sub-type are so slight as to prevent any
determination of these varieties from the shapes of their respective
corrosion pits. The other three sub-types merit a few remarks, inasmuch
as they undoubtedly owe their distinctive characters primarily to chemi-
cal composition.
Figure 3.
Tlie Kragero Sub-type, (110).
The pits on (110) of V. 31 were sotne-
what sharper than those usually obtainable
on basaltic hornblejide (Figure 3, Plate I.
Figs. 9 and 10, and Photograph 2). There
are again normally three, abnormally four,
figure-faces all oriented in the sense of the
corresponding faces of the pits of the Wolfs-
berg sub-type. The straightness of the edge
A D \% here characteristic. The angle D A H
is extraordinarily variable, having the value
of about 38° in the initial figures, aud in-
termediate values up to 80° in the large
matured pits. There is also a swivelling of
the edge A! , jy, but its amount is difiicult to
determine. Accompanying these changes in
the figure-faces, there is a tendency for the
figure to broaden out as it deepens; so that,
while in the initial figures the ratio of length
to breadth is about 3.5 : 1 (0.05 mm. : 0.014
mm.), that ratio is 2 : 1 (0.072 mm. : 0.03(>
mm.) in the matured pit. The angle C A H
ranges through limits about equal to the
Wolfsberfj readings.
