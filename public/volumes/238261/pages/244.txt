Plate I. — Showing the curves of extinction in the vertical zone of Amphiboles
for which the extinction on (010) is 10° and the optical angle is 50°, 60°, 70°, 80°, or
90°. The abscissa represents tlie amount of rotation of a plane in the zone away
from the plane of symmetry. The ordinate is the corresponding angle of extinc-
tion for that position of the movable plane. The position and amount of maximum
extinction are represented by arrow-heads. Tiie values of extinction for 10° inter-
vals in the zone are entered in the diagram.
