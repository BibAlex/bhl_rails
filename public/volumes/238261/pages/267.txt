bromide was sublimed iu the apparatus which had been used for the prep-
aration of the cobaltous bromide. The sublimate was then heated in a
current of dry nitrogen and hydrobromic acid gas, and finally, when cool,
the nitrogen and acid were displaced by dry air, just as in preparing the
cobaltous bromide for analysis. This potassic bromide upon solution
gave an absolutely neutral reaction with methyl orange. Taking into
consideration these three points, one cannot believe that enough hydro-
bromic acid was retained to have had an appreciable influence on our
results.
The third criticism, objecting to the ftict that in some analyses a small
amount of nickelous oxide was found in the bromide, is an unfortunate
one. A careful perusal of the work would have shown that only in the
preliminary series of results was this the case, and that this series does
not enter into the final average, although its results differ only by a very
small amount from those subsequently obtained with material free from
oxide. As far as the nickel is concerned, a conclusive proof of the ab-
sence of acid is afforded by this very fact that the earlier determinations,
in which it was necessary to filter off a residue of finely divided nickelous
oxide, gave results no higher for nickel than the later results.* Hence
the second and the third criticisms are obviously inconsistent with one
another.
The advantaces of the Gooch crucible are too well known to need
mention. Professor Winkler's specific objection to the collecting of dis-
placed asbestos upon an ordinary filter affects only an amount of a few
tenths of a milligram ; and a i^roof that no error was introduced in this
way lies in the fact that in every case the amount of silver bromide found
agreed very closely with the amount of silver necessary to complete the
reaction, where all but a few tenths of a per cent of the silver was
weighed out, and the remainder was added volumetrically. The following
brief table will make this clear.
Tlius, in the cobalt work, 18.1G302 grams of silver yielded 31.61642
grams of silver bromide, — a ratio of 57.448 to 100.000, — while in the
case of nickel, 15.51556 grams of bromide gave 26.67078 grams of silver
bromide, — a ratio of 57.444 to 100.000, while Stas found 57.445.
From the cobalt work AgBr : Ag = 100.000 : 57.448
From the nickel work AgBr : Ag = 100.000 : 57.444
From Stas's work AgBr : Ag = 100.000 : 57.445
* The slight colloidal solubilitj' of nickelous hydroxide was evidently destroyed
by the presence of large amounts of nickelous bromide, as one would expect.
