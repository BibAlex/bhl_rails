DALY. — ETCH-FIGURES ON AMPHIBOLES. 407
The smaller pits (Figure 5 a) are invariably four-sided and elongated
parallel to the side the more oblique to the trace of the cleavage. So
extremely minute as to be at times easily overlooked, they are, moreover,
inconspicuous on account of their shallowness and the consequent lack
of contrast with the rest of the crystal surface ; they may hence be called
the " light " figures to distinguish them from their darker fellows of the
second class to be described. The angle A^ D' H was determined at from
3° to 5°, the auirle B' A IX averaged 108°. A' B' and A' D' were
measured as under : —

On the average, A' B' : A' U is about equal to 8 : 5.
Quite different are the pits of the other kind (Figure 5 h) ; they are
larger, deeper, and often more numerous. The elongation is, in this
case, in the sense of the vertical axis of the crystal. The four-sided
figures are, as in the first class, parallelograms in plan, the acute angle
here lying, however, in the upper left hand corner. It is this corner and
the opposite one that are truncated by the accessory pair of figure-faces
already mentioned. The angle A D II is 8° instead of o°-5° in the
light figures. The angle £ A D varies from 82° to 88° ; the curvature
of the sides prevents a close determination. The limits of variation in
the ratio A B : AD were observed as 1 : 1 (0.04 mm. : 0.04 mm.) and
about 2:3 (0.032 mm.: 0.048 mm.).
According to the character of the figure-faces (always pyramids) these
larger pits can be subdivided into two sub-groups in one of which the faces
A B and C D are equally illuminated but darker, i. e. more steeply in-
clined to (010) than AD and B C, also of equal brightness, while in
the other group the reverse relation holds. (The figure-faces are here
indicated by their corresponding edges of intersection with (010).) Both
kinds have figure-faces belonging to the same crystallographic zones, and
they are probably allied as are the figure-faces described by Baumhauer
on apatite.* He noted — that which is evident from his photographs —
that, as the apatite matures (deepens) its faces become steeper and steeper
on (0001), (" Verschleppung " of Becke). In one case, I discovered a
large pit having A D steeper than A B, with the bottom occupied by a
