and the temperature is 46°.48.
If tlie radii of the slabs and the metal sheet had been infinite, the
temperature in these media would have been given by the expressions
Mz, M(fx c + 1 — fi), and M(z -\- ^\ (fi — 1)), respectively, where
31= 100/(1.98 + .02 /x). In all practical cases the temperatures of
points on the rim of the disk increase gradually from the cold face to the
warm face, and it would be easy to show that those portions of the
isothermal surfaces which we have used in computing the results of our
observations are sensibly plane.
The characteristic differential equation which gives the relation between
tlie temperature, the space co-ordinates, and the time in a body in which
there is an unsteady flow of heat, involves the specific heat of the body,
which is itself a function of tlie temperatui-e. Without attempting just
here to investigate the nearness of the approximation obtained in any
given case by assuming the specific heat to be constant, we will give for
future reference some numerical results obtained by using several differ-
ent values of z, t, and c in the solution of Problem 3.
An infinite homogeneous lamina of thickness I is originally at the
temperature c Vq throughout. From a given time, < = 0, one face is
kept at the constant temperature Fq, and the other face at the tempera-
ture 0°. The ratio of the conductivity of the slab to its specific beat is to
^be denoted by the constant d^, the ratio of /^ to a^ n"^ by T, and the
distance of any point in the lamina from the face which is kept at the
temperature Vq, by z.
The numbers in Table VITI. show the rate of flow across the cold face
of the lamina in fractional parts of the final rate for different values of
c and t, while the numbers in Table IX. give the rate of flow across
different planes parallel to the lamina faces at different times, for the
special case c = I.
