PEIRCE AND WILLSON. — THERMAL CONDUCTIVITIES. 5
If t) v, t are aiuilytic point fuuctious which define a system of orthog-
onal curvilinear co-ordiniites, and h^, h,^, h^ are the gradients of these
functions, and if q^, 9,,, q^ are the coraponeuts of the heat flux taken at
every point normal to the surfaces of constant ^, 7/, ^ which pass ihrough
that point,
For a given material which would be homogeneous if it were at the
same temperature throughout, under given pressure conditions, k is as-
sumed to be constant, so tliut k' f (6) is a function of the temperature
only. This product is called the specific conductivity of the substance
under the given circumstances, and is denoted by F' (0) or by k. We
may write, therefore,

If a closed analytic surface, aS", be drawn within the solid and if (4^, n),
(ij, n), (^, 11) represent the angles between the exterior normal to /S* at
any point on it and the directions at that point in which ^, »/, and l,
increase most rapidly, the flux of heat across ^from within outward may
be written

The surface integral, taken over S, of f^cos (^, «), where 6^^ is any
function which, with its space derivatives of the first order, is continuous
within and upon S, is equal to the volume integral, extended through the

If \j/ (0) is the specific heat per unit volume of the body under the
given pressure conditions, we may equate the expression just obtained to
