Ai s' = A^s' + B^ c, Jc^ Ai c' — kz {A^ c' + B^ s'),

The determinant of the coefficients of the s's and c's may be reduced
to the form
c's'iki-k^) kic'^-k^s'^
c s" s c" — c s" c c"

If in the special case where ^i and k^ are equal, we write ki = /x k^ = k.^ ,
we get

with corresponding values for the other coefficients.
We shall need at the outset only two or three applications of the fore-
going theory. We may ask first what must be the relative dimensions of a
homogeneous regular right prism, one end of which is kept at the uniform
temperature ^o ^I'J the other end at the uniform temperature 6„ while
its other faces are kept at some uniform temperature 6, between 6q and 61,
in order that the tem{)eratures on the axis of the prism in the final state
shall be sensibly the same whatever value has. If, for instance, the
difference between 60 and 61 is 100° C, what must be the ratio of the
radius a of the circumference inscribed in a right section of the prism to
the height I of the prism, in order that the temperature of every point on
the axis may be the same within less than 0°.01 C, whether 6 is ecjual
to 60 or to 61 ? Since we need merely to find a lower limit for a -^ /,
we shall do well to substitute for the prism the inscribed right cylinder
of revolution, and then apply the solution of Problem 4 given above.
We are to find a function of r and z, harmonic for values of r between
and a and values of z between and I, which (1) has the uniform
value F (Oo) when z — 0, whatever ?• is ; (2) has the uniform value F (0,)
