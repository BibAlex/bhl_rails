(3) Bay filled inside Bar (Adolescence). — Under this heading are included several
cases in whicli it is impossible to tell whether the bar originally was found where
it now stands or whether it began near the bay head.
Procchio and Biodola bays (Elba).
Tiie gulf of Salerno has a bar from Salerno across to Agropoli, inside of which
it has been filled by river and tidal action, forming a rich delta plain with only a
few remaining marshy places (Ital., 185, 197, 198).
Gulf of S. Eufemia (Ital, 241). Current from the left is indicated by deflec-
tion of streams to right.
From Palmi, Italy, across to Nicoteca a bar extends from the right headland to
a point across the bay half way between the left headland and the bay head (Ital.,
215, 246). Direction of current is probably from the right.
Bay of Phaleron southwest of Athens (Attica, III). The bar is largely pro-
duced by the action of the sea on the bottom, for the shore curves at its two ends
are not continuous with curve of the bar.
Vari bay (Attica, VIII). Tliis also shows sea bottom action.
Hanu bay (Swe., G). Dominant current from the right.
C. Bar near Head of Bay: Drakes Bay, Figures 20, 21 — At the
head of Skelder bay (Swe., 8j a bur is built chiefly from the bottom,
since the bar curve abuts sharply against the two sides of the bay, and
streams are deflected to the right on the right hand side and to the left
on the left hand side of the bay, thus indicating currents in either direc-
tion from the centre (Fig. 20). There is evidence of very trifling trans-
portation along the sides of Skelder bay.
