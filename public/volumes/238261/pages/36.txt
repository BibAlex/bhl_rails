This expression, though still sufficiently complicated, shows that for
properly choseu cases, as good for our present purpose as any others, the
computation is comparatively simple.
If, for instance, the thickness of the lower slab is half that of the disk
formed of the two slabs and the intermediate sheet of metal, I' =z ^ I and
n(p = 2 u, so that

responding to the case of a homogeneous cylinder already treated in
Problem 4, we shall see that T'l in the case of the heterogeneous cylin-
der can be found by multi{)lying each term of the series for 7\ by the
quantity — ^— , and that in our problems the resulting series is usu-
ally more convergent than the original.
In order to exaggerate the magnitude of the disturbing effect of the
tinfoil, we have chosen for computation a value of /x much smaller and
a value of 8 much greater than the proper values of these quantities for
most of our experiments, assuming that a = 5^= 10Z' = 500 (I" — /'),
and that /x = 0.002, so that A is nearly equal to
^ Xj, tanh I «o - j^ ctnh ^ a, - ^^ , where «„ = -^
These values correspond in certain cases to large disturbances of temijcr-
ature on the axis of the slabs, as the results show. Consider, for instance,
the point z = /', r = 0, in a com|iound slab 2 cm. thick and 20 cm. in
diameter, built up of a slab of |)oorly conducting material 1 cm. thick, a
sheet of metal 0.2 mm. thi<'k, and a second slal) of the same material as
the first. Let the lower face be kept at the temperature 0° C, the other
face at the temperature 100'^ C, and let every point of the edge be kept
