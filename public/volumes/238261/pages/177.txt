Tlie west coast of Hollanfl from the northernmost outlet of tlie Rhine to Helder
at the uilet to the Zuyder Zee (Atlas Univ. 26; Holl., 14, 19, 24, 25, 30, 37). Tliis
is a porti'^n of tlie confluent delta of the Rhine and adjacent streams.
The coast of Belgium (Alias Univ., 25; Belg., 4, 5, 11, 12, 19).
Depressioii : Youth. — Southwest Ireland is a typical example of youthful shore
evolution upon a vigorous coast (Ireland, 150, 151, 160, 161, 162, 171, 172, 17o, 182,
183, 184, 190, 191, 192, 197, 198, 199, 203, 204). A region of strong relief, with
transverse trends, dissected to about early maturity, was deeply drownt'd and
exposed to the strong attack of the open sea. Far up into the bays the waves
attack the coast and the offshore currents carry away the waste from tlie jagged
cliffs. Grade is reached only in the bay-bars near the heads of the bays.
The southern coast of Curzola island (Austr., 34, XVI).
The west coast of Central America, San Juan del Sur to gulf of Nicoya (II. 0.,
1016, details in 1025-1034).
Soledad bay and Santo Tomas anchorage. Lower California (II. 0., 1044).
Port Islay, Peru (H. 0., 1183).
Brayza island, Austria (Austr., 32, XV).
Meleda island, Austria (Austr., 34, XVII).
The southernmost portion of the Austrian coast, in places becoming adolescent
(Austr., 3(i, XIX ; 37, XX).
Many portions of the coast of Greece (Attica, III, VIII, XVI, XXI, XXII, and
XXIII).
The youthful shoreline of the low coast of Saitiiolm is markedly contrasted with
the adolescent shoreline north and south of Copenliagen (Denm., Kjilbenliavn).
The eastern coast of Schleswig (Germ., 7, 13, 14, 23, 24). The development has
advanced to adolescence in many of the more exposed portions of this low coast.
The steep eastern coast of Sweden from Ilanil Bay northward to a point on the
mainland opposite the north end of Gland island (Swe., 6, 10, 11, 12, 17, 22, 29).
It is worth notice how sligiitly the glacial accidents have here modified the forms
due to drowning.
The Stockholm district (page 159).
The irregular cliffs of eastern Scotland indicate yonth'"iil shore evolution (Scot.,
57, 67, 77, 87).* The development has gone a little farther toward adolescence
near Rattray head (Scot., 97), but very jagged cliffs are seen to the west of this
head (Scot., 95, 96). The north coast of Scotland (Scot., 113, 114, 115, 116) shows
almost no transportation alongshore, althougli several bays have been partly filled.
The west coast of North and South Uist (Scot., 08, 69, 78, 79, 88, 89) shows
a nearer approach to adolescent simplification of outline than their irregular
eastern coast.
Taken as a whole the western coast of Scotland, where the sea attack is stronger
though the rocks are more resistant, is nearer adolescence than the eastern, where
the weaker attack of the North sea has not done so much work upon the less meta-
morphosed rocks. The time since the beginning of the present cycle may not have
been the same in the two areas. As the division lines have been drawn in this
scheme, this Atlantic coast of Scotland is about on the border between the two
stages. Youthful and adolescent features both occur. Two typical areas, from
