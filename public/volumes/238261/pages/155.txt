by transportation and accumulation in front of the nipped oldland.
Although plotted from the soundings and contours about point Wilson,
this figure will serve as a general profile of all the cusps of this class.
Where the initial slopes were less steep, less contrast is seen between the
oldland and the foreland.

Tidal Hypothesis. — Before considering other cusps which differ some-
what from West point, let us look for a moment at what might be
expected to result in narrow channels with sides nearly parallel. Waves
would attack this inner shoreline to a greater or less extent at all points.
When adolescence is reached in the process of shore development, and
waste is supplied faster than it can all be carried offshore, it will be
transported and deposited somewhere* The great system of ocean eddy
currents is not able to affect this inner as it does the outer shoreline.
Local winds must pro-
duce small currents pro-
portional to the size of
the water bodies, but
these will be so weak
in narrow channels that
their effects will be lost
in those of even mod-
erately strong tidal cur-
rents. Thus it seems
safe to conclude that the
probable agent of trans-
portation in such chan-
nels is the tidal ebb and
flow.
An ideal scheme of inflowing tide, with the eddies which would prob-
ably accompany it, is given in Figure 25. Where the movement is
least in the triangles of comparatively dead water between the several
