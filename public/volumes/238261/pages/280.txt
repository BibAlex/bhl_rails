agitation. I am inclined to think that convection currents in the warmed
acid are sufficient to perform the same function.
Ill thus fixing on a universal solvent, its temperature, state of concen-
tration and of convention, we have narrowed down the variables of the
process to one, the duration of attack. This facility in arriving at the
conditions of a uniform method of etching is not possible when the caus-
tic alkalies are employed and hence these will be referred to only inci-
dentally in the following pages. Unless the contrary be stated, the
standard conditions of etching are to be understood in every experiment.
The Optimum Exposure of the Different Species.
Here the study was confined to cleavage pieces. It was naturally
found that as the figures increased in number, they also increased in size,
any changes in shape not being sufficient to remove them from the cate-
gory of "primary" figures (Becke). In most cases, the general cleav-
age surface showed no serious roughening as the figures grew and the
attack was allowed to continue nearly to the point where overlapping of
the pits (generally aggregated in groups) would occur. This length of
exposure usually gave the best figures for study ; hence I have called it
the " optimum " duration of attack. Since the determination of the
optimum length of immersion was a matter of considerable labor, the
result of several trials with almost all varieties, I have thought it worth
while to tabulate the results obtained with a certain number of speci-
mens. It is to be understood that the following table is only approxi-
mately accurate. Perfectly fresh acid was not used in every case, and,
of course, the longer the acid remains on the water bath, the weaker it be-
comes ; moreover, the amount of steam in the water bath is variable to some
extent, and thus the HF might become heated at different rates. Care was
taken to allow for such causes of variation from the true optimum.
