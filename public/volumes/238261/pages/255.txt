hydrogen answered the purpose ; for the temperature at which the reduc-
tion takes place is so low that no trace of nickel was found outside of the
boat which originally contained the bromide, if a rapid current of the
gas was maintained. It is obvious that according to the law of mass-
action, the presence of a large proportion of hydrobromic acid resulting
from the reduction would tend to prevent the desired reaction, and hence
to facilitate the undesired sublimation ; therefore a large excess of hydro-
gen must be present. Of course the hard glass tube used for this pro-
cess was always afterwards treated mternally with nitric acid, and the
liquid was examined with minute care for traces of nickel.

The use of rubber was confinefl to the first part of tliis train, where it could do
no harm (A B C D E F and A M N O P).
The nickelous bromide to be analyzed was contained in a platinum
boat, and the method of drying and weighing it was in every respect the
same as that described in detail in the previous paper upon this subject.
After having been weighed, the boat was carefully placed in a hard glass
tube, in which the bromide was cautiously reduced to the metal. When
the reduction was completed and the apparatus had just cooled, the boat
and its contents were returned to their weighing bottle, where they were
enclosed in an atmosphere of dry air. The weight of the residue was
