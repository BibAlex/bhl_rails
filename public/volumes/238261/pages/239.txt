Let tan 2 p = x, tan 2 6' = x' , tan 2 Q" = x' . We have
x' — X cos C" x" — X cos C"

Hence

We now have an expression by means of which the extinction can be
calculated even when the optical angle is not known. The theory of
the same problem was elaborated by Liebisch in his discussion * of the
general determination of the optical angle and of the direction of the
optic axes in biaxial minerals, using sections whose cry stall ographic
orientation is known, and on which the planes of vibration of the two
refracted rays are known. Of immediate interest to us is the case in
the monoclinic system where the optical plane is also the plane of sym-
metry, but the orientation of the two axes of elasticity is not determined.
He finds the problem soluble when two sections can be employed, and
this is what we practically have for optical purposes in the cleavage
piece placed at two positions with respect to the incident ray from the
polarizer.
But it is evident that there must be some degree of error in the instru-
mental readings of 0' and 6"; we have next to inquire if equation (12)
is so sensitive to changes in 6' or 6" or to simultaneous changes in both
as to make any determinations of p by means of it valueless. By ac-
