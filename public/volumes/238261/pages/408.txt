GREENMAN. — MEXICAN PHANEROGAMS. 667
This species seems most nearly related to E. acicularis, E. Br., but
differs in the stouter habit, the more conspicuously sheathed culms, and
the more persistent and longer setaj.
Smilax Pringlei. Stems terete, unarmed, somewhat tawny-pubes-
cent, later becomino- glabrous or nearly so: leaves alternate, ovate or
ovate-oblonty, 7 to 12 cm. long, 4 to 6.5 cm. broad, cordate or occasion-
ally subtruncate, short-acuminate, acute, entire, 5-7-nerved with rather
prominently reticulated veins, glabrous above or slightly pubescent on
the nerves, more or less pubescent beneath, later becoming glabrous ex-
cept on the rather densely hirsute-pubescent nerves; petioles 1.5 to
2 cm. long, pubescent, ceriferous near the base : peduncle 2 to 4.5 cm.
long, pubescent; pedicels 6 to 12 mm. long, these as well as the slender
flower-buds grayish-puberulent : perianth-divisions of the staminate flow-
ers linear-oblong, 6 to 8 mm. long, 1 to 1.5 mm. broad, obtuse, 1-nerved,
in anthesis recurved : pistillate flowers not seen : mature fruit smooth,
globose, about 1 cm. long ; seeds ovate, 5 mm. long, 3 mm. broad, red-
dish-brown. — Collected by C. G. Pringle in a barranca near Cuernavaca,
State of Morelos, 20 November, 1895, no. 7060, and in the same locality
at an altitude of 1,800 m., 18 June, 1896, no. 7259, also in mountain
canon above Cuernavaca, altitude 2,000 m., 15 May, 1898, no. 6843.
A species climbing to 6 m. and most nearly related apparently to
S. enjthrocarjja, Kunth, from which it is distinguished by the pubescent
character and by the shorter peduDcles.
Agave (Littsea) intrepida, Acaulescent : leaves numerous in a
rosette, lance-attenuate, about 4.5 dm. long, 1.5 to 2.5 cm. broad, gradu-
ally narrowed to a rather slender reddish-brown end spine, somewhat
dilated at the base to a breadth of 2.5 to 4 cm., smooth and in the dried
state more or less striate upon either surface, margins cartilaginous, mi-
nutely, closely, and evenly serrulate from base to apex : scape 1 to 1.25 m.
high, clavate : bracts of the peduncle scattered ; floral bracts lance-
attenuate, slightly exceeding, the flowers, scarious : flowers in pairs, 3.5
to 4 cm. long: perianth-tube 1.2 to 1.4 cm. in length; lobes oblong,
somewhat shorter than the tube, slightly thickened at their pubescent
apices : stamens inserted at about the middle of the perianth-tube, over-
topping the stigma and more than twice exceeding the perianth : capsule
1.7 cm. long, nearly 1 cm. in diameter. — Collected by C. G. Pringle on
mossy cliffs, Parque Station, State of Morelos, altitude 2,100 m., 2 June,
1898, no. 6868.
This species is apparently related to A. dasylirioides, Jacobi & Bouche,
but differs materially in size and habit. In Mr. Pringle's plant the
