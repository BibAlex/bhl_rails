its force upon the more exposed coasts, by having a simpler coastline
upon which to work.
(1) Bay but little Jill ed (Youth-Adolescence). â€” Bay-bars are forming across
tliree bays on the Oldenburg sheet (Germ., GO). Two of tliese are on the southern
side of Fehmarn island and tlie third is south of Grossenbrode. In Orther bay
transportation is from the left, but in the other examples it is about equally from
right and left headlands.
Gruber bay is enclosed b^- a bar (Germ., 60, 84). The deflection of the outlet,
Dahmer-See, to the left indicates a dominant current from the riglit.
Stettiner bay is closed by a bar wiiich shows a very beautiful series of aggrada-
tion shorelines (Germ., 89, 90, 91, 92, 120, 121, 122, 154, 155, 187). Tlie dominant
current is indicated by offsets, overlaps, and stream deflections to be from the left.
The contest between river and tidal currents on tlie one hand and alongshore cur-
rent on the otlier is clearly shown. A study of details on the ground in connection
with these expressive general maps ought to bring out many features of the pro-
gressive steps in the formation of bay-bars. Islands are included in this bar and
thus complicate its form. Usedom island is made up apparently of several indi-
viduals, and WoUin island is in large part a portion of the drowned mainland and
not the later built foreland.
Three bays formerly arms of Hochwachter bay are enclosed (Germ., 59). The
indications are of a dominant current flowing from the left.
Several examples from Kiel nortliward (Germ., 39, 58).
Warneniiinde is built on a bay-bar (Germ., 86).
Kurische and Frisciie bays (Germ., 1, 3, 8,9, 15, 16, 29, 30, 48,49, 50, 71,72,73).
Carder, Dolgen, Leba, Sarbsker, and Zarnowitzer are enclosed to form lakes or
lagoons (Germ., 25, 26, 44, 45, 46).
Vietzker lake (Germ., 43).
Vitter lake (Germ., 66).
Jamunder and Buckower lakes (Germ., 65).
Kamper lake (Germ., 93).
IIorst-Eiersberger lake (Germ , 92).
Bankel-damm is shut in by a bay-bar (Germ., 13). Transportation is about equal
from right and left according to the map indications.
Schlief-see is closed by a bar growing from the right, for on that side the
curve of the cliff is continued in the line of the bar, while on the left the bar
abuts abruptly against the oldland, forcing the stream under the left hand bluff
(Germ., 13).
The Sejrslev headland has a right and left wing growing across bays (Denm.,
LugstiJr).
A cuspate bar extends from the left hand side of Ilorsens fjord toward a rock
near Alro island (Denm., Skanderborg).
Across the mouths of some ten drowned valleys, between tlie Dnieper and the
Danube rivers on the Black sea, bars have grown (Rus., .33; Atlas Univ., 38),
More than half of them are completely closed by the sea action. Tlie low mean
annual rainfall in this region, 1.5.83 inches at Odessa,* would cause weak stream
