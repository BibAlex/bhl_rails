(4) The radius of the hase of a riglit cylinder of revolution of length
Ms a. A function, V, harmonic within this cylinder, has the constant
value Fq on one (the lower) base, the constant value F, on the upper
base, and the conslant value Fon the convex surface. If, then, the axis
of the cylinder be used as axis of z with origin at the centre of the lower
base, Fis given by the equation

where J^ and J^ represent Bessel's P'unctiou of the zeroth and first
order, respectively, and x^, is the jt»th root in order of magnitude of the
ecjuation J^, (./) = 0. The first ten values of x for which the Bessel's
Fuiictiuu of the zeroth order vanishes have been given by Meissel.*
We have computed the next thirty values of the xj?, by the aid of
Stokes's Formula,! and the values of the Bessel's Function of the first
order corresponding to these forty a;^'s either from the series which usu-
ally defines J^ (x) or from the semi-convergent series. This computation
was done by means of Vega's ten place table of logarithms,^ except in
the few cases where a greater number of places was necessary, and for
these we had recourse to Thoman's tables.§ All the values have been
checked by duplicate computation, and the first four values of Ji (x) by
comparison with Meissel's tables. The results of this work appear in
Table I. Table II. gives to seven places of decimals the values of the
Xj's from p = 4\ to /) = 65. The values of Kon the axis of the cylin-
der depend upon the corresponding values of the function
