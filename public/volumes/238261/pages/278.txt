Methods Used.
The researches of recent years on figures of corrosion have shown that
the most fruitful results are obtained by quantitative methods, that is, by
the use of reagents under definite specified conditions, and by close
measurement of the figures. It hardly needs mention that there is
much yet to be learned regarding the coliesional properties of the
species belonging to each of the great mineral groups, as well as re-
garding the similar relations which may exist between corresponding'
members of two different families. Just as we may describe as accu-
rately as possible the hardness or the fusibility, the specific gravity or
the optical properties, of a species, not only to fix it as an independent
type, but also to relate it to the other members of its own family and
to other mineral groups, so we believe it is possible to construct with
