of etching on the clinopinacoid. Good figures are obtained with ease.
(Plate I. Figs. 23a, 236, 23c.) They are remarkable in belonging to
two classes, analogous to those described by Pelikan for pyroxene with
the same reagent.* (Photo. 12, cf. Photo. 13.) The pit of the one
category is a quadrilateral in outline, with four pyramidal figure-faces
and a bottom-face that grows smaller and then disappears as the figure
matures and deepens. The other kind of pit is also four-sided in habit,
but may possess another pair of figure-faces in addition to the five cor-
responding to those of the first class. Figures 5 a and 5 b represent
diagrammatically the two kinds matured under normal conditions (water
bath, concentrated acid, etc.). The drawings are lettered in order to in-
dicate the elements chosen to fix the shape and orientation of the pits.
