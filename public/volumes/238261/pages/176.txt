nor is it free from inaccuracies. The sources of information are in many
cases very meagre.
All the reasons for the classification of each example are not dis-
cussed ; and many of the most important features are omitted, because
they already have been considered. Under examples of depression is
given some idea of the various kinds of lands which were depressed, and
also some hint as to the different stages of development which had been
reached before the new cycle was inaugurated.

Probably the coast of Brazil from cape Benevento to cape Frio should be here
included. The ciiarts sliow offshore bars enclosing lagoons (H. 0., 470, 471),
probably following uplift.
Also from cape Santa Marta to Tramandaky bar (H. 0., 477).
The soutliern half of Lower California, Mexico, appears on its western slope to
liave a coastal plain, described as " low hills and rising plains," with offshore bars
enclosing narrow lagoons (H. O., 621).
The western coast of Mexico, east of the gulf of California, also shows a similar
coast (H. O., 621 and 622 as far south as San Bias).
A third example in the same general region is seen on the west coast of Guate-
mala, extending a little on either hand into Mexico and San Salvador (H. O., 931,
932). The detail of bar and lagoon is shown on the chart (H. 0., 873). The lack
of definite information makes a positive statement in regard to this region unsafe.
A study of the maps indicates that they belong in this stage. Mr. J. J. Williams
says in regard to this region : " The tertiary clays, gravels, and beds of detritus
which cover up so much of the Isthmus along the line of survey, extend on tlie
north side almost to the summit-level, and the base of the hills which lie east and
west of it. Those deposits being found pretty uniformly spread, even to the depth
of thirty feet in some places, as at a point north of the sunnnit-level, and between
it and the river Almoloya, are evidences of the slow and tranquil elevation of this
portion of the Isthmus above tiie sea." *

The Tertiary strata are considerably deformed and therefore the shoreline is not
as straight as in the case of a more simple coastal plain. In a few places along
this line tlie development has hardly reached maturity, as for example west of
Pozzallo (276).
