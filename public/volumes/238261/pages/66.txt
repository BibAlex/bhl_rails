Introduction.
The nature of amalgams, although a matter of much interest, especially
in the light of the modern theory of solutions, is still obscure. The
subject has been studied from the standpoint of electrochemistry by
several investigators, notably by Meyer, * who observed the electromo-
tive forces of cells of the following type: — Dilute zinc amalgam of
concentration x ; Solution of zinc salt ; Dilute zinc amalgam of con-
centration y. Since the total change in a cell of this kind consists in
the transfer of metal between amalgams of different concentrations, the
electrical energy obtained is equal to the maximum osmotic work obtain-
able by the process. On the assumption that the zinc in the dilute
amalgam obeys the laws of dilute solution, Meyer derived the following
expression : —

in which E represents electromotive force ; ^, the electrochemical equiv-
alent, in grams, of the metal carried in one second from one amalgam
to the other ; J/, the molecular weight of the metal in the amalgam ;
T^ the absolute temperature ; log — , the common logarithm of the ratio
of concentration of the amalgams. By comparing with this formula the
experimental results, Meyer showed with sufHcient exactness that in
dilute amalgams the molecules of the metals studied by him are mon-
atomic. If, on the other hand, the atomic weight is substituted for M
in the formula, the agreement between the calculated and his observed
electromotive forces is not close enough to show whether the dilute
