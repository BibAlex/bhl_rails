spring balance at a point too far down to be shown in place. "With the
rubber tube in use the pressure against the end of the column was per-
haps 1.8 kilograms. When the lever and balance were used, it was some-
times about three kilograms and sometimes less.
The various jacketing and protecting devices shown in Figure 5 were
not all used at first, and in the early experiments on soft iron the e. m. f.
obtained from the column of short bars was several per cent less than
that obtained from the 15 cm. soldered bar, with a given difference of
temperature between the two thermometers. This discrepancy gradually
diminished as the method of experimentation was improved, until at last
it became little or nothing, as the following numbers, obtained with the
system of jacketing shown in Figure 5, will testify.

The e. m. f. is here given in terms of a purely arbitrary unit. The
values in brackets were obtained under conditions of special uncertainty
as to resistance. Considering the final trials of the end-to-end short bar
method satisfactory, I prdceeded to apply it to cast iron. From the end
of the slab that furnished the conductivity disk a slice was cut crosswise,
about 10 cm. long, 2.5 cm. wide, and 0.3 cm. thick. This was cut up
into 26 parts, and each of these parts was turned down to a thickness
of about 0.16 cm.; or, rather, 18 of them were so treated, the other
8 being broken at some stage of the operation. They were then boiled
for about 20 minutes in a strong solution of caustic potash, partly
to free them from oil, partly because the disk had been thus heated
before its conductivity was tested. In all of this work an attempt Avas
made, and I think a successful one, to keep the bars in the same order
with respect to each other that they had before being cut from the slice,
so that I could at the end tell what bars had been taken from near the
end of the slice and what ones from near the middle.
When ready for the test of thermo-electric quality, I rubbed the flat
ends of each little bar bright with infusorial earth, and wiped them care-
fully ; for it is evident that a particle of dirt or of vegetable fibre left
