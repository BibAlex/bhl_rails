Gryllus migratoriits (pars) Thunb., Mem. Acad. St. Pe'tersb., V. 243 (1315) t. Stal.
Gryllus rufescens Thunb., Loc. cit., V. 245 (1815) t. Stal.
Acridium flaviventre Burm., Handb. Ent., II. 631 (1838).
This is the migratory species which occurs on both sides of the Atlantic.
I have seen specimens from Brazil, Janson, and Panama, Hassler Exp.
(Mas. Comp. Zool.), in this comitrj ; and in the Old World from Spain,
Bolivar, Cairo, Egypt, Upper Egypt, and the Cape of Good Hope, the
last from Schaum's collection, XnheWeA Jlaviventre. Its distribution in the
Old World is given by Brunner as northern Africa, from Senegal to the
Red Sea, but not farther south, Syria, the Balearic Islands, and Portugal.
The published references to its occurrence in America have been obscured
by other species being confounded with it, so that no further details can
be given than are found above. Stal, however, states that the Stockholm
museum has specimens from Argentina, Montevideo, and Bahia in
America, and from j\Iadeira, Teneriffe, Algeria, Egypt, Nubia, and the
East Indies.
As this is the only species of Schistocerca known in the Old World,
and as it occurs in both hemispheres, there can be little doubt that it
originated in America, — the home of the genus. Notwithstanding its
known powers of extended flight one would hesitate to affirm that it crossed
the Atlantic Ocean on the wing, were it not that it has actually been taken
on vessels in midocean,* viz. in Lat. 25° 28' N., Long. 41° 33' W., which
is about as near one continent as the other, but slightly nearer Africa.
"The clouds and ship's sails were full of them for two days" early in
November.
39. Schistocerca paranensis.
Acridium paranense Burm., Reise La Plata, I. 491 (1861).

Acridium (Schistocerca) peregrimim (pars) Berg, Anal. Soc. Cient. Argent., IX.
275 (1880).
This is the destructive locust of Argentina, which has sometimes been
confounded with the preceding. The only specimens I have seen are
* See Psyche, II. 24.
