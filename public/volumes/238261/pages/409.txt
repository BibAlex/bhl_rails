568 PROCEEDINGS OP THE AMERICAN ACADEMY.
scape is erect, not pendulous, and the bracts of the peduncle are scattered,
not secund and falcate, which is perhaps the most striking character of
A. dasylirioides. The specific name is suggested by the seemingly
perilous habitat of the plant in its native haunts. As stated by Mr.
Pringle, A. intrepida grows " on the faces and tops of the strange castel-
lated knobs of bare conglomerate, which form a range fifteen to twenty
miles to tlie east of Cuernavaca."
SiSYMBiiiuM CouLTERi, Hemsl. Diag. PI. Nov. pars alt. 18, & Biol.
Cent.-Am. Bot. i. 35. Specimens of this species were collected by
Mr. C. G. Pringle on limestone hills near Pachuca, State of Hidalgo,
altitude 2,500 m., 17 August, 1898, no. 6963. In the original charac-
terization the flowers are described as white. This character, however,
must pertain to the corolla oidy, as the sepals in the type specimen,
namely Parry and Palmer's no. 14 (coll. of 1878), and especially in Mr.
Pringle's specimens above cited, are distinctly roseate.
Phaseolus microcarpds, Mart. Ausw. Merkw. Pfl. 18, t. 12 (18S0?
ace. to Jackson, Lit. Bot. 429). This species, although well character-
ized and excellently illustrated in the above cited work, seems to have
been overlooked and omitted from the more generally used lists of Mex-
ican plants, including Hemsley's Biol. Cent.-Am. Bot. P. monospenmis,
Rob. & Greenm. Proc. Am. Acad, xxix (1894), 385, is now regarded
as a synonym of P. mio'ocarjms, Mart., and to the latter species may
be referred Pringle's no. 5446, collected in a barranca near Tequila,
State of Jalisco, and also specimens collected by the late Rev. Lucius C.
Smith at Monte Alban, State of Oaxaca, altitude 1,900 m., 11 October,
1895, no. 931.
Croton Ehrenbergii, Schl. Linnsea, xix. 248 ; DC. Prodr. xv. pt.
2, 636. Specimens collected by Mr. C. G. Pringle at Cerro Ventoso
above Pachuca, State of Hidalgo, altitude 2,600 m., 18 August, 1898,
no. 6967, are referred confidently to the above species, notwithstanding
the slightly larger leaves.
Euphorbia dictyosperma, Fisch. & Mey. Ind. Sem. Hort. Petrop.
ii. 37; DC. Prodr. xv. pt. 2, 135. Excellent specimens of this very
characteristic species were collected by Mr. C. G. Pringle on wet mead-
ows of the Sierra de Pachuca, State of Hidalgo, altitude 2,900 m., 13
August, 1898, no. 6960. The species seems not to have been hitherto
recorded from Mexico.
Styrax Ramirezii. Tree, 9 to 12 m. high: branchlets finely ferru-
