metry in C E, and B C G a, plane cutting the vertical zone at right
angles. Let P represent the vertical crystallographic axis, D the
direction of extinction on (010), A (9 and B the optic axes. Let 0' P^
be the rectangular projection of P on B C G, 0' representing the sim-
ilar projection of on B G. Further, let O'D' be the direction of
extinction on BOG, and A' (/ and B' 0' respectively the lines of inter-
section of the planes A 0' and BOO' with the plane B C G. Let
the angle B C B' ^ C, ZP A = a, ZP B = /3, ZP'O'A' = a',
ZP'd'B' = /3'. We have also ZP'O'B' = 6 and ZPOB^p.
This construction represents an application of Fresnel's fundamental
law that, for a biaxial mineral, the direction of extinction in any section
is found by taking the intersection of the plane of the section with that
which bisects the angle between the two planes respectively containing
an optic axis and the line (ray of light), perpendicular to the section.

Equation (2) is a special case of Michel Levy's general formula on
page 65 of the " Mineralogie Micrographique," and also of the new for-
mula by Cesaro for expressing the extinction on any face of a zone.*
The mathematical treatment of these expressions shows that, as the sec-
tion moves continuously from the position (010) to the position (100),
it will pass through an intermediate position of maximum extinction if
the angle 2 F be less than 90°, or the angle (a + /3) greater than 90°.
Thus, has a maximum when cos c = .f This is true of
