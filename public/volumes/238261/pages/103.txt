Products of the Reaction Soluble in Water.
The first step in purifying tlie products of the reaction of soclic ethyl-
ate on tribromdiuitrobenzol in the cold consisted in washing with water ;
the highly colored wash waters were concentrated, and acidified with
acetic acid, which produced a flocculent precipitate ; this was dissolved
in dilute alcohol, filtered, and the hot filtrate treated with an aqueous
solution of baric hydrate. On cooling, beautiful leaf-like lemon-yellow
crystals of a barium salt separated, which, after purification by recrystal-
lizing from water, were dried at 100°, and the barium determined with
the following result : — -
0.3916 gram of the salt gave 0.1446 gram of baric sulphate.
Calculated for
[Con.(OC,U3)(NO,)20]oBa2noO. Found.
Barium 21.78 21.71
The retention of the two molecules of water at 100° is certainly strange,
especially as the salt changed from lemon-yellow to orange on heating,
evidently from loss of water, and, as therefore this analysis was not suf-
ficient to establish the identity of the substance, we prepared the free
phenol by decom[)osing the barium salt with acetic acid. It was recrys-
tallized from alcohol, until it showed the constant melting point 77°,
when it was dried in vacuo, and analyzed with the following result : —
0.2125 gram of the substance gave 22.1 c.c. of nitrogen at a tempera-
ture of 15° and a pressure of 752 mm.
Calculated for
C(iH2OUO0.,Il5(NO2)3. Found.
Nitrogen 12.28 12.11
The body is therefore a dinitroresorcine monoethylether, and seems to
be identical with that discovered by Aroidieim* by treating nitrosoresor-
cine ethylether with nitric acid, as the descriptions of the appearance
and solubilities of the two bodies coincide, but Aronheim gives the melt-
ing point 75°, whereas we found 77°. It seemed necessary therefore to
establish the identity of our body more firmly, and this was done by
saponifying a specimen of it by boiling for half an hour with a sulphuric
acid of specific gravity 1.44. As the dinitroresorcine thus obtained
melted at 212° our body has the symmetrical structure
OHI.OC2H55.NO22.NO24,
