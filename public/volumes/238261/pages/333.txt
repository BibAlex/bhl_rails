more than lialf as long again as the head and pronotum together in the
male, luteous, faintly infuscated apically. Pronotum well arched, in no
way tectate, but with a delicate percurrent median carina in the middle
of a gradually diminishing but percurrent luteo-testaceous median stripe,
the remainder of the disk ferrugineo-fuscous, the lateral lobes the same
with a strongly oblique anterior and inferior luteo-testaceous patch, edged
above with fuscous fading superiorly ; prozona roundly produced anteriorly,
slightly shorter than the metazona, which is very slightly broader than
at the eyes, posteriorly rectangulate (^) or faintly obtusangulate (9),
the angle narrowly rounded. Prosternal spine moderate, cylindrical,
blunt, erect or suberect. Tegmina extending well beyond the abdomen,
slender, with a pallid luteous streak basally in the costal area, in the male
otherwise immaculate or nearly so, in the female sparsely and rather
feebly maculate in the median area and particularly along the median line,
all the maculations small ; wings vitreous, with an exceedingly feeble
infumation, most distinct apically. Fore and middle femora not enlarged
in the male ; hind femora ferrugineo-testaceous, with hoary outer face
and the carinas punctate with fuscous ; hind tibia3 ferrugineo-testaceous,
the spines luteous with black tips. Male cerci very small, straight, hardly
twice as long as broad, ta})ering to a blunt rounded tip ; subgenital plate
slender, haustrate, somewhat compressed, subacuminate, apically narrowly
and not very deeply fissate.

I know of no species of Schistocerca in which the male cerci are so
narrow at apex as here ; the next species is the most closely allied in
that respect.
