the same material over and over again, and it introduces a complication
which might seriously retard the speed of attaining equilibrium, and
hence the constancy of the desired point.
After studying with care the published records of all the field of inor-
ganic chemistry, about two dozen salts were selected as probably suitable
lor the work in hand. Of these magnesic and nickelous sulphates, calcic
and nickelous nitrates, nickelous chloride and borax were rejected as
being too inconstant in their indications. The lack of constancy was due
sometimes to the smallness of the latent heat of transition, and sometimes
to a superabundance of crystalline hydrates. On the other hand, at least
eight of the new salts gave results comparable in certainty with those
given by the ever trustworthy Glauber's salt. These salts are given in
the table below.

The temperatures given above are only approximations, and are sul)-
ject to future revision ; at this stage of the work our effort has been only
to determine if the points were constant, and not to fix their absolute
value. Besides these nine, several other salts promise well. Baric
hydrate, given above, was our first trial of three components, for the car-
bonate was naturally allowed to be present. The study of such quintuple
points has now been interrupted by Messrs. Meyerhoffer and Saunders's
claim.
