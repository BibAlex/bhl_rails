F is evidently the temperature on Fourier's hypothesis within the
parallelepiped, if its bases and sides are kept at the temperatures F^, F„
and V respectively, when the How is steady. In this case the specific
conductivity of the material of which the liomogeneous parallelepiped is
made does not aftect the temperatures within the solid, and the lelative,
not the absolute, dimensions of the parallelopiped are of importance. Tiie
interpretalion of the equation (21) when/(^) and 6 are assumed to be
different is obvious.

co-ordmate plane z ■=. 0^ is contniuous, as are -7^ , -,^ , -?r-\ , in tne

region It, bounded by the planes 2 = 0, z = I. Within R, V satisfies
9 V ,9- V
the equation -^^-~ = <r ^ ., • V vanishes when z ^ I, and has tlie

constant value J'^ when c = 0, whatever t is. If, when < = 0, F= Fo^(c)

If <^ (z) has the constant value c,

where T=P /a'^TrK
Equation (23) would give, on Fourier's assumptions, the temperatures
at any time within a homogeneous infinite plane lamina of thickness I
initially at the uniform temperature c V^, if, from the time ^ = 0, one face
were kept at the constant temperature Fq and the other at the constant
temperature zero.
