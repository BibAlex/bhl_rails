San Juan Bautista bay, Juan Fernandez island, from Salimas point to Bacalao
point (H. 0., 1267).
The western coast of Mexico from San Bias to Tehuantepec {H. 0., 622, 932,
933; details 876, 915, 936, and 938).
Tuget sound (C. S., 6450, 6460).
Transportation occurs along nearly the whole firth of Forth shore (Scot., 32,
33, 40, 41).
The northeast coast of Ireland has entered adolescence (Ireland, 8, 14, 20, 21, 29).
The area of moderate relief in the region of Dublin, from Dundruni bay to
Wicklow head (Ireland 60, 61, 70, 71, 81, 82, 92, 102, 112, 121, 130), shows con-
tinuous transportation alongshore and other typical features of adolescence.
The eastern coast of Jutland from Skagen to Horsens (Denm., Skagen, Frede-
rickshavn, Aalborg, Mariager, Stavnshoved, Skanderborg). The offsets and river
deflections indicate a prevailing current from the left. The shoreline is here much
simplified, and for the most part in long swinging curves, but the initial outlines
are still seen in the fjorded bays, therefore the shoreline is classed as adolescent
approaching maturity.
The east coast of Kiigen island (Germ., 42, 64). See also hypsometric map by
Dr. R. Credner which shows the simplification of a very irregular shoreline.*
The southeast coast of MiJen and Falster (Denm., Moensklint, Vordingborg,
Gjedser).t The offsets and stream deflection indicate a prevailing current from the
northeast.
Part of the northeast coast of Schleswig-Holstein (Germ., 39, 58, 59, 60).
Southern coast of Sweden (Swe., 1, 2, 3). Tiie streams are deflected to the left,
which indicates a dominant current from the right.
The eastern shore of the Cattegat southward from Warberg (Swe., 4, 8, 13, 18).
Portions of the coast of Greece (Attica, VIII, XI, XVII).
The southeast coast of Arabia on the map by S. B. Haines.|
The coast of Tunis (Tunis, VII, XIV, XXI, etc.).
The northwest shore of the Black sea (Rus., A, 19, 33 ; 2\tlas Univ., 38).

Depression : Maturity. — The west coast of Italy from Punta Rianca southward
to the land-tied island, Massoncello (Ital., 96, 104, 111, 112, 119).
The west coast of the Italian "foot" (Ital., 228, 229, 236).
The western coast of Jutland (Atlas Univ., 30; Denm., Thisted, L(>gstur, Lok-
ken, liirshals, Skagen). A prevailing current from the right is indicated by the
offsets.
