If one is to measure the quantity of heat that passes through a portion
of the disk, lying within a cylindrical surface of revolution of relatively
small radius co-axial with the disk, it is desirable to make the ratio of a
to I so large that possible changes in the edge temperatures shall not
sensibly affect the temperatures at any point within the portion in ques-
tion. It will be sufficient for our purpose to consider the temperatures
at a distance / from the axis in a homogeneous disk for which a = 5 /.
It is evident that the greatest effect of temperature changes on the edge
of the disk will apppear at those points on the inside cylindrical portion
nearest the edge, tliat is, farthest from the axis.
Taking the formula
e = ^ (1 - 2 n - 2 7;_,) + 2^0 • T'.-. + 2 ^, . t; ,
and using the values of T' given in Table VI., we see that, if Q^ = 100° C-
and $1 = 0° C, and, if the whole edtre is kept at the temperature 0° C.,
