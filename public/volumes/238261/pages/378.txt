ROBINSON AND GREENMAN. — GENUS MONTANOA. 509
south as the Andes of Ecuador. Three natural subgenera are readily
recognizable.
Subg. 1. Eriocarpha. Heads snaall, numerous, corymbose : ligules
2 to 5 or : pales conspicuously, densely, and permanently silky-villous,
the spinescent tip mostly recurved in fruit: leaves various, 3-nerved. —
Eriocarpha, Cass. 1. c. Montagncea § Eriocarjihce, DC. Prodr. v. 564.
Eriocoma, HBK. Nov. Gen. & Spec. iv. 267. — Seven species, all
Mexican.
* Ligules none : disk-flowers only 3 or 4.
1. M. anomala. Branches lignescent, pithy, obscurely 4-angled,
striate, retaining only short and sparse remnants of a pubescence which
in the early stages of growth is evidently copious and silvery : leaves
opposite even up to the inflorescence, petiolate, the uppermost (the only
ones known) suborbicular, bioader than long, 4 cm. in length, 5 cm. in
breadth, mucronulate-denticulate, not lobed, puberulent and scabrous
above, rusty-tomentose beneath: panicle round-topped, 1.8 dm. broad;
the branches and linear bractlets tomentose ; heads crowded ; involucral
scales about 5, uniseriate, linear to linear-lanceolate, silky-villous on the
outer surface : corollas densely pubescent except on the tube below. —

character is noted. — Collected by Bourgeau in the Valley of Cordova,
Vera Cruz, Mexico, 16 March, 1866, no. 2057.
* * Ligules present, (2 to) 5; disk-flowers usually more numerous.
1- Bracts of the involucre, during antliesis, 2.5 to 4 mm. long.
■M- Leaves ovate, ovate-deltoid, or lanceolate, sometimes crenate-toothed and
hastate, but not otherwise lobed ; petioles wingless.
= Leaves crenate-dentate, with base mostly obtuse, truncate, or cordate.
2. M. FLORiBUNDA, Sch. Bip. Branching shrub, 1.5 to 2.5 m. high:
branches terete, striate, tomentose, at length glabrate : leaves all or nearly
all opposite, ovate or more commonly deltoid-ovate, acute, rounded or
more often truncate or broadly cordate at the base, shallowly crenate-
dentate, 3 to 6 cm. long, often as broad, scabrous above, more or less
sordid-tomentose beneath ; petioles 1 to 2 cm. long, tomentose, usually
naked, rarely appendaged near the leaf-blade : panicle corymbose, the
branches slender, much exceeding the leafy bracts : disk-flowers about
15 ; ligules 5, from 5.5 to 7 mm. long. — Sch. Bip. in Koch, Wochenschr.
