example of a mature bay-delta, although there is some doubt as to the
early stages of this example.
Other Examples. — In Cliehalis river, Wasliington, the delta has filled not only
the drowned valley, but has also considerably filled North and South bays between
the nipped coast and the bar (C. S., 643).
A similar case is WiUapa river, Washington (C. S., 681", 642, and 6180).
Solkjoer river ha.s completely filled its ria (Denm., Skamliiigs Banke), except
for a small pond. The deflection of the mouth is to the left, indicating a current
from the right.

Taubaek (Denm., Nibe).
Kastbjerg (Denm., Mariager).
Narenta river has nearly filled the drowned portion of its valley (Austr. 33,
XVII).
The Guadalhoree river has filled its ria; also the Ve'Iex (Spain, Bol. XVII,
1991, Lam. A ; XVIII, 1892, Lam. A).
Lake Bay-deltas. — Lakes whose basins are portions of river valleys
frequently show, at the end where the stream enters, deltas of similar form
to those mentioned above. These deltas show almost complete river
intention, since ocean currents and tides do not affect them, and the
narrow water bodies do not permit the winds to stir up very destructive
waves.
The delta of the Ticino river in lake Maggiore, Italy, is a typical example
(Pet. Geog. Mitt., Erg. XIV., Nr. 65, 1881, Taf. III.).
See also the delta of the Rhone in lake Geneva (Carta Geologica d' Italia,
Roma, 1889) ; that of the Aare in lake Neuchatel (Swiss, VIII, and Carta dell'
Italia Superiore, by 11. Lcnzinger, Ziirich) ; etc.
