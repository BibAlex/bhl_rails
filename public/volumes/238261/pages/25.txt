to notice the seemingly anomalous sequence of values in the terms of
the series for T. In fact, the relations between the successive terms
is, for some cases that we have studied, so complicated that the detec-

y â€” when r ^= a^ whatever s is, and equation (24) can be written in
the form
V= F(l - 2 n - 2 r,_,) + 2 F, n + 2 To r,_,.
