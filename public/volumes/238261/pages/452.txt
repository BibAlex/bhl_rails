JUSTIN WINSOR.
The career of Justin Winsor is remarkable both for what he accom-
plished, and for the way in which he accomplished it. There is a proverb
that a man must make his mark before he is thirty, or he will never
make it at all ; but at that age Mr. Winsor had done little to attract
public attention, or to give certain promise of great future usefulness and
renown. The forces of his nature were still maturing, and it was not
until the middle point of life had been passed that lie gave proof of
effective power. But the right opportunity had no sooner been presented
than his intellectual resources and the vigor of his character were
displayed with marvellous rapidity. Every decade revealed him as a
leader in some new field of work, and in each he was a pioneer and a
master.
He was born in Boston on January 2, 1831, and got his early
education there. As a boy he was exceedingly fond of reading, and kept
a diary in which he entered many statistics, scraps of history, and mis-

did not enter Harvard College until he was more than eighteen years
old, — rather an advanced age for a Boston boy in those days. Ilis child-
