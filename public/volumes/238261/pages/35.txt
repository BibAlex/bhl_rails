the temperature at no point within the cylinder of radius I co-axial with
the disk differs by more than 0°.02 from the temperature at the corre-
sponding point in an infinite disk of the same tliickness and same face
temperatures. In practice there is always a gradual fall in edge temper-
atures as z increases from to /, and in such a case we may consider a
guard ring of width 4/ amply large- enough to make the final temperatures
within a right cylinder of radius / and thickness I sensibly ecjual to those
within an infinite slab of the same thickness and same face temperatures.
In our experimental work we have sometimes found it desirable to
introduce between two slabs of low conductivity a thin sheet of tinfoil of
comparatively very high conductivity. It is evident that under con-
ceivable conditions such a layer of metal might seriously affect the final
temperatures in the slabs near their common axis. To investigate the
disturbances that miglit arise from this cause, we may apply the solution
of Problem 5 given above to the extreme case where the uniform edge
temperature is equal to one of the face temperatures, and where ki — k^.
If we attempt to compute numerical values of the series

by using the expression for A^ given in equation (32), we shall find the
amount of labor involved enormous ; we will therefore change the form
of the expression so as to make the nature of its dependence upon the
dimensions of the cylinders and upon their conductivities more evident,
keeping in mind the fact that the ratio of ^o to ki is very large. If we
denote the denominator of the second member of (i32) by D, and write
«=sinh~^s', « -f 8 = sinh~ ^ s", and Mo^sinh^^s,
