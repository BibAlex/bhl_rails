of the purest obtainable copper of equal cross section. Our finest wire
thermal elements, less than one tentli of a millimeter in diameter, were
so skilfully made by Mr. Sven Nelson, of Cambridge, that the joint was
hardly perceptible. Our German silver and copper ribbon thermal ele-
ments, about one eighth of a millimeter thick, were made by Mr. T. W.
Gleeson of Boston. These last were first soldered with the help of a
holder constructed for the purpose, and the joint was then rolled or
scraped until it was as nearly as might be of the same thickness as the
adjacent nietal.
For wire thermal elements we had large quantities of three kinds of
platinoid, approximately 0.74, 0.30, and 0.097 mm. in diameter. The
first two specimens were obtained about ten years ago from Messrs.
Elliott Brothers, and have been thoroughly seasoned. Each is thermo-
electrically pretty definite, though the two are quite different in their
properties. The electromotive force, in microvolts, of [)latinoid and
electrolytically deposited copper elements made of these wires may be
tabulated as follows for low temperatures.

Besides platinoid we have used with copper for wire thermal elements
two kinds of German silver wire respectively about 0.1 mm. and about
