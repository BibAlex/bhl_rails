conditions imposed upon it during its use, the correction for the cool
column projecting into the air may be omitted. This correction, by the
way, may account for the fact that Meyerhoffer and Saunders found
the transition temperature of sodic sulphate to be only 32.35° * instead
of 32.38.°
We are much pleased that the idea should have been grasped with
such eagerness in the laboratory of Professor van't Hoff, for no better
proof could be found of its unquestionable utility. We feel too that
constants of this sort, like atomic weights, should be studied by more
than one set of investigators, and that they should be finally investigated
with the utmost care in the Bureau Internationale des Poids et des
Mesures, and the Reichsanstalt ; hence we are glad to accord to Messrs.
Meyerhotfer and Saunders the right which they demand to investigate
quintuple jjoiuts involving sodie sulphate or sodic carbonate. At the
same time, we feel that our undoubted priority (our preliminary paper
having been finished early in June) allows us to study any desired
portion of this field ; and for the present, feeling that the simpler sys-
tems are the better ones, we shall investigate primarily the salts named
above.

* By a clerical error, Rimbach's table for this correction was stated in our last
paper to be on page 143 of Landolt and Burnstcin's Tables (1894). It is really on
page 95.
