The substance is therefore a bromdinitroresorcine diethylether isomeric
with the one obtained by W. H. Warren and one of us * by the action of
cold sodic ethylate upon the tribroradinitrobenzol and melting at 184°.
As the constitution of this substance has been established (in this paper)
as OC2H5l,OC2ll55,Br3,NOo2,NOo4, it follows that our new bromdi-
nitroresorcine diethylether must have the constitution
OC2H6l,OC2H53,Br5,N022,N024,
as this is the only other body with this composition which can be obtained
from this tribromdinitrobenzol.

This substance crystallizes in white needles thickly crowded into
bunches shaped like hour-glasses ; when better developed, they form
prisms with blunt ends, which seem to be made up of a basal plane
modified by verv minute planes of a pyramid. On long exposure to the
air, especially in bright light, it turns brownish, and this change is ac-
companied by decomposition. It melts at 92° ; and is freely soluble even
in the cold in benzol, ether, chloroform, acetone, glacial acetic acid, car-
bonic disulphide, or acetic ester ; somewhat soluble in cold alcohol, freely
in hot; sparingly soluble in cold ligroin, freely in hot; essentially
insoluble in water whether cold or hot. Ligroin is the best solvent for
it. A hot solution of sodic hydrate has little or no action on it. On
heating it with sodic ethylate it is converted almost quantitatively into
the triethylether of dinitrophloroglucine formed by the replacement of
its atom of bromine by an ethoxy group; the product was recognized
by its melting point 105°, and its other properties. The wash waters
