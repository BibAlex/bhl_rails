acuminate, acute, entire, appressed-tuberculate-hispid above, more or
less ajipressed-hirsute-hispid slightly paler and promiueutly nerved be-
neath : intlorescence terminal ; pedicels 5 to 6 mm. long: calyx 8 to 10 mm.
long, deeply 5-parted, canesceut-hirsute; lobes linear, acute: coroha
4 to 4.0 cm. long, covered externally with a spreading hirsute pubescence;
lobes ovate-oblong, about 8 mm. long, obtuse : stamens nearly or quite
equalling the corolla. — Collected by C. G. Pringle uuder firs, on the
Sierra de Pachuca, State of Hidalgo, altitude 3,000 m., 4 August, 1898,
no. 6949.
Solanum jaliscanum. Stems ligneous, unarmed, covered below
with a grayish-green cortex, the younger branches, as well as the foliage,
pedicels, and calyx, stellate-pubescent : leaves thin, submembranous,
usually in pairs, very unequal in size, the larger 8 to 13 cm. long, 2.5 to
4.0 cm. broad, the smaller less than half as large, obtuse, gradually nar-
rowed at the more or less unequal base into a petiole 5 to 20 mm. in
length, stellate-pubescent on either surface : inflorescence in sessile ex-
tra-axillary umbels : pedicels during anthesis 8 mm. or less in length,
later erect, about 1 cm. long : calyx 5 to 7 mm. long, 5-lobed ; lobes
somewhat irregular, ovate-oblong to oblong-linear, obtuse : corolla rotate,
about 1 cm. in diameter; lobes ovate, acute, externally stellate-pubes-
cent, the upper or inner surface glabrous : stamens equal, about 2.5 mm.
long: fruit globular, smooth, nearly or quite 1 cm. in diameter. — Col-
lected by C. G. Pringle, barranca of Guadalajara, State of Jalisco, 29
June, 1889, no. 2909, and in the same locality, altitude 1,200 m., 10 June,
1898, no. 6870.
A species having the general habit of S. capsicastnim, Link, S. vali-
dum, Rusby, and ;S'. lignescens, Fernald, and perhaps most nearly related
to the last, from which, however, it is distinguished by the larger thinner
leaves, the somewhat smaller corollas, and erect fruiting pedicels.
Solanum jasminifoi.ium, Sendt. in Mart. Fl. Bras. x. 13; DC.
Prodr. xiii. pt. 1, 81. Specimens collected by Mr. C. G. Pringle in
hedges about Cuernavaca, State of Hidalgo, altitude 1,500 m., 25 June,
1898, no. 6901, are referred to the above species, hitherto unreported
from Mexico. The leaves on the specimens at hand from Mr. Pringle
are for the most part simple and entire. Several specimens, however, of
S. jasminifolium in the Gray Herbarium have leaves from entire to
deeply piunatisect, thus indicating considerable variability as to foliage.
It may be said further that it is difficult to separate from this species
the nearly related and also South American !S. hoerhavicefolium, Sendt.
