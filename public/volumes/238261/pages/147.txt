On the western coast of Langeland and at the soutliern point are several enclosed
bays partly filled (Denm., Svendborg, Gulstav). The offsets indicate movements
in both directions.
The bays on the southwest side of Chirikof island, Alaska, sliow several stages
of filling (C. S., 9191, old number 796). The sea built five bars from headland to

headland, in swinging curves satisfactory to itself. In the broadest bay there still
remain two lagoons, but the others are completely filled (Fig. 19).
Kiska harbor on Great Kiska island, one of the Aleutian islands, has three hays
showing three stages of filling. In the central one there is a large lagoon com-
pletely enclosed, in the northern one a small lagoon remains, and in the southern
one the area back of the bar is completely converted into marsh (C. S., 9191).
The alongshore current is here probably from the left, witness overlap of bars to
the right, and streams crowded to right side of bays.
(3) Bay filled (Maturity). â€” The last few examples in the previous section are
as near to mature forms of this kind of bay-bars as have been found in the present
study. Mature stages of bay-bars merge into mature ria-deltas so closely that one
can hardly separate them upon the map. When the bay is filled, the stream
mouthing in the bay will attempt to push forward its delta, and the shore form
