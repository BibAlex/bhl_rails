It is to be noticed that equation (20) would give, on Fourier's assump-
tions, the final temperatures within a homogeneous parallelopiped of spe-
cific internal conductivity k, and of external conductivity h, if the lower
base were kept at the constant temperature Vq and the upper base at the
constant temperature F„ while the sides were exposed to the atmosphere
at the temperature V. In this result the absolute dimensions of the
paralleIopi[)ed are inextricably involved with the value ot h / k.
(2) The square bases of a rectangular parallelopiped of height / are
2 a long and 2 a broad. A function, F, harmonic within this parallelo-
piped, has the constant value Vq at the lower square base, the constant
value Vi at the upper base, and the constant value F on the other faces
of the parallelopiped. If, then, the centre of the lower base be used as
origin of co-ordinates, with axes of x and y parallel to sides of the base,
Fis given by the equation
