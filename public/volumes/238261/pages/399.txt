a. Scales of the involucre 8 to 10 mm. long : achene with a single small earlike
wing in the manner of Otopappus, or with two very unequal wings : Mexican.
68. V. Robinsonii, Fernald iu herb. Otopapinis alternifolius,
Robinson, Pi'oc. Am. Acad. xxvi. 1G5 (1891); 0. Bohinsonii, Klatt,
Ann. Naturh. Hofmus. Wien, ix. oG2 (1894). — Limestone hills, San Jose
Pass, San Luis Potosi, Pringle, uo. 3310. While this species possesses
the typical pappus of Otopappus, its habit, and as we now believe its
genetic relationship, are nearer to Verhesina. The original specific
name, alternifolius, being preoccupied under Verbesina^ the species is
transferred under the next name. To this species may be referred, with
some doubt, V. Ilumholdtil, Klatt, Leopoldiua, xx. 92 (as to pi. Mex.),
not Spreng. V. ITumholdtli, Spreng. ( F. helianthoides, HBK. Nov.
Gen. &, Spec. iv. 204), is supposed to be Ecuadorian and is described by
Ivuuth as having leaves glabrous above, which is not the case here.
