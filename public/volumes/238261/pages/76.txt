EICHARDS AND LEWIS. ZINC AND CADMIUM AMALGAMS. 99
(4) The heat of amalgamation of cadmium is thus found to be +505
gram calories.
(5) The heat of amalgamation of zinc as thus found is â€” 2255 gram
calories.
(6) A solid electrode composed of finely divided electrolyzed metal
gives a very constant and reliable potential.
(7) In the case of cadmium the contact-potential given by the satu-
rated amalgam in reversible relation to an electrolyte differs by the
twentieth of a volt from that given by the metal.
(8) In the case of zinc this difference is very slight.
Cambridge, Mass., October, 1898.
