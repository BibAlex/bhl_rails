Acerates Pringlei. Stems 10 to 20 in clumps, stout, herbaceous,
rather densely and finely pubescent : leaves opposite, short-petiolate,
ovate or ovate-oblong, 6.5 to 10,5 cm. long, 3 to 6 cm. broad, acute,
entire, somewhat truncate or subcordate at the base, rarely slightly nar-
rowed below, sparingly pubescent to essentially glabrous above, paler
and pubescent especially upon the prominent veins beneath; petioles 4 to
14 mm. long, canaliculate and often bearing above at the junction of
the blade several small gland-like bodies : inflorescence lateral, extend-
ing well down on the stem, interpetiolar; peduncles 3 to 8.5 cm. in
length, many-flowered, these as well as the pedicels (1.2 to 1.5 cm. long)
closely pubescent or subtomentose : bracts linear, setaceous, about 6 mm.
long, fugaceous; flowers about 5 mm. high: sepals linear, acute, 4 mm.
long, externally pubescent : lobes of the corolla oblong, 5 mm. in length,
usually slightly retuse at the apex, glabrous, externally more or less
purplish and with the purplish-tinged sepals early reflexed : collar of the
gynostegium short but distinct, the short ovate-oblong incurved-auricled
hoods of the crown exceeding the gynostegium and entirely devoid of
any horn-like process : immature follicles somewhat ovoid or slightly
ovate-oblong, short-acuminate, slightly puberulent : seeds reddish-brown,
smooth, about 8 mm. broad. — Collected by C. G. Pringle, on the Sierra
de Ajusco, State of Morelos, altitude 2,800 m., 21 May, 1898, no. 6853
(in flower), and on the Plan de Salazar, State of Mexico, altitude 3,000 m.,
13 August, 1896, no. 7309 (in fruit).
A species superficially resembling Ascleplas neglecta, Hemsley, but
distinctly different in floral structure.
GoNOLOBUs (§ Chthamalia) bifidus, Hemsl. Biol. Cent.-Am. Bot.
ii. 330. G. (§ ChthamaUa) Schaffneri, Gray, in Hemsl. 1. c. 334.
After a careful examination and comparison of the type specimens repre-
senting these two species there can be no doubt as to their absolute iden-
tity, and the name of Dr. Gray must give way to that of Hemsley by
right of priority of position.
Here also may be referred Pringle's no. 0898, collected on the plains
near Pachuca, State of Hidalgo, altitude 2,500 m., 3 July, 1898.
JpOMCEA NYSiPH^iFOLiA, Griseb. Cat. PL Cub. 203. It is inter-
esting to note that this characteristic "West Indian species was collected
by C. & E. Seler in Chiapas, 11 February, 1896, no. 1802. This
species seems not to have been hitherto reported from Mexico.
Macromeria Pringlei. Stems herbaceous, erect, about 4 dm. high,
branching from a perennial base, subappressed, hirsute-pubescent : leaves
sessile or nearly so, lance-oblong, 5 to 11 cm. long, 1 to 3 cm. broad,
