JACKSON AND KOCH. TRIBROMDINITROBENZOL. 121
the isolation of the following products of the action of sodic ethylate
on tribromdinitrobenzol, melting jioint 192°, when absolute alcohol and
benzol are used as the solvents, and the mixture is allowed to stand at
ordinary temperatures : —
(1) Broradinitroresorcine diethylether CoHBr(OCoH5)o(N02)2, melting
at 184°, (OCoH5).3l,5,Br3,(N02)22,4.
(2) Broradinitroresorcine diethylether CcHBr(0C2H5)2(N02)>, melting
at 92°, (OC2H5)2l,3,Bro,(N02)22,4-
(3) Tribromnitrophenol C6HBr3(N02)OH, melting at 90°, Bra 1,3,5,
^0.2,0 114.
(4) Dinitroresorcine monoethylether C6H2(OC2H5)OII(NOo)2, melting
at 77°, (OC2H5)l,OH5,N022,4.
(5) Dinitrophloroglucine triethylether Con(OC2ll5)3(N02)2, melting at
105°, (OCori5)3l,3,5,(N02)22,4.
These products indicate that there are three primary reactions, when
sodic ethylate acts on tribromdinitrobenzol. These are, Reactions I. and
II., consisting in the replacement of two atoms of bromine by two ethoxy
groups, producing the two isomeric broradinitroresorcine diethylethers
(1) and (2), and Reaction III., in which one uitro group is replaced by
one hydroxyl group (or by an ethoxy group followed by saponification)
giving the tribromnitrophenol (3). There are also two secondary reac-
tions owing to the further action of sodic ethylate on the products of
Reactions I. and II. ; first, the replaceraent of the bromine in the brora-
dinitroresorcine diethylether (1) by an atora of hydrogen (followed by
partial saponification) giving the dinitroresorcine monoethylether (4) ;
and secondly, the replacement of the bromine in the bromdiuitroresorcine
diethylether (2) by an ethoxy group giving the dinitrophloroglucine tri-
ethylether (5). The saponification mentioned in this paragraph might
be brought about by the sodic hydrate formed from the sodic ethylate by
the water added in the course of the purification, but it seems to us more
probable that the phenols were formed by some sodic hydrate acting
directly on the tribromdinitrobenzol, since the ethers of the phenols
seemed decidedly stable, when treated with an alkali.
The following estimations of the approximate yields of the products
give a rough idea of the extent to which each of the three primary
reactions ran : —
Reaction I., forming substances (1) and (4) . . . 28 per cent.
Reaction II., forming substances (2)and (5) . . . 38 per cent.
Reaction III., forming substance (3) 1 per cent.
Total G7 per cent.
