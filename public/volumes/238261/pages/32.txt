and from this expression, with the help of the numbers in the body of
Table IV., many special problems can be solved with very little labor.
The expression
A (1 _ 2 7; - 2 ?;_,) + 2 B Ti._,+ 2di.T^+ (0, - 5) (l - ^)
gives the final temperatures in a homogeneous disk of radius a and
height I, one face {z =. 0) of which is kept at the uniform temperature
^0, the other face (s = /) at the uniform temperature 0i, and the rim at
constant temperatures given by the law A -\- (0(i — B) il — ,) . From
this we may see, that, with a very rude approximation to a uniform
gradient in the temperatures of the edge of a disk of relatively large
thickness, the final temj^eratures on the axis are sensibly the same as for
an infinite disk of the same thickness.
