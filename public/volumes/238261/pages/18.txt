PEIRCE AND WILLSON. THERMAL CONDUCTIVITIES. 7
It is usually assiiiued that i« continuous at the surface of separation
of two isotropic solids of different conductivities. If Hi and n.^ are nor-
mals at a [)oint of such a surface drawn into the first and second conduc-
tors respectively, aud if the flow of heat is steady,

If the temperature differences within a body are comparatively slight,
we may often use Fourier's assumption and representy" (6^) approximately
by itself. As we shall need to compare the solutions of certain simple
problems in the steady flow of heat obtained on this hypothesis with the
corresponding solutions obtained ou the assumption that f (&) and 6 are
not identical, we may note certain facts in passing. It is easy to prove
by an elementary application of Green's Theorem that a function, F,
which is harmonic within a given closed surface S, and which upon two
given portions, Sy and ASg, of S has the constant values Ci and C2 respect-
ively, while at every other part of S its normal derivative is zero, is
determined by these conditions. If this function has been found, it is
easy to write down the unique function
F's^^5|-' F+^^i^^^-, (15)
which is harmonic within S, has the constant value C x on *S'i and the
constant value 0\ on S^^ and the normal derivative of which vanishes
at all points of S which do not belong to Sy oi' ^'i- T^'^ families of sur-
faces defined by the equations, F= constant, V = constant, are identi-
cal. If, therefore, two given portions of the surface of a solid isotropic
conductor in which there is a steady How of lieat be kept at constant
temperatures (Ci and G.) while there is no flow across the rest of its
surface, the function F, which on Fourier's hypothesis gives the tem-
peratures at all points within the solid, is connected with the function
K', which gives /(6') on the assumption that this is not identical with 6
itself, by means of the equation

and the forms of the isothermal surfaces are inde23endent of the form of
the function f.
