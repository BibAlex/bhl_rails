second typical pit manifestly of younger generation, but with its A B
steeper than A D. Brauns found on the etched surface of sylvite neigh-
boring pits bounded by figure-faces of different steepness, but he does
not seem to have connected the phenomenon with the difference of
maturity of the two pits. (See Nuues Jahrbuch fur Miu., etc., 1889,
Bd. I. p. 113.)
Either of these types of dark figures may show a keel at the intersec-
tion of a pair of figure-faces (Plate I. Fig. 23 b).
It was in connection with the study of the pits on (010) of actinolite
that I became convinced of the necessity of fixing a standard degree of
dilution of the hydrofluoric acid before beginning a series of comparative
experiments in etching the araphiboles. The problem could be here
more successfully attacked than in the examination of the figures on
(110) because of tlie greater likeliiiood of being able to observe differ-
ences in the shape or arrangement of the systematically straight-edged
pits on (010). Six cleavage pieces of Zillerthal actinolite were immersed
in II F, either in the form of pure gas or in different states of dilution
with water. The procedure and the results are synopsized in the accom-
panying table, which shows the effects on the angles A D H 3ind BAD
of the dark figures under the different conditions (Figure 6).*

No. 1 was etched by hanging it above the surface of some concentrated
water solution of the acid, that was very gently heated far below its
boiling point, and thus only a small percentage of water vapor could be
present during the reaction. The other examples were etched in the
ordinary way on a water bath. The percentages of dilution are by
volume.
The effect of dilution with water is, then, to produce a rotation of
each dark figure about a line perpendicular to the crystal plane. The
direction of the rotation is opposite to that of the hands of a watch, its
amount (within the limits of these experiments) about 30Â°. Along
