Holland (Atlas Univ., 26) is in large part a great confluent delta formed largely
by the Rhine and adjacent streams.
The Nile is a raulti-cuspate-lobate delta (Brit. Ad. 2673, 2630; Credner, loc.
cit., 2).
3. Cuspate Deltas* — The typical example of a cuspate delta is given in Figure 29.
The two gently swinging shore curves, concave seawards, with their dune-lined
beaches, are the work of the sea.
At the point of intersection of these
two curves the river empties. The
form of the land siiows that, if it
were not for the river, there would
not be any cusp here, as there is
no projecting point in the oldland
to cause eddies in the currents.
The evidence from tiie turning of
the mouths of the small streams
both to right and left indicates
that the direction of current motion
alongshore is probably sometimes
in one direction, and sometimes in
the reverse. The smaller streams
on each side of the river's mouth
are deflected away from the point
of the cusp, indicating that the
delta mass divided an onshore
current and turned it to the right
and left, carrying the river sediment
from the river along the shore.
Farther from the river, both on
the right and left sides, there are
streams deflected toward the mouth
of the main stream. There is here
evidently no dominant movement
in either direction along the shore.
A former stage of the delta is
indicated by the ridge of geologi-
cally older material, which is repre-
sented in the figure by the broken
line. This earlier stage of the delta
front is seen to have a rounded
— outline. This suggests that for-
Tiber, merly there was a dominant move-
ment alongshore. Back of this
former shoreline are seen areas of
marsh, filled lagoons, or lowland behind the old beach. Since this leap from
some still earlier position of the shoreline, the forward growth seems to have been
Kilometers
