DALY. • — ETCH-FIGURES ON AMPHIBOLES, 429
nous amphiboles, signalized by the two-group division of all our hand-
books, is once more confirmed. At the same time, attention has been
again called to the overwhelming importance of a sesquioxide, whether
iron oxide or alumina, in the mineral.
Glaucophane and gastaldite are the same species, and both isomorphous
with hornblende.*
Arfvedsonite appears to hold a more or less independent place in the
family of amphiboles. '
Barkevikite is more closely related to common hornblende than to
arfvedsonite.f
Anthophyllite and gedrite are plainly orthorhombic and holohedral.
Aenigmatite diverges considerably from the amphibole habit, but be-
trays a tendency toward symmetrical cohesional property, as it does
toward crystallographic symmetry. t
Lastly, it is believed that our present methods of determination of
species can be reinforced by the detailed study of mineral groups with
respect to etching. The peculiarities of the pits on the cleavages of
riebeckite, arfvedsonite, and barkevikite make it easy to say to which
of these a given cleavage flake belongs. Similarly, the differentiation
of crossite and glaucophane, difficult as it often is by purely optical
methods, is ready at hand if the mineral be etched on (110). The
striking characteristics of the Philipstad hornblende (V. 101) first became
evident in the process of etching cleavage pieces. Its description as a
new variety will form the sequel to this paper.

are isomorphous with amphibole [proper], but it is not yet proved." Neues Jahrb.

t The same opinion is held by Lacroix, chiefly on optical grounds (Mine'ralo-
gie de la France, Tom. I. p. 561) ; the opposite opinion by Brogger (Zeit. fiir Kryst.,
Bd. XVI. p. 414), followed by Dana (System, p. 403), and Hintze (Handbuch.
p. 1256).
