BCUDDER. â€” THE GENUS SCHISTOCERCA. 473
those sent to me by Professor Bruner from Argentina, while engaged in
studying its ravages there. His report states that it occurs not only in
Argentina, but in " the adjoining portions of Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil,
Bolivia, and Chile." Burmeister received it from the valley of the Pa-
rana, whence it derives its name. Its home, according to Bruner, appears
to be to the north of the settled district of Santa Fe, Cordoba, and
Entre Rios.

The single female I have seen was taken " two hundred and fifty miles
off the west coast of South America."

42. Schistocerca cancellata.
Acridium cancellatum Serv., Orth., 664 (1839) ; Blanch., Gay, Hist. Fis. Chile,
Zool., VI. 71 (1849).
I have specimens from Chile which agree perfectly with the descriptions
of the original specimens from the same country. There is also a speci-
men in the Cambridge Museum from Para, July. It differs but little
from S. americana, and may perhaps be regarded as a mere race of that
species.
Blanchard in Gay's Chile refers to a figure of this species in the atlas
of that work (Plate 2, Figure 7), but I cannot discover that more than
one plate of Orthoptera was ever published. Four copies have been
examined in a vain search for more.
