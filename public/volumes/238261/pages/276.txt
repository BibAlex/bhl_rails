enough confidence in the generalization from certain types to all types.
The systematic investigation was almost entirely pursued in the labora-
tory of Professor Lacroix, and I desire to acknowledge, in particular,

the etching.
The list of specimens is self-explanatory. For convenience I have
followed Dana's classification closely, without however implying an
absolute adherence to all its details. I have inserted the catalogue num-
bers of the Museum specimens, sometimes the date of collection, and,
where possible, leading references to original papers in connection with
those specimens that have furnished particular descriptions or material
practically identical with them. An asterisk denotes a specimen "pre-
sumably similar to the classic material from the same locality. The
source of each specimen is indicated in the general list by letters pre-
fixed to the number corresponding. H. — Heidelberg, V. = Vienna,
