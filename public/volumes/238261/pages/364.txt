specimens, as a sheet in the herbarium of the New England Botanical
Club from Revere, Mass. {Young), a taller but slender small-headed
plant from Framingham, Mass. {E. C. Smith), specimens from Harlan
County, Kentucky (^Kearney, no. 27), and from Indian Territory {Bush,
nos. 632, 633), connect this variety directly with typical E. ohtusa.
Var. gigantea. — Figs. 11, 12. — Culms stout and tall, 5 to 8 dm.
high : heads ovate-oblong, 9 or 10 mm. long, 5 mm. broad: scales ovate,
dark brown : achene as large as in the species, the broad obcordate tuber-
cle not depressed, about five eighths as high as the achene. — E. ovata,
var. gigantea, Clarke in Britton, Jour. N. Y. Microsc. Soc. v. 103
(nomen nudum). E. obtusa, Watson, Bot. Calif, ii. 222, in part, not
Schultes. — Cascade Mts., "Oregon" (i. e. Washington), 49° N. Lat.,
1859 {Lyall) ; bogs near New Westminster, British Columbia, Aug. 28,

plant collected by Mr. Howell in Multnomah County, Oregon, July,
1877 (no. 409), and by Professor Macoun at Agassiz, British Columbia,
May 20, 1889, has the smaller achene capped by a large tubercle, thus
connecting this variety with the typical form of the species.
++ ++ Heads lanceolate : scales pale, acute.
E. lanceolata. — Figs. 27 to 29. — Culms slender, almost capillary,
erect, 2 dm. high : heads 5 to 8 mm. long, 2 mm. broad, acutish : the
hyaline green-ribbed scales subappressed : achene broadly obovate, with a
scarcely depressed tubercle one half its height. — Collected in central
