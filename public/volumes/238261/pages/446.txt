were charted on a map and lines of equal' departure drawn. These lines
are shown in Plates VII. and VIII. The continuous lines show plus
departures and the broken lines show minus departures. The results
show that there were distinct centres of oscillation which had a move-
ment in space. From this it follows that the phase of the period at any
one point on the earth's surface will reverse, and the range and form of
the cycle cannot be found from averages of observations taken at one
point during a great many periods.
The next period which attracted my attention were oscillations in the
temperature of about thirty and of about seven days. The results of these
investigations were published in the American Meteorological Journal for
June and August, 1895. The seven-day period was found to be about
one fourth the length of the thirty-day period, and hence was assumed
to be a harmonic of the latter. (American Journal of Science, March,
1894.) By grouping the phenomena into periods of three years, I found
a certain constancy in the average position of the maxima and minima
of the seven-day period, and ascertained the length of the period as
7 days G.4 hours. In 1894, with the assistance of Mr. Sweetland, I
ascertained the range of all the periods which were multiples of this
length up to fifty-eight days. It was found that the period of about
twenty-nine days gave the greatest range, and this led me to consider
whether the synodic rotation of the moon was concerned in the matter.
It was found that the length of my seven-day period would be of the
same length as one quai'ter of the synodic rotation of the moon if the
number of periods had been assumed one less in the three-year groups in
which I had arranged the phenomena. It followed that the lunar period
