638 I'UOCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY.
NOT E.
SiNXF. the jqjpearance of this table last year, the Committee of the Ger-
jiian Chemical Society, Messrs. Landolt, Ostwald, and Seubert, have made
their interesting report upon the subject, and have invited the chemists of
the world to join them in deciding upon one standard to be used everywhere.
The fulfilment of this very desirable end must necessarily be a matter of
many months ; hence the present table is republished this year in accordance
with the original iilan. Jt is to be distinctly understood that the repub-
lication is not in any way an attempt to compete with or to foi-estall the
International Committee ; it is merely an expression of opinion, which may
be of temporary service. The fact that none of the other recent tables
follow the accepted scientific usage concerning significant figures seems to
afford an additional reason for reprinting this one.
The investigations of the past year have pointed to a change in four
values given in the table of 1898. Calcium is made 40.1 instead of 40; for
recent experiments (as yet unpublished) in this Laboratory indicate that
last year's estimate was too low. Neo- and praseodymium were oddly
transposed by their discoverer, and the more accurate values of Jones * and
others are substituted. Lastly, Lenher's f careful investigation upon sele-
nium seems to show that this element has a higher atomic weight than was
formerly supposed to belong to it. For,the present a compromise number,
79.2, is recorded above.
