This species is known only from the Gahipagos, and has been found
on Chatham, Hood, Tower, and Charles Islands, the forms occurring on
each island, or on all but the last, being distinct enough to be regarded
as races, as I have pointed out in the paper above cited, where nine points
of distinction are tabulated.

This is known to me only from the Galapagos Archipelago, where ii
has been found on Charles, Albemarle, Indefatigable, Chatham, Jervis,
Barrington, James, and Duncan Islands; but it is also credited by Walker

Galapagos, quoted above, I have discussed at length the distinct types
which appear to be forming ou the different islands.
