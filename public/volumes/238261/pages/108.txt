ON CERTAIN DERIVATIVES OF SYMMETRICAL
TRICHLORBENZOL.
By C. Loring Jackson and F. H. Gazzolo.
Presented October 12, 1898. Received October 20, 1898.
In a paper by Sidney Calvert and one of ns,* the behavior of tri-
bromiodbenzol Br3l,3,5,r2, and of tetrabrombeuzol Br4l,2,3,5, with
sodic ethylate was studied, and it was shown that the atom of iodine
(or the atom of bromine in the corresponding position) was replaced by
hydrogen under these conditions, giving the symmetrical trihroml^enzol.
It seemed of interest in this connection to study the corres[)onding tri-
chlor compounds, that is, the trichloriodbenzol and the trichlorbrorabenzol,
to see whether the loosening effect of the three chlorine atoms might
not be even greater than that of the three atoms of bromine, and thus
make it possible that these substances would react with other. agents
beside sodic alcoholates, which were the*only reagents that had any such
effect upon the bromine compounds.
At that time it was not worth while to undertake tlie work, because of
the great difficulty in preparing symmetrical trichloraniline, but since
this obstacle has been removed by the beautiful method of Victor Meyer
and Siidborough,t we have prepared these compounds and studied some
of their relations. Trichloriodbenzol, Cl3l,3,o,I2 melts at 55°; and by
treatment with sodic elhylate dissolved in alcohol and benzol yielded
symmetrical tricldorbeuzol recognized by its melting point 04° and two
analyses. It therefore behaved like the tribromiodbenzol under these
conditions. All our other attempts to obtain a simple replacement of
the iodine in this substance failed, so that it is no more reactive than the
tribromiodbenzol. Fuming nitric acid converted the trichloriodbenzol
into the trichlordinitrobeuzul melting at 129°, iodine being set free.
