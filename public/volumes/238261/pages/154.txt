On the inside of the cusp there is a faint cliff where the coast was nipped
after the initial drowning. The central lagoon is nearly all converted

into marsh, a small tidal inlet remaining on the left side with a few small
ramifying branches. The cusp is very perfectly formed by the intersec-
tion of the two curves in a sharp point.
Sand point in Narragansett bay is nearly as typical in form and
position as West point. This point projects from the eastern side of
Prudence island (C. S., 353) into a channel less than two miles broad
and from 10 to 17 fathoms deep, 5.^ fathoms off the point of the foreland.
This cusp is smaller than the average tidal cusp, and it shows no included
Isgoon or marsh. Mr. J. B. Woodworth says that the ice in winter
overrides this cusp, and thus any indications of embryonic form would be
obliterated. The secondary cusp on the left side of the foreland appears
to be due to the collection of sand about rocks or piles driven into the
sand.
A profile has been drawn from another typical cusp, point Wilson
(C. S., 6405), north of Port Townsend, Washington. This drawing (Fig-
ure 24) shows the relation of the foreland to the older mainland. The
broken line indicates the probable initial form of the land following the
depression which inaugurated the present cycle of shore development.
The " foreland" quality of the cusp is here clearly seen ; it is constructed
