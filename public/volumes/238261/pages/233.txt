(010). It seems to have been taken for granted by some writers that
this is not true.*
It is the object of this paper to make a systematic statement of the
relation between the extinction on (110) and on (010), and to indicate
under what conditions the former may be used to determine the latter.
First, there will be deduced a formula to express the extinction on any
plane of the vertical zone when the optical angle 2 Fand p, the angle of
extinction on (010), are known, and a graphic representation of possible
extinctions in that zone will be attempted. Then specific tables will be
introduced to show how 2 V, p, and 6' are related for any variety of
pyroxene or negative amphibole, where 6' represents the extinction on a
cleavage plate of that variety. Secondly, a method is proposed for the
determination of p by means of 6' and a new angle of extinction, 6",
found after turning the cleavage piece through a certain angle about the
vertical axis.
