late fall. This striking difference between the fruiting seasons of the two
plants, as well as the pronounced differences in size, aspect, and range, is
sufficient evidence that the common drab "wool-grass" of our northern
meadows and low thickets should no longer be confused with the more
southern and coarser ferruginous species with which it has been so gen-
erally associated.
A very handsome plant, unlike anything which seems to have been
formerly described, is found by Mr. Luman Andrews in Connecticut.
The plant is apparently an extreme form of Scirpus Eriophorum, but
unlike that species or its var. cyperinus, with short ovoid spikelets, this
stout plant has the glomerulate oblong spikelets often 1 cm. in length.
Occasional luxuriant specimens of S. Eriophorum, however, are found
with the spikelets more elongated than in the type, thus connecting the
Connecticut plant directly with that species.
The plants which have been associated as Scirpus Eriophorum may be
defined as follows.
* Culms stout (just below the involucre averaging 3 mm. in diameter), about 1.25
(rarely 1.5) m. liigh : leaves 4.5 to 11 (average 6) mm. wide: involucre usually
ferruginous at base : scales and bristles ferruginous.
S. Eriophorum, Michx. Inflorescence ample, 1.5 to 2.5 dm. high;
the dichotomous rays of the umbel elongated and drooping at the tips :
spikelets ovate or ovoid-oblong, 3.5 to 6 (average 4.5) mm. long, clus-
tered at the tips of the branchlets, the lateral mostly on distinct generally
elongated pedicels. — Fl. i. 33; Torr. Fl. N. and Middle States, i. 50,
