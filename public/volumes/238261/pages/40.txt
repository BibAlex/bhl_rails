tures betvveeu 0° C. and 100° C. of relatively poor conductors like plates
of stone or glass ; the otiier designed merely for comparing the con-
ductivities of slabs which form a prism or " wall," through which there
is a steady flow of heat.
Of this second form of apparatus, which is much simpler than the other,
we have three of different sizes for plates G5 cm., 35 cm., and 20 cm.
in diameter respectively. Rough diagrams which show the essential
parts of two of these, without their elaborate stands and jackets, are
given in Figures 6 and 7. In each, the prism to be tested is enclosed

between the horizontal planed plates of two castings, which are fastened
firmly together by bolts around their edges to insure close contact with
the body under experiment. Both castings are hollow ; one forms a
jacketed chamber through which steam or mercury vapor may be passed
for an indefinite period. The upper casting, which is provided with a
system of stirrers or scrapers operated by an electric motor, may be
kept at a low temperature by filling it with ice or by sending through
it a steady stream of water from a very large tank within the tower of
the laboratory.
In Figure G, A represents the hot chamber, weighing about two hun-
dred kilograms, which rests in a thick jacket on a heavy table or stand
made to hold it. A is connected directly with one (^B) of two stout-
walled copper boilers, B and i?', each of which holds about 40 litres of
water. A light cup-shaped weight, inverted and laid on a large tube
with squared end which projects above the top of the boiler, acts as a
sensitive safety valve and prevents any appreciable rise in temperature
within the boiler. B can be refilled when necessary with boiling water
