and not yet shown to exist. The interrupted phases of solution are
more reasonably connected with the lamellation of the cleavage parallel
to the plane attacked. Actual microscopic or submicroscopic separation
of layers parallel to this cleavage would present to the solvent action
of the hydrofluoric acid a series of thin plates each of which, strongly
resistant in a direction at right angles to the broad flat surface, would
readily yield, in directions in that surface, i. e. along the grain of the
mineral.
The above mentioned data regarding the highly important Wolfsberg
sub-type refer to conditions of etching described as standard for the
present investigation. Remembering Bomer's conclusion that the tem-
perature of the solvent has, in tlie case of HF and quartz, an influence
on the figures, I have recorded the facts from a number of experiments
intended to test the principle in its application to the group of the com-
mon and basaltic hornblendes. The experiments were made on V. 4G,

Result.
Many poorly defined pits.
Larger poorly defined pits.
Small sliarply defined pits.
Pits numerous, in every
case, some of great sharp-
ness and large enough to
measure.
Pits indistinguishable from
the last, but associated
with etch-hills.
Few but good figures of the
foregoing type.
Throughout the whole series there is such a close correspondence in the
forms and measurements of the figures that we must posit for the latter
an independence of the temperature of the hydrofluoric acid, so far as
any sensible differences are concerned.
Neither temperature nor concentration of acid, nor, indeed, any cause
known to me will explain a notable variation in the shape of the pits on
(110) of the amphiboles now under consideration. It consists in the
appearance of an adventitious fourth figure-face on the southeast side,
in addition to the three usual ones (see Plate I. Fig. 8). There is no
