potassic iodide, starch paste, and dilute sulphuric acid, and also a heavy-
white precipitate with argentic nitrate and nitric acid. To obtain the
organic products of tlie reaction the reddish alcoholic filtrate was allowed
to evaporate spontaneously, and the residue treated with water ; the in-
soluble substance thus obtained was purified by crystallization from alco-
hol, until it showed the constant melting point 81°-82°, when it was
dried in vacuo, and analyzed with the following result : —
I. 0.1236 gram of the substance gave by the method of Carius 0.0684
gram of argentic bromide.
II. 0.2500 gram of the substance gave 18.4 c.c. of nitrogen at a tem-
perature of 23° and a pressure of 754.7 mm.

The substance is therefore a broradinitroresorcine diethylether formed
from the trichlorbromdinitrobeiizol by the replacement of two atoms of
chlorine by ethoxy groups, and of the third by hydrogen. Certain
points in regard to its constitution are settled, since the two ethoxy groups
must be in the meta position to each other, and the atom of bromine and
the two nitro groups are in the symmetrical position to each other. The
radicals therefore are probably arranged as follows,
(C2ll50)2l,3,Br2,(N02)24,6,
but it is possible that one of the ethoxy groups instead of the atom of
hydrogen stands at 5 between the two nitro groups. It is isomeric with
the bromdinitroresorcine diethylether melting at 184°, and made by
Warren and one of us * from tribromdinitrobenzol and sodic ethylate in
the cold, which has the constitution (C2H50)2l,5,Br3,(N02)2,4, and also
with that melting at 92° obtained by Koch and one of us, f as another
product from the same reaction, which has the constitution
(C2H50)2l,3,Br5,(N02)22,4.
The yield of the bromdinitroresorcine diethylether was one gram from
five of tiie trichlorbromdinitrobenzol, that is, about 21 per cent of the
theoretical yield.
