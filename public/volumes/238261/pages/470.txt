THEODORE LYMAN. 663
"In vigorous health, with a personality physical, mental, and moral
which endeared him to all who came in contact with him, happily married,
with instincts and powers which led him to the highest callings, to the
service of his country in the field and in legislative halls, with tastes for
the study of the natural sciences and abundant means to gratify them,
there seemed to be nothing lacking to make his life an ideally happy
one.
" Then, when the shadow of a slow insidious disease fell upon liim, it
seemed for a time as if his life were but to afford another illustration of
the old Greek saying that no man is to be judged ha{)py before his death.
But when I saw how bravely he met the advances of his enemy, and with
what courageous cheerfulness he interested himself in the pursuits of his
friends and in the active life around him in which he could no longer
share, I could not help feeling that a happiness was reserved for him
higher than any of which the Greek philosopher had dreamed, or I, as a
young man, had formed a conception, â€” the hap[)iness of knowing that by
the force of his example he had helped to raise those who came under its
influence to a higher and nobler life."
Henry P. Bowditch.
