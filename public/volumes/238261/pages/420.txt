VIII. â€” PETROGRAPHICAL NOTES ON SOME ROCKS
FROM THE FIJI ISLANDS.

A COLLECTION, consisting of specimens of volcanic rocks from the
various islands of the Fiji group, collected by Mr. Alexander Agassiz
during the winter of 1897-98, was kindly placed in the hands of the
writer for a petrographical study. Each of the islands is, in general,
represented by specimens from one locality only, since the purpose was
to obtain simply an idea of the nature of the island rock, and not to
obtain a complete petrographical knowledge of the islands. In the case
of the very small islands, some of which are simply single exposed rocks,
the specimens collected can be considered as representative, but with the
majority of the islands structural and mineral differences may, and prob-
ably do, exist in the rocks iium different localities. The description,
therefore, of the specimen or specimens from each island, as given in this
paper, cannot be oflTered as the representative petrography of the island.
The Fiji group comprises two large islands, Viti Levu or Great Fiji
and Vauua Levu, together with a multitude of much smaller ones lying
east, south, and west of Viti Levu. Many of these small islands were
visited by Mr. Agassiz, and sjiecimens from about twenty-five of them
were collected.
In 1876 Th. Kleinschmidt visited some of these islands and collected
specimens of the rocks for the Museum GodefFroy in Hamburg.* These
specimens were later studied by Arthur Wichman,t and it is from his
published results that we have gained the most of our pi-esent knowledge
of the petrography of these islands.
