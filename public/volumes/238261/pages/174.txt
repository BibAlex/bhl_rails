And tiiere are numerous similar youthful cliffs elsewhere.
Minutely Irregular Shoreline. — The minute irregularity of the shore-
line of certain regions is a feature to which field study should be directed.
As a working hypothesis may be offered the idea that these irregulari-
ties are due to minor differences in resistance in beds at the coast. The
irregularity in the cases given below does not appear to be due to alter-
nations in the resistance in successive strata.
