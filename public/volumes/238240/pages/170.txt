THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF VANADIUM DETERMINED
FROM THE LABORATORY WORK OF
EIGHTY YEARS.

\'anadium can no longer be considered a rare element. Ferro-
vanadium is produced on a large scale for the manufacture of special
vanadium steels. Strangely enough, it was in a kind of natural
vanadium iron that Sefstrom detected this element eighty years ago.
In 1830, while technical director of the famous iron works at
Taberg in Smaland, Sweden, Sefstrom thought it might be interest-
ing to submit his high quality malleable iron to the Rieman Test
for cold-short iron, notwithstanding the apparent absurdity of such
an undertaking. Accordingly he took one of his bars. On a part
of its bright metallic surface he drew the little circular ridge of
tallow and poured dilute sulphuric acid into the shallow dish thus
formed, expecting, of course, to see no change whatever of the
bright metallic bottom of this improvised dish. But he was
amazed to see that bright bottom instantly turn black while the
shallow dish rapidly filled up with a black powder, exactly as it
does when the iron tested is badly cold-short.
The distinguished disciple of the great Berzelius instantly realized
that this striking contradiction between test and fact was a positive
indication of the presence of a hitherto unknown chemical element.
Accordingly he set about isolating this new element. Working up
quite a number of pounds of his iron, Sefstrom obtained less than a
decigramme of the substance from which the new element was to
be separated. Hence he turned hopefully from the iron to its fresh
slag and found it to yield a much larger per cent, of the black
powder. He now soon succeeded in isolating the new element
