If in equation (3) the full value of m is inserted and t denotes cur-
rent time, or /u = m/t; if

where pw is the density of water, h" and W" the difference of level
(see Fig. 2) of the surface in v below the free surface in A and
above the mouth at d, the relations are

The acceleration of gravity, g, has dropped from both equations ; k^
is independent of Rt. The coefficient A";,, however, is more per-
spicuous.
If h'" is made very small in comparison with /;" (care being taken
to avoid loss of air during manipulation) //" will also vanish; or
for /i" = o
and similarly for ]i" = o
reduces to
;// = k^ap^^g.
Thus the apparatus is most sensitive if a is as large as possible and
h"'/h" as small as possible and the length of the column in A is
eventually without influence on the result. Hence if for a cylindrical
swimmer the internal right section is equal to the area of the annular
space between the outer wall of the swimmer and the inner wall of
the vessel A^ if the column of water above the swimmer is removed
during the prolonged intervals of time between observations, the
