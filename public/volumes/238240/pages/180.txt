HIXRICHSâ€” ATOMIC WEIGHT OF VANADIUM.
203
Thus the least deviation or departure has resuhed from the use
of the ^Method 311 recently introduced by Edgar F. Smith. The
preHminary work of Berzehus, done eighty years ago, according to
methods a and b as represented by Hnes D and T on the diagram,
showed departures for sulphur and barium extending beyond the
limit of our diagram: 470 to the left (negative) in line D and
776 to the right (positive) in line T; the former is almost half a
unit, the latter three quarters of a unit of atomic weight.
