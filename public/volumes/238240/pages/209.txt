260 LOWELLâ€” REPULSION OE GASEOUS ^MOLECULES. [April 21,
at this inopportune moment he would naturally conclude that no
repulsion existed while in truth another motion was temporarily
obstructing it.
7. Lastly the spectrograms and spectroscopic observations of
Frost and Parkhurst. de la Baume Pluvinel and Baldet agree in
showing the light of the tail of Morehouse's comet to have been
due practically wholly to emission ; in other words to glowing gas.
Here, then, we have not only corroboration of the fact, brought
forward from study of Halley's comet, to wit : that molecules of gas
are repelled by the sun, but, from the light of the tail being com-
posed solely of gaseous molecules, any supposition that they were
not the cause of the visible effect, is entirely excluded.
We reach then this interesting conclusion: that molecules of gas
not only may be but demonstratedly are repelled by the action of
the sun and that though we have reason to suppose that minute solid
particles may be similarly impressed it is of the former not the latter
that we have direct proof at present.
