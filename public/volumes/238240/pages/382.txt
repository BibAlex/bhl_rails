If we take the arithmetic means of the plant heights, lengths of
pistillate spike portions and breadths of pistillate spike portions of
the thirty plants taken from three separate localities along the shores
of Stockton Lake, we will appreciate the influence of the saline con-
ditions of the soil upon the relative size of the plants of these
three sets.

This table clearly shows that the cat-tails in fresh water are much
taller than those growing under more saline conditions, and this
applies not only to the heights of the plants, but to the other dimen-
sions as well.
