284 LAMBERT— ON THE SOLUTION OF [April 20.
If the solution of the three-dimensional Fourier's equation
dF „( d-V d'V d^F
/ a-F d'F d'F\
dt
is a function of ;• and / only, so that
F = f{r, t) , where r = (.r- -f y- -\- c- ) *,
the transformation of the given equation from rectangular to polar
coordinates shows that the solution is
r
where u is a solution of the Fourier's equation
du d'^ti
It follows that solutions of the three-dimensional equation of the
form F = f(r, t) are obtained by replacing .r by r in any solution
of the one-dimensional equation
aF _ dht
and dividing the result by r.
In this manner are obtained the solutions
V(i) F=4.
(2) F=^— --
(3) F = — e"' sin (;/;- -|- 2irKt).
It is interesting to compare the solutions of Fourier's partial dif-
ferential equation obtained in this paper with the solutions tabulated
by Sir William Thomson in the mathematcal appendix of the article
on "Heat" in the "Encyclopaedia Britannica," ninth edition.
Sir William Thomson obtains his results bv summation, that is
