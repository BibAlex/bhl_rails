serviceable and by far the most readily understood and easiest
applied.
Our general deduction (really as indicated 1894 already: a
method of the variation of the constants) leads to the simple form
of the equation of condition
100 (7 = 2A€,
where the constant 100 presupposes that the analytical excess e and
the variation A are expressed in units of the fifth place while the
departure c is expressed in units of the third place or thousandths
of the unit of atomic weights.
It may not be amiss here to insist on the fact that since in every
chemical reaction there are at least two elements present, the above
equation contains at least two unknown departures e. and is there'
fore really an indeterminate or a diophantic equation.
Our practical solution ex sequo of this equation is as follows :
Let m be the number of elements involved in the chemical reaction,
used, then the number of terms Ac in the above sum 2 is m.
Ascribing to all elements an equal influence on the error or excess
e, the part thereof due to each element will be e'^=e/m.
Hence the actual departure e for each element in the reaction
will be determined by the simple relation
100 e'
If the value of A be above a certain limit, this determination will
be sharp; the corresponding reaction therefore may also be called
sharp.
But if the value of the variation A for any element is small,
the reaction for that element zinll be dull and the determination of
the atomic weight will be impossible with any high degree of pre-
cision, as we have shown in Comptcs Rcndns, T. 148, p. 484, 1909,
in the attempted determination of the atomic weight of Tellurium by
a reaction quite dull for that element.
This one attempt strikingly shows the real condition of the
work of the dominant school to be irrational.
After having briefly explained the manner in which we have
tried to solve the great problem of the deduction of the true atomic
