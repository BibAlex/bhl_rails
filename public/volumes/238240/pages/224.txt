Fourier's partial differential equation for the linear flow of
heat is
= IC
dt
Replace Fourier's equation by
dx
dV _ d^V
and assume that
makes the latter equation an identity.
When arranged in ascending powers of S this identity is

S^ + ... = 0.
Equating to zero the coefiicient of the powers of 5" in this identity,
there result the following partial differential equations for the deter-
mination of Fq, F^, Vo, Fg, • • •,

These partial differential equations solved in regular order give

Substituting these values of F^, F^, F„, Fg, ... in the assumed
value of F and finally making 5" unity, there results
{A) F= 4>{x) + r{-r){Kt) + <t>'\x) ^' + r\^) ^' + • • . ,
