191 1.] BARNARD— SELF-LUMINOUS NIGHT HAZE. 253
■ Note.
Since this paper was in type Mr. C. F. Talman, Librarian of
the Weather Bureau at Washington, through Dr. W. J. Humphreys,
has called my attention to a paper, Xo. 22, of the Publications of the
Astronomical Laboratory at Gronitlgen. " On the Brightness of the
Sky and the Total Amount of Starlight " by L. Yntema. Dr.
Yntema calls attention to the frequent luminous condition of the
sky and its efifect on determinations of the amount of starlight. In
section 14 of his paper, which is devoted to earthlight. he gives
numerous records of this illumination. There does not appear to be
any direct reference, however, to the main features of my paper — the
luminous hazy strips and masses.
