According to Sir J. J. Thomson's theory^ atoms may be regarded
as rigid spheres of positive electricity containing negative electrons
which can move about freely through the positive charge. The
total negative charge on the electrons in an atom is equal to the
positive charge on the sphere. This theory has many advantages
over the theory of Sir J. Larmor, who regards atoms as systems of
positive and negative electrons in rapid motion. In the first place
the sphere of positive electricity provides a rigid and stable founda-
tion which is lacking in the other theory and which seems very neces-
sary to explain the extraordinary stability of atoms. It is difficult to
see how Sir J. Larmor's atoms could possibly survive the shocks of
continual violent collisions with other atoms.
Sir J. J. Thomson's theory has also the great advantage that it
explains the fact that only negative electrons can be isolated and that
positive electricity is always associated with atoms or molecules of
matter.
It also explains the fact deduced from the Zeemann efifect that
spectral lines are emitted by vibrating negative electrons and not by
positive electrons. It is consistent with the fact that atoms can
lose a few negative electrons without their identity being destroyed
which does not seem possible on Sir J. Larmor's view. The kinetic
theory of gases agrees best with the facts when the atoms are re-
garded as rigid spheres which again is strongly in favour of Sir
J. J. Thomson's theory.
This theory therefore may be used as a working hypothesis wdiich
enables a mental picture of the atom to be formed. It leaves the
nature of electricity and of the iether an open question and is conse-
