IN THE TAIL OF HALLEVS COMET.
259
Of comet ?iIorehouse this observatory possesses about sixty nega-
tives taken by Mr. E. C. Slipher. Among them are many pairs, the
one plate following the other on the same evening. From the assort-
ment thus offered I have selected two sets for measurement, the one
a pair taken on October 31, 1908, at 8h om zb to 8h 42m ± M.S.T. a-;d
from 9h 14m ±: to I oh 8m ± respectively ; and the other a triplet on
November 16. 1908, No. i being taken at 6h 25m to yh 13m; No. 2
at yh 24m to yh 50m ; No. 3 at 8h om to 8h 32m, respectively. I
chose four knots on one and five on the other with the following
results :

6. It will at once be seen that both sets of plates show accelerated
velocity in the particles of the tail away from the head as the dis-
tance from the head increases. In the first set the acceleration is
fairlv uniform, while in the latter the velocity does not increase until
the distance out has become considerable. This afifords the reason
whv some observers have failed to detect the motion. It is at times
and in certain places masked. For this the following explanation
mav be oflr'ered : In the neighborhood of the head the several emis-
sions are violently contorted as a mere inspection of the photographs
show, and in consequence must be subject to collision with other por-
tions of the tail. Possibly they encountered here matter in space
which speaks unspeakably of motion other than that due solely to
repulsive force. If now an observer chanced to make his measures
