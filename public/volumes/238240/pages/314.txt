191 1.] WILSON— COXSTITUTIOX OF THE ATOM. 373
this were ?o the calculation of /3 given above would not be affected
as can be easily seen.
The equation ( 477 '3/? )3 =.-J„j-i — A,„_^i gives
^„=(^>+(„,-,)(^;yy.
This equation enables the atomic weights of a series of similar
elements to be approximately calculated if that of the first in the
series is known. For example, if we take Aj^=i we obtain the
following numbers :
m Am
1 I H=i
2 6 L\ = y
3 18 Na = 23
4 40 K = 39
5 77 Rb = 85
6 129 Cs=i33
If we take A^ = c) we obtain the following numbers:
/;/ Am
1 9 Be = 9
2 24 Mg^24
3 51 Ca = 40
4 92 Sr = 87
5 150 Ba=i37
6 230 Ra = 226
It will be seen that the numbers given by the approximate
formula deduced from Sir J. J. Thomson's theory agree approxi-
mately with the atomic weights. I think this must be regarded as
strong evidence that there is a considerable element of truth in
the theory.
I believe that this is the first time that a definite theory of
atomic structure has been worked out sufficiently to enable a com-
parison between theoretical results and the known atomic weights
to be made.
