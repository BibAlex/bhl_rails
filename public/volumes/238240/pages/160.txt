THE NEW HISTORY.
Bv JAMES HARVEY ROBINSON.
{Read April 22, 1911.)
I propose to discuss in this paper the vakie of historical study.
The question has long haunted me and certainly merits a more care-
ful consideration than it has, so far as I can discover, hitherto re-
ceived. It will be impossible to do more here than to analyze the
problem and briefly state the general conclusions which that analysis
suggests.
The older traditional type of historical writing was narrative in
character. Its chief aim was to tell a tale or story by setting forth a
succession of events and introducing the prominent actors who par-
ticipated in them. It was a branch of polite literature, competing
with the drama and fiction, from which, indeed, it differed often
only in the limitations which the writer was supposed to place upon
his fancy. As Professor .McAlaster has recently said: "It was by
no mere accident that ]\Iotley began his literary career with a novel
called " Merry-Mount," and Parkman his with " Vassall Morton.''
These bespoke their type of mind. The things that would interest
them in history would be, not the great masses of toiling men, not the
silent revolutions by which nations pass from barbarism to civiliza-
tion, from ignorance to knowledge, from poverty to wealth, from
feebleness to power, but the striking figures of history, great kings and
queens, the leaders of armies, men renowned for statescraft, and the
dramatic incidents in the life of nations. Each must have his hero
and his villain, his plots, conspiracies and bloody wars. Just as
Froude had his Henry VIII. ; just as ]Macaulay had his William HI.,
Carlyle his Robespierre and Cromwell, and Thiers his Xapoleon, so
Motley had his William of Orange and Philip of Spain ; Prescott
his Cortez, Pizarro, Ferdinand and Isabella ; and Parkman his Pon-
tiac, Frontenac and La Salle. History as viewed by writers of this
