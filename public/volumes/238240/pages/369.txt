in phytogeographic and phytoecologic investigation. The method is
appHcable not only to a study of salt marsh soils, but also to an
investigation of salt lakes and alkaline soils, which are found in
many parts of our western arid districts and in other parts of the
world (Fig. i). The use of the hydrometer supplements, if it does

of the salt marsh vegetation of the New Jersey coast. The names of plants
are arranged along the scale to graphically represent the maximum density of
salt water to which these plants are subjected in their marsh environment.
Other data are given for comparison.
