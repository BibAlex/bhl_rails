200 HINRICHS— ATOMIC WEIGHT OF VANADIUM. [April 21,
weights from the experimental work done in the laboratories, we
may proceed to the full statement of the facts obtained for the ele-
ment vanadium during the past eighty years and the final results of
our discussion of the same.
We shall present the facts in the most compact form of tables and
finally exhibit them to the eye in the form of accurately drawn
graphics, from which we shall be able to read the final result the
most readily and clearly.
THE ACTUAL DETERMINATION OF THE TRUE ATOMIC WEIGHT
OF VANADIUM.
I. — Absolute Atomic Data.
Fundamental Constants, Calculated from the Absolute Atomic
Weights.
Only seven'"'^ chemical reactions have been used for the determi-
nation of the atomic weight of vanadium, thus far ; they are the
following :
No. 98 : Pentoxide reduced by hydrogen.
No. 269 : Oxychloride to silver.
No. 270: Oxychloride to silver chloride.
No. 311: \^anadate to chloride.
(o) — Oxychloride to pentoxide.
{b) — Sulphate to barium sulphate.
(c) — Sulphate to pentoxide.
The last three preliminary methods of Berzelius have been used
by him, each once only, and by no other chemist, except that Roscoe
made four determinations according to method (a). No. 311 has
but just been introduced by Edgar F. Smith, December, 19 10. All
the chemical reactions used for the determination of the atomic
weight of vanadium, up to that date, were devised and first used
by Berzelius in 1831, eighty years ago. It seems that his work has
some scientific value, after all.
In the following Table I. we have given the most important fun-
damental constants required by our method of reduction. They
have all been calculated from the well-known absolute atomic
weights: Va, 51; T, 16; CI. 351/^; Ag, 108; Na, 23; S, 32; Ba,
'" If we count 269 and 270 as distinct reactions.
