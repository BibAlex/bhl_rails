Nat. Herb. 10: 89. 1906. — Though primarily based on Yucca
pitcainiiccfolia {Hcclitia gloiiicrata) and made to include with ques-
tion Yucca [Noliua] lougifoUa, it finally stood with its author for

foliuui were definitely included in his first publication on the genus
and mark its type.
Leaves 2-edged, usually somewhat concave and irregularly keeled, prickly-
margined and usually roughened with minute intervening denticles or
serratures (pp. 431-440). Eudasylirion.
_Fruit-small (3-5 mm. wide).
Fruit normally with moderately deep notch, narrowly elliptical to
obovate, the style not surpassing the wings. Perianth segments
about 2 mm. long. Leaves elongated, rather wide (usually 15-20
mm.).
Prickles prevailingly upcurved.
