-^Judah is the name of the worshipers of Jhvh, who were
united under the leadership of David about 1000 b. c. David was
not an Israelite, but an Edomite. See n. 18 to my paper The Aryan
Ancestry of Jesus in The Open Court, Chicago, April, 1909 ; cf. p.
358 of my paper The Burning Bush, cited above, n. 20, and my
paper on ^lidian and Sinai (see above, n. 11 ). p. 506. 1. 2; p. 507,
1. 36; also Erbt's remarks in OriciifaHstische Litei'atiirccitinig, July,
191 1, col. 298, 1. 19. For the sheepmen of Judah see p. 284, n. 5
of my paper on Leah and Rachel, cited above, n. 19 ; cf. my paper
on the five Assyrian stems la'u in the Journal of the Anicricaji
Oriental Society, vol. xxxi.
-* In Syriac, habbdltd (or hebdltd, cbdltd) means herd, drove,
especially of camels ; cf. Obil, the name of David's keeper of camels,
I Chronicles, xxvii., 30 (see Encyclopccdia Biblica, col. 6). Hebel,
the Heb. form of Abel, may be connected with hobil, to lead. The
name of Jabal, the father of such as dwell in tents and of such as
have cattle, Genesis, iv., 20, may be derived from the same root ; cf.
Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible, vol. i., p. 5*^. The original form
of Jabal seems to have been J obil; the Greek Bible has Iw/SeX (and
inBHA for IHBHA). Hebel may be a subsequent modification
of Hobil, due to a popular etymology combining the name with Heb.
hebel (for hdbil) breath, transitoriness ; see below, n. 27. For
Jdbll = Hobil cf. my remarks on Jair= Me'ir, p. 513, 1. 24 of my
paper cited above^ n. 11. The name Moses, Heb. Moseh, may have
had originally an 'A in at the end so that it would be equivalent to
Joshua ; see /. c, 1. 26. and for the vanishing of the final laryngeal,
op. cit., p. 522, 1. 47; also Haupt. The Book of Esther (Chicago,
1908), p. 74, 1. 14.

-" In Canaan a bloodless offering smacked of Canaanite heathen-
ism ; cf. the remarks on p. 44 of the translation of Judges in the
Polychrome Bible. Skixxer says on p. 106 of his new commentary
