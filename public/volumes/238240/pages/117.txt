iv OBITUARY NOTICES OF MEMBERS DECEASED.
Through the generosity of Mr. Lea's family, two portraits, one
of Mr. Henry C. Lea, and the other of his father, Mr. Isaac Lea,
will be presented to the American Philosophical Society.
As an illustration of the thoroughness with which Air. Lea pre-
pared for his work, I may cite the following little incident :
While spending the winter of 1907-8 in Rome I saw in an anti-
quarian bookstore a catalogue of books on Witchcraft, a subject in
which I knew Mr. Lea was deeply interested and of which, though
he was then eighty-three years old, he contemplated writing a full
account. I sent the catalogue to him — a list of seventy or eighty
titles — some of them very rare, and offered to aid him in securing
any which he might wish to purchase. In reply I received a letter
of thanks, but he declined my proffered assistance for the very
good reason that he "already had all of them in his library."
I have now the pleasure of introducing Edward P. Cheyney,
Professor of European history in the Llniversity of Pennsylvania,
and a co-worker with Mr. Lea, who will read a memoir on the Life
and Works of Mr. Lea.
