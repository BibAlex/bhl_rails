types and those of live-oak barrens. Among existing localities which
I have visited which impress me as duplicating the climatic and other
physical conditions indicated by this late Pliocene flora are the estu-
aries along the gulf coast of Alabama and western Florida, among
which Apalachicola, Mobile. Perdido and Pensacola bays are the
larger. The Santa Rosa peninsula which separates the latter from
the Gulf of ^lexico supports a flora that is very similar to this
Pliocene flora and one or two of the species represented in both
are closely allied and may even be identical.
Pleistocexe.
Pleistocene plants are also common throughout most of the
coastal plain and when they shall have been thoroughly studied they
will yield a large body of exact facts which will throw much light
upon the immediate ancestry and migrations of our existing flora.
Already more than one hundred species have been recorded, most
of which are still existing and these indicate a very difl^erent geo-
graphical distribution from that of the present coastal plain flora.
COXCLUSIOX.
I have only had time in the foregoing remarks for a very frag-
mentary and incomplete sketch of the present study which has really
only just commenced. With the complete exploration of the area
and the additional collections which it is hoped to make it is believed
that the combined results of the speakers studies of the fossil floras
and those of his associates on the fossil faunas and the areal geol-
ogy will furnish a basis for reconstructing the physical, faunal and
floral history of the southern states, during the several millions of
years from the Cretaceous to the present, which will constitute a
lasting contribution to the history of the earth.
