the conditions between Enkhuizen. north from Amsterdam, and
Dordrecht, south from Rotterdam, as well as in localities east and
west from that line. It is unnecessary to give more than a few of
these as in any group the same conditions are found. Eighteen
borings are reported along the east and west line from Rotterdam
to the Hook of Holland. Seven of these follow, the measurements
beinsf in meters and the numbers are those of the records :

These exhibit the variations to a depth of 16 meters. The mate-
rial in each case below the lowest peat bed in the column is sedi-
mentary clay and sand. Peat was found in some localities at 19
meters, but it is never continuous to that depth, being always divided
by sediments. The greatest continuous thickness found in any
boring is 10 meters. At times the peat is replaced wholly by sedi-
ment and one can trace old river courses in which no peat was
formed and which now are filled with the transported sediment.
The records show the conditions in an area of 70 by 20 miles,
throughout which one finds one or more beds of peat covered with
a greater or less thickness of sediment. These are autochthonous,
and they contain stems of trees rooted in the subsoil. The inter-
vening deposits are often distinctly marine in many parts of ?Iol-
land ; a section by Lorie shows
