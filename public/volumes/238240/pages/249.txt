310 BERRY— TERTIARY FLORAS OF THE [April 2.,
Extensive marine faunas indicate even more torrid conditions
than in the preceding epoch, uniformly distributed over this whole
area.
Middle Oligocene.
The Middle Oligocene deposits are those of shallow tropical
waters with a bottom temperature of at least 39° C. (70° F.), marine
toward the east with true reef corals in Georgia, but becoming
brackish or fresh toward the west, by reason of their shallowness
and the increased volume of fresh water from the Oligocene Missis-
sippi and Tennessee rivers and other streams. The flora is scanty
but includes tropical swamp types, the fern genus Acrostichum being
the most abundant form collected.
The accompanying sketch map (Fig. 3) shows in a generalized
way the relation of land and water in the Middle and Upper Oligo-
cene. It is to be noted that the great Mississippi Gulf had been
reduced to a very wide and shallow reentrant.
Upper Oligocene.
Toward the close of the Oligocene a widespread emergence of
the land was inaugurated accompanied by a slight lowering of tem-
peratures. The floras are not abundant but are represented in
western Florida and central Mississippi. They contain very abund-
ant remains of several species of Sahal-Wka palms; the large leaves
of a species of ArtocarpHS or breadfruit; leaves of figs; of the Cin-
namomum or camphor tree; representatives of the genera Acacia,
Btimelia, Diospyros, Pisoma, Cyiniiida. Clcditsia, Nectandra,
Sapotacitcs, Rhanimis. Uluuis, etc. — the latter being the only genus
which is a strictly temperate type in the modern flora, although most
of the genera enumerated have representatives in the warmer parts
of the temperate zone at the present time.
Miocene.
A long interval followed the close of the Oligocene, during which
the coast line of southeastern North America was considerably sea-
ward from its present position, in consequence of which deposits
