512 HAUPT— AN ANCIENT PROTEST [April 22,
Book of Esther, Haman is called an Agagite, that is, a descendant
of Agag, the king of the Amalekites, who had been spared by Saul,
but was hewn in pieces before Jiivii by Samuel, whereas ]\Iordecai
is introduced as a descendant of the first king of Israel; see Haupt,
Piirim (Leipzig, 1906), p. 12, 1. 30. The Amalekites were Edomites
who had invaded southern Palestine before the Edomite ancestors
of the Jews, after their exodus from Egypt, conquered the region
afterwards known as Judah (see n. 23). In Numbers, xxiv., 20
Amalek is called the first (that is, oldest) of the nations. The
Amalekites, however, had intermarried with other (non-Edomite)
tribes; in Genesis, xxxvi., 12, therefore, Amalek is introduced as a
son of Esau's first-born, Eliphaz, by a concubine, just as the sons
of Jacob's concubines, Bilhah and Zilpah, were tribes with foreign
elements; see my paper on Leah and Rachel in the Zcitschrift fi'ir
die ahtestamcntUche WissciiscJiaft, vol. xxix., p. 285. The identi-
fication of Amalek with the cuneiform Meluha (OriciitaHstische
Literaturscitiing, June, 1909) is untenable. According to i Chron-
icles, ii., 55, the Rechabites {cf. Jeremiah, xxxv. ; 2 Kings, x., 15,
22,) were descendants of the Kenites; but this can hardly be correct.
The Rechabites resembled the ancient Kenites in that they were
ardent worshipers of Jhvii, and that they continued to live in
tents after the men of Judah (see n. 23) had settled in Canaan.

Origin of Judaism in vol. xlviii. (No. 193) of these Proceedings

above, n. 11), p. 506, 1. 12; p. 512, 11. 15 and 33; p. 513. 1. 2. In
Genesis, iv., 17 we read that Cain built a city.
-^ In Judges, iv., 11 the words tnib-beiie hohdb Moseh are a
secondary gloss (or variant) to niiq-Ooiii, and hotcn is a tertiary
gloss to hobdb. The original text of Judges, i., 16 s^ems to have
been: zcc-Oaiii 'aldh uie-'ir hat-tcinarhii ct-Yehuddli inidbdr 'Ardd

Palm City to the wilderness of Arad, and went and lived with
Amalek. The words bene . . . hot en Moseli and YchuddJi aser
ban-negcb are glosses. vSec the translation of Judges, in the Poly-
chrome Bible, pp. 8 and 2; also p. 49, n. 15; p. 62, 1. 55; cf. my
