THE HIGH VOLTAGE CORONA IN AIR.
; . By J. B. WHITEHEAD.
(Read April si, 1911.)
The term "corona" as employed by electrical engineers refers to
the luminous envelope which surrounds a bare electrical conductor
when its potential is raised above a certain value. As the voltage of
long-distance transmission lines has been raised to higher and higher
values in order to reduce the size and cost of the conductors and so
increase the distance of economical transmission, a limiting condition
has been found in the insulating properties of the atmosphere. For
each definite space separation and size of conductors, above a certain
value of voltage the regions immediately surrounding the conductors
become luminous, and a power loss sets in which increases rapidly
with further increase in voltage.
These facts were first noted by electrical engineers in this country
in 1896. It was promptly recognized that the region in the imme-
diate neighborhood of the conductors is subject to the greatest electric
intensity and that the phenomena are due to local though restricted
break-down of the air. This was corroborated not only by the pres-
ence of the luminous envelope immediately around the conductors,
for voltages above that at which the loss begins, but by study of the
eft'ect of changing the size and separation of conductors ; decreasing
separation and size both increase the surface electric intensity and
therefore lower the voltage at which loss begins. The electric inten-
sity at the surface of the conductor may be readily calculated in most
cases that occur from the voltage and from the separation and sizes
of the conductors. It is directly proportional to the voltage in all
cases. The term "corona" was first used by Steinmetz in 1898 to
describe the luminous enveloi)e and has been generally adopted by
engineers.
