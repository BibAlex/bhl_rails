276 LAMBERT— ON THE SOLUTION OF [April 2^.
Equating to zero the coefficients of the powers of 5" in this identity,
there result the following differential equations for the determina-
tion of yo,yi,y2>yz> ••••
The equation in v,, is a homogeneous linear differential equation
and its solution is
Substituting this value of y,, the equation for determining y^
becomes
ax'- ax ^
This equation becomes exact when multiplied by .t'"""\ The
resulting equation integrated gives a linear equation of the first order,
the solution of which is
-^'1 ^ 2\n^) "^ 2\n- i) ■
Substituting this value of a'i in the equation for determining y^
and proceeding in the same manner
V = 1
2*. 2 !(/^ -I- i)(« + 2) ^ 2'- 2 !(;/— i){n — 2)
In like manner
_ Ax''+^ 5;t'-"+«
J', = 2^7! (;r+ i)(« + 2){n + 3) "^ 2''.3!(^/- i)(«- 2)(^z-3)'
and so on.
