II. — General Summary of the Experimental Work Done.
In the common reviews of the experimental work done for
atomic weight determinations, the amount of substance taken in each
experiment is not made the subject of special consideration. This
neglect is due to the erroneous estimation in which the so-called
"probable error" of the mean is held.
This probable error has caused the most serious errors in all
branches of physical science where it has been applied — in the un-
fortunately common way. without proper understanding. We have
treated of this repeatedly, especially in our " absolute atomic
weights, 1901. on the first hundred pages, to which we must refer.
In the language of Berzelius already quoted we might say the
above probable error is the gnat strained at which hides from sight
the camel-like systematic and constant errors which are swallowed.
We have, at last, seen one admission of the fact we have always
^ Between the second and third decimal of the five, we always leave a space
to make the constancy of the first two conspicuous.
