(c) In this identit}- arranged according to the ascending powers
of S equate to zero the coefficients of the different powers of S.
(d) Solve the dift'erential equations thus obtained in regular order
for Vo.Vi,3'o,3'3, V4. •■••
(e) Substitute these values in ( 3 ) and make 5" unity. The result-
ing value of _v, if it contains a finite number of terms or if it is a
uniformly convergent infinite series, is a solution of the given dif-
ferential equation.^
The method of solution of linear dift'erential equations as here
outlined does not seem to occur in mathematical literature except as
developed by the author.
The method will be exemplified by applying it to two dift'erential
equations, important in mathematical physics — Bessel's equation, a
second order ordinary dift'erential equation, and Fourier's equation
for the flow of heat, a second order partial dift'erential equation.
Bessel's equation is

^ This method gives a formal solution of non-linear differential equations,
but up to the present time the author has been unable to test the resulting
series for convergency.
