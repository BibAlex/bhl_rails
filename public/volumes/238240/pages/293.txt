theory of the constitution of matter. Unfortunately, so Httle weight
can be attached to these results and the conclusions reached by these
authors, that they have received no serious consideration from those
most competent to judge their value.
In closing, a point which seems worthy of special emphasis may
be briefly mentioned. This is the apparently important part played
by the alpha or material particle emitted during radioactive trans-
formations. In those cases where it has been possible to observe
its influence, the loss of an alpha particle is always accompanied by
a corresponding decrease in the mass of the atom from which it is
separated. Although the disruption of a radio-atom is accompanied
bv the release of a relatively enormous amount of energy, still it
appears that the fragments projected into space are always of one
or the other of two quite distinct classes; either beta particles of
extremelv small mass, or helium atoms of a mass seven thousand
times that of the beta particles. So far as the results of our experi-
ments have enlightened us we have not yet been able to observe the
resolving of the by far the greater proportion of the effective mass of
an atom into anything other than a further subdivision of ordinary
matter.
