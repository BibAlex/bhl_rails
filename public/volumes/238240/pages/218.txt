LXCREASE OF THE SUX'S MASS.

The last of these papers is the most important, since it supple-
ments and extends the results of the earlier investigators. Professor
Stromgren's method is one of great generality and appears to be the
most satisfactory yet devised; and we shall base our brief discussion
■chiefly on this paper.
If cr be a very small quantity, and (pit) some function of the
time, the original unit of mass becomes i -|-o-<^(n. and the differ-
■ential equations of motion become
d^y
dt
r,+k\\ + o-(^(o] ';3 = o ;
(I)
where k- is the gravitation constant, and the mass is unity at the
initial epoch ^ = o.
The new constant of areas becomes
dv
dx
Other formulas of interest are:
la = i\(T<^{t) — 2d\<j I 0'(/) jit ,
- = - [i + 2I/. [ie] cos i{e + ;// — tt)]

And finally after a careful investigation of all effects due to
errors of the first order of the disturbing force, (T(f>(t), Stromgren
