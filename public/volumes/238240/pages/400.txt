I91I-] AGAINST THE CURSE ON EVE. 517
Philadelphia, April 23, 191 1, under the caption Education and Race
Suicide: " Declaring that race suicide is due to an increase in intelli-
gence, and theorizing that the human emotions become fewer as
human beings become better educated, Dr. Paul Haupt, professor
of Semitic languages at Johns Hopkins University, spoke at the
session yesterday morning. Contrary to the hope of many members
of the Society, Dr. Haupt advanced none of his religious opinions in
the course of his address. He spoke upon ' An Ancient Protest
against the Curse on Eve' and confined himself wholly to observa-
tions on race suicide." â€” The abstract which I had placed at the dis-
posal of the press was printed in the Philadelphia Ledger, the North
American, &c., April zt^, 191 i.
