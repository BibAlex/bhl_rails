INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
By WILUA^I \V. KEEN, ^I.D, LL.D,
President of the American Philosophical Society.
Members of the American Philosophical Society, ^Members and
Representatives of the Library Company of Philadelphia, of the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, of the Academy of Natural Sciences, and of
the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Ladies and Gentlemen : â€”
In the days, of Julius Caesar and during the wars which followed
his assassination, "Triumvirate" was a word very familiar to
Roman citizens. But whether applied to the first or the second
triumvirate it had a sinister meaning. Our own city, however, for
many years has had an illustrious triumvirate of men who have been
eminent in literature, science and civic life. Horace Howard Furness,
S. Weir Mitchell and Henry Charles Lea. Xo other American city
could boast three names comparable to these.
When one of these three, and such a man as Henry Charles Lea
has passed away, it is fitting that his associates and the community
at large should halt for an hour in our busy life and pay a tribute
to his character and achievements.
The American Philosophical Society, of which he was an honored
member, therefore suggested to the four other public institutions
named with which Air. Lea was associated by membership, and
which had benefited by his active interest and generous support,
that a joint meeting in memory of Air. Lea should be held. The
idea was most cordially received and a speaker representing each of
these societies will share in the proceedings of the evening.
In addition to these distinguished local representatives. His
Excellency, the Right Lion. James Bryce, the British Ambassador,
has come from Washington especially to do honor to the memory
of his fellow historian and friend.
