Leaves 5 mm. wide, rather concave and unusually rough-margined.
Inflorescence 25-30 cm. long, with rather numerous
^ /"T^^ strict branches scarcely one-third as long, smooth or
© vJv/y somewhat scabrid on the short peduncle. Fruit more
or less ovate-orbicular, cordately notched, 8 X 8-10
mm., inflated. Seed (immature) 2X3 mm.
East-central Mexico. In the region of A^ humilis, etc.
Specimens examined: San Luis Potosi. Vicinity of San Luis
Potosi {Parry & Palmer, 8/4, 1878, — the type, 502, 1878; Schaffner,
261, 1879).
Leaves rather thick, Hnear or narrowly oblong-triangular, scarcely over 12
mm. wide, green, more or less concave and unequally keeled on one or
both faces, raggedly dentate-scabrous in most species and in age often
fibrous-lacerate at tip. Inflorescence usually about as long as the leaves,
peduncled, compound-panicled. Bracts not usually very showy. Bract-
lets more or less lacerate.
Fruit small, not inflated, the relatively large seed early exposed and
prominent (pp. 416-420). Erumpentes.
Inflorescence (as in the last preceding species) often roughened in
lines. Pedicels rather thickened in fruit. Acaulescent.
Lower bracts' firmly long-attenuate from a somewhat dilated
scarious-margined base.
Lower panicle divisions much shorter than the subtending
bracts, with rather weak strongly ascending branch-
lets.
