448 REIDâ€” ISOSTASY AND MOUNTAIN RANGES. [Apni 21,
that the earth is not strong enongh to sustain an added thickness of
more than alxtut two hun(h-ed and fifty feet of rock over an area as
large as a square degree without slowly yielding. The stations
where the ohservations were made are scattered over various parts
of this country, on the eastern coast, in the Appalachian mountain
range, in the region of the Great Lakes, near the Gulf of Mexico,
in the great plains of the Mississippi basin, on the great elevations
of the Rocky Mountains, the plateaux of Utah, the Sierra Nevada
mountains and the Pacific coast, regions exhibiting a great variety
of topographic forms and differing greatly as to geologic activity.
Whatever movements may be going on in the Rocky mountains,
and in the region between them and the Atlantic ocean, are certainly
very small ; whereas to the west, and particularly in the state of
California, the movements seem to be very active. The eastern
edsfe of the Sierra Nevada received additional elevation at the time
of the Owens Valley earth(iuake in 1872, and the comparatively
frequent earth(|uakes in the Sierras and the Coast ranges make it
quite possible that these mountains are now being elevated as actively
as at any time in their history. In view of the great variety of the
country in which the stations were located, both as to topography
and geologic activity, in view of the great amount of material being
continually eroded from one region and deposited in another, thus
tending to overthrow the isostatic equilibrium, and in view of obser-
vations in other parts of the world, we are driven, with Dr. Hay-
ford, to the conclusion that isostasy is not an accidental condition
existing at the present time within this country, but is due to the
fact that the earth yields plastically to the long continued action of
even small forces. We feel justified, therefore, in believing that
isostatic equilibrium exists in other parts of the world and existed
in other geologic ages, and in saying that the whole earth is, and
always has been in isostatic equililjrium.
This conclusion carries with it many important consequences and
has a very direct bearing on the theories of the origin of mountain
ranges ; for it tells us that every segment of the earth, having an
equal area of surface and with its a])ex at the center, contains the
same amount of material, which it is impossible either to increase
