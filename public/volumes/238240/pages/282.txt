The study of the discharge of electricity through gases and the
properties of radioactive substances has done much to broaden our
knowledge of the relations of electricity and matter. It has served
to throw a new light on the ultimate constitution of matter itself,
and, while confirming the older theory of a discontinuous or atomic
structure, has led to the presumption that the chemical atom is not
only divisible into still smaller entities, but that in some cases it can
undergo a spontaneous disruption accompanied by the ejectment of
certain of its constituent parts at high velocities. All this has opened
a broad and attractive field for more or less legitimate speculation
and conjecture.
Since the first recognition by Becquerel in 1807 o^ the radio-
active phenomena exhibited by the element uranium, the extension of
our knowledge of the radioactive substances has steadily and pro-
gressively advanced. This development has been due in great part
to the early formulation of the theory of atomic disintegration, pro-
posed in 1902 by Rutherford and Soddy, which has served as a
systematic foundation and has afforded an orderly basis for the
interpretation of the otherwise somewhat complicated relations.
According to this hypothesis the atoms of the primary radioactive
elements are considered to undergo spontaneous disintegration and
in this manner to give rise to a series of successive radioactive prod-
ucts, differing from the parent substances as well as from one another
in phvsical and chemical properties and in the relative stability of
their atomic systems. Simultaneously with the disruption of the
atoms certain characteristic radiations are emitted by ikit systems,
