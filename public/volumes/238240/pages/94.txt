I9II.] THROUGH A PARTITIOX OF WATER. 123
section a through which capillary transpiration takes place is defi-
nitely given. It is obvious that the swimmer must be suspended, for
instance by fine cross wires, above the bottom of the tank A.
Reference is finally to be made to convection and to temperature.
The manipulation during observation necessarily stirs up the water
and distorts the regular pressure gradient. Hence observations are
to be made rarely. Again to obviate convection in general the
vessel must be kept in a room of nearly constant temperature.

be inserted in the equations for k,, and kp,

Hence for a gradient of i dyne per cm., 2.9 X lO"^^ grams of air
flow between opposed faces of a cu. cm. of water per second. This
may be put roughly as about 2.4 X iO"^° cu. cm. of air per second.
The speed of migration of individual air molecules intermolecularly
through a wall of water is thus 2.4 X lO"" cm./sec. for a dyne/cm.

Since the. gradient is the energy expended when the cu. cm. is
transferred i cm. along the channel and if the number of air mole-
cules per cu. cm. be taken as A' = 6oX IO'^ the force acting per
molecule to give it the velocity just specified is 1/(60 X 10^^) dynes.
Hence the force or drag per molecule if its speed is to be i cm. per

This may be compared with the force necessary to move a small
sphere through a very viscous liquid of viscosity -q. This force is
