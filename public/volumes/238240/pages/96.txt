I9II.] WITH REFLECTING GRATING. 127
For d' > i the second series of interference spectra occurring at
D, eccentrically, are broader, but only on perfect adjustment do the\-
occur simultaneously with the other set. In fact, since for the pre-
ceding case i^=6, or
2 sin i = X/D
and in the present case,
sin 6' — sin / = X/D,
therefore
sin 6' ^2> s"i ' = 3 sin 0.
There is also an available set in the second order to the left of E.
In the gratings used above D lies in front of G,,. being nearer the E
than the L direction.
2. Inz'cysion of the Method. — The occurrence of the undeviated
ray R suggests another method. For if the white ray R is reversed,
i. e., comes from an eccentric collimator, slit images w'ill be seen in
telescopes at L and £, whereas overlapping spectra will appear in
the direction D' eccentrically and in the lines R and R' . One of the
latter may be lost in the collimator. The former occurs for the
same angle 6' so that
sin ^'^3 sin/.
Moreover, if 7 = 45° is the angle of incidence of L upon M when
sodium light is taken, so that (9' = 26° 14'. / = 8° 28', the R, D. D'
rays make angles 2i, 6' -\- i, 0' — /, respectively, with the E direction ;
or the sum of the angles at D and D' with the E line is 2O' , their
difiference 21, and the rays D, R, D' intersect at a common centre on
Gm- Hence if we place the plane of Gm at the centre of the spherom-
eter and arrange -1/ and G„ eccentrically, the angles may be meas-
ured as before.
3. Resolution of the Slit Image. — If the sharp white images of
the slit in a Michelson apparatus for the case in which the incident
light consists of parallel \vhite rays from a collimator, be accurately
superimposed and the opaque mirrors be set at the proper distances
from the semi-transparent mirror by the micrometer, the slit image
may itself be view^ed through a grating and will then show' elliptic
interferences in all the spectra. The apparatus is here eccentric,
