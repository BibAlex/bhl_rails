ABBOT— SOLAR CONSTANT OF RADIATION. [April 2.,
It was thought doubtful by Langley, and others, if correct esti-
mates of the atmospheric transmission can be made, even by the
spectro-bolometric method of high and low sun observations. Lang-
ley, indeed, gave an argument tending to show that the values of the
solar constant thus obtained fall far below the true intensity of the
solar radiation outside the atmosphere. This argument, however,
seems to be unsound. ^^ In order to test the accuracy of the method
I made spectro-bolometric measurements on Mount Whitney (4420
meters elevation) in 1909 and 1910 simultaneously with similar ob-
servations made by Messrs. Ingersoll and Fowle, respectively, on
Mount Wilson (1800 meters elevation). In 1905 and 1906 solar-
constant measurements were made nearly simultaneously at Mount
Wilson and at Washington (10 meters elevation). It does not ap-
pear from these observations that there are any differences in the
solar-constant values depending on the altitude of the observer, and
not due to accidental errors of observations.^*
In illustration of this conclusion I give the results obtained simul-
taneously at Mount Wilson and Mount Whitney :
Date.

Mount Whitney.

1-959
1910, Aug. 12.

The very slight excess of the Mt. Whitney values is not large
enough to be significant.
We conclude that the solar-constant values computed from the
method of high and low sun observations do not depend on the
altitude of the observing station up to altitudes of 4,420 meters,
provided the sky conditions are satisfactorily clear and uniform.
Reducing values published in Vol. II. of the Annals to standard
calories at 15° centigrade, and including the mean values obtained
in later years, ^"' we have :

'*As regards the Washington and Mount Wilson comparisons, see
Annals, Vol. II., pp. 99 and 102. Note that the provisional scale of these
Annals values is 5 per cent, too high.
'° Many of the values of 1910 are not yet reduced.
