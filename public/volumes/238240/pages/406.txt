THE FORMATION OF COAL BEDS. II.*
By JOHX J. STEVEXSOX.
Some Elementary Problems.
(Read November j, 191 1.) »
It is necessary, first of all, to consider some matters to which ref-
erence is made by every one who has endeavored to explain the
formation of coal beds. Too many seem to have been content with
acceptance of current statements respecting the apparently common-
place phenomena and too few have thought essential a careful study
of work done in recent years. The indefinite and often contradic-
tory assertions contained in discussions, published within the last
decade, compelled the writer to study the available literature and,
as far as possible, to make examination of the phenomena in place.
This study has led him to reject some of his cherished beliefs while
it has confirmed others. At the same time, it has increased his
respect for the problem, which he has undertaken to solve. The
topics to be considered in this portion of the work are :
The efifect of floods upon a cover of vegetation.
The phenomena of peat deposits.
The buried forests.
