GROUP ON THE SAME LETTERS.

§ I. Introduction.
The problem to determine all the substitutions on n letters which
are commutative with every substitution of a regular group on the
same letters was first solved explicitly by Jordan in his thesis. It
was found that with every regular group there is associated a group
which is conjugate with this regular group, such that each is com-
posed of all the substitutions which are commutative with every
substitution of the other. ^ These two regular groups were called
conjoints by Jordan and it is evident that they have a common
holomorph and that their group of isomorphisms is the quotient
group of this holomorph with respect to either of these two regular
groups.
The more general problem to determine all the substitutions on
n letters which are commutative with every substitution of any
transitive group on the same letters seems to have been solved for
the first time by Kuhn in his thesis.- He found that with each
transitive group G of degree n there is associated a group K on the
same n letters which is composed of regular substitutions on these
n letters, in addition to the identity. The order of K is a, the degree
of the subgroup composed of all the substitutions of G which omit a
given letter being n — a. Hence a necessary and sufficient condi-
tion that K be transitive is that G be regular, and the number of the
systems of intransitivity of K is always equal to n/a. When a <i n
K is formed by establishing a simple isomorphism between n/a
