at V, is known to .025° C, the barometric height should be deter-
minable as far as .1 mm. Apart from this the sensitiveness of the
apparatus is surprising. Care must be taken to avoid adiabatic
changes of temperature, so that slow manipulation is essential.
These and other precautions were pointed out in the original paper
