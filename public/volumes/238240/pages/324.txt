History.
The four genera NoUim ( Michaiix, 1803), Dasylirion (Zucca-
rini, 1838), Bcaucarnca (Lemaire, 1861 ) and CaUbanns (Rose, 1906)
form so natural a group that many botanists have considered a
single generic name, Dasylirion, suf^cient for all, though they differ
enough in fruit to have caused the founder of this genus to question
the propriety of including in it all of the species that were known
even in his day ; and they show marked differences in habit.
Except that Dasylirion was based in part on a Hcchtia, which
led its author — who later recognized the error — to place it among
the Bromeliacese. and that on his suggestion it has been connected
transiently with the Juncace?e, this genus and its immediate rela-
tives have been accorded place generally among what are now con-
sidered as Liliaceffi, — though not always under that family when its
rather heterogeneous components have suft'ered temporary segrega-
tion. Xo better arrangement has been found than that of Engler
and Prantl'^ who locate the Nolinese between Yuccese and Dra-
cseneas as part of the Draceanoid Liliace^e. From the Yuccese they
are sharply differentiated, among other characters, by their small
polygamo-dioecious flowers (never 10 mm. in diameter), few-
ovuled pistil, and small usually indehiscent fruit rarely more than
one-seeded : and the Dracaenese differ from them in a usually some-
what gamophyllous perianth, perfect flowers, and prevailingly
fleshy fruit, — but in all of these respects the group of Dracasneae
offers a good deal of latitude.
