It will be noticed that in this set of solutions [' = when .r^o.
Let u^^f^(xj), U2 = f2{y>^)> ^h = fz{^>^) represent solutions
of the three one-dimensional Fourier's equations,
dV _ d-V (^V _ d^-V dV d'V
~dt^^d7^' a7^ ^' "a7~ a^
respectively. It is readily proved that
y=zn^u.-. and l^ -^ u-^\i.,u,
are solutions respectively of the two-dimensional Fourier's equation
dV (d-V d-V\
and the three-dimensional Fourier's equation
dV (d'V d^V d''V\
~df ^ ^\~dx^ ~^ ~dy '^ ~dz' )'
This shows how solutions of the two- and three-dimensional
Fourier's equations can be obtained from the solutions of the one-
dimensional equation.
For example, from the one-dimensional solutions

respectively, are obtained.
