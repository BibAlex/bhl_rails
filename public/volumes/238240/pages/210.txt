THE NEW COSMOGONY.

The results established in the writer's " Researches on the Evo-
lution of the Stellar Systems," Vol. II., 1910, have given a new basis
to our conceptions of the cosmogony. Instead of the traditional
doctrine of throwing off, we now have that of capture, which means
essentially that the nuclei originated in the distance and have since
grown by accretion as they approached the centers about which
they now revolve in greatly reduced orbits of small eccentricity.
Not only have we witnessed a radical change in the point of view,
but also in the method of research employed. And along with these
changes has come the introduction of rigorous mathematical and
dynamical criteria by which the mechanical principles involved may
be extended over an almost unlimited period of time.
Not the least important of the improvements recently introduced
is that resulting from a careful examination of the premises under-
lying our reasoning. Nothing is adopted from tradition, nor taken
for granted, nor from any authority however high ; but every ques-
tion is examined on its merits and from the very ground up. As the
subject is new it naturally follows that much still remains to be done ;
yet the general trend of nature's laws seems to be well established,
and cosmogony begins to assume the form of a true science. Ac-
cordingly it may not be without interest to the general reader to
summarize in one connected view the leading principles of the new
science of cosmogony, with brief analysis of the criteria by which
they are confirmed.
I. Babinet's criterion based on the mechanical principle of the
conservation of areas, by which we are enabled to calculate the
times of rotation of the sun and planets when expanded to fill the
orbits of their attendant bodies, as imagined by Laplace. This
enables us to say at once that the attendant bodies could never have
