I. Electrons and Matter.
The enormous difference in tlie behavior of dift'erent materials
towards electric force is a matter with which everyone is familiar ;
and it is one of the triumphs of the electron theory that it has given
us a verv satisfactory picture of the dift'erence between insulators
and conductors of electricity. We are to regard all matter as made
up primarily out of electrons. They are the stones with which the
material structure is built up, the electrodynamic forces are the
cement which holds the stones together. There are, however, two
different ways in which the electrons may exist in a given portion
of matter. They may be located in position of stable equilibrium,
in which case a very small force will displace them to a small extent
but a perfectly enormous force would be required to dislodge them
thoroughly and give rise to instability ; or they may be so loosely
held that they are able to move about in the interstices of the material,
very much after the fashion in which we believe the molecules move
about in a gas. In the former case, when the electrons are practically
fixed, we say the substance is an insulator ; in the latter case, where
they are wandering about, the substance is a conductor.
A moment's reflection will show that this dift'erence is sufficient
to explain the difference between insulators and conductors. Con-
sider what happens when a slab of the first kind is placed in an
electric field. There will be a displacement of the electrons, it is
true, but the displacement will be small and they will all return to
their original equilibrium positions as soon as the external field is
