The object of this paper is to apply to the solution of linear differ-
ential equations, both ordinary and partial, the method of expansion
into series used in the solution of algebraic equations in the papers
read by the author before the Philosophical Society in April, 1903,
and in April, 1908.
Let the given differential equation be
f dy d'y (t\v\
o.
The method of solution consists of the followirg steps :
(a) Break up the left-hand member of the dift'erential equation
into two parts.

such that the first part equated to zero can be integrated by some
known method, and multiply the second part by a parameter 5", inde-
pendent of .r and 3'. Replace the given equation by
