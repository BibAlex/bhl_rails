but also majestic trees, such as cypress and gum. which, as well as
the less imposing juniper, yield wood of great importance to the
artificer.
The inland swamps of the northern states dift'er in many wavs
from the coastal swamps. They occur along river borders or in
lakelet areas of the drift-covered region. In great part, the former
are "wet woods'" covered more or less deeply with water during
several months of each year, but they show considerable stretches
of true swamp. The swamps and marshes of the drift region are
less extensive, but they afford better opportunity for studies bearing
on the mode of accumulation. They have been investigated bv C. A.
Davis, H. Ries, N. S. Shaler and others, but the most comprehensive
and most recent description is by Davis.
Davis^^- notes that very few highly organized plants can grow
wholly submerged in water, and those are mostly endogens ; lo feet
of depth seems to be the limit, although Potamogeton has been found
rooted in 23 feet : other types, low forms such as Cliara and the
floating algse are indift'erent. Some plants, burweeds, arrowheads,
reed grass, pickerel weed and water lilies can grow when partially
submerged ; while some land plants, shrubs and trees can endure
long exposure to water about the roots. The surface growth on
swamps is important. Elm and black ash swamps are of common
occurrence and have, besides those plants, tamarack, spruce, willows,
alders, with various heaths and mosses. They do not always show
much peat, but what there is is well decomposed and is apt to contain
much mineral matter. The greatest thickness of peat in these
swamps is reported to be 10 feet. Tamarack { Lari.v lariciua) and
white cedar (Chanuccy parts tliyoidcs) indicate the presence of peat,
the latter growing densely on the surface of a deposit, 20 feet thick.
Spruces {Picca mariana and P. brcvifoUa) also grow on thick peat;
willows, poplar and alders grow on the thickest peat and in wet
places; but the mosses, Hypmim and Sphagiiuin, grow onlv in
advanced swamps.
