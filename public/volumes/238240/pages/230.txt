by integration, from the solution IV (i) above. All his results
occur directly in the above tables or are combinations of two of these
solutions. It is evident that there are several misprints in the results
as printed in the " Britannica."
Of course there are many solutions of Fourier's equation which
must be built up from elementary solutions, however found, by
means of Fourier series, or which must be obtained by the methods
of harmonic analysis.
The solution III (5) above is the series used by Sir William
Thomson in his solution of the problem of the secular cooling of the
earth.^
An interesting result in pure mathematics is obtained as follows :
Sir William Thomson shows that for a continued point source of
heat, if the rate is an arbitrary function of the time, f(t), the solu-
tion of Fourier's equation when K = i is given by the definite
integral
