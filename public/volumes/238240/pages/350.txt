East-central Mexico. The type is said by Otto to have been
raised from seed sent with that of D. acrotrichc by Deppe in 1827. —
As the earliest well-characterized and figured species, this may per-
haps be accepted as the type of the genus, though it follows D. ser-
ratifoliuin in position. — In the region of D. Parryanum, Calibanus
and A'olina huniilis and JVatsoni.
Specimens examined : Sax Luis Potosi. A'icinity of San Luis
Potosi (Parry & Palmer, 876, 1878; ?Schajfner, 242, 1878, — mixed
with D. Parryanum). Las Canoas (Pringle, 3746, 1891).
Leaves of D. hybrid uni of the Botanical Garden of Rome do not
differ from this except in being 15-20 mm. wide, nearly dull and
scarcely brush-tipped. It is said to be a hybrid between D. [Xoliiia]
longifolium and D. serratifolium, but in foliage shows no characters
of the former, and it is unlike the latter as I understand it.
Prickles moderate.
