uring the latter it was necessary to count the fringes between the
C and D lines and divide their angular distance apart by these num-
bers. As c cannot be measured, its successive increments Ae from
the first position are given. These are presently to be associated
with the corresponding increments of dn/dO.

8. Equations. — In Fig. 5, L and L' represent a pair of corre-
sponding white rays, reflected into R and R' and diffracted into D
and D' at angles i and 6. respectively. The half gratings g and g'
are separated along the crack S\ and g' is movable parallel to itself
by a micrometer screw normal to g'. Let the normal distance apart
of the gratings be c. The incident rays L, L' strike the originally
coplanar grating at points A' rulings apart, or XD cm. apart, if D
is the grating space. In the separated grating let these points be at
a distance c apart. Let d be the incident wave front and /; the corre-
sponding dift'racted wave front and call the angle between r and d. y.
When there is reinforcement the path dift"erence of the rays L
and L' from the incident (d ) to the dift'racted (/;) wave front, may
be written ;;A ^= b — a.
where b and a are the distances of /; and d from the points of inci-
dence of L and L' on the grating g and g' respectively. If finally /
