290 IDDINGS— PROBLEMS IN PETROLOGY. [April 21,
minerals in solution. The problem of the determination of the
mineral composition of rocks is for this reason more complex than
at first appears, and is further complicated by the difficulty of
determining the amounts of colored and colorless crystals, when
they appreciably overlap one another in thin section.
Another obvious result of a comparison of the actual mineral
composition of igneous rocks with the chemical composition of
their magmas is the notable variability in the combination of minerals
that may in some instances result from the crystallization of mag-
mas of like chemical composition. This is true both as to kinds and
amounts of the resulting minerals. A striking illustration of this
variability is found in the mineral composition of three rocks from
the same region, the parish of Gran. Norway, which have been
described by Brogger. Analyses of the three are shown in columns
I, 2 and 3, Table II. The first rock is an essexite, the second a
camptonite, the third a hornblendite, and while the compositions
dififer slightly in percentages of silica, and to a less extent in other
constituents, the chemical resemblances are striking, and the three
analyses lie within the range of many well-known series of analyses
of particular rocks.

The first rock consists of lime-soda-feldspar and augite, with
some olivine and mica, and rarely a little hornblende. The second
rock consists of feldspar and hornblende in nearly equal proportions ;
