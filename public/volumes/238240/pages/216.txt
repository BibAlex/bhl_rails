In the days of Newton, Lagrange and Laplace, it was assumed
that the formation of the planetary system was essentially complete,
and the sun's attraction rigorously constant from age to age ; and it
was scarcely deemed necessary to consider the secular efit'ects of
slight modifying causes such as the downfall of cosmical dust upon
the bodies composing the solar system. But the progress of the past
century has shown that the Newtonian hypothesis of a constant
mass and a central attraction depending wholly on the distance, but
not on the time, is at best a very rough approximation to the truth;
for in addition to the downfall of cosmical dust upon all the bodies
of our system, it has been shown by the researches of Arrhenius,
Schwartzchild and others, that the sun especially is losing finely
divided matter under the action of repulsive forces such as we see
illustrated in the streamers of the corona and the tails of comets.
In our modern studies of the orbital motions of the heavenly bodies,
therefore, we have to take the central mass as variable with the
time, and consider the small secular changes which will follow from
a variation of the central attraction incident to a gradual change of
mass.
These questions have been treated in some form by many of the
successors of Newton ; and even this great philosopher himself in
one case supposed that the central mass might be varied by a comet
falling into the sun.^ Laplace devotes considerable attention to the
secular equations for determining the eltects of the decrease of the
sun's mass due to loss of light, then supposed to be of corpuscular
