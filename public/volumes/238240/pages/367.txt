Corrigendum
■ In Mr. Berry's article on "A Study of the Tertiary
Floras of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain" in No. 199,
the sketch maps on pages 306 and 308, by mistake, have
been transposed and that on page 308 should have been
printed on page 306 and that on page 306 should have been
printed on page 308. The legends are correctly numbered,
but Fig. I has been printed over the legend of Fig. 2 and
vice versa.
Members who have not as jet sent their photographs to the Society will
confer a favor by so doing; cabinet size preferred.
It is requested that all correspondence bj addressed
