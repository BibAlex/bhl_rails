BARUS— ELLIPTIC INTERFERE^CE
r April ?i.
Finally if for any suitable value of c the grating g' is moved in
its own plane without rotation away from g, so as to widen the
crack at 6^ between them, the fringes grow continually finer until
they pass beyond visibility, and vice versa ; i. e., as the crack at 6^ is
made smaller the lines continually coarsen.
5. Nature of the Evanescence. — The fact that the lines vanish
as a whole and almost suddenly after reaching their maximum dis-
tance apart is very peculiar, as is also the fact that they cannot be
passed through infinite size or appear symmetrically on both sides
of this adjustment. To investigate this case I provided both the
collimator and the telescope with slits so that the parts of the grat-
ing g and g', from which the interfering pencils come, might be
investigated.
If a single vertical slit about i mm. wide is passed from right
to left toward the objective of the telescope, a black line passe.=

across the field of the spectrum, which line is merely the image of
the crack at 5". In the diagram Fig. 4, the G rays, for instance, conif^

the [' rays come from but a single grating. Now when the space e
