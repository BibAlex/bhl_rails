This fact shoitld be noted in connection with the use of the above
table, viz.. the specific gravity of a sample of sea water is the num-
ber representing its weight as compared with an equal volume of
pure water at the same temperature. The latter is usually called
1. 000 so that the specific gravity of a sample of sea water may be
some such number as 1.025. The density is the weight in grams of
one cubic centimeter of water at the temperature in situ (^°) com-
pared with that of i c.c. of pure water at 40° C. It is usually
expressed as D-^. The salinity is the total weight in grams of the
4
matter dissolved in i.ooo grams of water.
Mathcmatic Calculation. — Through the kindness of a graduate
student, ]\Ir. John C. Bechtel. to whom my thanks are due, I was
relieved of the labor of making the mathematic calculations neces-
sary to reduce the hydrometric readings to 15° C. His method of
procedure is herewith given in a sample case.
To determine density at 15° C. of salt water whose density at
23° is 1.0155.
From the table we see that this corresponds to a solution whose
density at 15° lies between i.oi and 1.02.
We therefore find figures for density of salt water at 23°, if
density at 15° is i.oi, and also if density is 1.02.
Density at 20° is 1.00898 for first and 1. 01886 for second.
