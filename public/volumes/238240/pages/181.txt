204 HINRICHS— ATOMIC WEIGHT OF VANADIUM. [April 21.
III. — The Analytical Results.
The chemical work, beginning with the determination of the
weight p and ending with the determination of the weight q (or the
inverse) gives directly the atomic ratio r, by a simple division carried
to five decimal places. A simple substraction now will give the
analytical excess e by using the atomic ratio calculated once for all
for the reaction. The results obtained in this way are given in
Table III.
We will here only call attention to the following peculiarly inter-
esting circumstances :
" Analyst B " working under Roscoe makes three determinations
under reaction 269, and takes almost the same weight of the oxy-
chloride for each one of these determinations ; notwithstanding the
fact that he really only repeats one and the same determination three
times, his results range over 501 units in the fifth place — an enor-
mous range under so favorable conditions.
In the language of Berzelius, this enormous range is quite a big
camel which was swallowed without an effort in the laboratory of
Roscoe, who strained laboriously at the tiny gnat of phosphoric acid
which a test of high delicacy, that was not yet known in the days
when Berzelius did his splendid pioneer work on vanadium and
courteously presented to Faraday a sample of the vanadic acid he
had received from his disciple who discovered the element vanadium
and which acid Berzelius had purified himself as far as the science
of his time permitted. These facts I gather from Becker, Smithson.
