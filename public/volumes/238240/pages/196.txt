Our observations indicate as the mean value of the solar con-
stant of radiation :
1.922 calories (15° C.) per square centimeter per minute.
The observations having been obtained mainly near the time of
sun-spot maximum we think it probable that their mean is hardly
high enough to represent the average condition of the sun. We
incline to think this because it has been shown by Koppen, Nord-
mann. Xewcomb, Abbot and Fowle, Bigelow, Arctowski and others
that the earth's temperature is a little lower at sun-spot maximum
than at sun-spot minimum. This probable correction cannot exceed
one or two per cent.
There is another reason why our value of the solar constant may
be too low. \\''e have not been able to observe, even on ]^Iount
Whitney, any radiation beyond the wave-length 0.29/i, in the ultra-
violet spectrum. Whether the rays of less wave-length are oblit-
erated in the earth's atmosphere or in that of the sun we cannot
know, but we do know that ozone, which is perhaps formed in the
upper atmosphere, exercises powerful selective absorption beyond
wave-length 0.29/x. Hence it may be that we are forced to neglect
some radiation not quite negligible. It is very improbable that the
amount thus neglected exceeds i or 2 per cent.
As for the supposed variability of the sun, our determinations
strongly indicate that the so-called solar constant is not really a
constant, but fluctuates over a range of about 8 per cent. This
result is apparently the direct outcome of our observations, but the
question may well be asked if the apparent fluctuation is not due
either to the inaccuracy of the observations or to incorrect estimates
of the transmission of the atmosphere. If it were due merely to
accidental errors of observations, a gradual march, step by step, day
by day, from a low value to a high one and return woukl be the ex-
