NEPTUNE. AND THE CONNECTION EXISTING
BETWEEN PLANETS AND COMETS.

One of the most remarkable results of the writer's recent
researches on the origin of the solar system has consisted in the
development of a satisfactory proof that the primordial nuclei of
the planets were formed at great distances from the sun, and that
their primitive orbits were highly eccentric like those now described
by the comets ; so that in the last analysis it is shown that the two
classes of bodies are merged together, or rather that the planets
have been built up by the agglomeration of cosmical dust, in the
form of comets, and other fragments of matter, from our ancient
nebula. The following is a brief outline of the thread of argument
leading to this conclusion :
1. It is shown by the exact data supplied by Babinet's criterion
that not one of our planets could have been thrown off from the
sun, by acceleration of rotation, as imagined by Laplace in 1796, but
that the nuclei must have started in the distance and since neared the
sun, by insensible degrees, as the masses were gradually augmented
by precipitations from the surrounding nebular medium.
2. When it was thus demonstrated by exact calculation that the
premise handed down by Laplace is erroneous, our theory of
planetary genesis was placed on a new basis by the proof that the
roundness of planetary orbits is due to the secular action of a
resisting medium, which has reduced the size of the planetary orbits
and rendered them almost exactly circular.
3. In order to be so exactly circular, as they are now found to be,
these orbits must originally have been very large, and also highly
eccentric, like the orbits of comets ; the orbits accordingly have been
reduced in size by encounters with the other minor bodies, the
