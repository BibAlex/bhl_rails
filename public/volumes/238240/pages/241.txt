800 IDDINGSâ€” PROBLEMS IN PETROLOGY. [April 21,
regions, each of which may undergo local differentiation according
to conditions of its eruption. The apparent persistency of the major
features of reHef on the earth's surface and the demands of isostasy
suggest an absence of homogeneity within the material of which it
is composed. The solution of these fundamental problems in geology
must rest on petrological research along the lines here indicated.
Such are some of the more obvious problems of petrology, the
solution of which involves the cooperation of petrographers with the
chemist, the geophysicist and the geologist.
