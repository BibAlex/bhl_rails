of this age are tmknown. This interval comprises the first half of
the Miocene age and when renewed stthmergence furnishes ns
with a record we find very different conditions from those pre-
viously enumerated. Either because of the diversion of the gulf
stream to the eastward due to the emergence of peninstilar Florida
or as a result of changes in depth off the Hatteras anticline, a cool
inshore current seems to have swept southward along the coast and
through the Suwannee Strait across northern peninsular Florida,
carrying with it a northern marine fauna which replaced the tropical
fauna that had previously occupied this region.
