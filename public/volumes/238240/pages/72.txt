I9II.] STEVENSONâ€” FORMATIOX OF COAL BEDS. 97
In a later paper,^' Potonie says that having supported the cause
of autochthony, he must describe a deposit of allochthonous type.
The distinctions are simple ; in plants of autochthonous origin, the
more tender parts are preserved but they are practically wanting
in those of allochthonous origin. In connection with coal beds one
has to do chiefly with autochthonous plants ; but in Culm localities
he has to do with " Haecksel." shreds of plants, which are char-
acteristic of allochthony. These fragments are at time large
enough to show by their arrangement the direction of the transport-
ing current.
Allochthonous deposits of carbonaceous material have few
botanically recognizable plants ; many stems and branches, often
coal coated but with surface sculpture so obscured that determina-
tion is impossible ; stems of the Knorria type are of frequent occur-
rence ; while Stiguiaria is almost wholly absent, those which do occur
being imperfect. Sub-surface organs can be carried away only
after having been washed out from their place : other portions of
plants nuist be the essential material of a transported mass.
He presents the following contrasts.
Autochthony. Allochthony.
