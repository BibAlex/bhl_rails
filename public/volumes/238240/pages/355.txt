ISOSTASY AND MOUNTAIN RANGES.

The cause of the elevation of mountains has ahvays been a most
fascinating subject of study, and we find the earher geologists giv-
ing much attention to it. In the first half of the nineteenth century
the prevailing idea was that mountain ranges were due to the upward
pressure of liquid lava and that their elevation was closely related
to the volcanic forces. As late as the middle of the century Elie de
Beaumont upheld this idea with all the prestige of his great authority.
But a more detailed study of the structure of the rocks wdiich
make up the mountains led to dift'erent conceptions. It was found
that the whole mass had been subjected to tremendous compressional
forces in a line at right angles to the mountain range. This was
shown by the immense folding of the rocks, the existence of thrust-
faults and of cleavage and the evident flattening out of fossils; so
that the existence of these tangential forces was thoroughly proven.
This led then to the idea that mountains owe their origin not to
vertical forces, but to the great tangential forces which folded the
rock and squeezed it upwards. Professors Heim and Suess in
Europe, and Dana, Hall and Le Conte in America, were all very
active in developing this point of view, though Dana realized that
vertical forces also played some part in the elevation of mountains ;
but the dominant influence of the tangential forces was recognized
in the udLine orogenic, or mountain-making {orcts,\\\-\\c\-\\\2iS reserved
entirely for them. Without doubt, confidence in the efficiency of
tangential forces was greatly strengthened by the fact that these
forces could be satisfactorily accounted for by the cooling of the
earth ; for the cooling is greatest at a short distance below the sur-
face and the exterior layers are subjected to tangential crushing to
accommodate themselves to the shrinking interior.
