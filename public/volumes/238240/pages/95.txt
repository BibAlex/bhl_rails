In other words the molecule moves through a liquid about twice as
viscous as the air itself.
9. Conclusion. — The above data are subject to the different hypoth-
eses stated ; but it has been shown that the results may be obtained
by the method described free from ulterior assumption. It seems
to me that detailed investigations of the above kind carried on with
reference to both the chemical and the physical properties of the
liquid, i. e., with different liquids and different gases at different
temperatures and pressures, cannot but lead to results of importance
bearing on the molecular physics involved. Hence experiments of
this kind have been begun in this laboratory and I hope to report the
results from time to time. Obviously in a doubly closed water ma-
nometer (U-tube) the unequal heads of the two columns of liquid
must in a way similar to the above vanish in the lapse of time. This
method seems particularly well adapted to obviate convection.
Finally hydrogen shows a measurable amount of molecular tran-
spiration in the daily march of results already obtained, and with this
gas a new and direct method for obtaining the molecular diameter
is foreshadowed.
