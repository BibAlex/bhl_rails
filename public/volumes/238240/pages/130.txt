HEXRY CHARLES LEA. xli
laying the foundation of our knowledge of freshwater bivalves, Lea's
aim and achievement were purely intellectual. Of him may be truth-
fully quoted those noble words of Tyndall : " The true son of science
will pursue his inquiries irrespective of practical considerations. He
will ever regard the acquisition and expansion of natural knowledge
— the unravelling of the complex web of nature by the disciplined
intellect of man, as his noblest end — and not as a means to any other
end."
The President:
Dr. Dixon, Dr. ]\Iitchell, ]Mrs. Henry C. Lea. and other members
of Air. Lea's family, in the name and on behalf of the American
Philosophical Society, it gives me great pleasure to accept with
sincere thanks these gifts of affection and of a just civic and family
pride. They will find in the notable collection already in the ancient
hall of the American Philosophical Society the portraits of worthy
spirits and warm friends from those of Washington, Franklin, Jef-
ferson and Rittenhouse down to those of Cope, Leidy and New-
comb. There they will ever live, an inspiration to young men of
what may be achieved by a long life of faithful unremitting labor,
and a reminder to old men of what has been thus splendidly achieved
by their predecessors.
