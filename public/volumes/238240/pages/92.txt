A few comparisons with a case of viscous flow may here be inter-
esting. Using Poiseuille's law in the form given by O. E. Meyer
and Schumann's data for the viscosity of air, it would follow that
but .194 X 10"^ cm.- of the .0314 cm.^ of right section at d is open
to intermolecular transpiration. The assumption of capillary trans-
piration is of course unwarrantable and the comparison is made
merely to show' that relatively enormous resistances are in question.
Again the coefficient of viscosity

may be determined directly. In this equation m is the number of
grams of air transpiring in t seconds through the section irr- and in
virtue of the pressure gradient {P — /')/i, when -q is the viscosity
and ^ the slip of the gas. Hence the value r;/(i -f 4l/r) =4.8 X 10^
would have to obtain, a resistance, which would still be enormously
large relative to the viscosity of air (t/=i.8oX io"*'), even if the
part of the section of the channel which is open to capillary tran-
spiration is a very small fraction.
7. The Coefficients of Transpiration. — To compute the constants
under which flow takes place the concentration gradient dc/dl
may be replaced either by a density gradient dp/dl or a pressure
gradient dp/dl. If the coefficients in question be k^ and kp respec-

where a is the section taken equal to the area of the mouth of the
swimmer, R is the absolute gas constant, r the absolute temperature
of the gas, and m the loss of imprisoned air in grams per second.
