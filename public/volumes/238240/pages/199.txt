SELF-LUMINOUS NIGHT HAZE.

There is one phase of the night skies which does not seem to have
received much or any attention. It is the occasional presence of
self-luminous haze. This matter does not seem to be similar to tfie
luminous night clouds, " die leuchtenden Nachtvvolken." which were
observed by O. Jesse and others some twenty-five or thirty years
ago, and which were found to be clouds at such great altitudes above
the earth's surface (upwards of fifty miles high) that they received
the sunlight long after or before the ordinary clouds. The observa-
tions of O. Jesse were printed in the Astronoinische Nachrichtcn,
Bd. 121, pp. JT,, III ; Bd. 130. p. 425; Bd. 133, p. 131 ; Bd. 140. p.
161. In A. N., Bd. 140 (No. 3347), he gives a long list of altitudes,
determined by photograph}-, which range from 81 km. to 87 km.
The mean value given by the observations from 1885 to 1891 was
82 km. (52 miles). These clouds were seen in the northern hemi-
sphere onlv near the time of the summer solstice. In the southern
hemisphere they were seen at the opposite season. From his papers
it is clear that these sunlit clouds were in no way related to the
present subject, and I onl}- mention them to forestall any suggestion
that they were similar to the ones seen by me. The objects to be
described here were apparently at the altitude of the ordinary higher
clouds. They have been seen in all parts of the sky and at all hours
of the night. In a paper on the aurora^ I have previously called
attention to the frequent luminous condition of the sky at night.
This feature long ago impressed itself upon me. Indeed any one
who has spent much time under the open sky hunting comets, etc..
will have been forcibly impressed with this peculiarity. In most
cases this illumination has been due evidently to a diffusion of the
