taut factor in respect of (|nantity, but its swell, coming later than the
others, often prolongs the stage of high water. 11ie western rivers,
entering below the mouth of the ( )hio, are the Arkansas, Red,
Ouachita and >'azoo. all of which descend into lowlands, where they
meander for a long distance before reaching the Mississippi. The
condition in this drainage area is that of ra])idl_\- Howing streams
emerging from highlands on an immense area of lowland, most of
which, unless protected, is subject to overflow.
r>oth l'"rankenlield and Morrill emphasize the gradual rise of
Hoods within the open area. h'rankenlield gives the record for 1903.

The advance was deliberate, the lirst wave requiring four da}s
for passage from Cairo (at the mouth of the Ohio) to Memphis and
seven (la\s thence to New ( )rleans. The rise was gradual at Cairo,
being a foot and a half dail)' for i,() days to March 8- — which was
thought to be remarkably ra|)id — and much less thereafter to the
crest; at Memphis, it was one foot for 21 clays and onlv one fourth
of a fool for v:\c\] of the remaining _>S ; at \'icksburg, barely nine
tenths of a fool during each of the first 27 davs ; while at New
Orleans, the dail\ rise averaged little more than one fifth of a foot
throughout the whole ]H'riod. '^Idie great mass of the water came
from the ( )hio, but the \\c(\ and ( )uachita, entering from the w'est,
were abnormall\ high; at New ( )rleans, the water was at or above
danger line for 85 days.
When one studies the reports of local observers, as given in the
publications from which this synopsis is taken, he is surprised bv
the nature and extent of damage within the Hooded areas. Artificial
protection is almost unknown along th.e upper Mississij^pi (above
Cairo) as well as along the Missouri and its tributaries. Floods
have free course in the low-lying prairie regions of Illinois, Iowa
and Kansas as well as in jiortions of Missouri, and there one should
expect to fmd record of the greater disaster. Morrill has compared
