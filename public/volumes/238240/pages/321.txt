NIPHERâ€” DISRUPTIVE DISCHARGES
[April 21,

spark channel. This part of the discharge must be practically noise-
less. The sound produced by the spark is caused by the collapse of
the spark channel in a manner similar to that caused by the crack
produced by the end of a whip-lash, which also cuts a hole in the
air. When an electrical discharge occurs between clouds or between

trical corpuscles, the latter region must be in a condition like that
surrounding the grounded anode in Fig. i. The disruptive channel
will dififuse into it. This region is one which is properly called a
region of conduction.
The other end of the discharge channel must penetrate regions
where the air is super-charged with corpuscles. It is not in the
