charged electroscope. The initial discharge of the electroscope is
very sharply marked. Observations may be repeated at will and
after any interval ; when corrected for temperature and pressure a
most satisfactory constancy of results is obtained. Fig. i indicates
the essential parts of the apparatus. In the following a short de-
scription is given of the results of investigations of the influence of
the diameter of the conductor, of stranding the conductor, of the
alternating frequency, of wave form, of pressure, of moisture con-

tent and of temperature on the electric intensity at which atmos-
pheric air breaks down. The experiments on temperature, moisture
content and diameter of conductor are given in the paper mentioned
above. The results of the remaining investigations are first given
here. Xo attempt is made to describe the details of the experiments.
For these the reader may refer to the earlier paper and also to one
shortly to be presented to the American Institute of Electrical Engi-
neers in which the practical bearing of the results will be discussed.
