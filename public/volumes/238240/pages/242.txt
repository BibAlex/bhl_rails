Introductory.
The observations recorded in the following pages may be said
to represent a preliminary sketch of a small chapter in the study of
the South Atlantic and Gulf Coastal plain undertaken by the United
States Geological Survey in cooperation with the various state sur-
veys under the direction of Dr. T. W. \^aughan.
Neither geologist nor biologist fully appreciates the magnitude,
complexity or uniqueness of the coastal plain of the southeastern
United States. The present coast line, a boundary first recognized
by the aborigines and early explorers and so emphasized by geog-
raphers, is from the standpoint of the student of geologic history a
continually shifting demarcation which does not, nor perhaps never,
marked the seaward limit of the physiographic unit known as the
Coastal Plain Province, for the gently sloping land surface continues
seaward beneath the waves of the present Atlantic and Gulf waters
varying distances up to lOO miles or more and then precipitately de-
scends several thousand feet in a few miles, forming the majestic
escarpment which is regarded as the continental boundary. In the
past the coast line has advanced inland over the present emerged
portion of the coastal plain and receded seaward over the present
submerged margin, many times. At one time the waves of the Gulf
of ]\Iexico broke in southern Illinois, at another they were confined
lOO miles south of the present sites of ]\Iobile and New Orleans,
600 miles to the southward.
On the whole, the history of events in Tertiary times has been a
progressive adding to the land area of the continent, the most im-
