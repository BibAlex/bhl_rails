138 BARUSâ€” ELLIPTIC INTERFERENCE. [April 21.
a corona were produced by a sufficient number of fog particles dis-
tributed throughout a plane normal to the undeviated rays. Now
let the alternate particles be moved in the same way slightly to the
rear of their original position and let the distance between the two
planes be small relatively to the wave length of light. In such a
case there should be two identical coronas, superimposed in all their
parts and they should therefore interfere. Inasmuch, however, as
even small fog particles are of the order of size of .0001 cm. and
their mean distance apart fifty times larger, i. e., .005 cm., it remains
to be proved whether such an effect can be looked to as an explana-
tion of the disc colors of coronas.
