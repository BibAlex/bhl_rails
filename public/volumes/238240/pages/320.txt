although only one discharge could be distinguished by the sound.
The fainter discharge came from the red-hot ball, and crossed the
track of the brighter spark, which came from a hook serving for
suspension of the ball on a grounded wire. The track of the fainter
spark is as sharply defined within the flame as that of the brighter
one. In Figs. 3 and 4 the discharge was in the positive line. The
hot ball was grounded.

It is evident from these results that the conduction of the gases
within the flame of the lamp is very much less than is shown in the
positive column near the anode terminal in Fig. i. In that figure,
the air within the disruptive channel is highly rarefied. This channel
is a hole bored through the air. The discharge through this channel
issued from the end and continued as " sheet lightning " across the
drainage area surrounding the grounded anode. This drainage area
