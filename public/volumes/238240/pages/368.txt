AN HYDROMETRIC INVESTIGATION OF THE INFLU-
ENCE OF SEA WATER ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF
SALT MARSH AND ESTUARINE PLANTS.

(Read April 23, 19 lo.)
Elsewhere^ I have discussed the general character of the vegeta-
tion of the salt marshes of the northern New Jersey coast and the
factors controlling the distribution of marsh plants in that area.
This earlier study was based largely on physiographic and floristic
considerations, although reference is made on page 379 of that paper
to the use of the hydrometer in the investigation of the actual influ-
ence of sea water, or salty soil, on the distribution of a limited num-
ber of plants. The investigation begun in 1909 has been continued
until sufficient facts have accumulated to warrant their publication.
The use of a special kind of hydrometer was suggested as a
simple but efficient method of investigating the salt content of salt
marsh soils and of the estuarine water which, at first strongly saline,
becomes largely diluted, as it mingles with that of streams flowing
in a seaward direction. This is the first actual use of the hydrometer
