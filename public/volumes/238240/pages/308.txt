obtained from the spreading out of a beam of rapidly moving
electrons when they traverse a layer of matter. Working over such
material as was then available Thomson found his conclusion, that
the number per atom was comparable with the atomic weight, was
strengthened. Quite recently J. A. Crowther has made a very care-
ful experimental investigation covering both these lines of inquiry.
He finds that Thomson's calculations are borne out very satisfac-
torily by his experiments and that the number of electrons which
go to make up each atom is three times the atomic weight of the
element.
