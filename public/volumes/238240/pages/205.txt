SPECTROSCOPIC PROOF OF THE REPULSION BY THE
SUX OF GASEOUS AlOLECULES IN THE TAIL
OF HALLEY'S COMET.
By PERCIVAL LOWELL.
{Read April Ji, 191 1.)
1. The return of Halley's comet has been noteworthy chiefly for
the possibihty of employing upon it modern methods of instrumental
research. Since its last previous apparition have been devised those
two great engines of astronomic exploration, spectroscopy and celes-
tial photography. The former has afiforded us our first direct knowl-
edge of the substances composing comets, while the latter has given
us a means of easy and rapid registration of the visitant's appear-
ance. This is especially valuable in the case of a body as vast and
vague as a comet, free-hand drawing of which is peculiarl}- liable
to distortion.
During the last return of Halley's comet that body was sub-
jected at Flagstaif to investigation b\' both instruments simulta-
neously. One result of this was the detection that gaseous mole-
cules — in contradistinction to minute solid particles merely — are
directly repelled b}- a force emanating from the sun, presumably
the pressure of light. Previously this had been held impossible.
Schwarzschild had, as he thought, demonstrated mathematically in
an able paper that molecules of gas were too small to be thus aiTected
by the forces concerned and Arrhenius had adopted his deduction
and published it as a fact in his " Worlds in the Making." That
the bodies themselves would so soon refute this would not have been
deemed probable and invests the detection with the more immediate
interest. Incidentally we may remark that vSchwarzschild had since
given up his original opinion.
2. That the tail of a comet is due to repellant force exerted by
the sun is api)arent from the direction the tail takes. For that direc-
