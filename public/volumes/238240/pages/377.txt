The fact that such salt marsh species as Spartina stricta maritima
mingles with fresh-water marsh species under almost fresh-water
conditions is to be explained by the occasional inundation of such
plants by more strongly saline water at exceptionally high tides, so
that the exceptionally high tides enable the salt grass to persist sur-
rounded by fresh-water marsh species. The salt marsh species can
" Prolnibly due to evaporation.
