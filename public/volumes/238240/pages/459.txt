the peat. In the great Digenmoors of the Bavarian highlands he
found
Meters.
1. Black peat, with Sphagnum i to 1.2
2. Homogeneous black-brown, compact, plastic peat, with
layers of crushed birch stems ; a few specimens of
Sphagnum, but 90 per cent, of the mass consisting of
roots of Cyperaceae i to 1.5
3. Wood layer of conifers 0.4 to 0.6
4 Glacial drift.
He gives measurements from fourteen locaHties in Switzerland, only
one of which failed to show the succession observed in the section.
The exception is a Hochmoor Avithout Rasenmoor foundation and
resting directly on a layer of wood remains. One group seems to
contradict Sendtner's generalization that Hochmoor accumulates only
in localities where the water is not calcareous. This, the " Todte
Meer," is a typical living Hochmoor, near Willerszell, bearing on its
surface many hummocks nearly equal in height and basal diameter,
and bordered by a mountain stream, whose drainage area is in a
limestone region. It shows
Meters.
1. Hochmoor, Sphagnuni 0.2 to 0.3
2. Felted Rasenmoor, upper part consisting of Carex and
Arundo, with scattered alg.T ; lower part with
Hypntim 3
3. Almost pure well-preserved Hypniim.
4. Clay and gravel.
He finds a simple explanation in the fact that the stream, at high
water, does not wet the Spliaginun. It may be well to note here
that in Michigan, according to Davis, SpJiagmon is indifferent to the
character of the water, the presence of calcium carbonate in no wise
affecting its growth.
Friih reports 48 Hochmoors in the Alpine region as originating
on Rasenmoors. Y. Bemmclen and Staring are cited as having
proved the same relations for the provinces of Orenthe, Friesland
and Gottinguc in Holland. The Rasenmoor does not require hard
water, for the vast moors of the Rhine and Maas area are watered
bv those streams, which contain only 65 and 41 millionths of calcium
and magnesium compounds. The relation between Hochmoor and
