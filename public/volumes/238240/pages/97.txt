BARUS— ELLIPTIC INTERFERENCE
[April 21,
while the grating (either transmitting or reflecting) must be at the
center of the spectrometer, if angles are to be measured. The same
is true for any of the other superimposed white slit images in the
above or the earlier experiments and may even be repeated with
successive transmitting gratings. It is interesting to note that the
position of the center of ellipses is at the same w^ave length in all
the spectra though the form of ellipses may differ enormously. The
same phenomenon may thus be seen by a number of observers at the
same time, each looking through his own telescope.

4. Third Method. Parallel Gratings. — In this case the two
halves of the grating are treated displaced parallel to themselves,
from their original coplanar position in the grating, from which
they are cut. Their mounting is thus something like the case of the
two black plates of Fresnel's mirror apparatus, one of the plates
being adapted for displacement parallel to itself.
In Fig. 2 g and g' show the two halves of the grating cut along
the plane S, normal to the plates and parallel to the rulings. The
half g' is provided with a micrometer screw, so that it may be suc-
cessively moved from the position g' in Fig. 2 tt^ the position g' in
Fig. 3, through all intermediate positions, while the half g remains
stationary. Each of the halves g and g' is controlled by three ad-
justment screws (horizontal and vertical axes of rotation), to secure
complete parallelism of the faces of the grating. Each, moreover,
