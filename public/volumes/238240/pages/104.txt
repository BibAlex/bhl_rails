ing X, the corresponding coefficients would be i\d(n -{- N)/d$, and
these are much more in error, here and in the preceding cases. If

If the crack N ^JJ should be made infinitely small, they would be
infinitely large. To pass through infinity, A'^ must be negative,
which has no meaning for i > ^ or would place one eft'ective edge of
the crack 5" behind the other. These inferences agree with the
observations as above detailed. If, however, i <^ 0, a. negative value
of Nq restores equation (i6) for //:^o to equation (17), as was
actually observed (Figs. 2 and 3).
Finally equation (14) might be used for observation in the incre-
mented form

but I did not succeed with it. One loses track of the run of a

II. Colored Slit Images and Disc Colors of Coronas. — In the
above experiment the fringes were but a few minutes apart. It is
obvious, however, that if A''^ is sufficiently small the fringes will grow
with decreasing 11, in angular magnitude, until there are but a few
black bands in the spectrum. Under these circumstances the unde-
viated image of the superimposed slits must appear colored, particu-
larly so if an effect equivalent to A^^, is present throughout the
grating. This phenomenon of colored slits is apparently of interest
in its bearing on the theory of coronas, where there is also an inter-
ference phenomenon superimposed upon a diffraction phenomenon,
as is evidenced by the brilliant disc colors. For instance suppose
