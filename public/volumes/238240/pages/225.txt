LAMBERT— ON THE SOLUTION OF
[April 20,
which is a solution of Fourier's equation for all values of <f>(x) for
which V either contains a finite number of terms or is an infinite
series uniformly convergent both in .r and in t.
The following table shows several values of <^(.v) and the cor-
responding solutions of Fourier's equation.
I (i) <f>(x) = A,
(2) <f>{x) = A.V,
(3) <^W = ^-^^
(4) (f){x) = A sin {nx),
(5) <^('t') = ^ cos {71X),
(6) 4>{x) = Ae^%
(7) <^{x) = Ae-\
(8) 4>{x) = Ae"' sin {?ix).
V= A,
V= Ax,
F= A{x^ + 2 A?),
]^ = Ae-''-'^' sin {nx).
V=Ae-
{nx),
V= Ae-"'+"'''',
V= Ae""" sin (//.r -(- 211^ Kt).
It will be noticed that in these solutions ^(.r) is the value of V
when t=o, that is F^</)(.r) is the initial heat distribution.
It will also be noticed that in all these results x may be replaced
by X 4" 0" This statement is true of the results in the several fol-
lowing tables.
If Fourier's differential equation is replaced by
Ct OX'
and the assumption made that
makes this equation an identity, this identity arranged in ascending
powers of 5" is

Equating to zero the coefficients of the powers of 5" in this
identity,
