Let A^, A.^, A^, etc., denote the atomic weights and suppose
/SA^^u^, ^A.^^n.-,, etc.. where ^ is a constant. Then we have

where C is a constant which should be the same for all series of
similar elements.
Also ('',„+^ — r„i)^^t' approximately, so that
According to the theory therefore we ought to be able to find the
number of electrons per atom from the atomic weights.
In the figure the values of Ai for series of similar elements are
plotted against the order of the elements in the series. For some
series a constant has been added to the values of Ai to prevent the
different lines falling too close together. It will be seen that
the values of Ah for each series fall nearly on straight lines
and that the different lines are nearly parallel. This shows that
Am+^i — A,ni = C is nearly constant, as was to be expected from the
theory. The mean value of C is o.8i. Hence w'e get ^ = 8 so that
the number of electrons per atom conies out 8 times the atomic
weight in all cases.
This estimate agrees as well as could be expected with the num-
bers deduced from the optical properties of the elements which
might be expected to be too low.
We have assumed that the electrical density of the positive
spheres is uniform so that the approximate agreement of the atomic
weights with the theory confirms this assumption. It is easy to
see that the arrangement of the electrons in the positive sphere is
not afifected by a change in the size of the sphere provided its density
remains uniform and its total charge the same as before. It is
