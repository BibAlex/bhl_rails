the observing station, up to the liighest altitude tested, 4,420 meters.
Fluctuations in the values proceeding step by step, day by day, from
higher to lower values and return, within a range of about 8 per cent,
usually occur in somewhat irregular intervals of from five to ten
days in total period. These fluctuations are thought to indicate a
true variability of the sun. It is proposed to test this conclusion by
daily observations extending over several months, and to be made
simultaneouslv in California and southern ^Mexico.
