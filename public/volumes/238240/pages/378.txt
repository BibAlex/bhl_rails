withstand fresh water better than the fresh-water species can salt
water. These latter plants are able also to withstand an occasional
flooding, although normally they are controlled by fresh water. This
is probably to be accounted for by the resistance of the leaves that
surround the stem, while the roots are in practically fresh water,
which saturates the ground and prevents the entrance of salt water
into it for some time. The occasional flooding of salt water is not
for a sufficiently long time to efifect the character of the ground
water in which the roots of such plants as Sagittaria latifolia, Cicnta
maculata grow.
The observations at Belmar began with an estimation of the
salinity of the ocean water. The readings from 4-19 are interesting

for hydrometric determinations were chosen along this shore.
