These plants indicate that the coast was low, which explains the
absence of any but the finest terrigenous materials in the shallow
water deposits which constitute the Calvert formation. The flora
from \'irginia indicates the presence of extensive cypress swamps,
the latter type of plant being the most abundant fossil collected and
the other plants identified being for the most part similar in their
physiological demands upon their environment. The flora from
Maryland is the natural counterpart of that from Virginia in con-
taining several typical elements of just the sort of a plant associa-
tion found on sands (inner beaches and more or less stationary
dunes) along the present coasts in the temperate zone.
Regarding age the plants are clearly Middle Miocene according
to European standards. They indicate less conclusively the climatic
