gas constant, and T = t-\-2y2>° its absolute temperature. M is the
mass of the glass of the swimmer and g the acceleration of gravity.
The equilibrium position of the swimmer is unstable. To find it,
R may be raised and lowered for a fixed level of the swimmer; or R
may be clamped and the proper level of the swimmer determined hy
suction and release at C. The dropping of the swimmer throughout

the column of water may occasion adiabatic change of temperature
of .23°. It was my practice to use the latter method and to indicate
the equilibrium position of the swimmer by an elastic steel ring,
encircling A. In this w^ay the correct level may be found to about
I mm., and afterwards read ofi^ on the cathetometer.
After making the observations, the hose ab is to be separated at
a, so that the swimmer falls to a support some distance above the
bottom, admitting of free passage for diffusion. Clearly this dif-
fusion is due to the difference of level, h" , between the water level in
z' and at the free surface of the liquid, / (see Fig. 2). Increase of
barometric pressure has no differential effect. A large head h" how-
ever means a longer column for diffusion.
5. Data. — In the following summary a few of the data made in
1900 are inserted, chosen at random.
