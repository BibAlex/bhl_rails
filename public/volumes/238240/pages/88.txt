THE- TRANSPIRATION OF AIR THROUGH A PARTI-
TION OF WATER.

1. Molecular Transpiration of a Gas. — Ever since 1895 I have
observed that the Cartesian diver, used in my lectures, grew regularly
heavier from year to year. The possibility of such an occurrence
is at hand ; for the imprisoned air is under a slight pressure-excess
as compared with the external atmospheric air. But this pressure
gradient is apparently so insignificant as compared with the long
column of water through which the flow must take place, that oppor-
tunities of obtaining quantitative evidence in favor of such trans-
piration seem remote. If, however, this evidence is here actually
forthcoming, then the experiment is of unusual interest, as it will
probably indicate the nature of the passage of a gas, molecularly,
through the intermolecular pores of a liquid. It should be possible
for instance to obtain comparisons between the dimensions of the
molecules transferred and the channels of transfer involved.
2. Apparatus. — Hence on February 27. 1890, I made a series of
definite experiments^ sufficiently sensitive that in the lapse of years
one might expect to obtain an issue. The swimmer was a small
light balloon-shaped glass vessel, vd, Fig. i, unfortunately with a
very narrow mouth, 2 mm. in diameter, at d, in the long column of
water A. The small opening however gave assurance that the air
would not be accidentally spilled in the intervening years. For this
reason it was temporarily retained, the purpose being that of getting
a safe estimate of the conditions under which flow takes place.
In Fig. I ab is a rubber hose filled with water, terminating in the
receiver R. Here the lower level of w^ater may be read ofif. More-
over R is provided with an open hose C, through which pressure or
suction may be applied by the mouth, for the purpose of raising or
