(MACROCHELYS TEMMINCKII) FROM TEXAS.

The writer has received for examination from Professor Mark
Francis, of the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, at College
Station, Tex., a nearly complete skull of the great fresh-vvatcr tor-
toise known as the alligator snapper. This fine specimen was dis-
covered last summer or autumn during some dredging operations in
the Brazos River, hetwecn College Station and Navasota. After
passing through various hands it came into the possession of Pro-
fessor Francis, who, on application, kindly transmitted it to me.
With the skull came also a part of a carapace, which doubtless be-
longed to the same animal. The skull was found in a mass of
gravel, and had undoubtedly been washed out of the river bank
not far away. This proximity of the place of burial is evident from
the little damage done to the skull, and is made more probable from
the presence of a part of the shell.
The cavities of the skull, when it came into Professor Francis'
hands, were full of gravel, wedged in very tightly. Some of this
gravel was sent with the skull. It was strongly colored with iron
oxide ; and this oxide served to cement the bits of gravel together
and to the bone. The bone is also colored with the oxide, and it
is so thoroughly mineralized that, on being struck, it rings like a
piece of porcelain.
It would l)c interesting to know exactly the geological age of
this specimen ; but it appears now impossible to determine this.
Professor Alexander Dcussen, of the LTniversity of Texas, has been
engaged in studying the Quaternary and Recent deposits of some
of the rivers of Texas ; and a part of his results is soon to be pub-
lished by the ITnitcd States Geological Survey. He has kindly in-
