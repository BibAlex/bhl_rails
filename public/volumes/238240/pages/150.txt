Like many other weapons, artillery is not of much service unless
vou know how to use it, and do not hesitate to use it. Charles the
Bold was the last of the knights-errant, unless we include the chival-
ric Don Quixote. Cannon had changed all that and Charles was a
failure, though a magnificent one.
