PROBLEMS IX PETROLOGY.
Bv JOSEPH P. IDDINGS.
{Read April 21, 1911.)
The development of the science of petrology from that condition
of the study of rocks, properly termed petrography, is characterized
by the shifting of the emphasis from the purely observational and
descriptive phases of the work to those that relate to the origin and
formation of rocks, both with respect to their occurrence as integral
parts of the earth, and to their composition and structi^re.
Not that there is less need than formerly for accurate observation
and study of rocks, and for thorough description of their composi-
tion, texture and occurrence, but the introduction of greater definite-
ness into conceptions of their modes of formation, and the widening
of the horizon of this field of research through the experimental
and synthetic investigations of the geophysicist, have advanced the
study of rocks from the accumulation of data and statistics, to the
formation of laws and relationships, both as regards minutest details
of composition and texture, and with respect to petrographical prov-
inces, and their connection with the dynamical history of the regions
of the earth in which they occur.
As a consequence of this advance new problems present them-
selves, and invite the cooperation of workers in several branches
of inorganic science. Leaving out of consideration for the present
the great problems of metamorphism, some of which are being suc-
cessfully treated by Adams, or have been under investigation by
Van Hise and Leith, I wish to call your attention to certain phases
of the study of igneous rocks that may be grouped under three
heads for present purposes, as follows : ( 1 ) Tlie actual mineral
composition of igneous rocks, (2) the mathematics of the petrology
of igneous rocks, and (3) petrographical provinces.
