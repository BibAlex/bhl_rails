510 HAUPT— AN ANCIENT PROTEST [April 22,
may be supposed, the orange-colored berry of the mandrake which
is still regarded as an aphrodisiac and supposed to promote concep-
tion; see my paper on Jonah's Whale in vol. xlvi. of these Proceed-
ings (Philadelphia, 1907), p. 152, n. 4. In Genesis, xxx., 14, the
mandrakes are called in Hebrew: duda'hn, that is, love-apples. The
fruit of the mandrake is quite round and of the size of a large plum ;
it resembles a small tomato. The largest berries have a diameter of
ilA in. (nearly 4 cm.). The idea that the forbidden fruit was a
fruit from which an intoxicating drink was prepared is untenable ;
contrast Cheyne's article in the eleventh edition of the Encyclopcvdia
Britannica, vol. i., p. 168". In the article on mandrake, vol. xvii.,
p. 566% there are five misprints in the five letters of the Heb.
word duda'hn; similarly there are two misprints in the three letters
of the Arabic name for Egypt, vol. ix., p. 41''. The new edition is
marred by a great many misprints and inaccuracies, not only in
Oriental words, but also in the English text.
■^ Garden is often used for pudendum niulieris; see Haupt, The
Book of Micah (Chicago, 1910), p. 62, n. 9.
®Eden means pleasure, delight; Heb. gan-'edn denotes a pleasure-
ground. Damascus, the earthly paradise of the Arabs, is called in
Amos, i., 5: Bct-'edn, House of Pleasure; see my remarks in
Peiser's OricntaUstische Literatur.zeitung, June, 1907, col. 306.
The Greek Bible has for Heb. ga>i-'edn in Genesis, iii., 23, 24:
o TrapaSeio-o^; tt}? Tpv<f)}]<; ; the \'ulgate : paradisns voluptatis. The
reading a garden in Eden in Genesis, ii., 8 seems to be a subsequent
modification introduced by some one who connected Heb. 'edn with
the Babylonian edinn^^SnmQr'mn edin, desert; he may have re-
garded Paradise as an oasis in the desert like Damascus ; cf.
Pinches' note in the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archce-
ology, London, June 14, 191 1, p. 161. Damascus means settlement
in a zi'dl-zvatered region; the original form of the name was Ddr-
masql; see my remarks in the American Journal of Semitic Lan-
guages, vol. xxvi., p. 26.
'* See Deuteronomy, i., 39; Isaiah, vii., 16; cf. the translation of
Isaiah, in the Polychrome Bible, p. ii, 1. 25; p. 141, n. 16.
" To know good and evil has about the same meaning as our
phrase to cut one's eye-teeth.
