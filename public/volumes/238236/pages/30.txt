by changing external conditions (for example,
temperature) it will be possible to achieve
success.
In any case, of the three plants subjected to
the action of X rays, our small laboratory ob-
tained a significant increase in yield with peas,
and a very large increase with rye. Besides
continuing to work with the irradiation of rye,
we have already planted half a hectare with
experimental rye seeds at one of the collective
farms of the Moscow Oblast. The results of
these experiments will be described in another
article. We shall only point out that on both the
initial development and yield X rays have exerted
a most beneficial effect.
The investigations conducted in our laboratory
on changes in the development of plants due to
irradiation of rye, wheat, and pea seeds were
set up with the idea of avoiding the mistakes of
our predecessors.
1) The seeds irradiated in our experiments
received exact doses of X rays carefully meas -
ured by expert physicists using dosimeters.
2) The amounts of radiant energy were gradually
increased in order to obtain the full curve of
stimulating dosages (i. e. , according to the
Arndt-Schultze Law). 3) A sufficiently large
number of seeds was used in the experiments
so that results would not be affected by individ-
ual fluctuations. 4) Whenever possible, similar
conditions of temperature and humidity were
maintained both during irradiation and while the
plants were growing. 5) Thorough phenological
observations were carried on during the course
of the entire development of the plants from the
moment of germination to complete ripening of
the seeds. The crop was carefully gathered
and analyzed. These observations showed that
stimulation during the first stages of develop-
ment does not coincide with an increase in yield,
at least for the most thoroughly investigated
object, i. e. , spring wheat. 6) Measurements
were carried on [throughout development].
There were measurements of the main root of
the sprouts, measurements of the plants on the
twenty -seventh day after planting, and measure-
ments of ears and stems at harvest time.
7) The seeds were weighed in such a manner
that the weights of healthy and of diseased
seeds could be obtained as well as the total
weight. In addition, all the seeds of a single
plant, selected for the exceptionally large size
of seeds, were weighed on a torsion scale,
grain by grain.
As far as the individual crops are concerned,
our investigations have shown that rye is suffi-
ciently sensitive to X rays that experiments can
be set up with it and a whole series of questions
which are of interest to radiation biologists can
be answered. These experiments: 1) showed
the incontestable application of the Arndt-
Schultze Law to the action of X rays on plants,
at least on rye, since the measurement of young
plants on the twenty-seventh day after planting
gave a splendid growth curve; a small dose
(250 r) stimulated development, 500 and 750 r
produced still further development in the same
direction, until at 1000 r maximum stimulation
was achieved, after which the curve began to
drop; 2) confirmed the different sensitivity of
soaked seeds and sprouts; 3) showed that differ-
ences do not depend on the quality of the rays,
i. e. , hard or soft rays; 4) the effects of radia-
tion showed up in different ways depending on
the individuality of various plants, which
affected the number and weight of seeds, length
of the stems and ears, time of ripening, etc.
Besides these purely technical conclusions,
we also were able to establish the stimulating
effect of X rays on rye. Plants which received
beneficial doses developed more quickly, had
broader leaves, and exhibited a deeper green
color than the control plants. The average
diameter of the rootlets followed the same
curve of growth as the other parts of the plants.
