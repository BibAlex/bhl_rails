which mutations can be induced. " The answer
is that the threshold is determined by the ability
of the rays to penetrate [the tissues] ; and that
in order to induce mutations any source of rays
may be used, beginning with ultraviolet rays.
Stubbe considers that the second question
concerning rays of different qualities is also
answered, since no statistically significant
differences in results were obtained when iden-
tical doses were used in the region of X rays,
from softest to the hardest rays. In plants this
was confirmed by experiments with snapdragons,
in which equal doses of soft and hard X rays
(as well as gamma rays of radium) induced
identical frequencies of mutations. In other
words, it can be considered established that
the inductive action of X rays does not depend
on wave length. This conclusion is splendidly
confirmed by the table taken from Stubbe
(Table 35).
This table shows that when equal doses of
radiation are used (3000 r in one case and 6000
r in another), hard X rays (506 kv) and soft
ones (180 kv) produce equal increases in the
number of mutations as compared with the
control. It should be noted that the number of
mutations induced by 6000 r is nearly 3 times
as great as that produced by 3000 r.
Now let us turn to the question raised in
1928 by Ancel as to whether administration of
doses in fractions affects the appearance of
mutations. The most clear cut experiment set
up for clarification of this point was also that of
Stubbe who tested the difference between the
action of rays of different qualities in concen-
trated doses and in doses which had been di-
vided into three fractions and administered at
24 -hour intervals (Table 36).
All these experiments indicate, despite the
indications of earlier experiments to the con-
trary, that neither the quality of the rays nor
the fractionation of doses has any effect on the
number of mutations but that the only signifi-
cant factor is the size of the dose (i. e. , the
number of r).
This was confirmed by our experiments with
rye, which revealed that there is no difference
between hard and soft rays in relation to stim-
ulation or inhibition (Breslavets, Medvedeva,
and Afanas'eva, 1935).
One more very interesting question remains,
namely, the nature of gene mutations obtained
by experimental means. In his very first work,
Muller noticed the identical nature of spontane-
ous mutations and those obtained by experi-
mental means. This is confirmed for all the
objects examined. The numerous gene muta-
tions obtained through the action of X rays in
snapdragons, corn, and Drosophila had all been
encountered previously among spontaneous mu-
tations. They possess the same properties,
affect all the organs and the physiological
properties of the organism, and are likewise
usually recessive, very few being dominant.
The first indication of differences in the
nature of spontaneous and experimentally ob-
tained mutations crops up in Stubbe' s experi-
ments (1932*- 1933). The first experiments
showed that after irradiation of the buds the
percentage of gene mutations in the vegetative
organs rose sharply, in comparison with the
controls, whereas the percentage of mutations
that cause changes in the shape of the flowers
did not rise. In another experiment, after
irradiation with soft and semi -hard rays, it
was found that as the dose was increased the
percentage of previously encountered mutations
diminished, while the number of new, i.e., not
previously encountered, mutations increased.
