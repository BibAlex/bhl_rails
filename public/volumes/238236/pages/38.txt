time, produced remarkable results. Irradiation
increased the frequency of mutations by 17. 1%.
These were chromosomal aberrations as a con-
sequence of which there developed various mor-
phological changes, which received specific
names. In addition, among the offspring of the
irradiated plants two gene mutations were ob-
served: "albino" and "swollen. " The latter had
thick, swollen, shiny stems and stalks, thick
leaves, and dwarf size.
A second investigator who began to experi-
ment with the action of X rays on plants and who
confirmed Muller's results was Stadler. In a
whole series of papers (1928, 1929, 1930, 1931,
1932, and 1933), he published interesting data
that he obtained for corn and barley. In the first
experiments he irradiated sprouted seeds.
From 26 irradiated plants of barley which gave
66 ears in Xj (first generation), three X-ray
mutants of recessive type were obtained. They
showed various degrees of albinism, which led
to the death of these plants. The fact that these
mutants appeared only in a few ears indicates
that these X-ray mutants arise in the course of
ontogeny. The 1243 ears which were examined
from Xg (second generation) contained 14 mu-
tants, which were also albinos. Stadler imme-
diately raised the question of the significance of
voltage. He irradiated seeds with high and low
voltages. As his experiments showed (Table 15),
voltage did not affect the frequency of mutations.
These experiments also permitted him to
make an interesting comparison between the
effects of X rays and radium. The latter turned
out to be less effective.
Stadler was also the first to combine the
action of X rays with the action of salts of heavy
metals (barium, lead, and uranium) for a 6-
hour period, 15 hours before irradiation. The
author expected to intensify the mutation process
on the assumption that the absorption of X rays
increases proportionately to the atomic weight
of the substance used (Table 16).
As can be seen from this table, soaking the
seeds in the metallic salts increased the number
of mutations— one out of 16 ears showed muta-
tions — while when X rays were used alone there
was only one mutation in 36 ears, i. e. , the
preliminary treatment increased the number of
mutations by 50%.
In another of his experiments in 1928 Stadler
[1928c] studied the influence of X rays on the
frequency of cross overs and the appearance of
a mosaic effect in the endosperm of corn. Irra-
diation increased the frequency of mutation in
the endosperm by [20-fold] ■'^. Stadler attributes
this increase partly to intensification of the
mutation process in the genes and partly to
chromosomal aberration.
In his paper in 1930, Stadler [1930a] summa-
rizes the results of experiments with the genetic
effect of X rays on barley and corn. Both dry
and sprouting seeds were exposed to radiation.
The appearance of mutations in barley was
