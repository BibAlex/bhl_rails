Stubbe explains this by the fact that the action
of large doses shakes up the structure of the
genes to an extent which cannot occur under
normal conditions or with weak doses. As a
consequence, after strong doses, even genes
that are distinguished in general by great sta-
bility undergo mutation.
The majority of experiments in this area,
however, indicate that experimentally obtained
mutations do not in any way differ from spon-
taneous ones. If mutations appear after irradi-
ation that were not encountered previously, the
reason, in all probability, is that none of the
objects with spontaneously arising mutations
was sufficiently observed to uncover all the
possible mutations. In addition, we know that,
in every more or less thoroughly investigated
object, spontaneous mutations crop up from
time to time which had not been encountered
before in X-ray experiments.
The regularity of distribution of experiment-
ally obtained chromosomal aberrations con-
firms the assumption concerning the lack of
specificity in the effects of short-wave radia-
tion, which should have been expected on the
basis of the physical properties of the rays.
The following facts indicate that various
sectors of the wave spectrum do not produce
specific effects: 1) Stubbe's experiments which
were set up with an isolated segment of ultra-
violet rays; 2) the fact that as a consequence of
irradiation the same kinds of mutations arise
as are observed under natural conditions; ^
2 Recent findings indicate that the action of ultra-
violet rays does differ from the action of X rays.
3) the appearance of reverse mutations due to
the action of short waves.
The significant factor in the increase of mu-
tations is the amount of energy used (the num-
ber of r) and not the quality of the radiation
(voltage). The frequency of mutations rises in
direct proportion to the dose.
VARIABLE SENSITIVITY OF ORGANISMS
TO X RAYS
We pointed out in Chapter 1 that X rays have
a varying effect, not only on different species and
finer subdivisions of the classification system,
but also, frequently, on organisms of a single
species. Then we broached the question, in this
chapter we shall attempt to clarify it. The first
suggestion on this subject was expressed by
Bergonie and Tribandeau in 1906. They point
out in their article that according to the data of
all the physicians, irradiation, which induces
the death of neoplastic cells, leaves the immedi-
ately adjacent cells of the normal tissues, in-
cluding those of the tumor, uninjured. In addi-
tion, experiments with living tissues have indi-
cated that the rays have a selective action on
healthy tissues. These authors showed that X
rays destroyed the seminal cells of rat ova but
didnot affect the interstitial gland [cells?] .
Therefore, the authors assumed that it was pos-
sible to formulate the following law (which is
known as the Bergonie -Tribandeau Law): "X rays
act with greater intensity on those cells which
have a greater power of reproduction, on those
which have a longer karyokinetic future, on
those whose morphology and function are less
definitely fixed. " Hence, they have no difficulty
in understanding why irradiation destroys tum-
ors without affecting the healthy tissues.
