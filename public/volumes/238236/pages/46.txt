retarded development, growth proceeded quite
normally. From the irradiated seeds 8230 were
selected; 27. 42% turned out to be mutants. The
irradiated sprouts^ gave 29. 17% mutants.
As has already been pointed out, Stubbe
[1930b] was dealing with an extraordinary object,
since these snapdragons had for a great number
of years been under Baur's care. The latter
developed many pure strains of this plant and
studied many genes which determined its char-
acteristics and properties. Baur's long experi-
ments revealed, incidentally, that each strain
has its own coefficient of mutation. Strain "50, "
which Stubbe used for his experiments, had a
relatively low coefficient of mutation, only 1%.
By the use of high doses of X rays this coeffi-
cient was raised up to 300%.
In these same experiments Stubbe established
the dependence of the mutation frequency on the
size of the dose. The table presented below
proves this, since for all doses except 400 r the
number of mutations increases as the dose is
raised (Table 21).
In a subsequent article Stubbe [1932] solved
the problem of which developmental stage is
most sensitive to Xrays. With this aim in mind
he studied the X3 generation and discovered that
the majority of the gene mutations occurred in
those buds which at the time of irradiation had
finished reduction-division. From 80 mutations,
58 descended from such flower buds and only 22
from buds which were undergoing reduction -
division [at the time of irradiation] or had not
yet undergone it.
Already in his first experiments Stubbe dis-
covered that the frequency of mutations after
irradiation is not identical for both sexes of
snapdragons. This caused him eventually (in
1933) to set up experiments with irradiation of
mature male sex cells. He thought that if this
stage of male haplophase showed the same high
X-ray sensitivity as immature germ cells, it

would be of considerable advantage to the
experimenter. In the first place, a desired
uniformity in the stage of development for
irradiation would be obtained. In the second
place, there would be no need to worry about the
absorption of soft rays by somatic tissues. In
the third place, an exact count of the frequency
of gene mutations could be made.
The methodology of the experiments consisted
of the following: pollen from flowers that had
just bloomed was placed in a thin layer on
parchment paper and, immediately after irradi-
ation, was transferred to the stigmas of emas-
culated plants. For irradiation he used both
soft (30, 50, and 70 kv with filters) and hard
(125 and 175 kv with filters) rays. The results
of this experiment were amazing: in both parts
of the experiment completely unexpected, but
identical curves for the frequency of mutations
were obtained. The curves rose up to 400 r,
then fell to 1600 r, and after 3200 r rose again.
From this it seems clear that even such great
differences in voltage as 10 and 175 kilovolts
do not have any effect on mutation frequency,
that everything depends on the quantity of
roentgens. These curves are the result of two
completely independent biological processes.
On the one hand, they are an expression of the
relationship existing between doses of irradia-
tion and frequency of mutation; on the other
hand, they are due to the gradual injury and
killing off of the pollen grains by increasing
doses of X rays.
The explanation of the drop in the curve be-
tween 400 and 3200 r, according to Stubbe, lies
in the fact that the radiation affects areas of
different sensitivity within the nucleus of the
cell â€” some of which give mutations with low
doses (up to 400 r), while others produce muta-
tions only with doses of around 3200 r. This
explanation by the author is confirmed by the
fact that labile loci have been found in all of the
fully investigated objects ( Drosophila , corn,
etc). Consequently, it is no surprise that they
should vary more frequently than other areas
