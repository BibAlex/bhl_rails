place, the vacuoles diminish in size. This
phase is not reversible. In other cases the
protoplasm of the cell is broken down by auto-
matic processes, as a result of which all that
remains are a few fat globules.
In order to determine the changes in viscosity
of protoplasm under X irradiation, Breslavets
(1936) selected pollen grains as objects in which
these changes can be most easily observed by
means of centrifugation since the greater part of
these individual cells, at a certain stage in their
development, becomes filled with a large num-
ber of starch granules, which can be displaced
by centrifugation. In this respect the pollen
grains of hyacinth are particularly convenient,
since the transparent integument of the grains
permits microscopic observation of the entire
thickness of the protoplasm. Preliminary experi-
ments have shown that, depending on the time of
irradiation, a greater or lesser displacement
of the starch granules takes place. The follow-
ing method was used for the determination of the
viscosity of the protoplasm: the centrifuge tubes
were filled with 5 cubic centimeters of 10%
solution of cane sugar; into each of the four tubes
one anther from the same flower was placed,
and the centrifuge set in motion (2000 rpm).
After 5 minutes, an anther was removed from
one of the tubes and placed on a microscope
slide with a drop of iodine in potassium iodide,
and the centrifuge was set in motion once more.
After 15 minutes a second anther was removed
and placed on a cover glass, a third was re-
moved after 30 minutes, and a fourth after 60
minutes. Due to the action of the iodine the
starch granules became dark blue in color and
their displacement (which depended on the dura-
tion of centrifugation) within the pollen grain
could be easily observed. A 5 -minute action
[of the centrifuge] cleared 1/6 of the space from
starch granules; 15 minutes, 1/2; 30 minutes,
2/3; and 60 minutes, 3/4. Thus, the displace-
ment of starch granules is proportional to the
time of action of the centrifugal force. Prelimi-
nary experiments have shown that the viscosity
of protoplasm in young pollen grains is very
great. It is precisely these young pollen grains
which had to be used for the experiment, since
in them the starch granules reach their maxi-
mum size. For this reason, experiments to
study protoplasmic viscosity were begun with
large doses of X rays. The conditions of irra-
diation were as follows: 220 kilovolts, 5 mil-
liamperes, distance from the tube: 70 millime-
ters, no filters (Table 24).
These experiments indicate that the viscosity
of the protoplasm begins to increase only with
the action of 4000 r, and that it continues to
increase up to a dose of 48, 000 r, inclusive.
Apparently, the centrifugation method is too
coarse to distinguish finer differences in vis-
cosity of the protoplasm due to X irradiation.
It is interesting to note that pollen grains germi-
nated even after the action of such doses as
48,000 r. Microscopic examinations (Bresla-
vets, 1937) indicate that only doses of 16, 000 r
begin to change the structure of protoplasm,
making it more coarsely grained.
Erdmann (1936) investigated the relationship
between the loss of water contained in proto-
plasm and the action of X rays. The author
points out that yeast is an object in which it is
possible to measure the water content in living
cells, and that it is possible in yeast to measure
the effect of X rays by the depression of their
ability to multiply. The water content was
measured by: 1) hypertonic solution, 2) drying
in a desiccator, 3) natural aging of the yeast
cells.
It should be kept in mind that all plant cells
contain free water in addition to water bound in
the protoplasm. By removing this water with
hypertonic solutions it is possible to cause a
shrinking of protoplasm [due to loss of water].
