or diseased, while in plants receiving 250 r,
only 63. 7 out of 446. 5 seeds, 35. 5%, were
diseased. This indicates an increase not only
in quantity of yield, but also in quality. If we
add to this what we know about the increase of
weight of seeds, then the full significance of the
proper use of X rays to agriculture becomes
evident.
Turning our attention now to the total weight
of the seeds, we see that 250 r triples the
weight, that exposures of 500 and 750 r keep it
on the same level, and that only beginning with
1000 r does the weight begin to regress (with
4000 and 8000 r it is nearly half that of the con-
trols). Thus, a dose of 8000 r has a strongly
depressing effect on the number of ears and the
weight and number of seeds; in addition, it in-
creases the number of underdeveloped and
diseased seeds (Fig. 6).
Looking over the data for every individual
plant for each of the doses, we find great indi-
vidual variations. Thus, the number of ears
can vary from 2 to 24; the number of normal
seeds, from 17 to 930; the total weight for any
one plant, from 1. 06 to 36. 26 grams. This
great variability is characteristic not only of
rye, but of all other plants which are subjected
to the action of X rays, as can be seen from
the literature. If we turn to variability in num-
ber of ears, the first thing that strikes our
attention is the large number of secondary stems
on irradiated plants, which did not have time to
come to maturity. These secondary stems, in
turn, increase the number of underdeveloped
seeds and thus lower the total seed weight for
a single plant. ^ If we are unable to answer
definitively at this time the question of why
irradiated plants have so many secondary stems
that do not reach maturity, we can at least con-
jecture. Apparently, X rays, by stimulating
development in plants, open up possibilities
which in normal plants are latent. However,
these possibilities never reach full development
because something is missing from the environ-
ment, and this results in the incomplete devel-
opment of all stems and ears. What is missing
(nourishing elements in the soil, or light, or
heat, or all of these) we cannot tell at this time.
From our preliminary data it is quite obvious
that X rays act as stimulants to the development
of rye. If we compare all the curves by which
growth, development, and yield of irradiated
plants are reflected, we see that they coincide.
The initial height of the plants, diameter of
rootlets, number of stems, number and weight
of the seeds — all act in a similar manner under
irradiation. Radiations of 250 r send the curves
up steeply; 500 and 700 r continue this tendency,
but with doses of 1000 r the curves begin to
drop.
At this point it seems appropriate to point
out once more the necessity of carrying through
experiments with irradiation of seeds or sprouts
until the plants mature; otherwise, it is possi-
ble to obtain an incorrect impression of the
effect of X rays. If we had carried our experi-
ments only up to the point where plants were
beginning to bush out, we might have come to
