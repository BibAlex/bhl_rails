used on snapdragons by Noethling and Stubbe in
their experiments in 1936. All these experi-
ments indicate that rays with voltages from 8 to
500 kilovolts, i. e. , the entire range of the X-
ray spectrum, induce numerous mutations.
The results of experiments that attempted to
establish the threshold of action on the ultra-
violet end of the spectrum are less clear cut.
The negative results obtained in experiments
with snapdragons and Drosophila indicate that
ultraviolet rays can be effective only when they
are not absorbed by the surrounding tissues.
The results obtained by Noethling and Stubbe
indicate that pollen grains of snapdragons are
particularly suitable for studying the effect of
ultraviolet light (Table 34). ^
In their experiment, the authors divided the
spectrum into the smallest parts possible.
Pollen grains transmit a significant percentage
of both visible and ultraviolet light and it can be

stated with certainty that they also absorb a
definite amount of the rays. In comparing the
effects of unfiltered rays with monochromatic
ultraviolet rays it was discovered that the fre-
quency of mutations rises sharply when light
from the 280 to 285 millimicron line is used,
whereas irradiation of pollen by rays of the 366
millimicron line has no particular effect in
increasing the frequency of mutations. From
this we can conclude that the threshold of action
in the ultraviolet area, which induces mutation
in the pollen grains of snapdragons, lies in the
vicinity of the 313 millimicron line, although it
is not possible to establish any effect for the
265 millimicron line. In this fashion these
experiments on the pollen grains of snapdragons
established the thresholds for action of ultra-
violet rays in both directions; that is, for
longer as well as for shorter rays.
Stadler and Sprague (1936) showed that when
they irradiated the pollen grains of corn with
unfiltered ultraviolet rays the frequency of mu-
tations rose sharply.
At the same time we get an answer to the
first question posed by Stubbe (see above)
"concerning the threshold of wavelength at
