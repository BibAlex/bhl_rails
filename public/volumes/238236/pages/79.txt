the frequency of spontaneous mutations, but
also the action of short waves that induce muta-
tions. However, the mechanism of the action
upon which this fact is based is completely un-
known. Since up to now [Doring and] Stubbe
(1938) have investigated the absence of those
elements (nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulphur)
which enter the composition of the chromo-
somes, it is understandable that disruption in the
metabolic function of these elements leads to
irregularities in the structure of the substance
of the genes, i.e., to mutations. A calcium
deficiency does not increase the percentage of
mutations, but then calcium is not an essential
part of the substance of the gene.
Stadler (1929) adopts an extremely interesting
point of view in explaining the diversity of the
effects of X rays on various species and genera
of plants. He established that different species
of the same genus manifest differences in their
ability to undergo mutations. The irradiation
of seeds of Avena sativa, A. bysantina , A.
strigosa, Triticum monococcum, T. dicoccum ,
T. durum, and T. vulgare with identical doses
leads to different results. Whereas the species
A. brevis and A. strigosa show increases in
the percentage~bf mutations when subjected to
irradiation, A. bysantina and A. sativa do not
react at all in this respect. Similarly in T.
monococcum, the percentage of mutations is
very great and it falls gradually through dicoc-
cum and durum to vulgarum , which doesnT
exhibit any mutations (Table 38).
By comparing the data of this table we see
that the frequency of observable mutations de-
creases as the number of chromosomes in-
creases. By way of explanation Stadler offers
the following hypothesis. If we assume that in
A. bysantina and A. sativa the same gene is
present in each genome in a dominant condition,
then the formula for this genome will be
A ^ Ag A;
A J Ag A3
If a mutation occurs from A to a.
it will lead to a heterozygous condition
AAA
^ "^ "3 ' which in time will lead to a homo-
a 1 A2 A3
zygous condition

show any change since the four dominant allelo-
morphs will mask the two that have undergone
