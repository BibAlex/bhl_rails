a more accurate evaluation of the quality of the
obtained yield of peas, the irradiated and control
seeds were weighed on a torsion scale in batches
of 525.
In 1935 3 the irradiated pea seeds were planted
out on plots of the Timiryazev Academy with a
quadruple replication of the experiment. As an
index of X-ray effect, we selected the average
weight of seeds collected from a single plant.
These data are compared in Table 10.
From this table we can see that as far as the
increase of the weight of seeds is concerned the
dose of 350 r had a particularly beneficial effect.
From this we can deduce that for peas, just as
for rye, irradiation of the seeds before planting
leads to an increase in yield (Fig. 9).
Five years of experimentation with the effects
of radiation on plants permit us to express our
convictions concerning the significance of this
factor in the stimulation of growth, development,
and yield of plants. The negative results obtained
by many investigators are to be explained, in our
view, by insufficient work on the dosages, which
are specific for every species and variety of
plant. Let us take an example from our own ex-
perience. Despite three years of experience
with spring wheat, we are still unable to obtain
stimulating doses for it. We do not draw from
this the pessimistic conclusion that stimulating
doses are non-existent for wheat; we merely

consider that we have not discovered them as
yet. Nevertheless, our experiments with this
plant are rather interesting.
Wheat ( investigations of Afanas'eva) . For
our experiments we used a pure line of soft
wheat whose seeds were irradiated in air -dry
and soaked conditions, and finally, in the form
of sprouts. The air-dry seed was discovered to
be resistant to the action of X rays; it did not
react in any way on exposure to small and
medium doses of X rays, whereas exposures
to heavy doses produced a depressing effect on
the first phases of development of the plant.
In order to study the effects of X radiation on
soaked seeds they were planted in the laboratory
and in field plots. This last experiment was
performed with quadruple repetition, using hand
planting by row. The seeds planted under lab-
oratory conditions all came up at the same time
[regardless of dosage] as the controls. The
percentage of irradiated seeds which germinated
in no way differed from the controls. During
further development obvious depressing effects
were noted with a dose of 16, 000 r (just as in
the previous experiment). Under field condi-
tions it was possible to observe that as the
dosages increased, the viability of the plants
went down. The dose of 16, 000 r, which under
laboratory conditions produced identical germi-
nation as the other dosages and the controls,
under field conditions made a 50% lower show-
ing. This is explained by the loss of a certain
percentage of the developing plants during the
entire growing season of the plant. Not a single
