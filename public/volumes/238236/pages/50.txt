leaves, which completely changes the behavior
of hemp (Fig. 14).
As has already been pointed out in the survey
of the literature, sex can also be changed by the
action of X rays. The same is to be expected in
hemp, which happens to be labile in relation to
sex. However, before turning our attention to
sex changes, we should examine the differential
survival of plants on the basis of sex (Table 22).
The total number of plants which reached the
flowering stage was 82 in the control and it
remained the same for the 1000 r dose, but,
beginning with 2000 r, the number of surviving
plants begins to fall steadily, so that with the
highest dosages we have only 11 to 13 plants
surviving. If the effect of irradiation on male
and female plants is examined separately, it
will be noted that the slight initial predominance
of the female plants in the controls is supplanted
by a two -to -one predominance of female plants
over the male. This predominance of the female
plants leads one to believe that they are very
resistant to X rays. The first of the specific
changes of the male inflorescence are changes
in the bract and perianth. The imitation of
pistils is all the more complete in that their
ends acquire a reddish tinge. All the plants
(controls as well as irradiated plants) were
under identical germinating conditions, i.e. ,
during 11 days they were subjected to shortened
days and only after that period did they receive
