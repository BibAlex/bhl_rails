revealed during the growth of the self-fertilized
offspring of each ear.
Fifty -three X-ray mutations were found
among 2800 plants in the first series of experi-
ments. At the same time 1500 control plants
failed to show a single mutation. Sixty percent
of these mutants were true albinos, 5% were
white sprouts which gradually acquired green
coloration in the course of their development,
15% were yellow (of various intensities of color-
ing), 10% were greenish yellow, and the remain-
ing 10% had various kinds of multicolored leaves.
The majority of these mutations were lethal and
nearly all of them grew very poorly. Few mu-
tants which reach maturity remain stable.
When the mutants were crossed with the con-
trols, the changes were transmitted through
the pollen, appearing as recessives in Xg.
Stadler considers these mutations as changes
of the dominant gene to the corresponding
recessives in the somatic cells of the homo-
zygous plant.
As for the effect of X rays on corn [Stadler,
1931a], irradiation of the embryo produces
chimeras at various stages of its development.
In this paper Stadler once more raises the
question of the relationship between the fre-
quency of mutations and the intensity and wave
length of the X rays. The wave length was
obtained from unfiltered rays of 54 to 108 kilo-
volts. The doses were changed by varying the
length of exposure from 2 to 30 minutes, with
the other conditions of irradiation being held
constant (108 kv, 4 ma, 18 cm from the tube,
without filter). As the experiment shows
(Table 17), the frequency of mutations in-
creases proportionately to the dose.
