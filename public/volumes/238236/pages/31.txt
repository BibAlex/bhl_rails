With a dose of 750 r it increased by 30%, the
size gradually diminishing as the dosage in-
creased. Analysis of the yield indicates that
the number of ears increases nearly three times,
as do the number and weight of seeds per plant.
The advantages of irradiation are not limited to
an increase in yield of the directly irradiated
plant; they are also transmitted to the descend-
ants of the irradiated plant. Seeds collected
from irradiated plants gave an increased yield
the following year. With a dose of 750 r the
increase was 37. 99%.
Since pea seeds are known to be extremely
radiosensitive, the weakest possible doses of
X rays were used for their irradiation. In the
first experiment the number of pods per plant
doubled (in comparison with the controls) when
a dose of 450 r was used. In an experiment of
another year a dose of 350 r raised the weight
of seeds per plant from 3. 66 grams (weight of
the control) to 5. 07 grams.
Irradiation of the seeds and sprouts of spring
wheat produced neither stimulation of develop-
ment nor increase in yield. Only high doses of
X rays (8000 and 16, 000 r) clearly exerted a
depressing effect.
Summarizing our 5 years of experiments
with three [kinds of] plants, we can draw the
conclusion that exposure of rye and peas to
X rays before planting causes stimulation of
their development and increase in yield. For
wheat, we have so far been unsuccessful in
finding doses that produce either of these above
results.
Rye Grass (investigations of Breslavets) .
Several years had passed since the end of our
experiments concerning the effect of X rays on
agricultural crops, when the question of appli-
cation of these rays to meadow grasses came
up. One of these was the Vesterval'd rye
grass, picked out as the most rapidly growing
one. Doses of 200, 300, 400, 500, 750, 1000,
2000, 4000, and 8000 r were selected for these
plants as well as controls. They were planted
on February 24, 1942, in quadruplicate. First
the time of germination of seeds with the vari-
ous dosages was noted (Table 12).
These data show that doses of 300, 400, 500,
and 2000 r cause all seeds to germinate, while
in the controls only 76% germinated. We have
come across this type of phenomenon more than
once in our experiments with X rays on the
seeds of many other species of plants. These
facts should be noted since they show that
valuable seeding material can be saved by the
use of radiation.
By the end of March the plants had developed
to such a point that it was no longer possible to
leave them in boxes. They were removed from
the ground and the number of roots on each plant
for each dosage was counted. In addition, the
lengths of roots and stems, and the weight of
the stems were recorded (Table 13).
As can be seen from Table 13, a dose of
750 r nearly tripled the number of roots, in-
creased the length of stems by 19%, the length
of the roots by 25%, and the weight of the stems
by 76%. The above dose obviously stimulates
the growth of the plants, while a dose of 8000 r
which depresses plant development can be used
to create the impression of unevenness in the
soil due to the uneven development of the plants.
For the number of roots we can see the
typical biological curve of the Arndt-Schultze
Law: a gradual rise up to and including 750 r
and then a gradual falling off to the dose of
! 8000 r. The same may be observed for length
I of stems and roots, and weight of stems. From
