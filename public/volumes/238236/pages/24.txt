ordinary field conditions. These [control?]
ears sometimes exceeded normal size by one
and a half times (Fig. 4). But especially strik-
ing was the size of the grains which approached
that of Polish wheat. In order to compare the
weight of the initial [control] material with the
weight of seeds obtained from irradiated plants,
we determined their weight on torsion scales,
handling each seed separately. On the basis of
these facts, two variable curves were construc-
ted. By examining the left curve we can see that
in the initial [control] material weeds weighing
15. 5 milligrams were most common and that
they varied from 9. 5 to 33. 5 milligrams, while
in the right curve (weight of seeds obtained
from irradiated material) a weight of 3. 95 mil-
ligrams was predominant, a weight which does
not even occur in the initial [control] material
(Fig. 5). The weight of the experimental seeds
varies from 21. 5 to 51. 5 milligrams. A com-
parison of these two curves points up the large
size and uniformity of the irradiated grain,
which from the economic point of view gives it
a great advantage over the initial material.
An analysis of similar factors concerned
with the yield of non- irradiated and of the irra-
diated shoots shows that all curves based on
individual characteristics tend to shift to the
right [for the irradiated material].
From Table 6 we can see that the average
number of ears on a control plant is 4. 5, while
plants exposed to 250 r have on the average
nearly 12 ears. Then as the X-ray dosage is
increased, the number of ears tends to diminish;
however, it does not approach the control until
a dose of 2000 r is reached.
Only doses of 4000 and 8000 r which have to
be considered strong doses, cut the average
number of ears per plant to three, i. e. , they
give a number which is smaller than the con-
trol (Fig. 6).
If we analyze the column with the number of
seeds, we shall see a similar picture: the num-
ber of seeds triples with a dose of 250 r, then
it begins to go down gradually, and as for the
number of ears, the number falls below that of
the controls with doses of 4000 and 8000 r
(Fig. 7).
The diminution of the number of underdevel-
oped and diseased seeds in plants irradiated by
beneficial doses of rays, as compared with the
controls, should also be noted. In the controls
48 out of 135 seeds, 35.5%, were underdeveloped
