FIGURE 9. Comparison of the weights of pea seeds in controls
and in plants which received 250 r.
one of the X-ray dosages used exerted a stimu-
lating effect and only doses of 8000 and 16,000 r
exerted a depressing effect on the growth and
development of the plants. This depressing effect
lowered the yield by 30% for a dose of 8000 r,
and by 63% for a dose of 16,000 r.
For neither the dry nor the soaked seeds of
wheat were we able to find stimulating doses of
X rays. Since many authors pointed out that
sprouts were more sensitive than seeds, either
dry or wet, it became necessary for us to try out
the effect of radiation on sprouts. Seeds of wheat
were allowed to germinate on wet filter paper;
of the germinating seeds we picked out those
which had just begun to show the sprout. After
irradiation with doses of from 50 to 8000 r, the
seeds were planted under laboratory conditions in
three groups, 100 seeds per group. Shoots ap-
peared simultaneously in all dosages and in the
controls. Further observations of the develop-
ment of the plants and periodic measurements
showed that doses of 50, 100, and 200 r did not
affect the growth and development of the plants,
whose size remained equal to that of the controls.
With doses of 5000'* r it was possible to observe
a weak depressive effect. With doses of 1000,
2000, 8000, and especially 16,000 r it was possi-
ble to observe a strong depression of develop-
ment. Plants irradiated by other doses developed
identically with the controls. Phenological ob-
servations showed that plants which received a

dose of 1000 r began sending up secondary stalks
4 days later than the controls, and that they be-
gan to ripen 10 days later. By harvest time far
from all of the plants exposed to this dose had
ripened; the ears were small and many of the
seeds were underdeveloped. At harvest time the
height of the plants was measured, and the num-
ber of ears was counted for every plant for each
of the doses. Threshed grain was weighed sepa-
rately for each plant. The average data (height
of plants at harvest time, number of ears, and
weight of seeds are counted per single plant)
thus obtained are presented in Table 11.
An analysis of this table shows that the height
of the plants remained unchanged despite the
action of rather high X-ray dosages (only doses
of 8000 and 16,000 r decreased it significantly).
Similarly, only the strongest of all the doses
applied, i. e. , 16,000 r, reduced the number of
ears to 2 from 3 which was the number found
on the controls and on all the plants which had
received smaller doses. The weight of the grain
per single plant began to decrease with the ap-
plication of 4000 r and fell to nearly a third
when 16,000 r were used.
In comparing the action of radiation on dry,
soaked, and sprouted seeds of wheat it was es-
tablished that the latter are the most sensitive,
for doses of 1000 r had strong depressive effects
on them. Summarizing the investigations of the
effects of X rays on wheat seeds, we can see
that for this plant, in Afanas'eva's experiments,
stimulating dosages have not yet been found.
This does not mean, however, that we should
stop trying to find them. It is possible that
