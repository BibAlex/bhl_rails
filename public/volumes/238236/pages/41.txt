some were semi -lethal. The author observed
no giant or fast growing types, or any which
were of any particular value because of their
flowers or their fruits; in short, there were no
superior types possessing economic significance.
Asseeva and Blagovidova in 1935 used radia-
tion in order to obtain artificial mutations in
potatoes. Both soft (64 kv) and hard (180 kv)
rays were used. Mutations were found both in
the leaves and in the tubers. They noted an
interesting peculiarity in the effect of the radia-
tion on the tubers, specifically the importance
of variety [of potatoes] for the frequency of
mutations (Table 18).
Tuber mutations were found only in variety
"Vol'tman" (five instances in 10 bushes). From
their experiment they drew the following con-
clusions: 1) the number of mutations increases,
generally, in proportion to the number of r;
2) the effect of short and long exposures is equal;
3) soft and hard rays are equally effective;
4) irradiation at intervals or all at once does
not seem to have any perceptible effect on the
frequency of mutations.
Haskins and Moore in 1935 observed changes
of growth in citrus sprouts due to action of X
rays. Albinism often appears in citrus plants
especially in hybrid lines. After irradiation,
however, an abnormally high percentage evi-
denced a lack of chlorophyll. This condition
varies within wide limits, from those in which
all green pigment is absent, through variegated
leaves, to full albinism. Moreover, the authors
observed numerous instances of terminal and
lateral fasciation, twisting of stems, and dupli-
cation. For example, the last phenomenon was
revealed in the splitting of the central veins of
the leaves near the stem. In some cases, es-
pecially in grapefruit, the entire leaf would
become double. In lemons this development led
to the appearance of leaves with two or three
leaflets on the same plant. In two grapefruit
plants cup-shaped leaves were observed.
Kraevoi, in 1935, irradiated a pure line of
Pisum sativum vulgare with a dose of 1000 r and
found this dose to be semi -lethal. Among the
progeny there appeared plants which pheno-
typically were completely distinct from normal
ones. In another experiment, following the
action of doses of 250, 500, and 750 r, aberrant
karyotypes were found. They had unpaired
chromosomes, which had not undergone second-
ary division and which were abnormally thick.
A certain number of aberrants remained in X3,
too, and for that reason the author called this
type the delayed modification of the karyotype.
He observed that as the dosage is increased,
the percentage of aberrants increases (Table 19).
These plants differed in phenotype from the
plant from which they were derived.
In his third article, devoted to the question
of the effect of X rays on plants, Kraevoi [1936]
raises the question of whether it is possible to
obtain useful mutations by the experimental
method, and answers the question affirmatively.
He points to the works of Sapegin [1930, 1934],
McKay and Goodspeed [1930], Horlacher and
Killough [1931], and also to the unpublished
work of Guilleminot, who obtained two useful
mutations from a pure strain of barley:
