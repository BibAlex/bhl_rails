Doses of even 250 r have an inhibiting effect on
the development of rye; doses of 500 r produce
approximately the same effect. But when the
dose is increased to 750 r, some of the plants
develop poorly while the remainder die. A dose
of 1000 r has such a retarding effect on the
plants that they barely reach a height of 2 to 3
centimeters. With doses of 2000 r only a few
sprouts survived; with a dose of 4000 r only one
survived; while a dose of 8000 r was completely
lethal, not a single plant surviving.
However, we did not limit ourselves to a
single optical evaluation. On the 27th day after
irradiation, i. e. , just before setting the plants
out in the field, we carefully measured them,
both the controls and those which had received
various dosages of radiation. The results of
these measurements can be seen in Table 2.
A careful examination of this table will reveal
that a dose of 250 r is already sufficient to re-
tard the average height of the plants, but the
average bushiness is still somewhat higher than
in the controls. Besides, the differences be-
tween the effects of soft and hard rays begin to
show up here: the soft rays have a less drastic
effect on the plants. This difference also shows
up in other doses with the exception of the 750 r
dose, where the soft rays produce smaller size
and less bushiness than the hard rays. But, in
general, the difference between the effects of
soft and hard rays in our experiments was so
slight that in future presentation of data, we will
deal only with hard rays, since they were used
in the majority of experiments.
The phenological observations conducted by
us in the spring and summer of 1932 demon-
strated that the average irradiated plant headed,
flowered, and ripened at about the same time as
the controls. However, individual variations
for some plants were 3 to 4 days. These indi-
vidual differences are frequently encountered
among irradiated plants, as we shall see when
we turn our attention to the study of other
aspects.
We should note that only during flowering did
some of the irradiated plants attract attention
by their unusual development. Such plants could
be encountered only with dosages of up to 1000 r.
Starting with doses of 2000 r obviously degen-
erate forms with smaller ears began to show
up. When the rye was ripe, the plants were
collected individually, and the entire contents
were subjected to analysis. The number of
ears was counted, the total weight of seeds was
obtained, the total number of grains, and also
the number of healthy and injured seeds. These
results are presented in Table 3.
All these data refer to a single plant. In
analyzing this table it turns out that a dose of
250 r more than doubles the number of ears,
and the quantity and weight of seeds. A dose
of 500 r has a much weaker effect, although the
number of ears, and the weight and number of
seeds still show a significant gain over the
controls. A dose of 750 r depresses the devel-
opment of ears and seeds, while a dose of
1000 r has a still more depressing effect. Plants
that received doses of 2000 and 4000 r perished
early in the spring.
If we were to project curves on the basis of
these data, we would see first a sharp rise of
all quantitative factors and then their gradual
falling off. This points up our mistake in setting
up the experiment, since for irradiation of
sprouts we took too large an initial dose.
Apparently, we should have begun with
smaller doses, perhaps as small as 50 r. It
is possible that smaller doses also would have
produced increases in yield and we would have
obtained a more normal curve.
Our experiments with irradiation of rye
sprouts indicate how wrong it would have been
for us to limit our observations to the initial
stages of development (as the majority of authors
did with various plants) or take them only as far
as ear formation (as Long and Kersten did).
Comparing the two tables, we can see how the
