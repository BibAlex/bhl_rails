The sensitivity to radiation depends on the
amount of water held by the living protoplasm.
The criterion that indicates the loss of water
from protoplasm is the growth of the cell. The
ability to grow is connected with a definite de-
gree of turgidity of the protoplasm and it consti-
tutes a very sensitive indicator of turgidity loss.
The loss of water in Erdmann's experiments
was produced by potassium chloride, sodium
chloride, or urea. These experiments showed
that when protoplasm lost its turgor, the effect
of X rays was reduced by 25 to 30% by compari-
son with cells whose protoplasm was in the
normal state of turgor. If yeast cells from a
hypertonic solution were transferred to tap
water, irradiation produced the same effect
on yeast cells as when loss of water had not
taken place. Desiccation lowers the sensitivity
of the cells to radiation as when water is
removed by hypertonic solutions. The sensi-
tivity of older cultures of yeast is reduced by
35% in comparison with normal ones. Actually,
the aging of yeast cells is also accompanied by
loss of water which accounts for the reduction
of sensitivity.
Heilbrunn and Mazia [1936] forms a chapter
in Duggar's book. In this chapter, the authors
discuss the idea that even if there is no doubt
that irradiation affects the protoplasm and the
cells, we still cannot know whether this is the
effect of the direct [primary] action of radiation
on the organism because our knowledge in this
area is still very limited. Even where cells
are examined microscopically, the number of
experiments devoted to the study of the direct
[primary] effects of radiation on protoplasm is
insignificant. The authors consider that our
primary interest should be in primary action of
irradiation on living protoplasm and in the study
of this action by means of physico-chemical
methods, namely, 1) permeability to water and
dissolved substances, 2) viscosity, 3) electrical
charges and potentials, and 4) chemical reac-
tions.
Permeability, or rather, changes in perme-
ability due to the action of visible and ultraviolet
light and radium [radiation] were studied in both
animal and plant cells; while the investigation
of the effects of X rays was performed, chiefly,
on animals. Brummer^has shown that on human
skin2and on erythrocytes irradiation diminishes
permeability, whereas Hassel [Gassul]^and
Hoffmann^ indicate that permeability increases.
The data of Kroetz-*^ and Kov^cs^are equally
contradictory. Comparing the speed of chloride
diffusion through the normal frog skin and
through skin which had been exposed to 10 to

^Editorial comment: Brummer found that irradia-
tion increases permeability in human skin.
30 HED, the former demonstrated an increase
in permeability [of the irradiated skin] of almost
200%. Kov^cs, on the other hand, was unable
to establish any difference [of permeability] due
to X irradiation. Finally, Seckt (1902), while
observing changes in the stomata openings after
irradiation, established an increase in perme-
ability due to irradiation on a single plant
organism ( Tradescantia selloi).
Viscosity . An investigation of changes in
viscosity of the protoplasm due to the action of
radiation of different wave lengths, ranging
from the ultraviolet to X rays and radium
[radiation], showed Heilbrunn [and Mazia] that
the main mass of the protoplasm (Plasmosol)
first became liquid and then, as the dosage was
increased, more viscous. While the internal
protoplasm became more viscous, the external
layer became diluted to 1/4 of its original state.
Changes in cytoplasm, after irradiation are
similar in the tissues of various organisms,
although the difference in the degree of radio-
sensitivity of tissues, in general, is obvious.
Temporary stimulation of the physiological
processes is the first stage of the effects of
X rays. This is followed by gradual diminution
of activity and finally by complete inactivity.
A great many observations were performed on
protoplasmic movements (Lopriore [1897],
Nadson [and] Rokhlina [1926, 1934], Williams
[1923]) on motility of chondriosomes, fat glob-
ules, etc. , which indicate corresponding
changes in viscosity as well as the selective
permeability of protoplasm (Nadson [and Rokh-
lina, 1926 and 1934]). Protoplasmic strands
are drawn into the permanent cytoplasm and
accumulate around the nucleus or in some other
place; their cytoplasm gradually becomes turgid
as a result of formation of granular, small fat
globules, whose number and size gradually in-
crease, and finally, first small and then large
vacuoles appear (Nadson and Rokhlina [1926,
1934], Heilbrunn [and Mazia, 1936], et al).
When these changes become irreversible, death
occurs (Lopriore [1897], Nadson [and Rokhlina,
1926 and 1934]). The vacuoles may increase in
size or the protoplasm may disintegrate.
Irradiation induces changes that are similar
to Dauer modifications, which is particularly
clearly demonstrated in Drosophila . These are
cytoplasmic changes that in subsequent genera-
tions revert to the original state. Many of
these changes, for various characters, were
described by Stein (1922 to the present [1946*])
in irradiated snapdragons.
Certain investigators have also noted that
even where reversible changes were effected,
the reversibility was often partial and that
cytologically imperceptible changes may be
retained and [later] manifest themselves by
formation of new tissues and possess, in the
final analysis, cytogenetic significance.
