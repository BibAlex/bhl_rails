the conclusion from graphs of their development
that doses of 1000 r were most conducive toward
an increase in yield. But by the time the seeds
of the irradiated plants ripen, doses of 250,
500, and 750 r outstrip the 1000 r dose, which
by then is somewhat depressing; it is with this
dose that signs of decline begin to show. How-
ever, even this dose cannot be excluded from
determination of the effect of X rays on other
plants, for there are times, depending on the
problem we want to solve, when it becomes
important to obtain a greater initial develop-
ment.
The advantages of X irradiation are not lim-
ited to an increase in yield of the irradiated
plants; the advantages can be transmitted to the
offspring of the plants. These data were ob-
tained by us in the fall of 1932 as a result of
planting seeds which were obtained from plants
irradiated in 1931. For sowing material we
selected seeds of the plants which gave the
greatest yields. For controls we used offspring
of the control plants of 1932, from which we
similarly selected the best plants, hence the
best examples of the control plants of 1932.
During the growing season phenol ogical observa-
tions of the irradiated and control plants were
conducted, and no appreciable difference in the
length of the various phases of development was
observed. The ripened plants were subjected
to the same detailed analysis as in 1932, i. e. ,
the number of ears and the number and weight
of grains were determined. The data thus ob-
tained are compared in Table 7.
An examination of this table indicates an
obvious secondary action which shows up in
increased yields with certain doses of X rays.
Although we see that the 1933 yield is less than
that of 1932, nevertheless the increase is evi-
dent in the total weight of the seeds as well as
in their number. In order to facilitate a com-
parison between the effect of direct irradiation
and its secondary action, we have drawn up
Table 8, where the results are expressed in
percentages, taking the index of the control
plants as 100.
From the data of this table it is possible to
arrive at the very definite conclusion that a
dose of 750 r not only increases the weight of
seeds by 166% as a result of direct X radiation,
but that it retains an increase of nearly 30% in
the next year's yield, as a secondary action.
Doses of 250 r, which produce such sharp in-
creases (21%) over the controls during the year
of irradiation, here give strongly negative
indications. We shall return to this question
later (see Chapter 3). Doses of 1000 and 2000 r
reveal in their secondary action a gradual de-
crease in yield which takes place more slowly
than under the direct effect of X rays. The
secondary action is distinguished by the fact
that high doses (4000 and 8000 r) which depress
the development of the plant in the first year
(as a result of direct irradiation) give a positive
effect eventually. A probable explanation of
this phenomenon is that those plants upon which
the rays had the most depressing effect died.
Peas ( investigations of Breslavets and
Atabekova). 2 This plant was selected as an
object for investigation chiefly because it is
well known in the literature for its sensitivity
to X rays, and, in addition, is useful for genetic
research because it is self-pollinating.
Taking into account the sensitivity of peas
to X rays, we used lower doses than for rye,
i. e. , we began with 50 r. Pea seeds irradiated
under air-dry conditions were planted in vege-
tating pots on the day after irradiation. When
the irradiated and control plants formed pods,
they were photographed. 350 r should be
This work, started jointly, was transferred the
following year to Atabekova alone.
