author, on the basis of theoretical considera-
tions, refuses to acknowledge the action of this
physical factor on the development of plants,
then, upon getting positive results he ascribes
them to chance. That is what Seide did in his
experiments (1929)* with the ova of Ascaris
megalocephala . Observing in one experiment
an increase of 26% (as compared to the control)
in dividing irradiated ova, and failing to obtain
similar results upon repetition of the experi-
ment, he calmly proceeded to reject the first
experiment as "due to chance, " instead of
determining why the second experiment did not
succeed. Johnson [1931] acted in the same
way. Observing an increase in the green weight
of the plant after irradiating sunberry seedlings,
she assumed that it was due to chance and
deleted it from her count. On the other hand,
those investigators who are prejudiced in favor
of stimulation of X rays are even more guilty,
for they sometimes contrive their experiments
in such a manner as to include basic contra-
dictions.
Nevertheless, the great bulk of experiments
and observations of plants exposed to the action
of X rays constitutes a unique body of biological
data, interesting both in their theoretical and
their practical aspects.
Investigations Performed in the
Electrobiological Laboratory
We were guided by the above considerations
when we decided to answer, by a series of
systematic experiments on the effect of radiation
on various species of plants, including agricul-
turally significant ones, the question posed by
our predecessors concerning the existence of
stimulating X-ray doses. But we expanded the
question of stimulation to include the question of
yield, and thus we not only brought the plants up
to the fruit -bearing stage of their development
but analyzed the yield as well.
The experiments were first conducted in a
laboratory for the biontization of seeds which in
1935 became part of the All -Union Institute for
Fertilizers, Soil Science, and Agricultural
Engineering, and later of the All -Union Institute
for Electrification of Agriculture. When the
activities of the latter were terminated, the
laboratory was transferred to the Timiryazev
Agricultural Academy.
Our experiments began in 1931, and our first
subject was rye. This was a good choice for,
as we shall see later, rye proved to be very
sensitive to X rays.
Rye . In order to discover the principles
governing the process, we systematically in-
creased the dosage for each succeeding experi-
ment in the following order: 250, 500, 750,
1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 r. Not content with
varying the X rays quantitatively, we also tried
qualitative variations in our experiments, i. e. ,
we used hard and soft rays. Seeds soaked for 12
hours as well as sprouted ones were irradiated.
We shall present the findings of these experi-
ments separately.
Rye sprouts (investigations of Breslavets ,
Afanas'eva, and Medvedeva) . For irradiation
we used for the most part freshly sprouted
seeds of rye, but since we did not select the
sprouts for irradiation with sufficient care,
some of them attained 1/2 centimeter in size.
We believe that this difference in size is largely
responsible for the highly uneven manner in
which the irradiated sprouts came up. Immedi-
ately after irradiation the sprouts were planted
in flower pots, several per pot. The plants
grew there for 27 days, after which they were
planted, one at a time, in a heavily fertilized
plot of ground. While the plants were still in
the pots, before transplanting, they were photo-
graphed. In this photograph, differences in
their development (depending on the dosages
they had received) were clearly apparent.
