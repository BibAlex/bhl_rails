Introduction.
The development of submarine detectors in this country started
shortly after the United States entered the war. In April, 191 /,
the Submarine Signal Company, General Electric Company, and the
Western Electric Company combined for the study of submarine
detector apparatus and started a station at Nahant, Massachusetts.
A foreign commission from France and Great Britain visited the
United States in June, 1917, and laid before those most interested
all the knowledge of submarine detection at that time in the hands
of the French and the British. As a result of this visit, the United
States Naval Experimental Station was started at New London,
Connecticut, under the control of the United States Navy, and sev-
eral physicists and engineers from different parts of the country
were called together to carry on the research and development work
at this station under the direction of the Special Board on Anti-
submarine Devices.
In the following paper no attempt has been made to give credit
to individuals, but the developments brought about at the Naval Ex-
perimental Station and at the Nahant Station have been carefully
stated in the hopes that proper credit may be given to each group of
experimenters and in order that the excellent results accomplished
by the United States Navy in this comparatively new field may be
made known to the public.
General Methods.
The presence of a body beyond our reach can be detected by in-
tercepting some form of energy radiating from the body or through
