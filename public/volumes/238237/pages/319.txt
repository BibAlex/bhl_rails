444 STEVENSON— INTERRELATIONS OF FOSSIL FUELS.
ite ; evidently the old surface was irregular and the overlap is nota-
ble, for only the highest part of the Schlaner beds is present.
The Pilsen Basin, not more than 30 miles south from Rakonitz
and at extreme western extremity of the larger area has a total
extent of not far from 150 square miles; the succession is practically
the same as in the basin at the north, but the strata have endured
much greater disturbance. Dips on the border reach 55°, though
in the interior they sometimes become insignificant. The lower or
Radnitz group shows 3 coal seams, known locally as the Fiirstenflotz,
Oberflotz and Unterflotz, the second and third being equivalent to the
Hauptflotz and Grundflotz of the Kladno-Rakonitz region, while the
highest seam is the same with that at Lubna near Rakonitz.
The variations in interval-thicknesses within this petty area are
as remarkable as those proved by actual mining within the Anthra-
cite fields on Pennsylvania. Dannenberg gives these measurements
for opposite sides of the basin, separated by not more than 10 or
12 miles :
Eastern Side. Western Side.
1. Upper coal group.
2. Interval 200
3. Fiirstenflotz 0.32 to worthless 0.5 to 1.15
4. Interval 15 to 132 17
5. Oberflotz i.i to 2.1 i.o to 2.0
6. Interval 45 to 70 18
7. Unterflotz 1.8 to 4.4 0.5 to i.o
The surface of the underlying rock is uneven, so that the Unter-
flotz is often wanting. The important seam is the Hauptflotz, which
is usually i to 2 meters thick, but toward the north, occasionally
swells to 3 or even 5 meters. The highest or Fiirstenflotz is avail-
able midways in the basin, where it is known as the Niirschan can-
nel. Katzer*" placed this in his " Middle Zone " and believed it to
be lower Permian. He has given a detailed section of the bed as
seen at Niirschan: (i) cubical black coal, 0.30; (2) black clay, 0.03
to 0.30; (3) cubical black coal, 0.30; (4) cannel, rich in Stigmaria,
a few ferns, some bones; (5) Brandschiefer, thinly laminated, re-
mains of ferns, some saurians and fishes, 0.25 ; (6) Platterkohle, in
thick slabs, the chief source of saurian remains, with streaks of clay,
