electrical engineering. It has not yet been determined definitely
that the law as proposed by Peek is the correct one. The results of
R. D. Mershon, one of the earliest observers and workers in this
field, on an experimental line at Niagara Falls, are distinctly at
variance with the results of Peek, as are those of Jakobsen on an
operating transmission line in Peru. On the other hand, the ob-
servations of Faccioli in Colorado, and Harding on an experimental

line at Purdue University, give results in good agreement with
Peek's formula. The difficulty appears to be that the formula does
not give correct values for voltages only slightly in excess of the
initial corona forming value, the explanation being that surface
irregularities and atmospheric deposits of various descriptions on
the surface of the wire result in partial corona formation at values
below those which would obtain for a perfectly round clean wire.
As the voltage is pushed above the corona forming value, these
initial losses become relatively small and the rising curve showing
the relation between loss and voltage gradually merges into the true
curve for a smooth wire. The law as announced by Peek is based
on the upper region of this curve. (See Fig. 2.)
