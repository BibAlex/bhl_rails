278 ORTMANN— CORRELATION OF SHAPE AND
are connected by intergrades, and any line drawn between them must
necessarily be artificial and arbitrary. It is advisable, however, to
retain the old names in a varietal sense, for the extremes are rather
strikingly different.
Group of Fusconaia pilaris in the Upper Tennessee-
drainage.
Fiisconaia pilaris (Lea) is the representative of F. subrotunda
in the upper Tennessee system, and it is extremely hard to distin-
guish the two. All I can say is that pilaris is a smaller shell than
subrotunda, a character mentioned also by Simpson. For the rest,
there is no difference, and it is actually impossible to tell younger
subrotunda from pilaris, as is shown by the fact that pilaris re-
peatedly has been reported from the Ohio River. In the Tennessee
River in northern Alabama, typical subrotunda is found, and I have
specimens from this region. But since I have no material from this
river between these parts and the vicinity of Knoxville, Tenn., I
cannot discuss the relation of these two forms. They may pass
into each other.
The pilaris-gvoup of the upper Tennessee contains a number of
nominal species which have been distinguished on entirely insuffi-
cient grounds. I have revised them^^ in the following way.
I. Fusconaia pilaris (Lea). — D. 55 per cent, or over.
U)iio pilaris Lea, '40 (French Broad and Holston). — Quadrula
pilaris Simpson, '14, p. 893.
Dia. (Lea) : 63 per cent. Simpson gives two measurements,
47 and 54 per cent., which, however, belong to the next form, which
he unites with this.
Unio globatus Lea, '71 (Holston). — Quadrula globata Simpson, '14,
p. 899.
Dia. (Lea) : 68 per cent. ; (Simpson) : 67 per cent.
Quadrula andrctvscc Marsh, '02 (Holston). — Quadrula andrcwsi
Simpson, '14, p. 895.
Dia. (Simpson) : 55 per cent.
