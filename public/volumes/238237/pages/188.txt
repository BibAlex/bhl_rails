WHITEHEAD— HIGH VOLTAGE CORONA IN AIR.
249
No explanation has been offered for the foregoing law, nor does
an obvious explanatioin suggest itself. It is not difficult, however,
to see that the loss should increase sharply above the critical voltage.
Corona first begins when the maximum of the alternating voltage
reaches a definite value, which, in the case of a smooth round wire,
is very sharply marked. Above this value corona starts on each
half wave at this same definite value, whatever the maximum value
of the voltage wave may be, and on the descending half wave
corona ceases at about the same value or very little below it.
Corona is thus periodic and with increasing voltage occupies a
larger and larger area at the top of successive half waves of alter-
nating voltage. (See Fig. 3.) In the neighborhood of the critical

corona forming value, when corona is limited to a short interval at
the crest of the wave, the loss will evidently be proportional to the
frequency since the number of breakdowns per second increase with
the frequency. However, with increasing voltage the aggregate
time during which the corona actually exists becomes more and
more nearly equal for all frequencies. As to the influence of
voltage, with increasing voltage the volume of corona increases,
and since this means increased ionization and conductivity of the
