Sound from receivers i, 2, and 3 can be brought into phase at A
by rotating the groove to a proper position with respect to the fixed
openings i, 2, and 3. At the same time the three receivers of each of
the other three groups will be brought into phase at the points B, C,
and D respectively.

Plate XIII. Principle of Type-H compensator.
Sound from points A and B are conveyed through two fixed
grooves of equal length in the lower plate to another compensating
groove in the movable plate, the sound from B passing around the
end marked X and that from A passing the end marked Y. Both
sounds unite in a single path at E. The sounds from C and D are
similarly united in a single path at F.
