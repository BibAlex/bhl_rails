MUNROE-HOWELLâ€” PRODUCTS OF DETONATION OF TNT. 223
A careful examination of the pressure reading on the water
manometer, analysis of the second sample of gas, and the analysis
and amount of gases retained in the solid products shows that the
amount of gas retained by the solid products is not sufficient to have
any important effect on the observed pressure reading or analysis
of the gases.
Our thanks are due to Messrs. W. L. Parker, L. B. Berger and
W. H. Miller for the analyses of the gaseous products ; to L. G.
Marsh, Assistant Explosives Chemist, for the analyses of TNT, to
Mr. A. B. Coates and his associates of the Explosives Experiment
Station, and especially to Mr. J. E. Crawshaw, Explosives Testing
Engineer, who, during the enforced absence of one of us owing to
sickness, has taken entire charge of the operations.
