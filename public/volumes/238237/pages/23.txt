HAYESâ€” DETECTION OF SUBMARINES.
The minimum number of receivers is three. All of the listening de-
vices developed at the Nahant Station except the C-Tube, make use
of three receivers located at the vertices of an equilateral or isosceles
triangle. Such a device is often called a " 3-Spot." Devices of this
character developed at the Naval Experimental Station employ four
detectors located at the four corners of a square. Such devices are
commonly named " 4-Spots." The " 4-Spot " can still be operated

if any one receiver becomes damaged but the " 3-Spot " becomes use-
less under such conditions.
An instrument called a compensator has been developed by which
the path difference between the two receivers and the ears can be
varied. Compensators are made in various forms for dififerent spe-
cial purposes. Plate IV. shows the principle of one of the simplest
forms. It consists of an upper brass casting with grooves as shown
by the full lines. This casting seats on a lower brass plate upon
which it can be rotated about a central pivot (0). The lower plate
