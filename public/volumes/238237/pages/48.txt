Introduction.
As the name " Kansan " is given to the drift in Pennsylvania,
south of the moraine of Lewis & Wright, along the Allegheny River,
and as it extends across the Delaware River from New Jersey, the
intermediate drift in Pennsylvania south of the same will be so
called, though it differs almost entirely in petrographic character-
istics ; as drift everywhere tends to conform to the outcrops on which
it lies, and onfiy in moraine or overwash accumulations is there a
general and indiscriminate mixture.
It is proposed to-night to examine the character and the origin of
the high-level gravels along Allegheny River, concerning which there
is a difference of opinion. Other gravels will be used as illustrative
material.
Professor G. F. Wright expressed the opinion in 1894^ that some
of the Allegheny gravels' were remnants of a complete valley filling,
since excavated; but he abandoned this theory later. In 1902 F.
Leverett" expressed Wright's former opinion. Beginning in the
Lehigh Valley, in 1892, E. H. Williams, Jr.,-"* found that the sculp-
turing of the Kansan outwashes antedated the deposition of the
universal capping of iceberg silty clay. This is also the case in the
Susquehanna and Allegheny valleys and is applicable to all foreset-
bedded glacial outwashes deposited in deep pondings.
Pondings are of two kinds : those against a watershed, with grad-
ually rising surface until a discharge over a col occurs and, if trench-
ing occurs, with gradually diminishing depth : those against per-
sistent or ephemeral ice-dams, with the depth varying with height
of the dam. The former class is characterized by a permanence
