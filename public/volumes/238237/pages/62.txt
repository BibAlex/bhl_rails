PENNSYLVANIA AND DEPOSITS THEREIN.

Fig. 7 shows the top of the Upper Indian Hollozv Sands, hori-
zontally bedded, and underlying the Clarendon Gravels. Such a
deposition of coarse gravel with interbedded quicksand on sands
could not have been made in an area of scour. This association, like
the thinning out of the lozver sands, just noted, indicates that the
quiet area of Indian Hollow was crossed by a current of less than
8 inches per second ; while at the surface of the ponding, 200 feet
above, passed a current of over 30 inches per second, carrying the
gravel.
Fig. 8 show'S more of the southw^est face of the working in the
gravel bar. The sand stratum shows that the dip was the same as
the average of the beds of the lozver sands, and foreset in the direc-
tion of Barnes. The view of the houses of Warren, across the
Conewango, in the left foreground, indicates the nearness of the bar
to the valley trough, and that it is 200 feet, or more, above it.

The southern face of the working in this bar is shown in the
frontispiece and in Fig. 9. The oil-well rig in the former is the same
shown on the extreme left of the latter, and in Fig. 5. This well,
and the others in the Hollow, have given a comprehensive idea of
