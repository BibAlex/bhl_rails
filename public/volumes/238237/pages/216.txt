STATION IN FRESH-WATER MUSSELS. 305
prevail at the upper stations. The metropolis of caperatus is clearly
in Clinch and Powell Rivers, toward the headwaters. It should be
noticed that this species does not go very far up in the rivers, and
that it is by no means a small-creek-form.
Group of Obovaria subrotunda in the Upper Ohio-drainage.
The synonymy of these forms is as follows (see Ortmann, 'i8,
p. 567, 568, but the name lens has been restored for Icvigata).
1. Obovaria subrotunda (Rafinesque). — Dia. 60 per cent, or
over.
Ohliquaria subrotunda Rafinesque, '20 (Ohio). — Obovaria subro-
tunda Vanatta, '15, p. 552.
Dia. (Vanatta) : 72 per cent.
Unio circulus Lea, '29 (Ohio R., Cincinnati; Monongahela R., Pitts-
burgh). — Obovaria circ. Simpson, '14. p. 291.
Dia. (Lea) : 73 per cent.; (Simpson) : 58, 67, 72 per cent, (the
first given by Simpson falls under the variety !).
2. Obovaria subrotunda lens (Lea). — Dia. less than 60 per cent.
Unio lens Lea, '31 (Ohio and Tennessee). — Obovaria lens Simp-
son, '14, p. 293.
Dia. (Lea) : 48 per cent.; (Simpson) : 52 per cent.
The material from the upper Ohio system shows that these two
forms intergrade completely, as I have pointed out already in 1909,
and subrotunda is the large-river-form, while lens is found toward
the headwaters.
