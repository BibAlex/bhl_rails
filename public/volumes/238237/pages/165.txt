THE REEFS OF TUTUILA, SAMOA, IN THEIR RELATION
TO CORAL REEF THEORIES.

The Island of Tutuila, American Samoa, is purely volcanic, no
elevated limestones having been observed upon it. As has been
shown by Daly the exposed volcanic rock is in most places weath-
ered to its ulttimate degree, but this does not apply to the region of
the southwestern shore between Tafuna and Sail Rock, where a
lava flow occurred in times so recent that its surface still shows a
ropy structure, while sharp-edged cracks and numerous lava cav-
erns remain open quite as they were at the time of their formation.
The Island is strongly cliffed by the sea, some of these clififs as
at Round Bluff being fully 300 feet high. After forming these
clififs the sea level sank so as to expose a platform of hard volcanic
rock which projects from 50 to 250 feet seaward from the foot of
the basaltic promontories. The recent lava flow between Tafuna
and Sail Rock overwhelmed this platform but elsewhere practically
every promontory of the Island shows this old emerged shore-shelf,
and remnants of it appear in numerous places lying ofif shore within
the bays, such as in Afonu, Vatia, Fagasa, Leone and Pago Pago
harbors, and especially along the south coast between Breaker Point
and Fagaitua Bay. It is also found around the ofif-lying island of
Aunuu southeast of Tutuila.
The bays of Tutuila are in regions of fragmentary material and
are flanked by ridges of harder rock. Thus the emerged shore
platform has resisted ero&ion where it is composed of basalt as at
the spur ends, but has largely disappeared within the harbors where
the rocks are generally soft.
A similarly elevated shore-shelf of volcanic rock is found around
the islands of the Manua Group, Ofu, Oloosega and Tau, and also
at Rose Atoll where it is of hard dolomitized limestone bearing
