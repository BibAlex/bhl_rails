204 MUNROE-HOWELL— PRODUCTS OF DETONATION OF TNT.
Calculations
A computation of the total amount of nitrogen in the gases com-
pared with the total nitrogen in the explosive, detonator, and residual
air in the gage, serves as a check on the accuracy of the observations
involved. This computation is based on the following data :
Analysis of gases,
Weight of charge,
Barometer,
Absolute pressure in gage.
Temperature in gage before shot,
Temperature in gage after shot.
Pressure of permanent gases.
The following complete calculation of test -p ^^- is given as
an example of the method of calculation :
Analysis of Gases.
Per Cent.
CO, I.I
O O
CO 60.2
H 21.0
CH, 1.9
N 15.8
Weight of charge 300 grams
Barometer reading 732 mm.
Absolute pressure in gage 50 mm.
Temperature of gages before shot,
(is liter gage) 25° C.
(20 liter gage) 25° C.
Temperature of gages after shot,
( 15 liter gage) 27° C.
(20 liter gage) 25° C.
Nitrogen in Explosive.
300 X -1814 = 54.420, in which 300 = weight in grams of ex-
plosive, 18.14 = per cent. N in TNT, as determined by the Explo-
sives Chemical Laboratory by the Orndorfif Method.
