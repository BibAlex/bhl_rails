THE HIGH VOLTAGE CORONA IN AIR.
By J. B. WHITEHEAD, Ph.D.
(Read April 24, igso.)
Atmospheric air is an extremely good electric insulator. It has
low specific inductive capacity, very low conductivity, and a rela-
tively high electric strength, or ability to withstand breakdown or
spark-over between high voltage terminals. The name " corona "
has been given to the continuous partial breakdown of air sub-
jected to electric strain, and it always appears as a glow or brush
discharge confined to one or both high voltage terminals with a
region of unbroken air in between.
When voltage is applied to a pair of parallel plates in air and
slowly raised, the air withstands the strain up to a definite value of
voltage and then breaks down completely with a heavy sparkover
or arc between the plates. (See Fig. i.) In this case the electric
field intensity or the number of volts per centimeter is uniform
throughout the region between the plates, being equal to the voltage
applied divided by the distance between them. The electric in-
tensity at which breakdown occurs in the air at normal atmospheric
pressure is about 32 kilovolts per centimeter. If needle points are
used, or a hollow cylinder and a wire on its axis, instead of the
parallel plates, a quite different behavior of the air appears. On
raising the voltage the air breaks down in the form of a brush or
glow discharge immediately around the needle points and at the
surface of the central wire, but the breakdown is limited to a small
distance and there is no sparkover or complete rupture until a
much higher value of voltage is reached.
The interest in the cases of the points and the central rod and
cylinder lies in the fact that the electric field or voltage gradient is
not uniform over the distance between terminals, being highest at
