286 ORTMANN— CORRELATION OF SHAPE AND
intervenes from which no shells are at hand, and that above Offutt
the Powell flows into the Clinch, the latter thus suddenly decreasing
in size.
Material from the Powell is scanty, but it fits into the scheme.
It is thus clear that also the ciincolus-group is subject to the law.
It also holds good, as far as my material goes, in the Tennessee and
its tributaries in northern Alabama, where this type of shells also
seems to be abundant.
Group of Fusconaia eugariana in the Upper Tennessee-system.
I distinguish the following two forms, but use the specific name
of cdgariana (see F. cor, Ortmann, 'i8, pp. 532, 533).
1. Fusconaia edgariana (Lea). — Dia. 50 per cent, or over.
Unio edgarianiis Lea, '40 (Holston R., Tenn. ; Tennessee R., Flor-
ence, Ala.).- — Pleurohema edgariannm Simpson, '14, p. 741.
Dia. (Lea) : 64 per cent. ; (Simpson) : 58, 69, 76 per cent.
Unio ohuncus Lea, '71 (Tuscumbia, Ala.; Holston R., Tenn.). —
Synonym to cdgarianum, according to Simpson.
Dia. (Lea) : 53 per cent.
Unio andersonensis Lea. '72 (Holston R. ; Clinch R., Anderson Co.,
Tenn.). — Synonym to cdgarianum, according to Simpson.
Dia. (Lea) : 76 per cent.
2. Fusconaia edgariana analoga (Ortmann). — Dia. less than
50 per cent.
Fusconaia cor analoga Ortmann, '18, p. 533 (Chnch R., Speers
Ferry).
