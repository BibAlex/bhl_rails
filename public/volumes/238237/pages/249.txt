KENNELLY-NABESHIMA— ESTABLISHING A
alternation of impressed e.m.f., there is an accidental transient
ripple, due to a slip in the contact mechanism of the line-switching
apparatus at A. This momentary disturbance is clearly duplicated
simultaneously at Aig in the sending current. After an interval of
about 2 milliseconds, a similar ripple transient appears at Ae,-, in
the voltage at B. All of these transients are absorbed in s^, at B,
and do not reappear. Such wave transients may be called casual
transients, to distinguish them from initiating transients which occur
at the starting of an a.-c. regime, or from terminating transients
which occur at the opening of an a.-c. circuit.
Regular Transients with Apparent Distortion. — In the case repre-
sented by Fig. 9, the e.m.f. and current waves, launched without
appreciable splash, develop regular transients that build into the
final steady state, without noticeable distortion. The successive
alternations increase in size without departing noticeably from their
sinusoidal shape. This is for the reason that the successive reflec-
tions, so long as they are of appreciable magnitude, happen to make
their appearance, at each end of the line, at or near the moments
when the voltage and current are passing through zero. This must
always happen, according to theory, when the length of the freed
line is a quarter wave for the impressed frequency. If, however,
the line has a length distinctly different from a quarter wave, or

each of the successive reflections will come in during the active part
of an alternation. In particular cases, they may happen to arrive
