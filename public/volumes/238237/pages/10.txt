OUTUNE.
1. Introduction :
Research and development work carried out by two groups of scien-
tists, one group backed by private companies, the other by the U. S.
Navy.
2. Two general methods for detecting the presence of a body:
a. Through energj^ radiated from the body.
b. The presence of a field of force surrounding the body.
3. Both methods applicable to case of moving submarine.
4. First method most effective (radiated energy being sound), second method
weak, due to limited range (field of force being magnetic).
5. Sound (physical characteristics).
6. Resonance and pressure tj-pe submarine receivers.
7. Tj'pes of submarine receivers :
a. Acoustic.
b. Microphonic.
c. Magnetophone.
d. Electrostatic Condenser.
8. Requirements for a perfect submarine detector.
9. Methods for determining direction :
a. Maximum-minimum principle.
b. Binaural principle.
10. Types of submarine detectors developed by:
a. England — Mark I, Mark II, Mark I and Mark II, Nash Fish and
Rj'an Fish.
b. France — Perrin Shielded Microphones and Walser Plate,
c. United States —
I. Submarine Signal Company,
(i) Tuned Microphone.
(2) Oscillator.
II. General Electric Company,
(i) C-Tube.
(2) Three-Spot Devices :
