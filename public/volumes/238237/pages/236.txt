THE TRANSIENT PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING A
STEADILY ALTERNATING CURRENT ON A LONG
LINE, FROM LABORATORY MEASURE-
MENTS ON AN ARTIFICIAL LINE.

(Read April 22, ig2o.)
The purpose of this paper is to make a contribution to the theory,
records and measurement technique of transient electromagnetic
wave propagation over long uniform conductors, with particular
reference to the upbuilding of the alternating-current steady state
over long alternating-current power-transmission lines, from meas-
urements made on artificial power-transmission lines in the
laboratory.
As is shown in the appended bibliography, the subject has been
already developed to a considerable extent from the theoretical side.
Very little, however, seems to have been published on the practical
side. The research here described has been mainly directed to the
practical side of the subject, from the laboratory viewpoint. It was
taken up in October, 191 7, in thesis work towards a master's degree.^
It was later continued from May, 1919, to the present date, as a
research in the electrical Research Division at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
Classification of Transients. â€” For the purposes of discussion
and analysis, it is desirable to establish certain provisional defini-
tions relating to transient electromagnetic phenomena, in order to
avoid ambiguity.
A transient may be defined as a temporary and evanescent dis-
turbance in an electric circuit, or in the indications of apparatus
connected therewith, due to any arbitrary sudden change imposed
