Summary.
The experimental work in connection with hydrophone develop-
ment, which the United States Navy has carried out during the past
year, has demonstrated that the MV type of hydrophone can effec-
tively aid and safeguard navigation in the following ways :
1. By hearing and locating a moving propeller-driven vessel at
ranges varying from 2 to 10 miles, depending upon the amount
of noise which the vessel makes and providing the depth is
within 100 fathoms.
2. By accurately determining the direction of submarine sound sig-
nals, located at fixed points along the coast and at harbor en-
trances, at various ranges up to 30 miles, depending upon the
amount of local or water noises encountered.
3. By giving a continuous sounding record while underway at any
speed for depths less than about three times the length of the
vessel.
4. By hearing, locating, and giving the course of any vessel equipped
with a suitable submarine sound signal at ranges up to 30
miles.
5. By affording a means of exchanging code messages between ves-
sels equipped with the proper apparatus up to ranges of 20
miles in water of any depth, thus giving an auxiliary to the
radio.
The results of the various tests that have thus far been carried
out indicate that this type of hydrophone will prove capable of
further aiding and safeguarding navigation in the following ways :
