CERTAIN ASPECTS OF RECENT SPECTROSCOPIC OB-
SERVATIONS OF THE GASEOUS NEBULA WHICH
APPEAR TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THEM AND THE STARS.

The Lick Observatory has carried on during recent years a
number of researches on the nebulae. About two years ago these
had taken a form sufficiently substantial to serve as the basis of a
publication, and a number of memoirs entitled Studies of the Nebulce
were prepared at that time. Owing to industrial conditions de-
veloped by the war the printing of these papers was greatly delayed,
and they have only now been issued as Volume XIII. of the Pub-
lications of the Lick Observatory. As one of the contributors to
that work I have been asked to present some account of the in-
vestigation with which I am particularly concerned. It may be
said that my own observtions are spectroscopic, and are confined
to the gaseous nebulae.
In attempting to give a comprehensive account of a survey in a
relatively new field one is likely to be embarrassed by the hetero-
geneity of the material that presents itself for description. Astro-
physics is essentially such a new field, and it is sometimes difficult
to wander very far from what we consider, perhaps too confidently,
the well-worked border without being overwhelmed with a diversity
of new, and totally unexpected facts, which frequently serve to
control the path of progress. Whatever was the original purpose
of the quest, it is likely to have become modified by factors of its
own development in such a way that the accumulated information
bears apparently on a number of problems, and offers a complete
solution of none of them. At any rate that has, in a sense, been the
course of the present investigation. It had its beginnings in an at-
