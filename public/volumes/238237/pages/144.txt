MUNROE-HOWELLâ€” PRODUCTS OF DETONATION OF TNT. 199
Following this procedure when the charging density in the bomb
was about 0.2 the products of two trials gave respectively the fol-
lowing results on analysis :

Per Cent. Per Cent.
Carbon monoxide 59-01 60.60
Carbon dioxide 1.93 1-66
Methane 1.97 i-90
Hydrogen 20.50 20.80
Nitrogen 16.05 16.08

In a further experiment in which the trinitrotoluene was ex-
ploded in a lead cylinder enclosed in the bomb Poppenberg and
Stephan obtained

Hydrocarbons 1.08
Hydrogen 7-6i

In discussing their results Poppenberg and Stephan referring to
an opinion advanced by Kast from a study of theoretical equations
of decomposition of trinitrotoluene say : " Kast calls particular at-
tention to the fact that no water is formed when trinitrotoluol is
detonated ; our experience does not correspond to this assertion.
We could prove regularly the presence of water in quantities of 1.5
to 1.8 per cent, in the explosion products. According to Kast's
equation, 23.4 percent, of hydrogen was to be found in the ex-
plosion products, but the analysis shows only 21 per cent. This
fact indicates further that when trinitrotoluol is detonated water
must be formed."
Relative to the " hydrocarbons " reported these authors say :
The large carbon and hydrogen concentration governs the formation of
hydrocarbons, which probably come from previously formed acetylene (com-
pare Pring and gas composition of the explosion products of ammonal). The
quantity, 1.08 per cent., is not significant and will not have any real effect on
the explosion constants. Whether or not their formation affects the maxi-
mum pressure, that is, whether they are formed at the moment of explosion
