The " S'Spot" detector operates on the principle of binaural
compensation and was developed soon after this principle was estab-
lished at the Naval Experimental Station. An improved type of
microphonic submarine receiver called a " rat " was developed which
proved highly sensitive, non-resonant, and durable. The construc-
tion is shown in Plate VIII. h. The microphone is carried by a rubber
diaphragm which encloses a water-tight space housing the micro-

phone. The leads to the microphone pass through a water-tight
stitffing-box at the end of the cylindrical shaped chamber opposite to
the diaphragm. Three of these receivers are fixed in position at the
vertices of an equilateral triangle four feet on a side. One lead
from each microphone attaches to a common lead into which a bat-
tery is connected in series. The other three leads, one from each re-
ceiver, pass through small inductance coils and thence to the com-
mon. A special type of telephone receiver connected in series with
a condenser is shunted across the inductance. This wiring scheme
is shown in Fig. i, Plate IX. Figs. 2 and 3 show other schemes used
for connecting in the telephone which are employed in devices de-
veloped at the Naval Experimental Station.
The two telephone receivers are attached respectively to the two
inlets to the compensator so that the sound is required to pass
through the compensator and the stethoscope leads before reaching
the ears.
A neatly designed switch arrangement makes it possible to con-
