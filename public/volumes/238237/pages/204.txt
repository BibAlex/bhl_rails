STATION IN FRESH-WATER MUSSELS. 289
It hardly needs to be pointed out that, beginning in the large
rivers, tumesccns passes gradually into barnesiana, and farther up,
into bigbyensis. This is one of the best and most convincing series.
In Clinch River, conditions are similar, but the only specimen
from the lowermost station (Solway) makes an exception, but a
rather striking one. We may however, very well disregard it, and
take it simply for an abnormal case. With the next station above it
(Edgemoor), the normal condition is seen to begin.

No comment is necessary, except that it should be noted that, in
this species, the intermediate form (barnesiana) turns up, occa-
sionally, way up in the headwaters. This, of course, is due to the
fact that the limits drawn between the three forms are very narrow.
In some of the tributaries of the upper Tennessee, tumescens.
according to my material, passes only into barnesiana, without the
most compressed form of bigbyensis being well represented. This
is seen, for instance, in Little Pigeon River at Sevierville, a tribu-
tary to the French Broad. The latter, at Boyd Creek possesses
tumescens with the average diameter of 50 per cent., with an ad-
