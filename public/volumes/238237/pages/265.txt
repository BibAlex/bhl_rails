found in practice that the average listener can determine the path
difference in water to within about one half inch.

Fig. 6.
Referring to Fig. 6, it will be seen that this error due to the per-
sonal element may introduce a relatively large error in the determi-
nation of 9 and hence the same error in the sounding angle $ which
is the supplement of 6.
For simplicity assume the hydrophone to consist of two single
receivers {A) and {B), Fig. 6, one connecting with each ear and
separated a fixed distance (C). Sound approaching from the direc-
tion represented by vector {V) makes an angle 6 with the line joining
the two receivers. The operator determines this angle by measuring
the distance {d) to within one half inch. Calling this error 8 we
have the following relation
= cos"^
"c ■
The accuracy with which this equation determines 6 is propor-
tional to (C), the distance between the two receivers, and varies
with the value of {d). Since the value of the cosine changes slowly
with change of angle as the value of the angle approaches zero, it
is evident that the value of 8 will produce an abnormally large error
in the determination of 6 when the direction of the sound approaches
parallelism with the line connecting the receivers. It is to be noticed
that in determining the sounding angle $ this condition is approached
when the vessel enters shallow water.
