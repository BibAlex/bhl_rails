in phase for sound coming from any particular direction by properly
adjusting the compensator. Also a similar adjustment of each
compensator in the other three groups will bring the response from
the three receivers of each group in phase at their respective junc-
tions B, C, and D.
For convenience the four junctions A, B, C, and D may be re-
garded as four separate receivers located at points 2, 5, 8, and 11
respectively. The responses from A and B can be brought together

in phase at E by means of another "■2-Spot" compensator and sim-
ilarly the responses from C, and D can be brought in phase at F.
Points E and F may, for convenience, be regarded as two sepa-
rate receivers located at a point midway between 3 and 4 and be-
tween 9 and 10 respectively. These two receivers connect with the
ears through another compensator and the stethoscope leads L and
R, and by properly adjusting the compensator the sound can be bi-
naurally centered and the direction of the sound source determined
with an ambiguity as to port or starboard. This ambiguity is readily
