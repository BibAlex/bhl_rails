514 JOHNSONâ€” GEOGRAPHIC ASPECTS
with less than a hundred Italians ; and for all of Istria, and the
shores of the Gulf of Fiume to and including the port, as well as
islands which would close the gulf and make it an Italian lake. In
the long negotiations looking toward a reduction of these claims,
Italy's persistent demand for explicit or virtual control of the port
of Fiume proved the most serious stumbling block.
The peculiar strategic value of Fiume from both the economic
and military point of view is at once apparent. A glance at the
map will show that the Dinaric Alps, a broad belt of wild and
rugged mountainous country, intervenes between the interior of the
Balkan peninsula and the Adriatic Sea. South of Fiume this range
is crossed by but two or three narrow-gauge railroads, wholly in-
adequate to serve the commercial needs of the interior. The only
standard gauge road crosses the mountain barrier at its narrowest
point, opposite Fiume. The geographic conditions are such as
permanently to preclude any cheap and effective rail transport across
the broad part of the barrier ; hence Fiume, advantageously situated
opposite the narrowest part, and at the head of a sea that makes
water transportation both cheap and easy, is the inevitable economic
outlet for the northern part of Jugoslavia. Practically the whole
standard gauge railroad system of Jugoslavia is in the latitude of
Fiume, because the fertile river plains of the country are almost
entirely confined to that region ; because nearly two-thirds of the
population lives in these plains and valleys ; because railroad con-
struction is easy and comparatively inexpensive there ; and because
there is sufficient local traffic to maintain the roads and keep rates
down. Thus it will be seen that the life of the Jugoslav nation is
to an unusual degree concentrated in the north of the country ; and
as the railroad system upon which this economic life depends has its
only direct outlet to the sea at Fiume, it may well be said that the
power that holds Fiume holds the life of an entire nation in its
hands.
Not only do Austria and Hungary, and to a considerable degree
Czechoslovakia and the newly enlarged Rumania look to Fiume
as an important economic outlet, but all the outside world desiring
to trade with central and southeastern Europe via the Mediterranean
