general results, and to support them by tables of measurements.
The material of this species is rather rich, and I shall not give the
measurements of all of it, but shall restrict myself to selected
examples which show the law clearly.
I have distinguished here three forms.
1. FuscoNAiA BARNESiANA (Lea). — Dia. 40-49 per cent.
2. FuscoNAiA BARNESIANA BiGBYENSis (Lea). — Dia. less than
40 per cent.
3. FuscoNAiA BARNESIANA TUMESCENS (Lea). — Dia. 30 per
cent, or over.
I first give the material from three large rivers in the vicinity
of Knoxville.
