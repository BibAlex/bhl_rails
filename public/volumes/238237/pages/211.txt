298 ORTMANNâ€” CORRELATION OF SHAPE AND
I have also a very interesting series from the Beaver drainage.
Just below the mouth of Beaver River, in the Ohio at Industry, pure
catillus is present with the average diameter of 57 per cent.

The elevation of the diameter at Clarksville is due to the pres-
ence of a number of quite young specimens. We have learned,
under the group of Fusconaia subrotunda, that the diameter of
young shells is comparatively greater. Older individuals at this
locality are all pure cocc'meiim.
Even in a small creek like the NesJiannock, the law becomes
visible.

Similar conditions prevail in the Monongahela drainage. At
Charleroi, the form catillus is rather pure. From farther up I have
only scanty material, but at the mouth of Cheat River, at Cheat
Haven, catillus is present (diameter about 50 per cent, or slightly
more). From the West Fork River I have only specimens of
typical coccinewm, all with the diameter below 50 per cent.
