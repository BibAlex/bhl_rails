HAYES— U. S. NAVY MV TYPE OF HYDROPHONE. 387
In practice the compensator is provided with a separate scale
which is caHbrated to give soundings in fathoms. To determine the
depth of water the Hstener adjusts the compensator until the pro-
peller sounds or submarine signal sounds ofif his own vessel are bi-
naurally centered and then reads off the value directly from the

sounding scale. This operation takes but a few seconds, so that a
continuous sounding record can be taken when desired and, as is
shown, the record becomes more accurate as the water becomes
shallower.
Sounding in Deep Water.
The angle of reflection method only gives reliable soundings for
depths less than three times the length of the vessel, but if the vessel
is equipped with both an MV hydrophone and a proper submarine
signal, an intermittent sounding record can be taken in water of any
depth. Such soundings are determined by measuring the time re-
quired for a sound signal to travel to the bottom and reflect back
again to the surface or, in other words, by measuring the time which
elapses between the sounding of a signal and the response of its echo
on the hydrophone.
