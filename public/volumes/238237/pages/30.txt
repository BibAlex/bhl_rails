HAYESâ€” DETECTION OF SUBMARINES. 25
curacy, is simple and rapid in operation, and is capable of giving
long range if there are no disturbing noises present.
The chief difficulty in submarine detection by sound lies in the
fact that under normal operating conditions the detecting apparatus
is mounted in the midst of numerous sound sources such as pro-
peller and machinery noises on the listening boat, breaking of waves
and slapping of waves on the boat, noises from promiscuous ship-
ping, etc. The range at which a submarine can be detected is largely
dependent on the ratio of the intensity of the sound from the sub-
marine as compared with that from other sources. Increasing the
sensitiveness of the receivers beyond a certain limit is of no advan-
tage since the disturbing noises are magnified in the same proportion
as are the sounds from the submarine.
Under such circumstances it becomes necessary to devise an
instrument that will magnify the sound coming from a definite
direction without correspondingly magnifying sounds from other
directions.
This result can be accomplished by using sound lenses or mirrors,
an example of which is the " Walser Plate," but because of the length
of sound waves in water their area must be so great, if they are to
give a marked advantage that their use is practically prohibited. As
soon as the principle of compensation was recognized it became evi-
dent that instead of a single receiver connecting with each ear it
would be advantageous to have several receivers spaced some dis-
tance apart, provided a compensator could be devised that would
not only make it possible to binaurally center the composite sound
reaching each ear from its respective group of receivers but at the
same time would compensate the separate air paths to the individual
receivers so that the sound response from all would arrive at the lis-
tener's ears in phase. By properly adjusting such a compensator the
response from the several receivers to sound from any particular
direction could be brought to the listener's ears in phase and since
under these conditions the intensity of the sound will be equal to the
sum of the intensities from the several receivers the sound reception
from this particular direction will be magnified.
It is evident that for this same setting of the compensator the
response from the several receivers to sound from any other direc-
