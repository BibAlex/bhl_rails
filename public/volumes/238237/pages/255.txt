ported by other cases, so far as they have been examined ; namely,
that at the impressed frequency of 60'~', nearly sinusoidal, if the
voltage is impressed without splash at an instant of zero e.m.f.,
the artificial line behaves substantially like its conjugate smooth line,
the greatest discrepancy being in the current-wave transient at the
sending end. Consequently, any similar artificial line of. a like
degree of lumpiness, should be available, in the laboratory, for the
study of initiating and casual a.-c. wave transients.
