and the direction of the sound. This relation between the path dif-
ference and the direction of the sound is readily seen to be:
d=o.2T, a sin 6,
where d represents the path difference in air, a the distance between
the two receivers, and 9 the angle the sound makes with the line
joining the two receivers.
Since this definite relation exists between path difference and

the direction of the sound, a device for varying the air paths can be
introduced and calibrated directly in terms of angle.
Two weaknesses in this method for determining direction are
apparent. First, if the angle approaches zero or i8o degrees a large
