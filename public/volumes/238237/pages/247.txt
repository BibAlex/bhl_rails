KENNELLY-NABESHIMA— ESTABLISHING A
Fig. 9 (Film No. 40) shows the regular transient case for thir-
teen half cycles on the full-length artificial line, as defined in Table

11., at the frequency of 60.6 -—', with the distant end free (through
the oscillograph at 5), and with the line switch closed at or very
near to an instant of zero e.m.f. The electrical connections are
those of Fig. 3.
The three curves on Film No. 40, Fig. 9, are Cg, is and e,-, repre-
senting respectively the sending-end e.m.f., the sending-end current
and the receiving-end voltage. The sending-end voltage (76.y volts
r.m.s.) is seen to be substantially uniform throughout the seven
cycles. It may be observed, however, that during the first two or
three alterations, the maxima of impressed e.m.f. are slightly
higher than those at later stages. This may have been an effect of
throwing on the load. The same efifect could also be detected on a
voltmeter, when throwing the line on and ofif. In the computations
to be subsequently described, these deviations from uniformity in
Cs were taken into account. In the analysis of the oscillographic
record, the measured values are all referred, for convenience, to
those which, by simple proportion, would be obtained with 100 volts
impressed e.m.f.
The is curve starts, without appreciable splash, practically in
phase with the e.m.f. Near the end of the first alternation, it is
reinforced by a current wave reflection from the distant free end.
These reflections keep coming in, approximately in step with the
outgoing alternations, so that the final sending-end current is nearly
