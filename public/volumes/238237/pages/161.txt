220 MUNROE-HOWELL— PRODUCTS OF DETONATION OF TNT.
posit would absorb a sufficiently large quantity of gases to influence
the observed pressure reading for total quantity of gas produced, or
absorb a selected gas in sufficiently large quantity to afifect the com-
position of the gases.
On account of the rough and pitted condition of the interior of
the Bichel gage, it was impossible to obtain an exact determination
of the amount of this deposit. But several determinations were
made to secure this as accurately as possible, and it was found that
with 200 grams of M — 2354, 11 grams of solids were obtained,
while from 400 grams, 15 grams were obtained, corresponding to
5.5 and 3.75 per cent, respectively. Two determinations made with
200 grams of M — 2630 gave 16 and 18.5 grams or 8.0 and 9.25 per
cent, respectively.
While an insufficient number of tests have been carried out to
warrant any definite conclusions, it would appear that the amount
of deposit decreases with the increase in charge and is increased by
the density of the cartridge, as in sample M — 2630 which was com-
pressed to 1.50.
The exact composition of this deposit has not been determined
as yet, for this deposit is contaminated by the iron from the support,
copper and sulphur from the electric detonator, and tin from the
wrapper holding the TNT, and no method so far tried has served
to separate them. An analysis of the contaminated deposits has
given the following result :

As the carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen are the elements in the
deposit arising from the TNT, this analysis is recalculated eliminat-
ing the contaminating substances, and is as follows :
