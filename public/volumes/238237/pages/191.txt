WHITEHEAD— HIGH VOLTAGE CORONA IN AIR.
is ionized and therefore becomes conducting, resulting in a sharp
deflection of the galvanometer Gg. Fig. 5 is a series of curves show-
ing how sharply the galvanometer deflection occurs as related to
corona voltage.
The corona has an audible sound even in the open. When the
corona wire is enclosed, as in the corona voltmeter, this sound is
gathered and intensified.' At atmospheric pressure the ear placed
at a small opening in the case C will detect the very first appear-
ance of corona, which will be very sharply marked. In order that
the sound may be utilized, when the pressure is of value other than
that of the atmosphere, a telephone transmitter is included inside

corona and the indications of telephone and galvanometer are
exactly contemporaneous, as indicated in Fig. 5.
