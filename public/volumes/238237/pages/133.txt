SLAV AND CELT.

It has been long recognized that language is not a final test
of race; that is, of race in the anthropological sense. It must be
remembered, however, that in current usage the word " race ^ ib
not employed to indicate the primitive long-heads, short-heads and
round-heads of strict anthropology, about which many modern
educated people know and care next to nothing, but rather to denote
what should be properly defined as " tribal groups," which subse-
quently developed into " nationalities," and then into political
" nations." Such primitive tribal " races " were originally nothing
more than groups of families fortuitously speaking the same lan-
guage or kindred dialects, who were forced together for purposes
of mutual protection, or for the purpose of conquest over weaker
and richer peoples. Such a tribal nucleus w-as the beginning of
every modern nation-group. It is, therefore, quite obvious that a
" pure " race, that is, a race originating from and maintaining a
single strain can not be in existence at the present time. In order
to determine national trend development, the student of group char-
acteristics must, therefore, refer to environment and the common
interests bred by common speech, rather than to skull-shape or
other bodily peculiarities which often vary in individuals of one
and the same family.
Mutual comprehensibility and the possession of a common
hereditary trend are the two most important features of such in-
fluential environment. The peoples now termed " Slavs " and
" Celts " must consequently be classified each within their own group
from the point of view of their respective speech-groups (= influ-
ence-groups), and may be studied still more closely by a comparison
of the traditions which have given rise to their mental and spiritual
characteristics.
