276 ORTMANNâ€” CORRELATION OF SHAPE AND
Pennsylvania. This is formed by two main branches, Shenango
and Mahoning, which unite below Newcastle, at Mahoningtown. I
shall begin with the only locality in the Beaver proper, then go up
the Shenango to the mouth of Pymatuning Creek, and finally go up
the Mahoning.

In the Ohio, just below the mouth of the Beaver (at Industry),
the diameter is 47 per cent. Thus the Beaver-shells are clearly less
swollen. While all these specimens are rather uniform in diameter,
it is seen that the lowest average is farthest upstream. Specimens
with over 50 per cent, are found frequently only at the lowermost
stations (Wampum and Manoningtown), and specimens with lowest
diameter (below 40 per cent.) are most frequent farther up. The
very high average at Clarksville (45 per cent.) is due to an unusual
number of young specimens, which, as we have seen, tend to elevate
the average ; and the low average at Harbor Bridge is due to the
fact that mostly large specimens are among them, which depress the
figures.
It should be mentioned that the type-locality for kirtlandiana is
in the " Mahoning River, Ohio," that is to say, farther up than any
of my localities, and that the diameter as given by Lea's illustra-
tion is 44 per cent.
Thus nearly all of the shells from the Beaver drainage fall
under kirtlandiana.
Finally, I have shells belonging here from the Monongahela
drainage. At present, the Monongahela in Pennsylvania and parts
