are intended to represent only in the most general way the two
classes or hypotheses which form part of the very speculative sub-
ject of stellar evolution, and are introduced to show at a glance the
especial interest which attaches to the relationship of the nobulae to
one or the other of the stellar groups. It may be said with regard
to the respective merits of the two hypotheses that the first has in
its favor a pretty straightforward sequence of spectral similarities,
with spectral evidence in the earlier groups of high temperature and
intense electrical excitement, which fades through the spectra in the
order indicated, while the second appears to receive support from

considerations of a general nature which indicate an exceptonally
low density for some of the red stars.
It will be observed that both of these hypotheses assume the
nebulas as antecedent to the stars.
In searching for a nebular origin there are four general classes
of objects among which it is necessary to distinguish: the spiral
nebulae, the extended amorphous nebulae with continuous spectra,
the extended gaseous nebulae, and the small gaseous, or planetary
nebulae. With respect to the spirals, it is doubtful whether they
belong to our stellar system, and in any event they are bodies of
such stupendous size and mass that they can not be regarded as
single stars in the process of formation. We know little of the
