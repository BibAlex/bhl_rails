the depth (D) being taken from the chart. It is to be noticed that
for ranges ahead the compensator reading, 6, occurs in the equation
while for ranges astern the " sounding angle," (j>, is used.

METHOD OF SOUNDING /\ND RANGE FINDING BY M-V HYDROPHONE
Fig. 4.
If the depth is not too great, {D) can be determined by the hydro-
phone as outlined above and the range formulas become
R, = L
R., = L

where (R) is the range to be determined, (L) the distance between
the sound-source and hydrophone on the listening vessel, and 6^, 6.-,,
and $ are the angles which the reflected sound from the three vessels
make with the surface as shown.
It is evident that the range to which these formulae will give rea-
sonably accurate determinations is proportional to the depth of water
in which the vessels are operating.
The equation connecting {D), the depth, and $, the angle which
the reflected sound makes with the surface, becomes somewhat com-
