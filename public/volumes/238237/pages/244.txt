STEADILY ALTERNATING CURRENT ON A LONG LINE. 335
of phase shift corresponds to 24Â° of LK mechanical-arc adjustment.
This adjustment is also illustrated in Fig. 5, where the pointer P

Stands over the stationary scale K, and determines the position of
the brushes B^B^ around the sectored insulating disk D. One elec-
trical degree of a 60'-' alternator corresponds to /4i6oo of a second,
