HAYES— U. S. NAVY MV TYPE OF HYDROPHONE. 383
The sounding equation, D = C ,-{- L tan ^, on the other hand,
would seem to predict that the depth of water (D) is determined
with greater accuracy as the water becomes more shallow, since the
value of the tangent varies less rapidly with variation of the angle as
the angle approaches zero. This does not hold true, however, for
the reason that the error in the determination of $ becomes abnor-
mally large as the value of this angle approaches zero and it results
from these considerations that depths of from 2 to 5 fathoms are
not determined with as great accuracy as depths from 10 to 20
fathoms if hydrophones of the type described are used. This type
is shown in the left-hand diagram of Fig. 7, where the line of the
receivers is horizontal and parallel with the ship's keel.

This weakness arises whenever the same hydrophone receivers
are used for determining both the bearing of vessels or shore signals
and also for taking soundings. It is readily removed if a separate
set of receivers is installed for sounding purposes only. These re-
ceivers are mounted in a vertical plane parallel to the keel and along
a line making an angle of about 30° with the surface, the forward
end of the line of the receivers being lower as is shown in the right-
Ijand diagram of Fig. 7. With such an arrangement of receivers
the sounding angle $ will be given by subtracting 30° plus the angle
given by the compensator from 180°, and the compensator will only
be required to determine angles between 60° and 150°. In this way
the most accurate part of the compensator scale is utilized for deter-
