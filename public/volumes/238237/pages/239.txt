rent will be splashless ; i.e., they will be sinusoidal and in cophase
from the very start. In such a case, because there can be no
reflection from the distant end, the initial outgoing current will be
the same, both as to magnitude and phase, as the final outgoing

current ; or there will be no transient wave. In this particular and
simple case, if 2q is the reactanceless surge impedance of the line, in
ohms, E^ the maximum cyclic e.m.f. in vector volts at standard
phase, the initial and final outgoing current will be

If the frequency of the impressed e.m.f. is / cycles per second, and
the corresponding angular velocity w = 27r/ radians per second, then,
at time t seconds after the switch closure, the instantaneous voltage

Because of the simple conditions assumed in this case, including
infinite line length, the current defined by (3) is instantly de-
veloped without the intervention of any transient. If the line has
"finite length, but is grounded at B through an impedance equal to
the surge impedance Zq, it will give rise to no reflections from B, and
will behave, in this respect, like a line of infinite length. Such a
case is represented in Fig. 12 (film 35).
