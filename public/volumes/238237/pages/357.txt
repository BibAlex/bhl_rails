GEOGRAPHIC ASPECTS OF THE ADRIATIC PROBLEM.
By DOUGLAS JOHNSON.

No question before the Peace Conference presented greater diffi-
culties than that of Italy's eastern frontier. The Adriatic problem
is essentially a geographic problem. It subdivides itself into a
question of naval geography and a question of land frontiers.
The mountainous, ragged eastern coast of the Adiratic with its
numerous harbors, is in strong contrast with the low; simple western
coast where harbors are few in number and inferior in quality.
Any naval power on the eastern coast must find itself possessing
immense advantages over Italy. A fleet taking refuge in one of
the Italian harbors is visible from far out to sea because of the
flatness of the coast, whereas vessels secreted along the eastern
shore are invisible behind mountain barriers. From the low western
coast observation of an approaching squadron is limited as com-
pared with the better observation enjoyed by those on the dominat-
ing heights of the eastern shores. Coast defense artillery has little
choice of inferior positions on the Italian side, and unlimited choice
of excellent positions on the eastern coast. A fleet emerging from
one of the western harbors to give battle may be taken unawares
before it can develop its battle formation ; while a fleet manoeuvering
behind the protective fringe of islands along the east coast may
emerge from a number of passages simultaneously and assume a
predetermined formation without delay. The Italian submarines,
scouting along the eastern shores, find the bottom rough and deep,
so that lying in wait for an enemy is a danegrous procedure; while
the Austrian submarine finds shallow water and a smooth bottom
upon which to lie concealed, pending the passage of an intended
victim. The clear waters along the eastern coast reveal hidden
mines or submarines to the scouting hydroplane, while the murkier
