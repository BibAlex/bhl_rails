states that this coal seam was covered by ocean water soon after
deposition, so that at some localities it has been replaced with dolo-
mite. This dolomite encloses the vegetable pulp of the swamp, little
changed.
The mass of deposits decreases toward the east. Andenne from
340 to 170 meters; Chatelet, from 400 to 288; Charleroi is 1,270 in
Couchant de Mons but only 970 in the Liege district. Four coal
seams at most are in the Andenne ; the same number in the Chatelet,
but they are unimportant except in the Liege district ; Charleroi is
rich throughout, having 19 workable seams in Couchant de Mons
with 10.70 m. qf coal, 20 in Charleroi, with 16.85 ^-^ 23 in Liege
with 17.45 m. of coal. Flenu in Couchant de Mons has 45 seams
with 27.20 m. ; besides these, each more than 30 centimeters thick,
there are many veinettes, which rarely become thick enough for local
operation.
Intervals between coal seams vary almost capriciously. Smey-
sters^^ notes many instances in the eastern part of Hainaut basin;
one may mention here only that between the Mere-de-Veines and
the Crevecoeur. This interval is usually 10 or 12 meters, but at
one locality, it is reduced to 60 cm., yet within a short distance the
normal interval was observed. The coal seams are equally variable
and some of them, as mentioned by Stainier, resemble a string of
huge beads. Several seams are persistent enough to be utilized as
horizons, but great variability characterizes all.
Many years ago, Cornet''^ grouped the Belgian coals into (i)
houille maigre a longue flamme ou houille flenu; (2) houille maigre
a longue flamme ou demi-grasse; (3) houille grasse marechale ou
houille grasse ; (4) houille seche a courte flamme ou houille maigre.
( I ) is brilliant, with conchoidal fracture, ignites readily, yields much
illuminating gas, but the coke is not well fused; (2) has shaly frac-
ture, often has fusain, yields excellent but not strong coke ; (3) gives
a coke good for all purposes ; while (4) burns slowly and the coke is
