horizon being the Barro Branco. Southwardly, the coal measures
pass under cover not far south from Minas and come again to the
surface near Sao Jeronymo in Rio Grande do Sul, where the Tre-
viso is represented by shale, the Irapua by shale and coal, but the
Barro Branco or Sao Jeronymo is important. At Serro Partido
near Rio Candiota, where Plant obtained his section, the section as
measured by White is, thicknesses being given in meters, (i) shale,
sandstone and concealed, 19.28; (2) coaly shale, 0.91 ; (3) shale with
plants, 2.29; (4) coal and shale, 0.305; (5) clay, 1.52; (6) shales,
dark and yellow, plants in latter, 1.04; (7) Sao Jeronymo. Coal,
4.78, consisting of (a) slaty coal, with Sigillar'm in roof, 1.22, (&)
blue clay, 0.51, (c) carbonaceous shale, some coal, 1.22, {d) impure
coal, 1.83; (8) clay and shale, 6.59; (9) interval in shaft, reported,
12.19; (10) Irapua Coal, 0.20 to 0.36. It is evident that the earher
observer mistook dark shale for coal.
The one persistent coal horizon is the Barro Branco-Sao Je-
ronymo, but it varies greatly. It is usually triple in the Minas
region, though more divided at times, the thickness varies from 0.93
to 2.20 meters, and the coal is described as " good " to *' fairly good "
and " slaty." In Rio Grande do Sul, it has, at one place, 2.68 thick-
ness with a parting of clay, only 10 centimeters, but at other places
this parting is from 3 to 5.30 meters. The other seams are traceable
in the two southern states, but for the most part they are thin. The
roof at most places is a leaf-bearing shale and the floor is clay or
clay shale. One can hardly recognize faux-mur or faux-toit owing
to character of the coal.
The coal is always high in ash and usually in sulphur. Analyses
of that from the one important horizon show :

Moisture i.oi to 1.21 3-43 to 6.05
Volatile 7.64 to 26.00 22.98 to 29.09
Fixed Carbon 35.34 to 54-63 37-52 to 44.20
Ash 24.88 to 28.38 23.04 to 31.17
Sulphur 1.58 to 11.42 0.60 to 12.96
The sulphur is present as pyrite and it, as well as a great part of
the ash, can be removed by washing. Briquettes, made from
washed coal, have from 8 to 14 per cent, of ash and 0.64 to 1.31 of
