K-W-N through compensator groove in upper plate ; N-R through
stethoscope lead to right ear. The sound from F traverses a similar
course, viz. : F-H-Z-M-0-K-Y-N-L ending at the left ear. It is
readily seen that the compensation effected between E and R and
between F and L when the upper plate of the compensator is rotated
Plate XIII. b. The acoustical M-V installation and protective blister.
is double that effected between E and {B or A) since in the former
case two grooves are connected in series. Thus all the requirements
for complete compensation of twelve equally spaced receivers
mounted in a line are met.
