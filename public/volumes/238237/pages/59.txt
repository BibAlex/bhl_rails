WILLIAMS— DEEP KANSAN PONDINGS IN
inforced at a later date by the torrent from the Big Bend ponding
through the pass at Kane, noted above. We have thus a deposition
of sorts of increasing size along this line of current, and only along
it, from the Allegheny Valley to Tiona (in general), and Sheffield
(with regard to some of the first deposits ; but only in very thin
beds). None of these deposits came to Barnes and thus into Tio-
nesta River. Of these described by Williams,^ the Conewango Clay,
the Upper and the Lozver Indian Hollozv Sands were dropped dur-
ing the discharge of the Conewango Ponding at Barnes, and the
Clarendon Gravels, at the end — the moraines at Clarendon marking
the arrival of the glacial margin of the main trunk on the Pennsyl-
vania Highlands. All are glacial outwashes. Figs. 5 and 6 were

taken from the same set-up, with the camera reversed. They repre-
sent the faces of a working in the Lozver Indian Hollozv Sands: the
former looking eastward to the back of the Hollow ; the latter, west-
ward, toward the Conewango Valley. We are looking at the same
strata. In Fig. 5 is shown an area undisturbed by the scour of the
flow towards Barnes, though the regular dip of the foreset beds of
different color in that direction shows that they were dropped in
