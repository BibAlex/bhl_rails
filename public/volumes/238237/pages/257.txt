372 HAYESâ€” U. S. NAVY MV TYPE OF HYDROPHONE.
6. By giving a fairly accurate, intermittent sounding record while
the vessel is under way in water of any depth, providing the
vessel is equipped with a suitable submarine sound-signaling
device.
7. By giving the distance of a submarine sound signal.
8. By locating icebergs, derelicts, or precipitous coasts at ranges
sufficient for avoiding collisions.
Hydrophones Developed by the U. S. Navy.^
The hydrophones developed by the United States Navy differ
from all others in that they employ a multiplicity of non-resonant,
underwater sound receivers, having sufficient time lag (compensa-
tion) introduced into the path of energy traverse between each re-
ceiver and the ear to bring the energy from all the receivers to the
ears in phase.
The receivers are placed at equal intervals along a horizontal
line. The dimensions of the group of receivers (length of line) is
sufficiently great to cause an appreciable change in phase relations
between the responses from the several receivers whenever the
direction of the sound-source relative to the line of receivers is
changed.
Navy hydrophones employing multiple receivers are of two
classes, namely ; those employing fixed compensation wherein the
line of receivers can be rotated about a vertical axis, and those em-
ploying variable compensation wherein the receivers are fixed in
position. The present paper deals with the latter class of hydro-
phones, the so-called " MV Types."
Why the Navy Tested the Ability of the MV Hydrophone
TO Safeguard Navigation.
At the time of the Armistice the MV type of hydrophone,
although not completely developed, was proving to be superior to
other types of on-board installations. Accordingly when the prob-
