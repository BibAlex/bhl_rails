STEADILY ALTERNATING CURRENT ON A LONG LINE. 331
Tiected with electric circuits. These may be divided into subclasses
in a variety of v^ays. The transients particularly discussed in this
paper are the regular transients M, v^hich are a branch of the in-
itiating a.-c. wave transients, and which belong to the principal class
A through subdivisions E, F, H, and /.
Artificial Line Employed. — The measurements reported in this
paper were all carried out on an artificial line in the electric trans-
mission laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
This is an artificial power-transmission line of 26 7r-sections, de-
signed by Drs. Pender and Huxley, the construction and dimensions
of which have been described elsewhere.^ It represents an aerial
singlephase copper conductor of 253 sq. mm. (500,000 cir. mils)
cross section, using ground or neutral return, and having the con-
stants given in the following table.
