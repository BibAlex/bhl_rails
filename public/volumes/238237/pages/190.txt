WHITEHEAD— HIGH VOLTAGE CORONA IN AIR.

the opposite terminal, an outer air-tight containing case in which
the air pressure may be varied, and convenient means for determin-
ing accurately the first appearance of corona. All of these features
are indicated in diagrammatical form in Fig. 4.
In Fig. 4 ^ is the central wire, or rod. B is the concentric

cylinder forming the opposite terminal which is connected to
ground ; C is the outer air-tight containing case with air pressure
control at the pump P ; and £ is a high voltage insulating bushing
for connecting the source of high potential A'' to the corona rod A ;
H is a porcelain insulator maintaining the lower end of A in fixed
position.
Two simple methods have been developed for detecting the
initial appearance of corona as the voltage on A is slowly raised.
The first of these makes use of the fact that the presence of corona
sets up a copious state of ionization. The cylinder B is therefore
perforated, and just outside cylinder B a continuous surrounding
cylinder F is placed, carefully insulated from B. Connection is
made to this outer cylinder through the galvanometer Go either
directly to ground or with a continuous electromotive force in series.
At the first beginnings of corona the air between cylinders B and F
