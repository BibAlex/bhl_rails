principle it is an electrical copy of the M-V Tube above described.
Two lines of twelve equally spaced microphone receivers are con-

of two carefully matched telephone receivers. The microphone re-
ceiver developed for these lines is fully as sensitive as the " rat" and
gives a more faithful reproduction of phase, a requirement for re-
ceivers used in multiple. The construction of this receiver is shown
in Plate XV.
Each line of twelve receivers is housed in a flexible gum rubber
tube which is stopped at either end by properly streamlined forms.
A line of receivers so housed is called an eel. Electrical connection
between the receivers and compensator is made through a 14-con-
ductor cable which can be payed out or in from a specially designed
reel without breaking the electrical circuits. Plate XVI. shows the
eel with its cable and reel. Plate XVII. shows the Type AE-2
electrical compensator, used to compensate the receivers in the eel.
The U-3 Tube consists of two similar eels towed abreast, each
by its own separate cable. The eels, because of their flexibility, do
not skid when eddies or cross currents are encountered and thus
keep their relative position without the use of a spreader. Their
