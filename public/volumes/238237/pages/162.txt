MUNROE-HOWELL— PRODUCTS OF DETONATION OF TNT. 221
In order to determine the nature and the quantity of gases ab-
sorbed by the solid products of combustion, two 4CK) gram charges
were detonated in the Bichel gage.

1. After the differential sample of gas had been taken and the
pressure in the gage was zero as shown by a water manometer, the
gage was again closed up and readings taken every 30 seconds until
the manometer reading was constant, when the pressure was again
released and the readings repeated. The readings are given in the
preceding table.
2. After the differential sample (a) had been taken for analysis
and the pressure reduced to zero, the gage was again closed up and
readings taken until there was no further increase in the pressure
reading on the water manometer, when a second sample (b) of gas
was taken and analyzed. The readings on the water manometer
and the analyses of the two samples of gas (a and b) are given in
the following tables on page 222.
In comparing the two gas analyses, it must be kept in mind that
the amount of gas given off by the solid products of combustion was
enough to change the analyses of all the gas remaining in the 15.3
liter gage to the extent given above.
When the gage w^as opened up, the solids in gage were collected
and treated in a vacuum extraction apparatus to determine the com-
position of the gases still retained by these products. In calculating
the analysis of the gas in the solids, the oxygen present was used as
