New England streams when the winter ice is hfted by a freshet.
Ice-dams are formed at each constriction and sharp bend of the
valley, and water ponded to considerable depths, leaving gravel and
boulders to be removed by the farmers before cultivation can be
undertaken.
Figure i shows the character of the glacial outwash carried over
the broad and flat saddle at Dix from the Bald Eagle to the Juniata
Valley, and dropped at Tyrone as soon as the carrying current lost
its velocity of 40 inches per second. The Juniata Valley was never
touched by the glacier.
Bald Eagle Ponding.
When the Kansan lobe that moved down the North Branch of
Susquehanna River touched the lofty wedge-end, where Bald Eagle
and White Deer mountains meet and rise 1,200 feet above the flood
plain of the West Branch of that stream, the water of that branch
was ponded west of Williamsport, and the lowest point of discharge
was the flat saddle at Dix, just above mentioned, into the Juniata
Valley. This fixed the surface of ponding at 1,110 feet, and the
depth against the glacier near Williamsport at 650 feet.
The gravels to be considered came from the wasting of that part
