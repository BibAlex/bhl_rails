MAYOR— THE REEFS OF TUTUILA, SAMOA.
229
A study of the submarine slopes of the fringing reefs of Tutuila
was made by casting out an anchor upon the seaward edge of the
reef, and then steaming seaward in the launch keeping the anchor-
line taut and making soundings at distances of 25. 50, 75, 100 feet,
etc., from the edge of the reef. This enabled us to determine the
slopes as shown in Fig. 3, which represents the conditions seen in
various parts of Pago Pago Harbor. The vertical and horizontal
scales are the same in these diagrams. We see that the growing
edge of the reef usually overhangs at sea level, due to the dense
clustering of the rapidly growing Acropora Icptocyathus in this
region, and to the fact that when they die these corals are main-
tained in place by the overgrowth of lithothamnion. Under this

overhanging edge there is a submarine precipice of usually 5 to 25
feet in depth, beyond which there is a narrow region which is rela-
tively flat, and where corals grow vigorously but cannot reach the
surface, due to the surges of the breakers which fracture their
stems in time of storm. Beyond this lies the seaward slope com-
posed chiefly of loose dead and alive coral fragments, the talus of
the reef, which extends downward at an average angle of about 25°
to 30°, thus being somewhat steeper than the average subaerial
slopes of volcanic islands. As this talus sets itself at an angle of
repose of 25° to 30° it would seem that a slope steeper than this
would be unfavorable for the starting of a coral reef, for whenever
a coral died or was broken ofif it would roll down the slope ; and new
