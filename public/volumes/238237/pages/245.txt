the switch mechanism are indicated in outline by Fig. 6. The
alternating-current generator G, is supposed to be in regular opera-
tion at the correct frequency. The above mentioned synchronous
motor, shown in plan view in Fig. 7, is then started, and synchron-

ized with the generator. The arc lamp for the oscillograph vibra-
tors is then lit. The brushes B^B^, Fig. 4, are next set in the correct
position to close the generator on the artificial line at an instant of
zero e.m.f. This adjustment is made by trial, substituting a simple
non-inductive resistance for the artificial line, and closing the gen-
erator through the brushes, and an oscillograph, so as to observe on
the translucent screen whether the beam of light starts into vibra-
tion without a splash. The setting of the brushes to effect this
result can usually be adjusted, with ordinary optical conditions,
within one electrical degree, or 46 microseconds for a 60.— ' gen-
erator. The artificial line is then reconnected to the apparatus, all
ready for the photographic record. A starting lever is moved by
hand, and this causes automatic switch S-^ to be closed, ahead of the
rotary switch D. The brushes B-^Bo then close the circuit finally,
