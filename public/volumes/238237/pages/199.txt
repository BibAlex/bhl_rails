282 ORTMANN— CORRELATION OF SHAPE AND
into this problem, which may necessitate some radical changes in our
Naiad-nomenclature.
This much is certain, that F. pilaris, the representative form in
the upper Tennessee of F. suhrotunda from the Ohio, behaves
exactly as F. suhrotunda, but the headwaters-forms of the two, in
the upper Tennessee and the upper Ohio drainages, although very
similar, have no direct genetic connection, and undoubtedly have
developed independently of each other.
Group of Fusconaia flava in the Upper Ohio-drainage.
I classify the forms belonging here as follows.
1. Fusconaia flava (Rafinesque). — Dia. less than 55 per cent.
Ohliquaria flava Rafinesque, '20 (trib. of Kentucky, Salt, Green R.).
— Quadrula flava Vanatta, Pr. Ac. Philad., '15, p. 557.
Dia. (Conrad, '37) : 43 per cent.; (Vanatta) : 39 per cent,
Unio rubiginosus Lea, '29 (Ohio). — Quadrula ruhiginosa Simpson,
'14. P- 872.
Dia. (Lea) : 44 per cent.; (Simpson) : 41, 34, 53 per cent.
2. Fusconaia flava trigona (Lea). — Dia. 55 per cent, and
over.
Unio trigonus Lea, '31 (Ohio R., Cincinnati and Louisville). —
Synonym to Quadrula undata (Barnes), according to Simpson,
'14, p. 881.
Dia. (Lea) : 63 per cent.
Probably also U . iindatus Barnes, '23, belongs here. This form,
has been discussed by Walker (Nautil., 24, '10, p. 24), who says
that it is the same as trigomts. He gives the diameter of 68 per
cent. Simpson (1. c), who follows him, gives it as 60, 61, and 76
per cent.
Walker and Simpson probably are right in regarding trigonus
and U7idatus as synonyms, as far as it concerns obesity. However,
I think that they difiter in the development of the beaks, iindatus
having higher beaks, so that the outline is more triangular, while it
is subtrapezoidal in trigonus. Of typical undatus I have no good
material, and this form is not found in the upper Ohio. Wliat 1
have from this region (vicinity of Pittsburgh and upwards) repre-
