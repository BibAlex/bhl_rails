STEADILY ALTERNATING CURRENT ON A LONG LINE. 341
made to analyze these curves as yet, owing to the bad splash and
lumpiness transients they indicate.
Splash Transient Occurring Singly. — If the line is made vir-
tually of infinite length with respect to the sending end, by ground-
ing it at B through an impedance equal to its surge impedance -sTq,
a splash produced by the closing of the line switch ofif zero e.m.f.,
will give rise to a splash transient, that will vanish very quickly at
A; because no reflected waves can return from the distant end.
An example of this case is presented in Fig. 12 (Film No. 35).

Fig. 12. Non-recurring Splash and Casual Transients.
Approximately the same half-length artificial line as in Fig. 11
(580 km.), is here grounded at B through a combination of resist-
ance and condenser, so as to produce an impedance, at 60.6'—', of
342.5 x' 4°. 4 ohms. The line switch was closed at a phase of about
20 electrical degrees later than the zero of ascending e.m.f. This is
seen to produce a splash both in Cs and is, the initial outgoing waves
of e.m.f. and current. This splash is also seen to be repeated in the
B-end voltage Cr, where the load (^0) is connected. The splash
gives rise also to a lumpiness transient, as may be seen by the ripples
in is, the entering current, during the first alternation. A similar
lumpiness ripple transient is faintly perceptible in the first alterna-
tion of e,- at B. Neither splash nor lumpiness transients are visible,
however, in the second or succeeding alternations in any of the
curves, these disturbances, according to theory, being all absorbed
at the B end, by the load Sq.
