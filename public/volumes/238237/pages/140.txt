PRINCEâ€” SLAV AND CELT. 193
particularly in his " Journal of a Writer," the last number of which,
January, 1881, contains a most elaborate plea for the Asiatic ex-
pansion of Russia in preference to a distinctly western trend.
Slavs and Celts are Oriental character-types in Europe requiring the
strong hand of western administration to guide them to efificiency.
Their thought-basis is from the East and they have never been thor-
oughly westernized. Full of individual kindliness and charm, lack-
ing the qualities which make for that worldly success which both
peoples in general despise, these eastern and western European
tribes, if rightly controlled and guided, should be a welcome counter-
balance to the too rigid materialism of the Germanic peoples and
the cold selfishness of the tribes of the Latin dispersion.
