STEADILY ALTERNATING CURRENT ON A LONG LINE. 337
at the proper predetermined phase of minimum splash. The auto-
matic switch So then immediately follows, so as to keep the contact
closed on the line after the brushes B-^B2 have passed off the contact
segment. Before the brushes 8^82 close, the photographic shutter
is opened by the electromagnet Q, under the action of an automatic
switch S^. After one complete revolution of the photographic-film
drum, another shutter is closed by the electromagnet C2, under the
control of an auxiliary automatic switch ^'4. This cuts off the arc
light from the recording film, after about nine cycles have been
recorded on all three oscillographs. The whole mechanism can
then be arrested, by hand, at leisure. Lastly, the photographic drum
is removed and taken to the dark room for development.
A photographic view of the artificial line and the oscillographic
apparatus is shown in Fig. 8.

Case of Regular Transients. â€” About 150 different triple oscillo-
grams have been secured of initial electromagnetic wave transients,
under various conditions, over artificial lines. Only a few of these
can be dealt with in this paper.
