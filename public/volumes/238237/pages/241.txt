The lumpiness correction factor of this Hne in the steady state
is 1.0002 V o°.ooo2 at 60'— ', which, for practical purposes, is quite
insignificant. This means that, for a.-c. transmission in the steady
state, at 60'~', this lumpy artificial line is equivalant to the smooth
uniform line having the linear constants r, g, I and c of Table 11.
At 189.4 '— ', however, the lumpiness correction factor, in the steady
state, is 1.002 ^ o°.oi, and at yet higher frequencies, it becomes
very appreciable. A picture of part of this line appears in Fig. 8.
In most of the measurements of transients made on this line,
the full length of 26 sections, 1255 km., or 780 miles, was employed.
At 60.6'—' — the frequency ordinarily used — this length is nearly a
quarter wavelength,^ so that, in the steady state, with the distant
end B free, the voltage at B with the oscillograph connected there,
rises to 5.627 V 110°. 6 times the voltage impressed at A.
