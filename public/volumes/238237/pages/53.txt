WILLIAMS— DEEP KANSAN PONDINGS IN
This dam was in the narrower and more crooked North Branch
of the river : the one in the main stream and far broader valley was
low ; but sufficient to form a terrace that runs, with slight rise, for
lo miles up the valley of Middle Creek, and for 20 miles up that of
Penn's Creek. The latter has a delta i mile broad. ^ This low ter-
race is the nearest approach to a complete valley filling that we shall
meet with.
Juniata Ponding.
I. C. White^ was the first to describe the glacial outwash in
Juniata Valley, and to call attention to the great distance above the
average level of the gravel terrace to which sporadic patches of the
same were carried. E. H. Williams, Jr., in 1895,* ascribed their
origin to ice-dams in the many " Narrows " where this stream has
cut through the more resisting ridges which border the trough-like
valleys it crosses in its way to the Susquehanna River. The terrace
runs with but slight rise far up the valleys of its affluents, and the
sporadic gravels are the usual iceberg trash carried on the crest of
the released wave when an ice-dam broke, and permitted the ponded
water to rush up all opposing slopes and leave its bergs and their
burden. This phenomenon occurs nearly every spring in northern
