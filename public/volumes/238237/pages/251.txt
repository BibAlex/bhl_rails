gram of Fig. 9 belongs. It is treated in detail in Appendix II.
The axis OX represents the standard phase of the sending end
voltage. The successive maximum cyclic voltage reflections at B,
are represented to scale by the vectors Oa, ah, he, etc., as far as the
fourteenth inclusive. The vector sum of these {Oa, Oh, Oc, etc.)
are given for each step in the process. Table V. in Appendix 11. ,
shows the maximum cyclic values attained at each stage. This in-
creases to iig 796.2 V 1 09°. 49' at the thirteenth reflection. After
this, it diminishes shghtly to 795.8 nio°.36' in the fina-1 steady
state. The final voltage at B is thus 5.63 times the impressed volt-
