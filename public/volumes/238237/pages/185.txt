the surface of the conductor and more so the smaller its radius of
curvature, and also in that the value of electric intensity at which
corona first appears may be much higher than 32 kilovolts per cen-
timeter. In fact in these cases values of electric intensity higher
than 32 kilovolts per centimeter are reached with no resulting
evidence of breakdown or brush discharge.
Evidently we are here in the presence of a striking property of

electric strain on the intensity at which initial breakdown takes place.
It would appear that here is a splendid opportunity for further
study of the molecular and atomic structure of the air. The phe-
nomena are extremely definite and constant in the case of the
central wire and cylinder, and all of the conditions are susceptible
of accurate measurement. However the physicist appears not to
be interested in the electric properties of air at pressures in the
neighborhood of that of the atmosphere. Professor J. T. Town-
