energy requisite for the production of this spectrum might be pro-
vided by an electric field. Interpreted through the medium of
Bohr's very convenient, but equally myterious conception, this con-
tinuous spectrum indicates for the planetary nebulae themselves a
degree of temperature, or electrical excitation, comparable with
that found to exist in their nuclei, and in other intensely radiating
stars.
