KENNELLY-NABESHIMA— ESTABLISHING A
Ammeters and voltmeters of the alternating-current type were
introduced, at special times, into the artificial-line circuits, in order
to secure calibrations of the oscillograms. The impressed e.m.f, at
A ranged, in dififerent cases, from 60 to 100 volts r.m.s.
Line-Switch Connections. — In order to minimize splash tran-
'sients, it was necessary to design and make up a switch, which
would connect the 60 '—' alternator to the artificial line at an instant
of zero e.m.f. For this purpose, a little 6-pole synchronous motor,
running in synchronism with the a.-c. generator, was caused to
drive an insulating disk D, Fig. 4, carrying a 60° conducting sector

S, in such a manner that a pair of insulated brushes B^B^, resting
thereon, could be brought into contact, through the sector, at any
desired position around its circumference. The final adjustment of
phase position was secured by means of the graduated pointer and
scale LK, divided into single degrees of arc. One electrical degree
