236 MAYORâ€” THE REEFS OF TUTUILA, SAMOA.
It seems probable that the reefs now living in the Pacific are
structures which have originated in modern times upon submerged
slopes and platforms of marine erosion. Being not more than
40,000 years old, these reefs have not existed long enough to have
been subjected, except in rare instances, to appreciable subsidence
or elevation of the land masses upon which they have attained a
foothold.
