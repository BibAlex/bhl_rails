HAYES— DETECTION OF SUBMARINES.
sound as received in the two phones its source can be located as to
port or starboard. By swinging the boat until the intensity is the
same in both phones the direction of the sound can be somewhat ac-
curately located as dead ahead.

The second installation consists of four Fessenden oscillators
placed one in each of the four quadrants of a large tank within the
ship. Each quadrant is separated from the others by a sound-screen.
By comparing the intensity of sound as received on each of the four
oscillators the direction of the sound source can be located to within
90 degrees.
Detector installations were early developed at both the Naval
Experimental and the Nahant Stations that were superior both as to
range and bearing accuracy and the above named devices were aban-
doned.
Two types of detectors have been developed at the Nahant Sta-
tion — the " C-Tube " and the " 3-Spot." One type, the C-Tube, has
been partially explained. It consists of two rubber acoustic receivers
spaced about four feet apart on a horizontal arm which can be
rotated about a vertical axis. Each receiver connects to one ear re-
spectively through metal tubes ending in stethoscope leads. The
direction of a sound is determined by the binaural principle in a
manner that has been described.
The C-Tnbe is a superior detector device. It is capable of giv-
ing good range and accurate angular bearings, but its operation is
seriously interfered with by local noises and noises from neighboring
shipping and it cannot be operated while the boat is moving. More-
over, it must be lowered before taking a bearing and must be raised
