and it is seen that the composition nearly approaches that given for
the products of Poppenberg and Stephan's experiments I. and II.
Bichel's experiment is the only one whose results admit of a
comparison being made with TNT itself in order to ascertain the
extent to which the two agree. For this purpose Bichel's percent-
ages for the compound substances have been reduced to their ele-
ments, the total for each element assembled and the elementary
composition of the products compared in the following with that of
pure TNT.

In the descriptions of the above investigations as found no de-
scription of the trinitrotoluene used or any means of checking it,
such as melting point, setting point or other data appear. Poppen-
berg and Stephan do not state what kind of detonator was used,
Giua notes that Bichel in his first experiment used 1.5 gram mercury
fulminate detonator. Experience has shown that at least a No. 8
detonator containing 2 grams'* of the fulminate charge is essential
to insure the full detonation of TNT, and the somewhat erratic re-
sults obtained in the pressure gage led us to consider the trial of
tetryl detonators in the hope that more certain uniformity might
result.
Considering the state of the information regarding the explosion
products of trinitrotoluenes that we have found in the literature ; the
