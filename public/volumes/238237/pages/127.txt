The data in the above table afford information on three main
questions, viz., the probable constitution of living matter to be in-
ferred from high hydration capacity, the nature of the colloids which
show a sensitiveness in hydration to the action of the hydrogen ion,
the hydroxyl ion and to ions which may be derived from amino-
compounds, and lastly the differentiations in heterotropic swelling.
The highest swelling of the pentosan-protein mixtures is that of
agar i gelatine 3 in hundredth normal acid. Such colloids may be
present in the animal, but may be taken to be highly specialized or
unusual in the plant and not shown by the cell-masses of the vegeta-
tive tracts. Chief interest centers in the colloids in which the carbo-
hydrate and albuminous components each vary in forming 30 to 60
per cent, of the total and showing high hydration capacities in the
hydroxides, in glycocoll and in water. These mixtures furnish an
analogue of living matter of proved similarity of composition and
action. Not only has it been possible to compound biocolloids which
