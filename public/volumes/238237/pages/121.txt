Summary of Generalizations Previously Discussed.
The principal conclusions established by our previously described
investigations which are of direct interest with relation to new re-
sults to be presented are as follows :
I. The protoplasmic mass of the active cell of the plant is a
mixture of carbohydrates chiefly in the form of pentosans and al-
buminous substances, with a probable very low but undetermined
proportion of lipins. In addition to the mucilaginous substances of
the first, freely soluble sugars may be present in the cell solutions.
II. The principal components of plasmatic masses, the mucilages
and the proteins, are mutually non-interdifi^usible and hence when
brought together in the cell by minute accretions or mixed in liquid
form must be taken to form complex emulsions or mesh-works, and
to occur separately both in disperse phase and disperse medium.
HI. Of the components of such a mass the one which could be
regarded as the more solid as having the lesser attraction for mole-
cules of water, would tend to take position in the peripheral layer
and to assume a greater density by lessening the liquid phase in the
surface layer.
IV. The external layer of any colloidal mass or of any layer
where two masses meet has invariably a composition determined by
the constitution of the impinging masses. The formation of the
cellulose wall which is first seen as a free plate between two separat-
ing protoplasts has a structure resulting from such action. The
plasma of the plant being highly carbohydrate, the external layer is
consequently largely anhydride of this material. The layers added
internally to the initial wall must be of the same character. Further-
more for similar reasons, the external layer of the plasma, the semi-
permeable membrane, would also be high in carbohydrate. The en-
