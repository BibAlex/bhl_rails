westward extension of the same beds on the edge of the scour of the
stream in the reversed Conewango, as each bed thins out, and some-
times completely disappears, as it is influenced by it. In fine, the
strata were shaped at that time as we see them to-day, for this is no
subsequent cutting down. Each bed becomes thinner, and the dip
of the upper layers is steeper than of those at the base. Besides this,
there can have been no sculpturing of these beds or of their surface
since the deposition of the iceberg clay which is found — with vary-
ing degrees of sandiness or of silt — capping everything about War-
ren, and so down the Allegheny to Pittsburgh. At times the boulders
in this cap are of large size, and speak of ice masses floating in deep
ponding, as the deposit in which they occur is so uniformly com-
posed of small sorts : at times it is clean silt with little or no larger
sorts. Along the Conewango the Lozuer Indian Hollow Sands vary
in thickness from 30 to 125 feet, depending upon the conditions of
deposition in the different areas where it is found. It rests in the
blued, sticky Conezvango Clay, which carries wood fragments and
logs, and is sometimes over 200 feet thick.
