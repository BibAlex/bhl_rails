HAYES— U. S. NAVY MV TYPE OF HYDROPHONE.
577
Referring to Fig. 3, let (H) represent the position of the MV
hydrophone and (F) the ship's propeller. The sound heard by (H)
has traversed the path P — B — H, making an angle (f) with the sur-
face. If (2L) is the distance between the propeller and the hydro-

phone, both located a distance (C) below the surface, and if the
sea-bottom is a horizontal plane, then the depth (D) is given by the
equation
D = C — Ltan^,
= C + Ltan(7r — ^),
or
D = C + L tan <^,
This equation will be referred to as the " sounding equation " and
the angle </> will be referred to as the " sounding angle." It is to be
noticed that the compensator scale is designed to feature d, the
angle the sound makes with the ship's keel extended forward, in
order to give directly the relative bearing of surface vessels. The
sounding angle <^ is the supplement of this angle.
The range of a vessel ahead or astern can be determined roughly
if the depth of water is known, since the hydrophone determines the
angle which its reflected sound signals make with the surface.
Referring to Fig. 4, where S^ or 5^2 represents an artificial sound-
source upon a vessel ahead or astern of the vessel equipped with the
hydrophone {H), we have
