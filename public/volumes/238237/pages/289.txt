place, 4 feet 4 inches thick, has at one mine only 3.5 per cent, of
ash, vi^hereas in another it has 23.61. No igneous rocks were seen

New South Wales. — The Permo-Carboniferous, according to
David," is divisible within the Hunter River region into
The Newcastle Series, freshwater, with coal seams 1,400 to 1,500 feet
The Dempsey Series, freshwater, no workable coal 200 to 2,000 feet
The Tomago Series, with coal seams 1,600 to 1,800 feet
The Upper Marine Series, without coal 5, 000 to 6,400 feet
The Greta Series, with coal seams 150 to 300 feet
The Lower Marine Series, with little coal 4,800 feet
A great gap exists between Carboniferous or "Gympic" depos-
its, which, most probably, belong to the Lower Carboniferous. On
the border of Queensland, in the Ashland coal field, the Permo-
Carboniferous rests in great unconformity against the Lower Car-
iDoniferous, which is not far from 20,000 feet thick. This vast
mass consists, in the lower and middle divisions, of marine beds, but
the upper division is mostly lava and volcanic tuffs. The gap is
indicated not only by the angular unconformity but also by the fact
that but one genus of plants is common and the contrast in fauna is
.almost as great.
The Lower Marine Series has, at base, a deposit about 200 feet
thick, underlying a basalt sheet and containing many glaciated peb-
bles. The first appearance of Gangamopteris is at about 3,000 feet
from the base ; and at 500 feet higher is a coal seam of rather infe-
rior quality, 10 feet 6 inches thick, inclusive of the partings which
contain Gangamopteris. The Greta Series, sandstones and shale,
has near the base the Homeville seam, 3 to 11 feet 6 inches thick,
"hard, bituminous coal ; at the South Greta mine it rests on Kerosene
shale. At 50 feet higher, the interval being filled with sandstone,
conglomerate and shale, is the Greta seam, 14 to 32 feet thick, with
floor of shale and roof of sandstone or conglomerate. Where the
