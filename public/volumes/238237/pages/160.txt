MUNROE-HOWELL— PRODUCTS OF DETONATION OF TNT. 219
It was thought that these different analyses were the result of
the explosion reaction following different courses, and that if a
priming charge diff'erent from mercury fulminate-potassium
chlorate were used for initiating the detonation, the explosion reac-
tion might either be made to always follow the same course or that
a still different reaction might take place. Accordingly, tests were
carried out using an electric tetryl detonator (M — 2664) contain-
ing a base charge of 1.2 149 grams tetryl and a priming charge of
.4650 grams mercury fulminate-potassium chlorate mixture.
The following table shows the composition of the gases obtained
from 200 gram samples of M — 2354 at a density of 0.86 and 200
gram samples of M — 2630 at a density of 1.50, using both a fulmi-
nate and tetryl electric detonator. For comparative purposes, all
these analyses have been computed free from the nitrogen in the
residual air and electric detonators.

It will be noted from the above table that the gases given off by
the two samples of TNT were practically the same whether ful-
minate or tetryl detonators were used.
Solid Products of Combustion from Grade I TNT,
On opening up the Bichel gage after firing a charge of TNT,
there is found deposited on the walls of the gage a very finely
divided deposit of black soot-like appearing solid. This same solid
can always be observed when TNT is detonated where the smoke
can be seen.
The question has arisen as to the amount and composition of this
deposit and its effect on the gases, i.e., whether this carbon-like de-
