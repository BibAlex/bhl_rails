corals. As this shore bench is identical in elevation in these sepa-
rated islands of differing ages and histories, Daly is justified in
the inference that it indicates a relatively recent subsidence of sea
level rather than an elevation of the Islands. Indeed a relatively
recent emergence of about 8 feet above high tide level is shown by
the Atolls of the Paumotos, and Ellis Groups, as well as by the
islands in Torres Straits, and the southern shore of Papua in the
region of Port Moresby. It appears also in the Florida Keys and
the Bahamas, and A. Agassiz, 1903, Proc. Royal Soc. London, Vol.
71, p. 413, says that "Throughout the Pacific, the Indian Ocean,
and the West Indies the most positive evidence exists of a moderate

recent elevation of the coal reefs." Indeed Daly records a mod-
erate recent emergence of the land along many thousand miles of
coast line not only in the tropical, but also in colder regions.
In the volcanic islands of American Samoa there are no traces
of elevated coral reefs, or limestones except small fragments thrown
up by volcanic action and imbedded in ejected volcanic ash as at
Aunuu, or in a crater rim south of Logatala Hill, Tutuila, or each
of Faleasau Village on Tau Island.
No corals or limestones are found imbedded in or resting upon
the emerged shore bench around Tutuila ; nor were any ancient
corals tossed up by stems on the beaches of the inner parts of the
