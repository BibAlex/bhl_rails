Every unit in the construction of an eel (head, tail, housing tube,
and each of the twelve receivers) is carefully designed to have neu-
tral buoyancy in sea water when the eel is filled with fresh water.
This assures that the line of receivers will lie in a horizontal plane

so long as there is any appreciable relative motion between the eel
and the water. The depth at which the eels trail depends upon the
length of cable and the speed of the boat. In practice this depth is
kept within lOO feet.
The electrical impulses from the microphone receivers, produced
by sound from any particular direction, are brought into phase at the
two telephone receivers by means of a rotating switch arrangement
which introduces the proper amount of loaded line into the separate
microphone circuits. The 6 microphones in the forward half of the
receiver line attach to one telephone and the rear 6 connect with the
other. The construction of the compensator is such that the same
