The statement that no increase in range is to be gained by increas-
ing the sensitiveness of the receivers beyond a certain point ob-
viously does not apply when the receivers are used in multiple since
the local and other disturbing noises are not intensified in the same
proportion as the sound upon which the receivers are focused. More
sensitive receivers can be effectively employed in multiple unit de-

with the need for a long range listening device led to the develop-
ment of several types of electrical listening devices employing mul-
tiple receivers. A description of these devices follows :
