bristles, shorter achenes, and phyllaries that are covered by stiffer
and more erect trichomes. I have been unable to make this distinc-
tion with confidence. It is true that H. ravemi (based on specimens
from its described geographic range, but not confirmed by chromo-
some counts) has phyllaries with trichomes which are often sparse
and ascending to spreading versus more numerous, generally ap-
pressed, and longer. Unfortunately, in surveying several hundred
sheets of Machaeranthera gracilis sensu lato, approximately twenty
percent showed intermediacy in this character. Formal recognition
of the n = 4 race has been questioned by Cronquist (1971) and
others.

For complete synonymy and a taxonomic treatment of this poly-
morphic species, the reader is referred to Turner k Hartman (1976).
A total of seven varieties distributed between two subspecies are
recognized. They often intergrade in areas of sympatry.

This species, which is restricted to the Sierra San Pedro Martir
of NE Baja California, is most closely related to Machaeranthera
gracilis.
