Plants taprooted annuals, biennials, or perennials, sometimes with a much
branched caudex, 0.3-7.0 dm taU. Leaves entire, serrate, dentate, or pinnatifid
to deeply bipinnatifid, teeth or lobes usually bristle tipped, often markedly
so. Heads radiate. Involucre broadly turbinate to depressed campanulate.
PhyUaries in 4-8 graduated series, linear to narrowly oblong, lower portion
rigid, light green to stramineous, upper half to fifth with a green patch or
strip (sometimes blackish near apex), usually pubescent, often with glandular
trichomes, erect to squarrose, obtuse to acuminate, usually tipped by a stiff
and often pronounced bristle. Receptacles usually alveolate, scales poorly de-
veloped or to 3 mm long. Ray florets yellow. Achenes often dimorphic, 1.5-3.2
mm long, elliptic to narrowly obovate, walls thin with 6-16 nerves or weak
ribs, glabrous to moderately pubescent; ray achenes usually rounded on dorsal
edge, often asymmetrical, and slightly shorter; disc achenes flattened laterally.
Pappus 3.5-6.0 mm long, white to tawny, bristles slightly to moderately dor-
siventrally flattened basaUy, in 2-4 markedly graduated series; pappus of ray
florets sometimes reduced in length. Chromosome number, n = 2, 3, 4, or 8.
1. Plants annual with herbaceous stems; involucre eglandular 2.
2. Leaves with entire margins, not bristle lined, or lower cauline and
basal ones tridentate or sometimes pinnatifid; restricted to Sierra
San Pedro Martir, NE Baja California, Mexico M. wiggmsii
2' Leaves uniformly spinulose toothed or lobed, bristles usually 1.5-3.0
mm long; phyUaries (except innermost series) tipped by bristles
usually 0.6-1.5 mm long; occurring elsewhere M. gracilis
