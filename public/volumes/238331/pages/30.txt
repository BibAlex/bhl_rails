Hartmaui: Conspectus of Machaeranthera (Astera.cea.e: Astereae) 451
To these four species, which constituted section Artda sensu Hartman
(1976), I would add the following taxa which are poorly known biosystem-
atically.
Aster blepharophyllus A. Gray, PI. Wright. 2:77. 1853, non Machaer-
anthera blephanphylla (A. Gray) Shinn., Field k Lab. 18:38. 1950,
based on Aplopappus blephariphyllus A. Gray. TYPE: U.S.A. New
Mexico: Hidalgo Co., Las Playas Springs, 7 Oct 1851, C. Wnght
1164 (LECTOTYPE: to be designated elsewhere, GH!, MO!, NY
[photo, RM!], PH [photo, RM!], US [photo, RM!]).
Nesom, et al (1990) are transferring this taxon to Machaer-
anthera, providing a new name to avoid a later homonym, and
designating the lectotype. This taxon is unusual as it shares sev-
eral morphological features (examples noted above in the key to
the subgenera and sections) with section Blepharodon. Likewise,
restriction site analysis of chloroplast DNA by Morgan & Simpson
(1990) indicate that it is a member of that section. Conversely,
probing with a ribosomal DNA gene intimated that it may not be
a member of section Blepharodon. It is possible that Aster ble-
pharophyllus was formed via hybrid speciation at the diploid level
between members of sections Anda and Blepharodon.
Machaeranthera camosa (A. Gray) Nesom, Phytologia 67:439. 1989.
BASIONYM: Lmosyns camosa A. Gray, PI. Wnght. 2:80. 1853.
TYPE: MEXICO. Sonora: "low, subsaline vaUey, west of Chiric-
ahui Mountains," Sep 1851, C. Wnght 1187 (HOLOTYPE: GH;
Isotypes: PH [photo, RM!], US [2 sheets; photos, RM!]). Aster
camosus (A. Gray) A. Gray ex Hemsley, Biol. Cent.-Amer., BoL,
2:120. 1881, non Aster camosus Gilib., Fl. Lit Inch. 1:214. 1781.
Leucosyns camosa (A. Gray) E. Greene, Fl. Francisc. 384. 1897.
Btgelovia intncatus A. Gray, Proc. Amer. Acad. Arts 17:208. 1882.
TYPE: U.S.A. California: Mohave Desert, at Lancaster Sta-
tion, C.C. Parry s.n. (HOLOTYPE: GH). Aster intncatus (A.
Gray) S.F. Blake, J. Wash. Acad. Sci. 27:378. 1937.
Nesom (1989) transferred this taxon to Machaeranthera on ac-
count of its similarities to M. npana and Aster blepharophyllus. I
suggested this disposition following the rediscovery of A. blepharo-
phyllus after observing the strong resemblance among these three
species. Previously it had been treated by Sundberg (1986) as
Leucosyns camosa.
