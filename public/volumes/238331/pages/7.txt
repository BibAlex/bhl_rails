Wood's variety was based on Gray's epithet. However, since Wunderlin em-
phasized that there was a bibHographical error in Wunderlin k Poppleton's
new combination, we accept it. Accordingly, the correct citation is: /. ambigua
var. monticola (Wood) Wunderlin h Poppleton.
ASTERACEAE
Gnaphalium.
J.C. Grierson (1971) noted that the type of the tropical weed commonly
known as Gnaphalium indicum L., belongs to the genus Helichrysum. He there-
fore transferred this Linnaean epithet to Helichrysum and made the new com-
bination: H. mdicum (L.) Grierson. Helichrysum indicum is a South African
species. With this disposition of the Linnaean G. indicum, Grierson assigned
the combination G. polycaulon Pers. to the tropical weed previously known as
"C. indicum.''^
Accordingly, the "C. indicum auct. non L." found in the New Worid must
be called G. polycaulon. Probably unaware of Grierson's published work, a
few modern authors, such as Liogier k Martorell (1982) and McVaugh (1984),
have used the name "C indicum L." However, McVaugh commented that he
did not know whether his "G. indicum,^^ is the same as G. indicum, of Linnaeus.
Gnaphalium polycaulon is characterized as foUows (from Grierson 1971):
wooUy annual, 10-25 cm tall; several or many stems arising from the base;
leaves obovate, 1-4 cm long, 2-12 mm wide; heads 150 to 200 flowered (central
bisexual flowers ca. 6); receptacle 1-1.3 mm wide; phyUaries acute, strami-
neous; pappus bristles separate at the base. The correct nomenclature is given
below:
Gnaphalium polycaulon Pers., Syn. 2:421. 1807.
Gnaphalium indicum auct. non L.: Alain, Fl. de Cuba 5:257. 1962;
Liogier k Martorell, Fl Puerto Rico & Adj. Islands 186. 1982;
McVaugh, Flora Novo-Galiciana 12:455. 1984.
Helianthus.
Helianthus ngidus (Cass.) Desf. {Cat. Pi. ed. 3, 184. 1829) was based
on Harpalium ngidum Cass. (Bull. Sci. Soc. Philom. Paris 141. Sep 1818).
For Helianthus ngidus ssp. ngidus, Heiser (Mem. Torrey Bot. Club 22[3!:131-
138. 1969) cited several synonyms, including Helianthus diffusus Sims (Bot.
Mag. 45:2020. Oct 1818) and Helianthus paucifiorus Nutt. (Gen. 2:177. 3 Apr
1818). Cleariy, Helianthus paucifiorus has priority over Harpalium ngidum a.nd
Helianthus diffusus; hence, the latter two cannot serve as basionyms. For the
North American flora, we accept Helianthus paucifiorus Nutt. as the correct
name.
