one tree per 35 sq. m in bogs. The trees in the pine woods were on average
more than twice the diameter (mean 16.8 cm dbh, range 1-40 cm, S.E.= 3.3)
of those in bogs (mean 7.8 cm dbh, range 1-28 cm, S.E.= 2.5).
Species distribution also differed between bogs and pine woods. Inside the
bogs, hardwoods over 1.5 m tall were infrequent and none occurred in the
transects. In the pine woods, hardwoods were common.
In pine woods, there were 2.5 times as many pines as in bogs, and those in
pine woods were more than twice the diameter of those in bogs.
The difference between the size class distribution of trees in bogs and in pine
woods is significant at the .01 level (Student's i), and the difference between
the class distribution of Pinus palustns in bogs and in pine woods is significant
at the .05 level (Student's t).
Scattered in the bogs and adjacent pine woods were various small trees
