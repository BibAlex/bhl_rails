This species hybridizes naturally with M. parviflora along the
margin of Lordsburg Playa near Lordsburg, Hidalgo Co., New Mex-
ico (Hartman, pers. observ.; W.L. Wagner, pers. comm., Wagner
3457, 3461). The two taxa also were successfully crossed artificially
by Stucky k Jackson (1975).
Machaeranthera tumeri Arnold Sz R. Jackson, Syst. Bot. 3:209. 1978.
TYPE: MEXICO. Chihuahua: 5.4 km N of Meoqui, along hwy. 45,
1 Aug 1964, R.C. Jackson 4005 (HOLOTYPE: TTC).
Hartman (1976) noted that plants of Machaeranthera parviflora
from W Texas, S New Mexico, and S Arizona are fairly uniform
with receptacles (measured after achenes have fallen and phyllar-
ies are reflexed) 2-3 mm in diameter, pappus of ray florets about
half the length that of disc florets, and phyllaries with appressed
apices. But these features show a clinal change with populations
in the southern portion of the range (W central Coahuila and E
central Chihuahua) having receptacles 8-11 mm in diameter, pappi
often of nearly equal lengths on ray and disc florets, and squarrose
phyllaries. The southern populations would represent M. tumen.
A more detailed study with intensive fieldwork is needed to deter-
mine whether these two names indeed apply to extremes of a cline
or whether they represent good species.
