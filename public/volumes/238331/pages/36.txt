Hajtman: Conspectus of Machaeranthera (AstcTacesie: Astereae) 459
Plants taprooted annuals, 1.5-4.5 dm tall. Leaves serrate or dentate, often
coarsely so, teeth blunt or terminating in stiff callosities, not bristle tipped.
Heads radiate. Involucre broadly turbinate. Phyllaries in 5-7 graduated se-
ries, linear to narrowly oblong, lower portion rigid, stramineous, upper fifth to
half with green patch or strip, densely glandular, erect, obtuse to acute. Re-
ceptacles alveolate, with scales to 0.4 mm long. Ray florets yellow. Achenes
essentially monomorphic, 2.5-3.0 mm long, oblong or narrowly elliptic, some-
times slightly asymmetrical, flattened laterally, walls thin with 12-14 nerves,
sparsely pubescent. Pappus similar in ray and disc florets, 5-7 mm long, white,
bristles filiform, not basally flattened, in 2-3 poorly defined series. Chromo-
some number, n = 4.

1950.
A species restricted to Chaves, Eddy, and Lea counties. New
Mexico and Culberson, Ector, and Hudspeth counties, Texas. Un-
til recently (Jackson 1969) it was usually called Machaeranthera
havardii (or Haplopappus havardii) but this name is a synonym
of M. viscida. an earlier name that had been "misplaced" in syn-
onymy under the very different H. spmulosus (= M. pmnatifida)
by Hall (1928).
