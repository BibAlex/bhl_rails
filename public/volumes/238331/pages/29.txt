occurs in S Nevada, S Arizona, S California and N Sonora, Mexico,
S to near El Desemboque. In Sonora. M. cnspa ranges in a strip
10-30 km wide from the vicinity of Bahia Kino to about 60 km
SE of Guaymas. The geographical separation of the two taxa, as
currently documented, is approximately 100 km. Machaer anther a
coulteri is found in an area from 50 km N to 55 km SE of Guaymas
and is sympatric with M. cnspa.
From the material studied by Turner (1986 and subsequently)
justifying the transfer of Machaer anihera anda to a variety of
M. coulteri because of putative hybridization between the two, 19
sheets were sent for re-evaluation of my taxonomic treatment. Two
were M. coulten (in agreement with annotations by Turner), eight
were M. anda (also in agreement), but nine were M. cnspa as I
define it. This last group was annotated by Professor Turner as
M. coulteri vars. coulteri (2 sheets) or arida (2 sheets) or as in-
termediates (4 sheets). Four of these [Hartman, et al. 3517, LL,
as M. coulten var. arida; Hartman, et al. 3516, 2 sheets, LL, as
intermediate; Powell & Averett 1524. LL, intermediate) are very
similar in leaf morphology and other features to specimens of M.
cnspa from Baja California Sur and I am convinced that they are
conspecific. The other specimens which I place in M. cnspa have
leaves which appear to be adapted to more xerophytic conditions
(thicker texture, more uniformly toothed, reduced size). Some are
from the vicinity of the good M. cnspa mentioned above, while the
remainder were collected near Guaymas. As I believe is true of M.
anda, I hypothesize that due to yearly fluctuations in precipitation,
the variation is due to phenotypic plasticity.
