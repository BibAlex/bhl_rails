1990 and Smith 1988 for a description and definition of bog habitat). The ten
bogs selected ranged in size from 0.2 to 2.5 ha and averaged about 1 ha, which
is typical for bogs we have surveyed and have measured on the ground in this
district (n = 35, mean = 0.9 ha, range = 0.1 to 4 ha). Elevation ranged from
80 to 90 m above sea level. Adjacent to each bog and upslope in the recharge
area were extensive pine woods, a typical community in the uplands of west
central Louisiana, in which Pinus palusiris is the dominant tree (see Smith
1988 and Piatt, ei al. 1988 for habitat description).
METHODS
We ran a transect through each of the bogs as close to its center (its widest
part) and for an equal distance into the adjacent upslope pine woods. The
length of each transect depended on the size of the bog. The longest was 91
m; the shortest was 30 m. All were 3 m wide. We sampled equal areas along
a straight line inside and outside each bog; e.g., for a 90 m transect, 45 m was
in the bog and 45 m was in the pine woods. The total area sampled was 2496
sq. m, half of which were in pine woods and half in bog. All trees over 1.5
m tall were identified and their dbh measured. The presence of shrubs and
saplings and type of ground cover were also noted.
RESULTS
Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3 summarize our main findings. Figure 1 shows
a typical pitcher plant bog in the study area.
There were 3.3 times as many trees in the pine woods (n = 118) as in the
bogs (n = 36). This translates into one tree per 11 sq. m in pine woods and
