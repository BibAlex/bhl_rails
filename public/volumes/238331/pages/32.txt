Harfman; Conspectus of Machaeranthera (Asteraceae: Astereae) 455
Acad. Arts 26:139. 1891. TYPE: MEXICO. Nuevo Leon: Sierra
Madre, near Monterrey, 15 Jun 1888, C.G. Pnngle 2238 (HOLO-
TYPE: GH!).
To these five taxa I would add the following, which are less well known
biosystematically.
Machaer anther a heterocarpa R.L. Hartman &: Lane, Brittonia 39:253.
1987. TYPE: U.S.A. Texas: San Patricio Co., Welder Wildlife
Refuge, ca. 2.4 km E of headquarters, 20 Oct 1973, R.L. Hartman
3785 (HOLOTYPE: KM!; Isotypes: NY!, TEX!).
Machaer anther a odysseus Nesom, Syst. Bot. 3:218. 1978. TYPE:
MEXICO. Nuevo Leon: Cerro Pena Nevada, ca. 5 km NE of moun-
tain locally known as Picacho Onofre or 35 km ENE of Doctor Ar-
royo, 28 Jul 1977, G.L. Nesom R5 8 5 with C. Wells (HOLOTYPE:
US [photo, RM!]; Isotypes: ENCB, GH, LL, MEXU, NCU, RM!,
TTC, US! [photo, RM]).
This section is diverse chromosomally. It appears to be based on x = 4,
as three taxa have n = 4. Machaer anther a heterocarpa with n = 3 is likely
derived through descending aneuploidy from M. tenuis, the tajcon with which
it was long confused, or a common ancestor (Hartman Sz Lane 1987). There
is no published chromosome count for M. gentryi, which is known only from
the type. It is most similar to the taxa (especially M. mexicana) with n =
4. FinaJly, two species, M. brevihngulata and M. odysseus, appear anoma-
lous, having a haploid number of n = 9. Based on general morphology and
chromosome number, it is quite likely that Aster pauciflorus Nutt., which was
treated as the sole member of Aster subgenus Alm,utaster hy Sundberg (1986),
belongs with the latter two taxa. Further study wiU be necessary to confirm
this disposition (Semple k Hartman, unpubl.). Interestingly, A. pauciflorus
(as A. hydrophyllus E. Greene) and A. npanus (= M. npana) were crossed
by Stucky k. Jackson (1975) to M. parvifloraoi section Anda. Consequently,
it is possible that none of the species used in the intergeneric crossing portion
of their study on DNA content and chromosome evolution in Astereae was
from outside the natural circumscription of Machaer anther a sections Anda
and Psilactis (Semple k, Hartman, unpubl.).
