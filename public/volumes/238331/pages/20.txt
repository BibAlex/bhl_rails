University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming 82071-3165 U.S.A.
ABSTRACT
A synopsis of Machaeranthera is presented with descriptions eind
keys where appropriate, synonymy, and discussion. The combination
Machaeranthera subgenus Sideranthus (Nutt. ex Nees) R.L. Hart-
man is made. The following new sections or sectional combinations
are recognized: Machaeranthera sections Arida R.L. Hartman, Ble-
pharodon (DC.) R.L. Hartman, Havardii (R. Jackson) R.L. Hart-
man, Sideranthus (Nutt. ex Nees) R.L. Hartman, and Stenoloba
R.L. Hartman. Other new combinations eire: Machaeranthera col-
oradoensis (A. Gray) Osterh. var. brandegei (Rydb.) T.J. Watson ex
R.L. Hartman, M. viscida (Wooton k Standley) R.L. Hartman, and
M. wigginsii (S.F. Blake) R.L. Hartman. Machaeranthera hetero-
phylla R.L. Hartman replaces Haplopappus rhizomatus M. Johnston
which would become a later homonym if transferred to MachaerantJiera.
KEY WORDS: Systematics, Aster, Asteraceae, Astereae, Hap-
lopappus, Machaeranthera.
The preparation of the Asteraceae of Mexico by B.L. Turner k G. Nesom
has prompted publication of the conspectus of Machaeranthera from my disser-
tation (Hartman 1976) to make available several new combinations and a new
name. All taxa are included except where otherwise noted. Subsequent (to
1976) modifications to the classification are indicated and recent references
provided where appropriate. A detailed revision of Machaeranthera section
Blepharodon with supporting data for the classification of the genus will be
published separately.
