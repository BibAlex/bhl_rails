Machaeranthera anzonica was based on specimens from Quito-
baquito Springs, Arizona which had been treated under M. anda
(Turner k Home 1964). The two species were said to differ in a
number of quantitative features of ray and disc florets (Jackson k
Johnson 1967), but overlap of statistical ranges for measurements
is considerable for nearly all the characters. Consequently, separa-
tion of the two would require calculation of statistical means. Since
deUmitation of taxa is based on morphological gaps, not statistical
means, this is a very unrealistic approach in systematics. Further,
since other collections from the type locality of M. anzonica are
essentially identical to M. anda, the two are here considered con-
specific.
According to Ray Jackson (pers. comm.), "the type of M. an-
zonica is a woody-based perennial" [which is true] "found on a
rocky area about the hillside origin of Quitobaquito Springs," and
