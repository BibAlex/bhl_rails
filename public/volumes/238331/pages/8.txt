Kartesz & Gandhi: North American nomenciature-JJ 425
ROSACEAE
Erythrocoma canescens E. Greene is characterized by leaves dentate at
apex; bracteolcs shorter than sepals; hypanthium hemispheric or sunken at the
base in flower; styles elongating in fruit, plumose at the base, glabrous above,
hardly geniculate. P. A. Rydberg (North Amer. Fl 22:409. 1913) transferred
this species to the genus Sieversia Willd.; however, in modern treatments,
these two genera are considered as synonyms of the genus Geum L.
C.L. Hitchcock (1961; p. 113) treated Erythrocoma canescens as a synonym
of Geum triflorum Pursh var. ciliatum (Pursh) Fassett. For the North Amer-
ican flora, we treat E. canescens as a variety of G. trtflorum. This variety is
differentiated from the var. ciliatum^ with the latter characterized by its dis-
sected leaves and by its bracteoles being longer than the sepals. The following
new combination is proposed here:

SAPOTACEAE
The genus Sideroxylon L. {sens, strict.) is characterized by having entire
corolla lobes, whereas the genus Bumelia Sw. [sens, strict.) is characterized
by 3 segmented corolla lobes. For the North American flora, we recognize
Sideroxylon {sens, lat), including Bum,elia (based on priority) and propose
the following new combinations.
