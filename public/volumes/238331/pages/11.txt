ABSTRACT
Bogs and adjacent pine woods were sampled in the Kisatchie Na-
tional Forest, Louisiana, to determine size aind density of trees. There
were more than three times as many trees in pine woods as in bogs,
and the trees in pine woods were more than twice the diameter of those
in bogs. The pine woods had little imderstory except a few shrubs;
whereas the bogs had a dense species rich herbaceous groimd cover.
KEY WORDS: Pitcher plant bog, Sarracema, longleaf pine woods,
Pinus palustns^ Louisiana, Kisatchie National Forest.
INTRODUCTION
Little has been pubUshed regarding bogs west of the Mississippi delta
(Allen, et al 1988; Bridges k Orzell 1989; Nixon k Ward 1986; MacRoberts
k MacRoberts 1988, 1990). To rectify this situation we have undertaken a
number of descriptive studies of Louisiana pitcher plant bogs. In this paper
we describe size distribution and density of trees in bogs and in adjacent pine
woods, a subject about which the literature says little or nothing. Most papers
dealing with the floristics or ecology of bogs give either a brief description that
indicates that trees are scarce and stunted or a photograph that clearly shows
that bogs are open habitat (e.^., Wieder, et al. 1981). We know of only one
paper that specifically addresses bog trees (Streng k Harcombe 1982). Our
purpose is to quantify our impression of the low tree productivity of bogs.
STUDY SITE
Thirtyfive bogs are known to us in the Kisatchie District, Kisatchie Na-
tional Forest, Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana. In October and November 1989,
ten were selected on the basis of certain criteria that had no a prion relation-
ship to the problem under investigation (see MacRoberts k MacRoberts 1988,
