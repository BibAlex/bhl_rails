ELECTRIC AXB GAS ILLUMINATION. 583
manufacturing, the English report includes purifying, salaries, the
wages for carbonizing, and wear and tear, which latter item has al-
ready been carried to the plant account. The first of these amounts
to 1-82 cent ; the second -82 of a cent, and the third to 7 '16 cents,
making a total of 9-8 cents per 1,000 feet. This is probably much
below the actual amount paid for these items in American works, but
I am assured on excellent authority that, in works constructed after
the best modern models, purification should cost the gas company
nothing, and that all labor in the manufacturing department should be
covered by an outlay equiralent to one man's wages (82.50 per day)
for each 40,000 feet of gas made per day. As the same amount of
labor would have to be paid for each day in the year as on the days of
greatest demand, this would amount, for a daily make of 1,000,000
feet, to 25 men whose wages at $65 per month (2Gx24-) would be
$19,500 * a year, or 9f cents per 1,000 feet of the actual make. Includ-
ing the cost of purification, and calling the amount 12 cents, we shall
not be far wrong, or at least shall not exceed the actual outlay in the
average works of this size. In the case of electricity the labor re-
quired at each station would be :
One chief-engineer 6125 per month.
Three assistants (at STo) 225 "
Five firemen (at §60) 300 "
Total 8G50
— making 815,600 a year for the whole manufacturing plant, and 7'8
cents per 1,000 feet. To this may be added \\ cent to cover salary
of electrician and incidental labor, bringing the item up to 9 cents.
There remains to be considered the cost of the coal in the case of
gas, and the expense of running the engines in the case of electricity.
The cost of coal per 1,000 feet of gas made was, in the case of the Lon-
don companies, ^^{{'j^ cents, corresponding to $3.51 per ton, the make
of gas being for this amount of coal 9,529 feet. This was offset by
the sale of residuals, as below :
Coke and breeze 11-16 cents.
Tar and products 7-13 "
Ammonia and products 5'72 "
Total 2 100 "
— which leaves 12"8 cents as the net cost of the coal.
Compared with foreign companies, both in England and on the
Continent, but very little is done with the residual products in litis
country, and the amounts received vary greatly between different
works. Reliable data on this point can not be obtained, but under the
most favorable conditions this item can not be taken as amounting to
* The cndneer furnishing the information on which this statement is basel informs me
that this should be §12,500, or §2.50 per 40,000 feet of tlic actual yearly, instead of the
maximum daily, make. This would reduce the item 9j- cents to '6\ cents per 1,000 feet.
