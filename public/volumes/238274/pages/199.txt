stances, but one or two examples will suffice. Perhaps the most
familiar vegetable product is starch, certainly interesting since it
enters so largely into the daily food of the world. Let us make a
thin section of a common potato and examine it for a moment (Fig. 7).
See what a multitude of tiny spheres and ellipsoids crowd the cells !
If we apply to our section iodine, we introduce the test of color.
The little solids take on a bright-blue tint, and so prove themselves

starch. Now we can see why the potato forms so nutritious an article
of diet. During fall and winter starch-grains, such as we have just
seen, fill the cells of apple-twigs and of branches of various kinds, and
form the basis for that lavish expenditure of plant-force by which our
orchards and woods are made glorious in the sudden inflorescence of
spring.
If we make a section of the petiole of a begonia-leaf, we may find
cell-contents as remarkable as beautiful. Here are plainly crystals
with their symmetrical, angular outline. Some of the mineral sub-
stances brought through the plant by currents ascending from the roots
have found room in the cells of the leaf-stalk to shoot the rays of
minute crystals, and here the crystals lie, sometimes a dozen jewels in
a single setting (Fig. 8).
But the interest attaching to plant-cells does not culminate in chlo-
rophyl, nor yet in starch-grains and crystals. The chlorophyl, as we
have seen, owes its allegiance to the light, the starch to the chlorophyl,
and the crystals to the water and the soil ; but back of all this, and
behind all this, though intimately united with it all, is that which owes
its homage to none of these — which moves all, controls all, uses all,
builds the cell-wall, and inhabits it — is, indeed, the active principle by
which chlorophyl becomes efficient, by which the inorganic is lifted
