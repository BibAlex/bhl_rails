THE PAST AND PRESEXT OF CUTTLE-FISHES. JS7
stalks in the ten-armed cuttle-fishes, hut are unstalked in the eight-
armed species. Each sucker (Fig. 2) exhibits all the structures inci-
dental to an apparatus adapted to secure effective and instantaneous
adhesion to any surface. It consists of a horny or
cartilaginous cup {a), within which are muscular ^■^—^
fibers converging toward its center, where they ^/0^$%^ ^ 7
form a well-defined plug or piston (b). By the l^^^^^y^a

most efiicient kind. In some cuttle-fishes, and most
notably in the so-called "hooked squids" (Owjchoteict/u's), the pistons
of the suckers are developed to form powerful hooks, by means of
which the prey may be secured with additional facility ; and in the
common squids the margin of the sucker is provided with a series of
minute horny hooks. The " arms " themselves, it need hardly be re-
marked, are extremely mobile ; they are highly muscular, and can be
adapted with ease to the varied functions of prehension and move-
ment they are destined to subserve. As regards their arrangement,
they are arranged in four pairs — a dorsal and a ventral pair, and two
lateral pairs ; the two elongated tentacles, when developed, being
situated between the third and fourth pairs of arms on the ventral or
lower surface.
The alimentary tract or digestive system of the cuttle-fish race is
in every respect of well-developed and complete character. Lower
down in the molluscan series the commissariat department is subserved
by a very perfect digestive apparatus, including representatives of
most of the organs familiar enough to us in higher or vertebrate ex-
istence. In the cephalopods we should naturally expect the standard
of lower molluscan organization to be further elaborated ; and this
anatomical expectation is justified by the actual details of cuttle-fish
structure. The mouth opens on the upper surface of the head — a dis-
position of matters already accounted for when considering the rela-
tions of the cuttle-fish body to that of other mollusks. The mouth-
opening is usually bounded by a raised lip, and leads into a cavity
containing an elaborate apparatus, analogous to the jaws of higher
animals, and by means of which the food of these animals is triturated
and divided. An inspection of the masticating apparatus of a cuttle-
fish readily solves the c^ucstion, "How are the hard shells of their
