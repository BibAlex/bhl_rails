THE PAST A^^D PEESEXT OF THE CUTTLE-FISHES.*
Br Dr. AXDEEW \YILS0X.
FEW groups of the animal kingdom possess a greater interest,
either for the zoologist or for the general investigator, than that
selected as the subject of the present article. From the earliest ages
in which human curiosity concerning external nature began to develop
into scientific observation, the cuttle-fishes have formed subject-matter
of remark. In the writings of the classic naturalists they receive a
due meed of attention. Their peculiarities of form and habits at-
tracted the notice of Ai'istotle and Pliny ; and even their develop-
ment, in its more readily observed phases, was studied in the days
wlien biology was but an infantile science. Tracing the lines of cut-
tle-fish lore onward through the centuries of growing culture, we dis-
cern the mediaeval spirit of exaggeration and myth seizing upon the
group as a likely subject for enlargement and discussion. In the fabu-

I0U8 history and " folk-lore " of zoology, the cuttle-fishes have over and
over again played a more than prominent part. In the days of their
mythical history they have swallowed whole fleets of ships ; they have
been credited more than once with the destruction of even an armored
navy ; and on more than one occasion there can be little doubt that
they have played the parts of Sindbad's floating island, and of the
"great unknown," the sea-serpent itself. To the modern zoologist,
however, eager in his search after the causes which have wrought out
the existing order of animal nature, the cuttle-fishes present themselves
as an unusually interesting group.
