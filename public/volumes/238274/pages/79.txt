given to the Royal Institution in the spring of 1868, and were after-
ward greatly enlarged and published in a work, ' The Origin of Civil-
ization and the Primitive Condition of Man," which has passed through
five editions, and, like his former work on prehistoric man, has been
translated into the French, German, Italian, Danish, Russian, Hunga-
rian, Dutch, Swedish, and other languages. It has also gone through
two American editions, and has given rise to considerable controversy
which has been called forth by the antagonism of some of its views to
the prepossessions of a large proportion of its readers. It must have'
cost the author an enormous amount of labor, and is, aside from the
theories it enunciates, a most serviceable work of reference, offering a
nearly exhaustive array of facts which it would be impossible for any
student to obtain for himself, drawn from a mass of authorities the
mere list of which would fill a considerable space. In this work the
Darwinian doctrine is applied in tracing the development of the social
and mental condition of savages, their arts, their system of marriage
and of relationship, their religions, languages, moral character, and
laws. It sustains the belief that " the law of humanity is not degen-
eracy, but progression ; not the falling away from a primitive state of
perfection, but the gradual amelioration and advance toward a higher
and better condition," To be more particular, the author maintains
the conclusions that " existing savages are not the descendants of civ-
ilized ancestors ; that the primitive condition of man was one of utter
barbarism ; and that from this condition several races have independ-
ently raised themselves." This work was one of the first attempts to
treat the origin of civilization on a rational and philosophic basis, and
has been pronounced " the completest summary of barbaric life that
we possess,"
These books form, however, but a small part of Sir John Lubbock's
scientific writings, which include besides numerous papers in the trans-
actions of learned societies, and in the scientific and antiquarian jour-
nals, the list of which is constantly growing, and the editing from the
original manuscript of the treatise of the nonagenarian Svend Nilsson
on " The Stone Age of Sweden,"
The labors of Sir John Lubbock in behalf of the preservation of
the ancient monuments of Great Britain and Ireland may be con-
sidered in connection with his scientific work, although they have been
carried on chiefly in Parliament, and under the form of appeals to the
public. They have found shape in the well-known Ancient Monu-
ments Bill, which jDassed a second reading three times, but was finally
lost in the House of Lords. This bill was based upon the princii^le
" that, if the owner of one of these ancient monuments wishes to de-
stroy it, he should be required, before doing so, to give the nation the
option of purchase at a fair price." For this purpose, it proposed to
create a body of commissioners especially charged with the protection
of the ancient monuments, and so commended itself to all persons in-
