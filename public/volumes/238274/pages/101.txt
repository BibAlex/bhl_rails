POPULAR MISCELLANY.
Purification of tlie Boston ffater-Snp-
ply, — The water with which the city of Bos-
ton is supplied became affected last October
by a peculiar and disagreeable taste and
odor which made it unpalatable, and justi-
fied much complaint on the part of citizens.
The taste was quite accurately described as
a " cucumber-taste," from its resemblance
to the taste of water which has stood in
contact with cucumbers. In a milder form
it was called a " fish-oil taste." After sev-
eral efforts to determine its origin, Professor
Ira Remsen, of Baltimore, was called in to
give the subject a thorough examination.
He, after patient investigation and experi-
ments, which failed to discover the cause of.
the odor in other matters, determined its
source, by the most satisfactory tests, to be
the decomposition of a fresh-water sponge
{Spongilla j!uvia(ilis), that was found quite
abundantly in the mud of the bottom of
Farm Pond, the water of which was most
offensive. Measures have been taken to
free the pond from the cause of impurity.
The Dessian Fly. — From a monograph
published by Professor A. S. Packard, Jr.,
through the United States Entomological
Commission, it appears that the losses from
the Hessian fly are greatest in the grain-
raising areas of the Middle and Northwest-
ern States and the adjoining regions of Can-
ada, while the New England States have
been comparatively free from its attacks,
probably because so little wheat is culti-
vated in them. Xo statistics as to the loss-
es have ever been collected, but they have
been sufficient to occasion much conster-
nation and alarm in certain years. Two
