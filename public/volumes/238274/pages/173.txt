its manifestations are associated, by passing into a new state, or ncAv
conditions of activity, of which science takes no cognizance. Thus
considered, mind, in its ultimate analysis, becomes a purely spiritual
entity which can never be dissolved and commingled with the hetero-
geneous forces of the material world.
ABOUT THE MOLDS.
THE molds represent an immense variety of minute plants that
grow upon a great number of objects, and under different cii'cum-
stances. The spores from which they are developed are borne in the
ail", imperceptibly to us because of their extreme littleness. The mi-
croscopic examination of them reveals some very curious dispositions
and forms, always worthy of admiration. We often, in the spring,
perceive blades of grass covered with a chalk-like dust, so white that
one is at first sight inclined to take it to be hoar-frost. On examining
it with a microscope of small power, we shall perceive a real forest of
minute plants. Little bundles of very delicate filaments, clear and
crystalline, composed of roundish cells connected together, rise from a
net-work of other branching filaments, which are collectively called the
mycelmm (Fig. 1). These curious organisms are the first phases of a
parasitic plant belonging to the great order of the cryptogams, or a
