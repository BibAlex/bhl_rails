not now here existing." He reviews all the
products from which sugar is obtained or is
expected to be obtained, in order to discover
which one presents the most hopeful open-
ing for enterprise. His conclusions are,
that sorghum offers a difficult problem from
a financial point of view ; that amber-cane
is a little more satisfactory, but not sat-
isfactory enough ; that the cultivation of
corn-stalks for sugar would exhaust the
soil ; that sugar-cane can not supply the
home demand ; that the maple can do this
no better ; that the expectation of obtain-
ing sugar from sweet-potatoes is delusive,
and that of getting it from white potatoes
more so. Water-melons deserve more con-
sideration, but they are declared to be in-
ferior to the sugar-beet; and the last is
pronounced " the only possible plant which
can supply the Xorth with sugar." The
question remains, whether beet-sugar can
be made profitably without the artificial
stimulus of protection. If not, we had
better continue to raise what we can derive
a profit from without artificial aid, and buy
our sugar where we can get it cheapest

SiiALL-pox. By Joseph F. Edwards,
31. D. Philadelphia : P. Blakiston, Son
& Co. Pp. 80. Price, 50 cents.
The energy of the opposition manifested
by a considerable number of persons against
vaccination has induced the author to make
his own independent study of the question.
He has gathered information from all avail-
able sources and considered the arguments
on both sides, as he presents them here, and
has become convinced that in vaccination
properly performed, and in that only, we
can find immimity from small-pox. He at-
taches much importance to anticipating the
opposition that may arise and spread in this
country, as it has done in England.

Sir John Lubbock's charming little book
on " Ants and Bees " will be the next vol-
ume of the " International Scientific Series,"
and is now in press, to be very shortly is-
sued. It will contain much new, fresh, and
entertaining matter on a subject always full
of interest. Sir John has been many years
a close observer of the habits of these little
creatures, and his volume will therefore not
be a second-hand compilation, but an origi-
nal contribution to the most romantic aspect
of natural history.
The entertaining sketches entitled " The
Mountains of the Moon " ; or. Chronicles of
Hakim Ben Sheytan, concerning a curious
African people, of which we have printed
some representative installments in the
" Monthly," is now being copiously illus-
trated for separate publication in a volume.
