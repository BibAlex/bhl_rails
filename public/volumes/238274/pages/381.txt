POPULAR MISCELLANY.
The Groat Tolosccpc .at Princeton. â€” The
new telescope for the Ilalsted Observatory
at Princeton has been mounted within the
past few weeks, and is now ready for work.
In magnitude it ranks at present as fourth
among the great refracting telescopes of the
world, and second in the United States. Its
only superiors in size are the Vienna re-
fractor, of twenty-seven inches diameter,
the telescope of the Naval Observatory at
Washington, twenty-six inches in diame-
ter, and the telescope of Mr. Newhall, at
Newcastle, in England, which has an aper-
ture of twenty-five inches. A number of
still larger instruments are indeed under
construction, but it will be some time before
any of them are actually in place. The
object-glass of the Princeton telescope is
twenty -three inches in diameter, and has a
focal length of thirty feet. The glass disks
were cast by Fell, in Paris, but the telescope
was made by Alvan Clark & Sons, of Cam-
bridge. Though the telescope is a little
smaller than the Washington equatorial, its
mounting is considerably heavier and firmer,
and is improved in many respects. The
regulator of the driving-clock is unusually
powerful, and, to prevent friction and wear
of its pivots, its shaft is floated in mercury.
The clamps and slow-motions are all man-
aged without removing the eye from the
eye-piece, and the declination circle is also
read from the eye-end by a new and ingen-
ious arrangement of the makers. The ob-
ject-glass is peculiar in having its two lenses
separated by a space of about seven inches,
so as to allow a free circulation of air be-
tween them, thus greatly diminishing the
disturbing effect of changes of temperature.
This construction secures also freedom from
the " ghosts " (formed by reflection between
the lenses) which are so troublesome in
many large instruments. The curves of the
lenses are not those usually employed, but
are somewhat like those of the Gaussian
system, though not so deep. The color and
spherical aberration are very perfectly cor-
rected, and the performance of the glass, so
far as can be judged from a few nights'
work, is extremely fine. The instrument is,
of course, provided with all the usual mi-
crometers, eye-pieces, and other accessories,
but as its chief occupation, for the present
at least, is to be in the line of stellar spec-
troscopy, special attention has been given
to the spectroscope, which is the most pow-
erful ever made for star-work. It is a direct-
v'.sion instrument, on the plan of that used
for some years back at Greenwich, though
much larger. It was constructed by Ililgcr,
of London, under the kind supervision of
Jlr. Christie (the present Astronomer Uoyal),
in accordance with his own designs. It has
