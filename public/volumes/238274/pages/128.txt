ZUNI SOCIAL, MYTHIC, AND RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS. 189
tional rituals, prayers, songs, and sacred epics of this led Jed for a
comprehensive idea of their mythology. Knowledge gained from
both these sources may in turn be vastly added to, strengthened, and
corrected by a close study of their most abundant and beautifully
imaginative folk-lore.
Supreme over all the gods of Zuiii is Sano ona loilona, or holder
of the roads of light, corresponding to the earthly j^eZ.'ioe/z a, or priest of
the sun, and represented by the sun itself. Beneath him is a long line
of gods so numerous that I know not half their names, nor have I re-
corded them, but they are divided into six great classes : the celestial
or hero gods (the demon-gods themselves perhaps the vestiges of a
more ancient hero-god mythology), the elemental gods, or the gods of
the forces of nature, the sacred animal gods, or the Jcia pin a hdi and
kia she ma a hdi, the gods of prey or xcemar a hdi, and the tutelary
gods, or divinities of places. While Hano ona wilona is supreme over
all, he himself, like the earthly sun-priest, is limited by his own high-
priests among the gods â€” the celestial or hero gods, and they, m turn,
by the demon-gods, while the two earthly offices of head political and
war chiefs are represented, on the one hand, by the raio or water-
wantings beings, or animal gods ; and, on the other, by the icenidr a
hdi, or gods of prey, while the priests of the night in the human or-
ganization {thioi-na-proa-a shi-wa-ni) seem to be represented by the
tutelar gods of the deistic organization. Kot less important, then,
because they are supposed to act in connection with the latter, are the
ancients, or spirits of the ancestors, who form the body-politic of this
great system of gods, and are supposed to serve as mediators between
the mortals and the gods. In Zuiii belief they have also a definite
place of residence assigned to them, notwithstanding which they are
supposed to hold constant communion, even to the extent of occasional
materialization with those whom they have left behind, to listen atten-
tively to their prayers, and to represent them in some vague way to
the higher gods of the Zuui mythology.
"While this great system of gods, like the Jed Jed, is organized, as a
whole, not unlike the ecclesiastical and martial systems of the Zuiiis,
so also has each one of the six systems of gods, like each of the six
estufas of the Zuiiis, its offices of high-pi-iests, priests of the house or
temple, warrior-priests, etc. As an example of this special organiza-
tion, let me speak of the gods of the ocean, who under specific names
and attributes are further distinguished as " our beloved Pe Jewi we, or
sun-priest of the ocean ; our beloved the ona ya na Je'ia a sJii xoa ni,
or priests of the temples of the ocean ; our beloved mother, the JCo
haJc o Je'ia, or the goddess of the white shells ; our beloved, the three
great warrior-priests of the ocean, Jeia cJila tea ni, kic pisJi tai a, and
tsi Je'ia Jidi a, in whom we do not fail to recognize the two mastci--
priests of the bow, and the third priests of the bow, or head warrior-
chief of the martial organization. The lesser personages of Zuiii
