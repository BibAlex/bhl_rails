American Forestry. — An ^Vmcrican Con-
gress of Forestry was held in Cincinnati,
beginning April 25tb, of which the Hon.
George 13. Loring, Commissioner of Agri-
culture of the United States, was chosen
President for the year. Ten State and Pro-
vincial organizations, one of which embraces
the Canadian Provinces, were recognized,
and sections were constituted, as follows :
A. Uses of Forests ; Dr. Franklin B. Hough,
President. B. Conservation of Forests ; Dr.
John A. Warder, President. C. Influences
of Forests, Injurious and Beneficial ; Pro-
fessor William Saunders, President. D. Ed-
ucational Means ; Professor N. P. Egleston,
President. Professor William Saunders, of
London, Ontario, read a paper on " Insects
affecting Forest-Trees," in which he con-
sidered the various means of preventing and
remedying insect depredations. Dr. George
Yasey, of Washington, D. C, read a paper
on " The Distribution of Conifers in the
United States," and was followed by a
discussion on resonant trees, in which the
American cypress was declared to be far
superior for musical instruments to any
foreign wood. Mr. Hough gave an account
of what had been done by the State of New
York in the matter of the Adirondack Park,
after which resolutions were adopted ap-
proving the policy of establishing the park,
and recommending the adoption of similar
measures by other States. Jlr. Ycrplanck
Colvin presented a paper on " The Decay
and Preservation from Decay of Wood,"
in which the merits of several preservative
substances were considered. Professor Lane
read a paper on "The Importance of Ex-
perimental Stations of Forestry," and the
Congress recommended the establishment of
such stations, to be under the care of the
agricultural colleges, with a central station.
In a paper on "The Profits of Durable
Trees," Dr. A. Furness, of Danville, Indiana,
showed that an investment of §50 for one
acre of land and 825 for tree-plants had re-
turned him in sixteen years a clear profit over
all expen.se3 and taxes of $1,048. Mr. C.
David, of Madison, Indiana, read a few notes
" On the Natural Growth of Forest-Trees "
which had given him in about thirty years
upon an originally bare prairie, a wood of
