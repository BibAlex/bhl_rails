" Wcnn ein Kopf und cm Buck zxisammenstossen, und es klingt hold, muss es denn immer
das Bucli yevicsen sein ? " — Lichtexberg, the Physicist.
THE above title is prefixed to an article contributed by Professor
Simon Newcomb to the April number of tbe " International Re-
view." The avowed object of that article is to discredit a recent vol-
ume of the " International Scientific Series" (" The Concepts and
Theories of Modern Physics ") as a publication unworthy of the com-

ignorant of the subject whereon he writes — as a scientific, or rather
unscientific, "charlatan" and "pretender" belonging to the class of
" paradoxers " whom Professor De Morgan has immortalized in his
famous " Budget." I am fully aware that, as a rule, it is both unwise
and in questionable taste for an author to make direct reply to criti-

find their vindication, at last, in its contents, and the chief function
of the critic is to bring them to the attention of the reader, the value
and spirit of the critical performance being of secondary importance.
But the case in hand appears to-roe to be an exceptional one. The
unmistakable intent of Professor Newcomb's " criticism " (and, if it
be left unchallenged, its probable effect) is to signalize the contents of
the book with which he deals as mere drivel, and unworthy of a mo-
ment's serious attention. And he writes for a magazine, the majority
of whose readers, however intelligent they may be, can hardly be ex-

which is a necessary prerequisite to the formation of an independent
and trustworthy judgment. All they are likely to know and care is,
