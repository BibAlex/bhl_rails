Experiments in Ensilage. — Professor W.
A. Ilenry, of the Experimental Farm of the
University of Wisconsin, has published a
report of an experiment in ensilage that
was made last year under his direction. A
pit was made, thirty feet long by fifteen
wide and fifteen deep, with thick stone
walls, at a cost of $413.12, and was filled
to near the top with a crop of fodder-corn
that had been raised and cut up for the
purpose, weighing 150,222 pounds, and at
the top with second-crop clover just as it
came from the field, all under the inspection
of many visitors who had been invited to
witness the process. " The comments,"
says Professor Henry, " were as varied as
the visitors. As the weather was very
warm the ensilage heated rapidly, and when
the visitor would run his hand down into
the mass of damp-cut fodder, and find it so
hot as to be uncomfortable, there would
sometimes come a shake of the head and
prediction of failure of some sort : ' It will
burn the barn up ' ; ' May keep below, but
will not on top ' ; ' Think it will be all right
above where it can get some air, but below
it will make a nice manure-heap.' " The
silo was loaded down with an unusual
weight of stones, in order to bring the
more pressure to bear upon the long and
matted clover-stalks ; for the efficacy of the
operation depends upon the prevention of
heating by cutting off the access of fresh
air. After the pit was closed, but little
evidence of the change within was seen,
only occasionally a just discernible but not
at all marked odor. When the silo was
opened, November 29th, the clover was
partly decayed for about a half -inch down,
and moldy for two or three inches below
and around the sides of the pit. This was
thrown out to be put on the manure-heap.
The cows were a little shy of eating the
ensilage at first, but after four or five feeds
all ate it as naturally as they would hay.
