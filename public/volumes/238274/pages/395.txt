1. Transformed epidermis constitutes the armor of the lobster, in-
sects, and hard-skinned articulates in general. Also the hair of mam-
mals, the feathers of birds, the scales which cover most fishes, reptiles,
and the legs of birds, and the plates of that lizard-like mammal, the

of mollusks, the tests of sea-urchins, star-fishes, etc. ; also those of the
chalk-forming rhizopods, and the silica shells of other microscopic ani-
mals. 3. True hoyiy armor produced by the skin ; as the coat-of-mail
of the armadillo, and the scale-armor of the ganoid fishes, the bony
pike and sturgeon, for example (also the armor of the group to which

belong the trunk-fishes. This sort of armor was very common among
the most ancient fishes, but it has now gone quite out of fashion.
The crocodile and alligator still have this bone armor in great per-

into a ball with the improtected parts inside. 4. In the turtles the
