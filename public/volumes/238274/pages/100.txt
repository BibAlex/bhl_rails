LITERARY NOTICES.

Publications of the Massachusetts In-
stitute OF Technology, and of its Of-
ficers, Students, and Alumni. 1862-
1881. Compiled by William Ripley
Nichols, S. B. Boston: A. A. King-
man. Pp. 50.
The list is intended to include the
books, pamphlets, reports, and contribu-
tions to periodicals (excepting daily jour-
nals) printed during the time included within
its scope, by the Institute officials and its
affiliated societies and associations ; by pro-
fessors and other instructors during their
connection with the school ; by special
students during their connection with the
school ; and by alumni and holders of cer-
tificates of proficiency during their connec-
tion with the school and in after-life. The
list is of considerable size, covers a variety
of subjects, literary and scientific, includes
many titles from foreign journals, and is
creditable to the institution and to American
research.
The Science of Mind. By John Bascom,
author of " The Principles of Psychol-
ogy," " Comparative Psychology," etc.
G. P. Putnam's Sons. Pp. 462. Price,
$2.
The first tiling to be said about Dr. Bas-
com'a various philosophical works is that
the handling of the subjects is his own, and
in stamping upon them the individuality of
his own mind he gives them a new and at-
tractive interest. And that freedom and
freshness which he maintains in his methods
of statement are to no small degree pre-
served in the elucidation of his views. He
is in no sense either a compiler or a servile
expositor of established opinions, but he is
an independent (we had almost said a free)
thinker upon his chosen themes of study.
Although by no means always up to the
times, he is always in a progressive way,
and moves as fast, perhaps, as the circum-
stances will allow. His present work, " The
Science of ilind," though avowedly and es-
sentially metaphysical, and standing squarely
upon intuitional or transcendental ground,
is still a very different book from its prede-
cessors of the same class, and shows that
the intelligent metaphysician is compelled
to yield to the advance of scientific knowl-
edge.
Dr. Bascom does not sympathize with the
current reproaches of metaphysical philoso-
phy, but recognizes that, like all other im-
perfect and difficult things, it may be and
must be practically improved. In his pref-
ace he says : " If asked why I hoped that
this volume might reward study, I should
answer, not because the system presented is
new, but because the statement it here re-
ceives is at once succinct and elaborate, is
strengthened by new points, by a consistent
maintenance of all that belongs to it, and by
the rejection of that which, essentially alien
to its principles, only embarrasses it. I
trust the intuitive philosophy will be found
hereby to have gained somewhat of that
proof which springs from completeness and
proportion of parts."
