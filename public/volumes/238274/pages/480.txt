MASSAGE: ITS MODE OF APPLICATIO]Sr A^^D
EFFECTS.
By DOUGLAS GEAIIAM, M. D.
" ~\ /f~ASSAGE," from the Greek masso (I knead or handle), is a term
-LÂ»-L now generally accepted to signify a group of procedures Avhich
are usually done with the hands, such as friction, kneading, manipu-
lating, rolling, and percussing of the external tissues of the body,
either with some curative, palliative, or hygienic object in view. Its
application should in many instances be combined with passive, resist-
ive, or assistive movements, and these are often spoken of as the so-
called Swedish movement-cure. There is, however, an increasing
tendency on the part of scientific men to have the word " massage "
embrace all these varied forms of manual therapeutics, for the reason
that the word "cure," attached to any form of treatment whatsoever,
can not always be applicable, inasmuch as there are many maladies that
preclude the possibility of recovery and yet admit of amelioration.
Hence the word " cure " may lead people to expect too much ; and, on
the other hand, the use of the word "rubbing" in place of "massage"
tends to undervalue the apj^lication and benefit of the latter, for it is
but natural to suppose that all kinds of rubbing are alike, differing
only in the amount of force used.
According to the requirements of individual cases, massage may
be of primary importance or of secondary importance, of no use at all,
or even injurious. Concerning the extent of its usefulness, it may
with safety be said that, at tolerably definite stages in one or more
classes of affections in every special and general department of medi-
cine, evidence can be found that it has proved either directly or in-
directly beneficial, or led to recovery, sometimes when other means
had been but slowly operative, or apparently had failed altogether.
