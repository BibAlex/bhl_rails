PLANT-CELLS AND THEIR CONTENTS.

The unicellular hairs found on young leaves of Ycrlena urtlcifoUa,
a common way-side weed, exhibit something like a nucleus at the base
of the hah-, from which center streams of protoplasm are constantly
departing, to which they constantly return (Fig. 13). Fig. 14 shows
the terminal cell of a hair taken from the petal of the purple lady's-

slipper. Here the nucleus seems almost to be in the way. It is so
large as nearly to close the narrow cell across from side to side, and
the current appears crowded between the nucleus and cell-wall.
In the hairs that cover the common tomato-plant we may find
beautiful transparent cells. In these cells sometimes the nucleus shows
a vacuole, and the streams are always fine and large, but changeful as
the shadows of passing clouds (Fig. 15).
But we must resort to plants belonging to the botanical order Cu-
curhitaeeoi to find hair-cells showing greatest activity. In the hairs
covering the forming bud of a common pumpkin-vine the cells are of
