a manner that their corresponding horizontal lines shall be on the
same level ; these panels are capable of sliding backward and forward
in grooves on the upright boards, D D'. The observer must place his
eyes as near as possible to the mirrors, the right eye before the right-
hand mirror, and the left eye before the left-hand mirror ; and he must
move the sliding-panels E E' to or from him, until the two reflected
images coincide at the intersection of the optic axes, and form an
image of the same apparent magnitude as each of the component pict-
ures,"
In using this stereoscope, of which a perspective view is given in
Fig. 4, the two conjugate pictures must be on separate cards, but may
be much larger than those which are now so extensively used with
more modern instruments. The arrangement is obviously such that
no side-images can be perceived, since it is impossible for either eye
to receive more than one image, and this is reflected from the oblique
mirror directly in front. As an instrument it is unwieldy and incon-
venient in comparison with those to which we are accustomed ; but

with it the great secret of binocular vision was brought into open day-
light. Wheatstone had the genius to find out how the door was to be
unlocked, and it was left for others to devise the special forms that
would be employed in making most acceptable to the world the treas-
ure which he had found. His predecessors had more or less distinct
conceptions of an hypothetical treasure, just as something was known
about the nature of steam before the low-pressure engine was invented,
