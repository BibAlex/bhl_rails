us examine this little shred with our microscope, using a lens of mod-
erate power. This is from the upper side of the leaf (Fig. 4). How
delicate the cell-walls, how beautiful the pattern ! Here is Kature's
best attempt at uniformity. All these cells serve identically the same
purpose, and, so far as we can see, might have been exactly alike.
Yet, while there is similarity, no two are just alike. Let us tear off
another shred of epidermis, this time from the lower surface of the

leaf. Here (Fig. 5) we have the same arrangement and forms of cells,
but more beautiful and varied outlines, and the cells are more inti-
mately interlocked. Our magnifying power is greater, and the cells
appear larger ; moreover, we have before us a few cells altogether un-
like any of their neighbors, little button-hole-like structures. These
are the storaata of the leaf, and through these tiny mouths— iox the
stomata are real openings through the epidermis — the exchange of
gases goes on between the growing plant and the surrounding atmos-
phere.
Let us now pass on a little further in our investigation of these
plant-cells and note the contents of some of them. In our examination
