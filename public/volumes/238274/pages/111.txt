146 THE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY.
that Professor Newcomb is a prominent scientist, at the head of a
scientific bureau in Washington; while the author of the book he pro-
fesses to review, if known at all, is known only in connection with
pursuits which are generally supposed to preclude, not only distinc-
tion but even rej^utable standing in the domains of scientific investi-
gation. I take the liberty, therefore, to subject the strictures of my
critic to a counter-critical examination, trusting that the learned pro-
fessor himself will find it thorough, and that the reader who has not
only perused his article, but also looked into a chapter or two of my
book, will recognize it as neither impertinent nor unfair.
Whatever may be thought of the soundness or unsoundness of the
general argument of the little book in question, the drift of that argu-
ment, it seems to me, can hardly be mistaken by the reasonably intelli-
gent reader. What I attempt to show is simply this : that modern
physical science aims at a mechanical interpretation of physical phe-
nomena, seeking to effect a reduction of them to two elements which
are ordinarily designated as matter and motion, but which (for reasons
briefly stated in the book, but to be stated more at length presently)
are more correctly designated as mass and motion. I then attempt to
show that, if to these premises we add the assumption of the atomic
constitution of matter, the mechanical theory necessarily involves four
distinct propositions, relating severally to the equality, inertia, and in-
elasticity of the atoms or ultimate molecules and the essentially ki-
netic character of what is now universally termed energy. In order to
enforce the irrecusability of these propositions on the basis of the
atomo-mechanical theory, and to guard against the imputation that I
am engaged in the frivolous pastime of chopping logic, I am at pains
to show, in the next four chapters, that every one of these proposi-
tions is insisted on and j^ropounded in terms identical with, or equiva-
lent to, those in which I state them, by men whom I was under the
delusion, up to the time of the apjDearance of Professor Newcomb's
article, of regarding as persons of the highest scientific authority â€”
such men as Professors Du Bois-Reymond, Thomas Graham, Wundt,
etc. I then proceed to inquire what is the relation of these proposi-
tions to the sciences of chemistry, physics, and astronomy, as they are
actually constituted, endeavoring to ascertain whether or not the funda-
mental propositions of the atomo-mechanical theory are available as
theoretical solvents of the facts with Avhich these sciences are con-
versant, and whether or not they are consistent with them. The result
of this inquiry is, that the man of science, however emphatic he may
be in the general assertion that all physical phenomena arc due to the
interaction of atoms or ultimate molecules, is constrained by the data
of scientific experience to repudiate and discard the propositions
which his assertion necessarily involves. It thus appears that there is
conflict between the facts and working hypotheses or theories of the
sciences on the one hand and the atomo-mechanical theory on the
