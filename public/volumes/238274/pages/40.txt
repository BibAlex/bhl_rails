THE STEREOSCOPE : ITS HISTORY.

Subjectively, therefore, our condition is not so very different from
that of the famous Cyclops. We have the advantage of being able to
see double, by adjusting conditions properly ; but, if sensation is to be
trusted, the object is duplicated while the eye is single, although by
other means we learn that the object remains single, and is only viewed
from two different stand-points at the same moment, while the sepa-

rate lines of du'ection for the two eyes meet elsewhere. By appropri-
ate muscular training the eyes may be directed, each slightly outward,
so that these lines meet behind the observer's head while the object,
apparently duplicated, is seen still in front. The recognition of the
subjective fusion of the two eyes into a Cyclopean, or central binocular
eye, is a fundamental prerequisite for the explanation of vision in the
stereoscope. In consequence of this, if two similar pictures are placed
close in front of the eyes, the distance between their centers being
equal to the distance between the pupils, they at once appear to coa-
lesce into a single picture. In this way an objective existence may
appear to be given to the binocular eye by approaching a mirror until
the nose touches the glass, and avoiding the convergence of visual
lines that would otherwise be natural. A narrow face is seen, possess-
