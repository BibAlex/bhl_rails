THE DEVELOPMENT OF CITIES.

hio-li^ay. Some cities are free to extend over the plain in any direc-
tion, while others are restricted to narrow valleys, or to islands of
which they cover the whole. The city of Cadiz, confined upon an
island, has very high houses, with terraces and lookouts, the object
being to reach a height where the air will be healthy and the rain-
water pure. St. Malo is built much after the same fashion, and the

streets in both cities are very narrow. Every one knows that the
principal highways in Venice are canals, and that the several islands
are traversed by prodigiously narrow and crooked streets. On the
other hand, the cities of Hungary extend over considerable spaces and
are thinly populated. The city of Maria Theresa, or Szabadka, for
instance, according to E. Reclus, covers a space of eight hundred and
ninety-six square kilometres, and is really nothing but a province cut
up by regular avenues, by the side of which houses stand at intervals
— an oasis of stone in the immense plain.
We may remark, with respect to the bearing of climate, that nar-
row and crooked streets protect the inhabitants against heat and against
colcl, but they foster the accumulation of miasms and prevent the cir-
culation of air. Cities tend to expand on the side from which the pre-
vailing winds come. It is the most pleasant side, because it is free
from the unhealthy emanations of the town.
