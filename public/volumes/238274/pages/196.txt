spheres ; some stretch away to the length of several feet, and some
are microscopic specks. In Fig. 3 we have the representation of a
beautiful marine alga, unicellular, and yet thirty inches or more in
length.
As we ascend the scale of life "\ve find the individual cell more sub-
ordinate to the organism as a whole, and so less complex in itself ; and

yet, when we examine the cells which make up the tissues of the best
plants we can find, the blooming occupants of our hot-houses, gai'dens,
and fields, we meet with marvelous diversity, and are soon made to
feel that variety of form is the law, uniformity the exception. Fig, 3
represents the appearance of a cross-section of a stem of Tradescantia.
From this section wc may learn not the variety of cell-forms only, but
something of the manner in which every plant is developed, and some-
thing of the porousness of all cellular structure.
But let us tear off with our forceps a little shred of the epidermis
of some leaf. The leaf from a petunia will do ; that of the wild
Jacob's-ladder is better, and that of the wake-robin better still. Let
