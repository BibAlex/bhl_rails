THE PHYSIOLOGY OF EXERCISE, 439
ically, we must conclude that in the struggle for existence those creat-
ures prevailed which, by exercise of their natural functions, casually
increased their fitness for those functions, or did this more than others,
and that the beings so favored transmitted this their happy gift to
their posterity for further increase. Thus originated an animal world
susceptible of exercise ; thus was originated natural selection itself, in
the exercise of an important aid ; finally, thus became the whole of
life, like the individual, a self-improving machine. Herr Ewald He-
ring was also led to the conclusion that " even those properties of an
organism may be transmitted to its posterity which it has not itself
inherited, but has appropriated to itself under the particular circum-
stances in which it has lived, and that, in consequence of this, every
organic being imparts to the germ that separates from it a small patri-
mony which it has acquired in the individual life of the mother organ-
ism and laid up for the grand inheritance of the whole race." The
more perfectly this conception agrees with the one just imfolded, the
more I am sorry that I can not follow Herr Hering when he repre-
sents the capacity of living beings to transmit acquired properties as
an original power of organic matter, and explains it as a power of
reproduction of the same kind with memory. To make the manifold
processes on which the difi'erent kinds of exercise depend the expres-
sion of an original power, appears to me to be rather a darkening than
an illuminating genei'alization. Herr Hering finds the tertium com-
2yarationis between the transmission of acquired bodily properties
and memory in reproduction. But I see no similarity between the
facile rolling-off of a definite molecular process iu the ganglion-cells
of the individual — which is memory — and the return in the offspring
of a molecular arrangement imposed, in consequence of external con-
ditions, upon the parent, which would be the transmission of acquired
properties ; and, if I did see a similarity, it would for me retire before
the distinction that, as the name ( Geddchtniss) indicates, memory is an
attribute only of thinking beings. Herr Hering's unconscious recollec-
tion is a side-piece to the idea which men since Plato, to the injury of
science, have suspected as a shaping force in the "great and little
world," or to the life-force, in the face of w4iich all the problems of
physics and chemistry should lie open. Unconscious recollection is,
moreover, not acceptable to me, because Herr Haeckel has eagerly
appropriated it, and given it an important part in his plastidule theory.
I hold this play with groundless analogies to be the more hazard-
ous^ since, finally, it can not be strongly enough sounded that the
transmission of acquired properties which we have thought of, with
Darwin, Herbert Spencer, Hering, and many others, as possible and
real under certain conditions, is proved, on further reflection, to be per-
fectly incomprehensible.
We are indeed indebted to the mechanical theory of gases for
more just conceptions of the minuteness and the number of molecules;
