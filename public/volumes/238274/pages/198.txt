PLANT-CELLS AND THEIR CONTENTS. 293
of the cells from the epidermis of the leaf no contents were apparent ;
in fact, the cells are tabular, very thin in proportion to their width,
and any contents they may possess are so nearly homogeneous as to
be transparent and invisible. But let us make a thin transverse sec-
tion of the same leaf. Here (Fig. 6) we find cells different in shape
from any we have yet seen, and evidently possessing different contents.
The cells from the inside of the leaf are here seen filled with tiny green ■
bodies, sometimes closely packed together,
sometimes scattered more sparsely. These /-'""'^ "~~~\.
little green bodies are the chlorophyl-gTSLU- X^g,^,,^^ r>T=»^ \

plant is diminished, and finally disappear
entirely when the plant is left in total darkness. Every one will recall
the appearance of potato-stalks where growth has started in some dark
corner of the cellar. Cells taken from such growth afford not a sign
of chlorophyl. Botanists tell us that the petals of flowers are only
altered leaves. In petal-cells, then, instead of chlorophyl-grains, we
find in some cases granules of yellow, sometimes of orange. Some-
times the cell contains no such granules, but rather some colored fluid,
red, blue, or purple, and then our flowers are tinted accordingly ; some-
times the cells of a petal contain air only, and then the flower is white.
But these tiny green grains in the leaf-cells do vastly more than
simply lend their color to the foliage ; they are readjusters and organ-
izers, and perform, in those diminutive laboratories we have been
calling cells, feats which the chemist strives in vain to rival. They
take possession of molecules of carbon dioxide and of water, compel
the binding chemical forces to relax their hold, combine again, to serve
the purposes of the plant, the atoms of carbon, of hydrogen, using
such part of the oxygen as may be necessary, and setting tlie remain-
der free in the open atmosphere — all this in the sunlight. The chloro-
phyl bodies thus work while it is day, have charge of nearly all
the income of the plant, and provide in themselves for the temporary
storage of its daily accumulations, mostly in the form of starch. When
the night comes, these same little factors give up at once their labors
and their stores, other cells of the plant begin to work, change and
transfer and change again, until all the wondrous series of vegetable
products with which we are familiar (the sugars, the oils, the alkaloids,
crystals of various forms and kinds) ai'c formed and properly deposited.
We might go on now to examine cells containing many of these sub-
