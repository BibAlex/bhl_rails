ABOUT THE MOLDS.

fungus. A mold that lias caused great damage to grape-vines — the
Oidlum Tucheri — is an incompletely developed fungus.
A whitish substance may be remarked on the leaves of lilacs near
the middle of the summer, which
might be regarded on superficial
observation as dust from the road.
It is also a mold. The microscope
shows it to be made up of very deli-
cate threads, similar to those of spi-
ders' webs. As these threads become
older, we may observe joined to them
a number of little spheroidal bodies,
some very small and white, others
larger and yellow, and others brown.
The white and yellow corpuscles are
young fruits of the fungus, and the
brown ones are ripened fruits. If
one of the last is put into a drop
of water and pressed between two
glasses for mounting microscopic
preparations, it will let escape some
small pyriform, transparent sacs,
each inclosing spores, the number
of which varies according to the
species, but is definite for each species. The arrangement of these
spore-containing sacs {sporcmgim) is shown by the vertical section (Fig.
4). The number of sporangim (6) contained in each of the fruits varies
in different species from one to twenty and more.
Aside from every scientific consideration, a great interest is given
to these plants by the beauty of their ornamentation ; and they form
choice objects for preparations. Around each receptacle may be seen
numerous ai)])endages radiating in every direction, and generally un-
colored. In some genera these appendages are long and flaky, while
other genera have only six or eight of them in the form of short needles
