possible also, when the stereoscopic displacement is so small, that not
the slightest duplication of images can be distinguished with even the
keenest vision. When this displacement is large, the play of the eyes
is necessary to the completeness of the jjerception ; but, in any case,
the illusion is complex. The perception of double images is doubtless
one important element ; but when these are too minute to be distin-
guished, we are driven to other resources for an explanation.
Every one has noticed that each instrument in an orchestra has its
own peculiar quality of sound, each singer in the cast of an opera his
own vocal timbre. The explanation of this is no longer a mystery
since Helmholtz analyzed, by the aid of resonators, what had eluded
analysis by the unaided ear, and showed that the difference in quality
between tones, nominally the same from different sources, is due to
minute modifications upon sensations, corresponding to small air- waves
accompanying those which produce the fundamental tone. By a well-
known system of graphic representation, let the curve in Fig. 17 stand
for the fundamental note ; if this be simple, the curve is perfectly
regular. But in fact it is accompanied by a groujj of smaller waves

(Fig. 18, a h)\ when all are graphically combined, the curve is modified
(Fig. 18, c d), and so is the actual sensation. With the same funda-
mental a different series of overtones would have produced a different
resultant ciirve and sensation. The first of these resultants may rep-
