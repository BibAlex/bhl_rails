it would flash into gas of a vastly inferior, but still of an elevated,
temperature. It is supposed that such fluid material, or material in
the " critical " condition, as Professor Thomas Andrews, of Belfast, has
named it, is continually transferred to the surface by means of convec-
tion-currents, that is to say, by currents forming naturally when a
fluid substance is cooled at its upper surface, and sinks down after
cooling to make room for ascending material at the comparatively
higher temperature. It is owing to such convection-currents that the
temperature of a room is, generally speaking, higher toward the ceil-
ing than toward the floor, and that upon plunging a thermometer into
a tank of heated water the surface temperature is found slightly supe-
rior to that near the bottom.
These convection-currents owe their existence to a preponderance
of the cooled descending over the ascending current ; but this differ-
ence being slight, and the ascending and descending currents inter-
mixing freely, they are, generally speaking, of a sluggish character ;
hence, in all heating apjiaratus, it is found essential to resort either to
artificial propulsion, or to separating walls between the ascending and
the descending currents, in order to give effect to the convective
transfer of heat.
In the case of a fluid sun another difficulty presents itself through
the circumstance that the vast liquid interior is enveloped in a gaseous
atmosphere, which, although perhaps some thousands of miles in depth,
represents a relatively very small store of heat. Convection-currents
may be supposed active in both the gaseous atmosphere and in the
fluid ocean below, but the surface of this fluid must necessarily con-
stitute a barrier between the two convective systems, nor could the
convective action of the gaseous atmosphere — that is to say, the simple
up and down currents caused by surface refrigeration — be such as to
disturb the liquid surface below to any great extent, because each
descending current would have had plenty of time to get intermixed
with its neighboring ascending current, and would, therefore, have
reached its least intensity on arriving on the liquid surface.
As regards the liquid, its most favorable condition for heating
purposes would be at the critical point, or that at which the slightest
diminution of superincumbent pressure would make it flash off into
gas ; but considering that, by means of conduction and convection, the
liquid matter must have assumed, in the course of ages, a practically
uniform temperature to a very considerable dcjDth, it follows that the
liquid below the surface, with fluid pressure in addition to that of the
superimposed gaseous atmosphere, must be ordinary fluid, the critical
condition being essentially confined only to the surface.
Conditions analogous to those here contemplated are met with in
a high-pressure steam-boiler, with its heated water and dense vapor
atmosphere. Suppose the fire below such a boiler be withdrawn, and
its roof be exposed to active radiation into space, what should we ob-
