PLANT-CELLS AND THEIR CONTENTS.*
By T. H. McBETDE.
PROFESSOR OF BOTA>T, STATE tryiVERSITT OF IOWA.
A CHILD'S toy-balloon may afford us an illustration of what a
natiiralist might call a typical cell. "We have in the toy simply
a closed sac thoroughly distended by its contents, more or less per-
fectly spherical in shape, and affording in outline or cross-section an
almost perfect circle. In the organic cell the sac is known as the
cell-wall, and whatever may be inclosed by the cell-wall is called the
cell-contents. A typical cell would be round, spherical, but very few
cells, as they occur in nature, are perfect spheres. A cell which may
be spherical at the outset may change its shape in accordance with
changing circumstances, so that we may say that the form of all cells
which we find united to form tissues varies with the situation which
such cells occupy, and the functions of the tissues themselves. This
we shall see more clearly as we go on. That vegetable tissues, as they
occur in wood, pith, leaves, flowers, and fruit, are entirely composed
of cells, may be easily demonstrated. All that is needed is, to take a
very thin slice of any of these substances and examine with a micro-
scope of moderate power, when the cellular structure becomes imme-
diately apparent. So, then, all the great variety of form and color, and
all the resulting beauty, which the vegetable kingdom affords, and all
the varied economic value of plants, depends upon the foi-m and con-
tents of these little organic units — of cells. INIore than this : those cells
are of the highest scientific interest. All the discussion of the past
few years in regard to spontaneous generation and the origin of life
has been a discussion of vegetable cells ; and very much of all that we
know about life, its activity and its mystery, has been derived from
