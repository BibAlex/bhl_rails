LONGEVITY. 589
The votes that killed Cavour and Disraeli probably revived La
3Iarmora and Gladstone, Success is a panacea ; a series of long-lived
rulers will generally be found to coincide with an era of national tri-
umphs, and a general increase of longevity with a period of material
progress, industrial development, good crops, etc., for, when " living "
is cheap, one man's success does not necessarily imply the short-coming
of his neighbor.
But, as Ludwig Borne says, *' to be happy is one of the cardinal
virtues " — there is such a thing as a gift of supporting vitality on an
accident-proof fund of good humor, a Mark-Tapley-like disposition to
exult in the disregard, or, at least, in the defiance, of bad luck. In
stress of circumstances, Hamlet's alternative may often depend upon
the possession of this accomplishment, for I believe that it is one of the
talents which can be cultivated. Not all men can attain to the j^hilo-
sophical eminence of Francis Fenelon, who valued gloomy days as a
foil to brighter ones ; but a step in the right direction is a resolute
contempt of trifling adversities, which leads to the habit of distinguish-
ing life from its incidents, the pilgrimage from the way-side vicissi-
tudes, and can be most easily acquired by keeping an ultimate goal in
view — not a supramundane one necessarily, but something elevated
enough to aid us in overlooking the base annoyances which beset all
but the loneliest by-ways of modern life. This devotion to a nobler
and enduring, or even a permanently interesting, object — a mere
hobby, in fact — serves to enhance the value of life, and explains the
success of many survivors under apparently hopeless difticulties, the
victory of competitors handicapped with disease, poverty, and defi-
cient education ; they support a cause which supports them in return ;
they live upon as well as for a principle. Hence the apparent paradox
of the longevity of busybodies, of men who seem to burn the fuel of
life at an extravagant rate. Xenophon, Cardinal Richelieu, Ximenes,
Benjamin Franklin, and Frederick the Great, were probably the busiest
men of their respective nations, gallop-riders on a road where others
kept the even tenor of their way, but they bestrode their hobbies and
managed both to outride and outlive their competitors.
It is, indeed, a mistake to suppose that the tranquillity, per se, of a
man's life tends to prolong its duration ; and the longevity of stagnant
villages and country parsons proves only how infinitely liexdth out-
weighs all other means of happiness. The peasants of Southern Rus-
sia live almost as frugally as the Hebrew patriarchs, on milk, bread,
and honey, with a bit of cheese now and then, or a drop of hydromcl
(half-fermented honey-water) ; their climate is dry and favorable to
perennial out-door life, and in spite of official tyranny, war, and rumors
of war, feudalism, and outrageous over-taxation, they outlive the free-
born British yeoman, with his strong ales and daily beefsteaks. But
the coincidence of dietetic and administrative abuses cuts the thread
of life with a two-edged knife, and in Northern Russia the average
