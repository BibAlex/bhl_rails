Ulex europaeus, L. (Leguminosae). " Furze or Gorse."
An important factor in determining the persistence of perennial
weeds during dry summers is the depth to which the roots penetrate.
Nevertheless, in the case of gorse, the plant seems to withstand dry
seasons, even when the roots penetrate only to a small depth. Thus
in one case a green clump four to five years old, 2 ft. 6 in. in
height and 4 ft. across, was growing on thin soil, with a hard pan
subsoil which the roots were unable to penetrate. Their depth
varied from 4i to 6 in., without the plant appearing to suffer from
the dry summer. On looser soils the roots penetrate much more
deeply. The deepest roots were found on a loose soil, with a porous
clay sub-soil, in which they attained a depth of 2 ft. 7 in. Under
still more favourable circumstances possibly greater depths may be
obtained.
Xanthorrhora australis, R.Br. (Liliaceae). "Grass Tree."
In addition to the resin produced by this plant other products
may be obtained from it, some of which may have an economic
value. By distilling the resinous leaf bases with water, Mr. Watt,
of Cobden, obtained a dark coloured, strongly smelling grass tree
oil, which if it could be obtained cheaply and in abundance might
be of some value as an insecticide. The oil itself killed every leaf
to which it was applied, viz., grasses, St. John's Wort, sunflower,
dahlia and onion weed. Unfortunately the oil does not mix with
water, and although water shaken up with it acquires a strong-
smell of the oil, it had no effect when sprayed on plants of St.
John's Wort, and also did not affect the grass leaves around them.
