Note on " Ziphiiis (Dolichodon), r/eelonr/ens/s,^' McCoy. ^
The fossil from Waurn Ponds referred by Sir F. McCoy to a
ziphioid is a long, strap-shaped tooth, having a compressed oval sec-
tional outline, and an extensive but slender pulp cavity. It is com-
pared with a type of tooth seen in Meso2)lodoii layardi (found off the
Cape of Good Hope, Chatham Islands and New Zealand), in which
the pair of mandibular teeth have a crown composed of true dentine
surmounted by a small and pointed enamel cap. The crown is raised
upon a solid mass of osteo-dentine, which has a continuously
changing form as the tooth advances in growth, tending upwards,
backwards, and finally inwards.- In course of time these teeth
interlock over the top, preventing complete opening of the jaws.
Their great size and recurved form is curiously paralleled in the
sabi'e-toothed tigers, as remarked by Beddard.^
The existing 3/. ZrtyffrcZ?, Gray sp., and, presumably, M.geelongen-
sis, McCoy sp., belong to the genus Me so plod o?i sensu stricto, while
M comjjressus, Owen sp., is referable, according to Flower, to the
group Dio2)lodon, including M.densirosfris, Blainv, sp., M.ausf rolls.

Observations. â€” In Dr. Hall's paper, " On the Systematic Position
of the species of Squalodon and Zeuglodon described from Australia
and New Zealand," a specimen (No. 5529) in the National Museum
from Waurn Ponds is figured. This is noticed by Hall as an " In-
cisor of (?) Farasqualodon wilkinsoni .''^ Having recently examined
the cetacean teeth in the Museum in some detail for the purpose of
the present paper, Ihave arrived at the conclusion that this speci-
men is without doubt referable to the above species, and that the
curious appearance of an incision at the base of the crown as shown
