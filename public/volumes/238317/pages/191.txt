phyll. and the carbohydrates are probably as much a product of
phuto-aiialysis as of photo-synthesis. So long as the supplies of car-
bon dioxide and light energy are in a certain ratio of equivalency,
and the products are continually removed, the chlorophyll is exter-
nally stable, though internally labile. In other words, it behaves
as an enzyme, and, according to whether we emphasize the source of
energy or of material, it might either, to coin a term, be regarded
as a lytase enzyme or a carboxidase enzyme.
The following equations are put forward not as representing
established facts, but as indicating how chlorophyll could act as a
photic or lytase enzyme for the conversion of carbon dioxide and
water into carbohydrates. The chief difficulty in regard to them
is the very large mass reactions which they represent.

Amorphous chlorophyll 4- carbon dioxide and water would form xantho-
phyll (or carotin) oxygen and glaucophyllin.

Carotin (or xanthophyll) + water + oxygen
=: Phytol + levulose + glucose + formaldehyde.
This reaction would take place in light with the aid of an oxidase
enzyme and the excess oxygen from (i.) escapes,

Phytol, glaucophyllin, and carbon dioxide form amorphous
chlorophyll and oxygen.
This change would take place in the living plant with the aid of
light energy. It makes the total volume of oxygen exhaled equal
to the volume of carbon dioxide absorbed.
This suggested cycle would indicate the enzymatic action of
chlorophyll in the presence of water, carbon dioxide and light, and
might serve as a basis for further investigation. Written in one-
line the equations would read : —
40CO.,-f-40H,O + chloiophyll + light energy
