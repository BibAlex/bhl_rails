Additions to Catalogue of Shells. 27
classed with 'pallens, you will note several differences. In yours the
lateral areas are more raised, and the growth lines are strongly in
evidence, which is not the case with /;a/Ze«s. The angle of the an-
terior valve in yours is not quite the same; yours shows a slight
bulge towards the apex. While the anterior valve in yours is short,
it is barely as proportionately short as in />a?Ze?!s, but it certainly
has a short anterior valve so characteristic of 2MUens. The pos-
terior valve does not show the niucro far back on a long valve, but
that may be due to its damaged condition. Yours suggests a little
more carination, but this may also be due to damage. In conclusion
I should place your shell with ])olle>is/''
Mr. Ashby kindly sent us his only co-type for comparison. We
quite agree with his remarks. Our specimen is not quite half the
length of the co-type. We have not yet found I. juloides on ou)-
coast.
