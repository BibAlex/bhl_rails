mera, having a bigger body of water, has made an heroic but unsuc-
cessful effort to persist in flowing on to reach the Murray in the
north.
Fig. 2. â€” Diagram to indicate the mode of origin of the present di-ainage
system of the Glenelg, as it is conceived to have taken place.
The old stream courseS to the north, shown by broken lines,
probably never firmly established themselves/owing to the lack of
grade ; while those shown to the southward have been covered by
the 'newer basalt" flows.
The southern streams were more blessed, and of these fortune
seems to have favoured the Glenelg. With a good slope, soft rocks,
and a good supply of water, this stream would rapidly deepen its
valley, receiving few tributaries en route. Nearly all that were
developed naturally came from the east, because the gentle tilt of
the land surface to the south-west would tend to direct the western
water away from the river, to collect in swamps and lakes, as is
still the case.
