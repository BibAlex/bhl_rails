Australian String Figures. 123
A given string may be taken up by a digit so that it lies on the
front or palmar aspect of the finger, or so that it lies on the back
or dorsal aspect. In nearly all cases it will be found that when a
string is taken up by inserting the digit into the distal side of a
loop, the string will have Ijeen taken up by the palmar aspect of the
digit, and that the insertion into the proximal side of the loop in-
volves taking up the string by the dorsal aspect of tlie digit.
Other operations involved are those of transferring strings from
one digit to another, and dropping the string from a given digit or
digits.
The manipulation consists of a series of movements, after each of
which the figure should be extended by drawing the hands apart and
separating the digits. In some cases in which this would interfere
with the formation of the figure, a special instruction will be given
that the figure is not to be extended. Usually, it is advisable to
retain the loops as near the tips of the digits as possible, and to keep
the strings as loose as you can until the completion of the figure.
There are certain opening positions and movements which are
common to many figures. To save trouble, these may receive con-
ventional names; the use of these will soon be apparent.
Posct ion I
Position 1. â€” This name may be applied to the position in which
the string is placed on the hands when beginning the great majority
of the figures.
Place the string over the thumbs and little fingers of both hands,
so that on each hand the string passes round the back of the little
finger, then between the little and ring fingers and across the palm;
then between the index and thumb and round the back of the thumb
to the radial side of the hand. When the hands are drawn apart the
result is a single radial thumb string and a single ulnar little finger
string on each hand, with a string lying across the palm.
