Orchid."
Cravensville, R. S. Rogers, December, 1917. A new record for
Victoria of this rare orchid, which was first described from speci-
mens found on Tingiringi mountain, New South Wales, in 1889,
by Bauerlen.
Erica arborea, L. "Tree Heath." (Ericaceae).
Selby, C. French, junr., October, 1917.
Becoming very common along the Gembrook line. It was first
recorded at Wheeler's Hill (J. W. Audas), and Beaconsfield (Mrs.
Dancocks), and must now be regarded as definitely naturalised.
The plant has no injurious properties, and is a decorative shrub,
which has escaped from gardens. As Epacrideae in Victoria take
the place of Ericaceae in England, it will be of interest to see to
what extent this introduced Erica will ou.st the native EjDacrideae.
Hypericum tetrapterum, Fries. (Hypericineae).
Government House Domain, Melbourne, P. F. Morris, January,
1917.
This plant, a close relative of the St. John's Wort, is a native
â– of Europe and North Asia, may be classed as an exotic not yet suffi-
ciently established to be considered naturalised.

Tyabb, Victoria, A. S. Krcrouse, May, 1917.
This plant, which is proclaimed under the Thistle Act for the

Victoria in 1913, and is now evidently spreading in New South
Wales.
