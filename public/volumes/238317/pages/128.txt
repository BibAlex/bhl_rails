Chiloglottis Pescottiana. 141
The species is named in honour of Mr. E. E. Pescott, F.L.S., of
Melbourne, who supplied me with specimens from Tallangatta,
Victoria â€” the same locality from which C. trapeziforme, Fitz.,
has recently been recorded as new to the State. It was discovered
by Mr. A. B. Braine, and it blooms from the latter end of
September to the beginning of December.
It would appear to be fairly numerous, but very local in its dis-
tribution.
