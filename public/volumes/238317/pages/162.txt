Acacia glandulicarpa, F.M. Reader. (Leguminosae).
" Hairy Pod Acacia."
Whipstick Forest, near Bendigo. Collector, David J. Paton,
September, 1917. A native of Victoria, previously only recorded
from the Mallee.
Cynosurus echinatus, L. (Grainineae). "Rouojli Do,t,''s Tail Grass."
Mentone, Collector, J. R. Tovey, December, 1916, Ferguson, near
Beech Forest. J. Murchison, February, 1917. New localities in
Victoria for this introduced grass, which has previously been
recorded from the Drouin district only.
Crovvka exalata, F. v. M. (Rutaceae). "Crowea."
Whipstick Forest, near Bendigo, D. J. Paton, December, 1916.
This is a new -locality in Victoria for this plant. It had previously
been recorded from the east and north-eastern localities only.
Mr. Paton says that the plant is fairly abundant in the Whip-
stick Forest, in two or three localities, notably near Eaglehawk,
whence the present specimens are taken. It seems to be associated
with the Mallee-like flora of the Whipstick, as I have not observed
it on the southern side of Bendigo, where the flora is of a different
type. As found here it is a low erect or straggling shrub, seldom
attaining three feet in height, and often much less. November and
December is the best flowering period, though a few flowers may be
gathered at almost any season of the year.
