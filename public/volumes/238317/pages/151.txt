above, either of these two rock arrangements necessarily tending-
to produce a steep cliff. It is possible also that water finds its way
down through the rocks and oozes out at the base of the cliff; and
so may slightly remove, or at any rate weaken the soft rocks at the-
base of the cliff. When these (quarries occur at the edge of " dry "
lakes bounded by rocky cliffs, the crystallization of salt from water
evaporating from the rocks at the base of the cliffs may also help-
this type of quarry formation, l)ut further investigation is desir-
able on this point.
The triangular quarries are due to the gouging action of rain on
soft rocks. Their form is guided by the hard rocks forming a cap-
to the " back," which cap resists erosion and brings about the
steep "back." At the same time the check given to erosion by
such cap causes the denuding agents to follow the line of least
resistance, with the result that the quarry is widened between the
sides of the triangle, thus causing a lengthening of the "back"
along the base of the triangle.
