Three typical specimens of tliis interesting estuarine shell were

There appears to be a large and confusing synonymy for this
very variable species, and the present writers have under examina-
tion evidence which seems to point to the above specific name as
the valid one. Some of the confusion has arisen through bad
drawing or inconsistent description, and it is hoped that a com-
parison of the various types involved will finally settle the question.
At present the writers are in communication wdth some European
authorities on the subject, the results of which wdll be made known
as soon as possible. Examples of the so-called species, vicforiae,
ler/randl and petierdi are found in this fossil deposit. The varie-
ties occurring in the Pleistocene of Mowbray Swamp, Tasmania,*!
appear to most nearly approach Bythinella victoriae, T. Woods, the
types of which are in the National Museum, Melbourne.
