Hab. — Dredged 5 to 8 fathoms. Western Port; also dredged off
Portsea, Port Phillip.
Obs. — A left valve, 30 x 40 mm. was forwarded to Mr. T. Iredale,
London, for comparison with types, and he Avrites : " Agrees
exactly with the types in the British Museum of Dosinia grata, Des-
hayes . . . from Tasmania, collected by R. Gunn. . . Tate and May
(p. 429), place D.(/rata, Deshayes, as a synonym of D.circinaria,
Deshayes, Avhich it is not, types compared."
Much confusion has arisen respecting this species, and to Aus-
tralian conchologists its identification has been perplexing, owing
in the first place to Tate giving a wrongful figure, l and at the same
time quoting D.diana, Adams and Angas. as a synonym. In 1897 —
reference above given — he corrected this, stating : " The type of
D.diana, Adams and Angas, and the shell I figured as D. grata are
certainly the same, but they are different from D. grata. ^^ Tate and
May2 cited the species as a synonym of D.circinaria, Deshayes, from
