hung with bushes of the mimosa, festooned in a very picturesque
manner with the wild vine. The river was everywhere deep and
full, ... on an average 120 feet wide and 12 feet deep. Granite

valley through which this stream flowed were beautifully smooth
and swelling. ... A little rill then murmured through each
ravine,
" ' Whose scattered streams from granite basins burst,
Leap into life, and sparkling woo your thirst.'
It seemed that the land was everywhere alike good, alike beautiful."
