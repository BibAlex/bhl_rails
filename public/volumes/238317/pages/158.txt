The predominance of common salt may be noted.
The Happy Jack water is extremely salt for a water away from
a lake, but it shows how salt some of the underground waters are.
In its percentage and nature of solids, it is probably close to the
normal underground lake waters. These analyses show that there
are abundant salts to operate on the rocks in the way described.
Space does not permit of detailed descriptions of particular
localities where the features described above may be seen, but as
examples of the flaking of hard greenstone rocks, reference is made
to the western shore of Lake Goongarrie, at the eastern end of the
" peninsula," between Comet Vale and Goongarrie.^ An example
of flaking of practically undecomposed granite occurs at the low
cliffs at the western end of an unnamed and unmapped lake to the
east of the Tiorth -eastern corner of Lake Goongarrie. The rectan-
gular outlines of siome of the undermined cavities, which are
largely due to vertical joints and other division planes, may be
seen at the extremity of the peninsula at Lake Goongarrie.
1 Comet Vale is 63 miles north of Kalg:oorlie,
2 Goongarrie is 55 miles north of Kalgoorlie.
