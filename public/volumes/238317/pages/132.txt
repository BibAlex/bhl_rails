General Remarks.
The specimens forming the basis of the present paper come from
two sources.
(1) The better preserved specimens, dorsal and ventral valves,
were found by Professor Skeats, D.Sc, in a road-metal heap E.
of Mount William railway station and N.E. of Lancefield. The
matrix is a whitish or pale ashen grey siliceous shale, with obscure
crustacean remains (cf. Hymenocaris). In thin sections under a
high power, small cruciform spicules can be distinguished, prob-
ably referable to Protosporigia.
(2) A smaller and slightly crushed and distorted interior of a
dorsal valve, apparently belonging to the same species, was found
by the late Dr. T. S. Hall, M.A., near Lancefield, which he pre-
sented to the Museum in 1908.
When first examining Prof. Skeats' specimens, I was struck with
their resemblance to certain Cambrian brachiopods formerly placed
in the genus Linnarssonia by C. D. Walcott, which genus has since
been merged into Acrotreta, Kutorga. Acrotreta is a genus of
more or less cone-shaped brachiopods in which the pedicle opening
is simple, circular and apical on the central valve. The false car-
dinal area is apparent in the cast of the ventral valve in one of the
present specimens.
Acrotreta antipodum, sp. nov. (Plate XXVI.)
Description. — Valves wider than long, subovate in outline; pos-
terior obtuse to depressed, with a false cardinal area. Ventral
valve moderately high ; pedicle opening situated about one-fifth
from the posterior margin, apex concavely sloping to the posterior,
