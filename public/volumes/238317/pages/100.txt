I. — Introduction.
These notes were prepared in connection with the Universitj'
Survey Camp, conducted in this area under Professor Skeats during
the vacation of January, 1914. They are published with the per-
mission of the Geological Survey of Victoria, under whose auspices
this survey camp was arranged.
The Glenelg River is one of the largest and most important of
Victorian streams. It is situated in the south-western corner of
Victoria, and drains an area of about 4200 square miles. Major
Mitchell, who discovered and named the river on July 31st, 1836,
records that the native name was Temicingandgeen, "a name unfor-
tunately too long to be introduced into maps. "1
