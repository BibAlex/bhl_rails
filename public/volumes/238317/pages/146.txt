Introductory.
The sub-arid interior of Western Australia possesses many strik-
ing surface features, which are as yet but little kiTown, and still
less have been the subject of investigation. Amongst minor forms,
the remarkable hollows, to which the writer has applied the name,
" natural quarries," are worthy of record. They differ in origin
from, the natural quarries due to ice action ; and in normally moist
climates they have no definite parallel. Their nearest topographic
forms in such climates are certain scars left in places on steep
hillsides, owing to land-slips, but for reasons stated below such
an origin cannot be postulated for any of the quarries described
in this paper.
Summary.
" Natural quarries," in sub-arid Western Australia are of three
kinds, circular, rectangular and triangular. They are distinct
excavations (resembling artificial quarries) in the hillsides of
various rocks; and are chiefly due to the mechanical gouging or
lindermining action of rain under certain special conditions.
Description.
There are three kinds, broadly speaking, of natural quarries.
They may be described as the circular, the rectangular and the
triangular types, such terms being based on the kind of plane
figure formed by the outline of the quarry on the normal surface
slope. There is, however, a certain amount of transition between
the different forms.
The Circular Quarry/. — This kind forms a more or less circular
hole of varying diameter and depth, on a hillside; and in many
