Victorian Fossils, Part XXI. 85
and small size. The build of both S.carreti, Du Bus (Antwerp Crag)
and S.macgeei, Chapni. (Beaumaris), is heavy, and the form of the
teeth broadly conical. The present tooth of S.lodgei is that of a
mature individual, and it does not in any of its characters suggest
specific affinity with the Beaumaris species. As in S.lodgei, the
Belgian species has the enamel of the crown longitudinally striated,
whereas in S.macgeei the enamel is not only rugosely striated, but
beaded or crenulate.
Occurrence. — Balcombian or Oligocene. Muddy Creek (Clifton
Bank), near Hamilton, Victoria.
This tooth (holotype) was discovered by the late Mr. H. Lodge, of
Hamilton, and we are indebted to Mr. F. P. Spry for presenting
this interesting specimen to the National Museum.
Note. — According to the label, it was found at " ]Muddy Creek,
near Hamilton." Since the locality is often used in a general vsense
by collectors for several geological exposures in the district, includ-
ing the Kalimnan of the Grange Burn, it suggested the possibility
of the tooth having come from the latter locality. However, this
doubt is removed by an examination of the material enclosed in the
pulp cavity of the tooth, which contained typical upper Clifton Bank
foraminiferal sand with shells of the pteropod VagineUa, and rolled
and wnnd-polished Aitiphistegiiiae. It is, therefore, conclusive that
the tooth w^as found in VagineUa band at Clifton Bank, which
includes the higher Balcombian horizon merging on the Janjukian
bed represented in the Grange Burn area by red limestone. i
