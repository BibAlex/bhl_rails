2. — That since the old tluue-rock and old swamp deposits con-
tain extinct forms of marsupial remains they presumably l:)elong
to the early Pleistocene.
."3. — The evidence of the shells from beneath the Warrnambool
tuffs shows the fauna to have a geologically recent aspect, but with
varietal modifications of the species indicating different geographical
features from that now prevailing in the locality, a strong
estuarine character antedating the re-juvenation of the present
river-system. This ancient estuarine feature is further emphasised
by the fact of the prevalence of a wide lava-flow of newer basalt
extending down to the present shore-line at Port Fairy and beyond,
pointing to the infilling of an ancient river delta which, originally
of great extent, embraced the Warrnambool-Portland area.
4. — It may therefore be postulated that the volcanic tuffs of the
Tower Hill series were ejected between early Pleistocene and fairly
modern times, that is, in late Pleistocene or Holocene, or, using
European terms, in early prehistoric times. Compared with the more
mature physiogiaphic features shown by the newer volcanic lava flows,
these tuffs represent one of the last stages of the volcanic outburst in
Victoria.
