and gently convexly to the anterior margin. The exterior of a
ventral valve shows the ornament to be strongly concentric (tegu-
late), the edges of the concentric laminae being acerate or sjoarsely
spinose. An exfoliated dorsal valve shows the impression of the
median septum with divergent furrows and rhomboidal termina-
tion ; also muscle scars near the hinge. The interior of the dorsal
valve from Lancefield (somewhat distorted) shows the median
septum and lateral scars.
DimenHions. — Ventral valve — length (in all the figured speci-
mens from the Mount William district), 2.25 mm. ; width, 2.75
mm. Dorsal valve — length, 1.25 mm.; width, 1.5 mm.
The smaller specimen, from the black shale of Lancefield, has a
length of 1.5 mm., and a similar width, the latter probably due
to a lateral distortion.
Occurrence. — Ventral and dorsal valves in grey siliceous shale
from stone heap E. of Mount William railway station. Collected
l)y Prof. E. W. Skeats, D.Sc. Dorsal valve in black Lower Ordo-
vician shale, Lancefield. (Coll. by Dr. T. S. Hall, M.A. } pres.
4.3.08).
Relationships. — The above species belongs to the group of
depressed Acrotretce, of which Acrofreta sagitfalis, Davidson sp.l
forms a central type. In that species the valves are not so laterally
widened as in the Victorian, and in this respect there is a nearer
approach to the present species in Acrofrefa helti, Davidson sp.2,
in which again the laterally ovoid outline is not so pronounced as
in A. antipodum. In the surface ornament A. sagittalis. by its
concentric laminae, shows closer affinity with A. aiitipodnm, but
it is not so strong, nor even inclined to spinosity as in the Vic-
torian species. A. sagittalis is a Menevian fossil in Wales, and A.
belli occurs in the Lower Tremadoc.
Another related form is Aerotreta hellatula, Walcott,^^ a Middle
Cambrian species from Millard County, Utah. ' This is a depressed
form, having a more circular outline, and with the aj^ex close to
the posterior margin ; whilst the surface of the valve is moderately
smooth or finely concentric.
