22 Gatlif and Gnhriel .-
Geneva Museum of M.fimbriatus ; but we do not tliiiik Ball's defini-
tion of Crasi^edotriton permits of the inclusion of this species. We
have a specimen before us of Triton convolutus, Broderip, the type
of Ball's genus Craspedotriton, and also his description of the
genus.
In his description of M.fimbriatus, Lamarck says: " Apertura
roseo-violacesente," this indicates its inclusion as a Coralliophila.
None of our specimens of M. planiliratus from this coast or from
Western Australia have any coloration within the mouth.

vol. xxxviii., p. 330.
Hab. — Coast generally. A common littoral species.
Obs. — 'Lamarck's type has never been figured, and its identity was
unknown here until I\Ir Hedley examined it in the Geneva Museum.
He says : "Three specimens apparently cotypes of Buccinum vino-
sum."
We agree with Mr. Hedley that it has been misplaced in the genus
Sistrum.
In form and sculpture this species varies greatly. It attains to a
lengtli of 22 nun., and the adult form usually develoj^es four or five
strong denticles within the outer lip.
