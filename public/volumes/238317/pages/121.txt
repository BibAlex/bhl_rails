This position differs from the opening position of the English
cat's cradle, in which the string is Avound round the hand so that
one string lies across the palm and two across the back of the hand,
with a single radial index string and a single ulnar little finger
string.
Optning A. — This name may be applied to the manipulation
which forms the most frequent starting point of the various figures.
Place strings on hands in Position 1. With the back of the index of
the right hand, take up from the proximal side (or from below) the
left palmar string and return. There will now be a loop on the
right index, formed by strings passing from the radial side of the
little finger and the ulnar side of thumb of the left hand, i.e., the
radial little finger strings and the ulnar thumb strings respectively.
With the back of the index of the left hand, take up from the
proximal side (or from below) the right palmar string and return,
keeping the index within the righ index loop all the time, so that
the strings now joining the loop on the left index lie within thei
right index loop.
The figui'e now consists of six loops, on the thumb, index, and
little finger of each hand. The radial little finger string of each
hand crosses in the centre of the figure to form the ulnar index
string of the other hand, and similarly the ulnar thumb string of
one hand crosses and becomes the radial index of the other hand.
The places where the strings cross in the centre of the figure may
be termed the crosses of Opening A .
To " Navaho." — When there are two loops on a digit, a distal
one and a proximal one, to JVamho is to lift tlie proximal loop over
the distal one and over the tip of the digit on to its palmar aspect.
" Pindiki " is a native name for the final extension of many of
the figures. It consists of passing the index fingers proximal to the
ulnar thumb string, and bringing them np through the thumb loop
