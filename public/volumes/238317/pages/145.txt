158 Osborne .• Theory of Gel Structure.
microscopic examination. i In egg-white coagulated by heat, we
have a gel containing some 86% water, but no fluid is extruded
when the coagulum is subjected to ether. It is just likely that we
have a honey-comb structure here, though the hydrophile nature
■of the framcAvork may also take its part. On the other hand, the
thallus of laminaria, as Struve discovered, exudes fluid copiously.
A silicic acid gel containing 13.4% solid matter, though easily
fractured, did not give a positive result.
It seems to me, therefore, that the Struve-Baumstark phenome-
non can be employed to distinguish those gels where the liquid
phase is held, in part at least, by capillarity from those in which
the fluid is held, through imbibition, by the hydrophile lattice of the
solid phase.
