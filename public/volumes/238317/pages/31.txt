24 Gatliff and Gahrid :
although they differ in size, length of spire, and outline of the lip —
which is occasionally more patulous — that there is only one species,
as indicated above, and that the specimens that we have examined
exhibit the slight variation comprised in the description and figures
of the forms included in the above synonymy.
We also have examples of the si^ecies from Durban, South Africa,
and from the same locality, T. hofmnui, Angus.
Pilsbry remarks on the genus, ^ "Tornatina differs from Retusa in
the conspicuously channeled suture, and the peculiar projecting
apex." These are distinguishing features in the type of the genus
T .voluta, Quoy and Gaimard.
Iredale asserts2 that the genus Tornatina is a synonym of Retusa.
Before accepting this we should like to examine the apex of what is
authentically regarded as being typical species of Retusa.
