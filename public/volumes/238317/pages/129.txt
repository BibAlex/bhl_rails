against RH assuming Lorentz Theory.

The negative electron, when it possesses a velocity v cms/sec, is
•deflected by a uniform magnetic field, H gauss, at right angles to
its direction of motion, into a circular path of radius R cms. such
that RH = vw/e, m grams being the transverse mass of the nega-
tive electron for a velocity v cms/sec. rn = nif,(f)(f3), where ^ = v/V,
V crns/sec Ijeing the velocity of light. In experiments on cathode
and (3 rays it is frequently necessary to calculate the velocity of the
rays when RH is known. Since e/nif, is now well known, and
Lorentz' s theory that mz=:mjl — fS')"- has teen confirmed by
Bucherer, it is convenient to tabulate v with RH as argument.
The following values for e/Wg have been obtained by different
observers : —
Bucher 1908 ... 1.763 x lO'E.M.U.gm-i
Classen 1908 ... 1.776
Wolz 1909 ... 1.767
Lerp 1911 ... L72
Malassez 1911 ... 1.769
Bestelmeyer 1911 ... 1.75
Bestelmeyer 1911 ... 1.766
Alberti 1912 ... 1.756
Jones 19U ... 1.75
From a consideration of these the value 1.763 x 10^ was chosen
for e/m^. The velocity of light w^as taken as 2.9986x10^0 cms/
sec.
The table expresses RH in gauss-cms and v in 108 cms/sec.
Example: If RH=:2315 gauss-cms. then v = 241.64xl08 cms. /sec.
