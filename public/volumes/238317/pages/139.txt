152 Frederick Chapman: Cetacean Tooth.
In the absence of any further evidence as to the relationship of
the Tasmanian fossil tooth with already described forms, it is here
provisionally referred to a new genus,^ Scaptodnn. The stained
and fossilised appearance of the tooth leaves no doubt that it was
derived from a Tertiary deposit of some considerable age.
Occurre7ice. — " Found washed up at Ulverstone, N.W. Tas-
mania, after a heavy gale." — H. H. Scott, Victoria Museum, Laun-
ceston, Tasmania. Probably from either Janjukian or Kalimnan
beds of the Table Cape series of Tasmania (Miocene or Lower Pli-
ocene).
In writing the above I wish to express my thanks to Mr. J. A.
Kershaw, F.E.S., for facilities in examining recent specimens,
and to Dr. E. Brooke Nicholls, for useful references and sugges-
tions.
