92 H- J- Grayson:
I am greatly indebted to Professor Orme Ma.sson, F.R.S., who as
President of the Professorial Board and Dean of the Faculty of
Science, used his influence for the promotion of the undertaking
and whose efforts made it possible for a proportion of my official
time to be given to the work. To my friend, Mr. James Fawcett,
of Camberwell, my heartiest thanks are due for the time and trouble
he bestowed upon the preparation of the plan of the machine
appearing as Plate VI., and for several minor drawings. Finally,
I am fully cognisant of the fact that I owe to the University or its
governing authorities, whose consideration and generosity have
made it possible for me to devote so much of my time to the
completion of this work during the past three years, far more than
this verbal expression of my indebtedness conveys.
