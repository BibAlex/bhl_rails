established, names can be read, and certain loan words, mostly
from Egyptian, have been recognized. The meaning of a small
number of native words and some of the basic elements of gram-
mar have also been established. Griffith's lexicons, which sys-
tematically arrange the known forms, should someday provide
a substantial base for further work. But until either bilingual
texts are discovered or the linguistic affiliations of Meroitic
are worked out so that known cognate languages can provide
a sound basis for systematic investigation, the hope of much
progress in the understanding of Meroitic appears dim indeed.
Until such a time the "translation" of even relatively simple
and well-studied formulae such as appear on tomb inscriptions
must remain an identification of known words and grammatical
forms eked out with many others of vague or uncertain mean-
ing as well as with guesses and blanks. With these limitations in
mind we offer the following translation of the Toshka inscrip-
tion :
(a) O (unknown adjective) Isis ! O (unknown adjective)
Osiris !
(b) (the honorable) Mli-wes (is here commemorated)
(c) a kinswoman of the commander of the deserts
(land?) whose name is Atkitnideye
(d) a kinswoman of the commander of the deserts
Adilememe
(e) a kinswoman of Qntkleb [or of qntks]
(f) a kinswoman of the governor [or civil
official] of Faras Pteremetiye
(g) a kin [or a cousin] of the envoy to the
Romans Aqehleye
(h) a kinswoman of the envoy to the Romans
Htpiye
(i) a relation (?) of Apetekdiyi [or of a female
ambassador],
(j) a relation (?) of commanders, envoys, and gover-
nors (?)
(k) (Abundant water may you drink in the afterlife.)
