A MEROITIC TOMB INSCRIPTION
FROM TOSHKA WEST
Bruce G. Trigger
The Meroitic inscription presented herewith is the only funer-
ary inscription to have been discovered by the University Mu-
seum of the University of Pennsylvania â€” Peabody Museum of
Vale University Expedition to Egypt in the large cemetery
(called TW-A) just north of the winter Post Boat station at
Toshka West. The cemetery is in the north part of Toshka op-
posite Gebel Agg, and lies between the river and the hamlet of
Duki Dawur. It was found to contain several hundred graves
of the late Meroitic, X-group, and Nubian Christian periods.
No reference to this cemetery is found in Emery's and Kirwan's
(1935) report on their archaeological survey of this region. A
description of the cemetery and of the work done there in 1961
and 1962 can be found in two preliminary reports on the work
of the expedition written by its director, Professor William K.
Simpson of Yale University. These have appeared in the Il-
lustrated London News (1961) and in Expedition, the bulletin
of the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania
(1962). The inscription, which was found during the 1962 field
season, is illustrated on page 38 of the second article and on the
cover of the issue.
