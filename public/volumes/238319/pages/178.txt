A series of observations on a sunny morning with a young (red) and
an old (green) leaf of Amherstia nobilis — the specimens stood with their
stalks in water — gave the following amount of transpiration in grams
per 100 grams of living weight: —

The following observations of Wiesner show how great transpiration can be at
Buitenzorg. He placed several herbaceous plants (Coleus, Adiantum, Jatropha,
Mimosa pudica) in pots, and imbedded them in the ground in a part of the garden
full)- exposed to the rain. For several days the plants received rain daily — sometimes
very heavy rain. ' On December 29 there was absolutely no rain ; the forenoon was
sunny, and at noon the sun was quite uncovered. On this day all the specimens —
they were not watered on the day in question — died of desiccation.'
Giltay made comparative observations on the amount of transpiration of Helianthus
tuberosus at Buitenzorg and at Wageningen in Holland. They showed that the
