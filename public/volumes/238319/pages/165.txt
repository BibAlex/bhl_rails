FORMATIONS AND GUILDS

and the lauraceous genus Cassytha â€” both leafless twiners with haustoria
on their stems and more (Cuscuta) or less (Cassytha) poor in chloro-
phyll. Others again have the habitat of true epiphytes ; such are the
mistletoe (Viscum album), Loranthus europaeus and numerous other
Loranthaceae, also several Santalaceae of extra-tropical South America.
These epiphytic forms are all hemiparasites except Loranthus aphyllus l .
Many are at the same
time climbers. Finally,
a separate oecological po-
sition may be assigned to
those forms that, except
for their organs of repro-
duction, are buried within
their host.
In the case of fungi, still
greater differences in their
mode of life exist ; for one
reason, because they, un-
like phanerogams, are not
confined to vegetable sub-
strata but also attack
animals, and also because
many species assume dif-
ferent forms on different
hosts.
Like saprophytes, para-
sites belong to a relatively
small number of sys-
tematic groups, and are
most numerous among
fungi and bacteria. Algae
include only a few holo-
parasites compared with
the more numerous hemi-
parasites in the group.
Holoparasites and holosa-
prophytes alike are want-
ing among mosses, pteridophytes, and gymnosperms. The analogy
between the two oecological groups of holoparasites and holosaprophytes
does not extend to angiosperms. Although there is a parasite (Melampy-
rum pratense) that apparently can also exist saprophytically (L. Koch),
yet the two modes of organic nutrition among angiosperms are systemati-
