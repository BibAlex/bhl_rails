unserviceable. Not only leaves, but also flowers, fruits, and seeds, or
portions of them, are carried home.
The parasol-ants disappear with their booty through the entrance-holes
to their nest, which lies either in a shallow natural cavity, as in the case
of the very carefully investigated Atta discigera and A. Hystrix of South
Brazil, or is dug in the ground, as in the case of Atta coronata and
probably of most species. What becomes of the pieces of leaves that
are brought home in such large quantities has until recently remained
an unsolved problem. Bates considered that they were used for lining
walls ; MacCook thought they were for the preparation of a kind of
paper for internal constructions ; Belt, however, advanced the daring
hypothesis that the ants cultivated fungi on the decomposing masses

of leaves. The sagacious ' Naturalist in Nicaragua ' had, as usual, hit
on the right explanation. Alf. Moller, in a research that presents a
rare instance in the domain of oecology of acuteness combined with
the critical faculty, has definitely proved the correctness of Belt's often-
disputed and derided statement, ' I believe . . . that they are in reality
mushroom-growers and eaters.'
The imported pieces of leaves serve only to a small extent for covering
the nests. Most of them are cut up again by the ants and kneaded
soft by their feet and mandibles, so that but few cells remain unbruised.
