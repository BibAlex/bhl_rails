and continuous woodland, which in most cases consists principally or
exclusively of shrubs, but which occasionally becomes true forest, although
of low or middle height only.
The trees are usually low, their stems generally massive, and the branches
gnarled. The leaves (Figs. 271-279) are at most of moderate size, about
as large as the leaves of laurel or oleander, usually smaller, or even very
small ; they are scarcely ever compound, as a rule narrow, lanceolate, or
linear to acicular ; their margins are usually entire. The leaves are not

generally placed with their flat surfaces perpendicular to the strongest light,
but usually avoid it by assuming an oblique or parallel position. They
are either destitute of an air-containing tomentum, or this is confined
to their under-surface ; on the other hand glandular hairs are not un-
common on both leaf-surfaces. Even when there is no tomentum the
leaves comparatively speaking are seldom shiny, but more frequently, even
if smooth on the surface, are dull, perhaps owing to exudations of resin, and
often bluish. Histologically the foliage is characterized by the thickness of
the walls of all the cells, including even the parenchymatous ones, by the
abundance of sclerenchyma, by the strong development of cuticle, and by
