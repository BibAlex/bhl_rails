want of water, and not of the low temperature. H. Mayr l states quite
correctly : ' One is surprised to find what low temperatures a woody plant
sheltered from the wind can endure, provided the air is fairly moist or
transpiration naturally restricted, as is the case under dense forest, in an
insular climate, in narrow mountain- or river-valleys ; on the other hand,
most plants are more sen-
sitive to winter frost the
drier the air is ; nine-tenths
of the cases reported of dam-
age by frost during winter
are really phenomena due
to desiccation, owing to the
interference with or stop-
page of the movement of
water by frost. Thus also
perhaps the apparent con-
tradiction may be ex-
plained, that many plants
have been termed ' hardy '
in a notoriously colder
climate, yet are considered
' tender ' in a notoriously
milder one ; probably the
plants in the former lo-
calities were growing in
moister air or were shel-
tered from evaporation,
while the tender plants of
the warmer climate had
to contend against both
drought and frost.'
Irrespective of seeds and
spores, it is not yet known
which species of plants are
least sensitive to frost and
what degrees of cold they can support without injury. But certain observa-
tions relating to arctic plants prove that the degree of cold may be
extraordinarily low. Thus Kjellman, who as botanist accompanied the
'Vega' expedition, makes the following statement regarding Cochlearia
fenestrata (Fig. 37):
' There are few places on earth where the winters are so severe as the spot on
which the "Vega'' expedition passed the winter. The cold was very persistent, and
