of a quill to that of a finger, and producing roots and tufts of leaves
at their nodes. The tufts, like our sand-grasses, owe their pallor to
a coating of wax.
The advantages due to this mode of growth in such habitats are
obvious. The creeping shoots, firmly anchored by numerous deeply
penetrating roots, offer a much better resistance to the wind, and incur
much less danger of being torn out of the loose shifting substratum
than do erect plants. It is therefore no wonder that many other
littoral plants adopt a mode of life similar to that of Spinifex, such as

Remirea maritima, which is almost ubiquitous in the tropics, and the
still commoner and more widely distributed Ipomoea Pes-caprae (I. biloba),
the extremely long and distantly rooted creeping shoots of which cover
and fix the sand with a narrow-meshed net, and also the species of
Canavalia that physiognomically resemble Ipomoea Pes-caprae. In the
north temperate zone, the sea marram (Ammophila arundinacea) fixes the
loose sand of the dunes by means of its extremely long and richly subdivided
rhizomes, and so do some other grasses, such as Elymus arenarius and
Agropyron junceum. .All -these plants have the important faculty of
again growing out of the sand, after having been covered by it.
