occasionally extend for distances of six or seven miles. Localities of the
same kind characterize the central Gobi, whilst in its northern and southern
parts mountains frequently occur, partly grouped like an archipelago,
partly extending in chains. The mountains are only slightly raised above
the flat tracts of land at their feet and are covered with rocks, which
one encounters at nearly every step. Frequently dry river-beds, full of
water only during the rainy season, also occur. Springs are situated at the
higher elevations. In the Gobi, as in the adjoining region, permanent
water-courses are absolutely wanting. During the rainy season temporary

lakes with a permanent supply of water.

season and collects in ponds and lakes, the grass is ranker and attains
a height of three feet. . . .
' Throughout the Gobi there is no forest, and only rarely a single tree at
the foot of a mountain or on the bank of a dried river-bed stands as an
