of known systematic position. The most remarkable of these structures appear,
as Ilaberlandt has already stated, on trees of the family of Sterculiaceae. In my
notes I find Sterculia spectabilis, Miq., Firmiana colorata, R. Br., and Pterygota
Roxburghii, Schott and Endl., as specially remarkable. I have also recorded as
worthy of note, Dysoxylum mollissimum and D. Kadoya (Meliaceae) ; Urostigma
altissimum and Cecropia cyrtostachya (Artocarpaceae) ; Spathodea campanulata
(Bignoniaceae) ; Vitex timorensis, V. Cofassus, V. leucoxylon (Verbenaceae) ; most
species of Terminalia (Combretaceae). No plank-buttresses are possessed by tall
trees belonging to the families Sapindaceae, Apocynaceae, Sapotaceae, or to species
of Myristica. Many species of the latter genus have prop-roots. Brandis mentions

plank-buttresses in connexion with Bombax malabaricum and species of Vitex,
Antiaris, Lagerstroemia, Hymenodictyon, Nauclea, and others.
The plank- buttress is a peculiarity of trees in a tropical climate with
abundant rainfall. It is not limited to the evergreen rain- forest, for it also
occurs in the deciduous monsoon-forest (Fig. 189), but is not found in less
humid districts. The amount of rainfall necessary for its appearance is not
yet ascertained. The physiological causes of the phenomenon and its
significance to the life of the tree are still obscure.
Owing to the prejudicial effect of humidity on the formation of cork, the
bark is only poorly developed on most of the tree-stems in the rain-forest.
Stems in the rain-forest never exhibit scales of bark of such surprising
