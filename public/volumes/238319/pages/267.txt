season and renew it at or immediately before the commencement of the
monsoon-rains ; apart from this they have only xerophilous organs well
protected against drought. Such tropophilous forests, whose alternating
hygrophilous and xerophilous character is regulated by the monsoon, have
been termed monsoon-forests l . Regions with less abundant rainfall are,
according to the character of their climate, occupied by xerophilous wood-
land (savannah-forest,
thorn-forest, thorn-
bushland) or by grass-
land, usually of the
savannah type. Still
greater drought induces
the desert character.
Tropical desert will
be discussed in con-
nexion with temperate
desert 2 .
The oecologicai
physiognomy of vege-
tation in periodically
dry districts is quite
different from that in
constantly humid ones,
especially if we con-
trast with humid dis-
tricts those districts
which, above all, have
a scanty rainfall and
show xerophilous vege-
tation at all seasons of
the year. Here the
danger of desiccation,
especially threatening
to tall plants, has led
to the evolution of
highly x crop J i ilons trees,
forming an extremely peculiar tree-type which, in particular, shows its
characteristic features in savannah and thorn-forest.
Investigations are greatly needed in regard to the structure and con-
ditions of existence of tropical xerophilous trees, which find no analogues
in Central Europe and first appear, in a feebly defined form, in the
Mediterranean region.
