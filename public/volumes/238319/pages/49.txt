THE FACTORS
[Part I
The directions in which the modifying influence of water has chiefly
acted are as follows : enlargement of the external surface of the shoots by
the lengthening or subdivision of their members, suppression or diminution
of the root-system along with, it may be, its transformation into fixing
organs, weak development of the cuticle, absence or reduction in number of
the stomata, displacement of the vascular bundles to form a central strand,
peripheral disposition of the chlorenchyma. In still waters there is
besides, as a rule, a diminution
in the mechanical elements and
an increase in the air-containing
intercellular spaces. These mo-
difications are not so noticeable
in actively moving water, where
also the relatively large ex-
tension of surface is less pro-
nounced. The utility of these
modifications is obvious. It is
only doubtful whether they are
to be attributed to natural selec-
tion or to the direct influence
of water. The first hint in
explanation of some of them
comes from the Cardamine ac-
cidentally growing in water, in
regard to which there can be
no question of natural selection.
Probably both groups of influ-
ences, the direct and the indirect,
have acted simultaneously.
The modifications which ex-
istence in water induced in
plants that were originally ter-
restrial are only in part attri-
butable to the direct action of
water. For the rest, it is a
question of other factors of
plant-life, which are themselves
modified by water. Some characteristics of aquatic plants are to be
attributed to the weakening of the light in water, and they accordingly
reappear in terrestrial plants growing in deep shade ; in illustration of this
may be cited the peripheral arrangement of the chlorenchyma and
possibly the great lengthening of parts in deep water. The considerable
extension of the plant-surface, and the abundance of air-containing canals
