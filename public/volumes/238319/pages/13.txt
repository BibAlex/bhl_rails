A. F. W. SCHIMPER
An Appreciation
The nineteenth century saw the birth of four botanists
belonging to the family of Schimper. Of these the first two were
the brothers K. F. (1803- 1867) and W. (1 804-1 878), the former
famous for his work on phyllotaxis, the latter known as a botanical
collector and a traveller; the third was their cousin, W. P. (1808-
1880), the professor, distinguished for his work on mosses and
palaeophytology ; and the fourth was A. F. W. (1856-1901), son
of the last-named, and author of the present work.
A. F. W. Schimper was born at Strassburg, where his father
held the Chair of Geology. His training as a field-naturalist com-
menced early, for as a young child he collected and named plants,
and as a boy he knew by sight many of the mosses upon which
his father was working. A true naturalist and a keen observer he
remained to the end of his life.
His four years (1874-1878) of university life Schimper passed
at Strassburg, where he studied natural science and devoted
especial attention to two subjects — botany and mineralogy. So
far did he prosecute his study of mineralogy that he seriously
contemplated becoming a mineralogist 1 ; indeed his first published
papers were two brief mineralogical notes issued in 1877, and his
next work, on proteid-crystals, was actually published in two
forms, the one for botanists and the other for mineralogists.
Of this paper, Dr. H. Miers, F.R.S., Professor of Mineralogy
in the University of Oxford, has recorded his impressions in
the following words : — ' This research proves him (Schimper) to

that I received my information from A. F. W. Schimper himself.
