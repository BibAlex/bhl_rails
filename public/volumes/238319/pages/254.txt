the crowns of the highest trees and clothe their stems most luxuriantly with
long- leaved shoots. The species of Carludovica are less lofty and less
vigorous climbers. Yet I saw Carludovica Plumieri play an imposing part
in the forests of the Lesser Antilles, where as a pronounced shade-plant it
enveloped all the stems in the gloomy forests with its palm-like leaves,
between which projected its extremely peculiar creamy-white spadices
decked with long filiform staminodes. Sarcinanthus with one species, S.
utiliSj is limited to the forests of Central America and Southern Mexico.

It is easily recognizable in our Figs. 129, 152, and 153, by its bipartite
leaves.
Among other monocotyledonous lianes, besides those mentioned, the
Araceae are in the first rank. The large genera Philodendron, Monstera,
Pothos, and some smaller ones, contain a number of tall large-leaved root-
climbers, that form one of the most striking features of the tropical rain-
forest, particularly in America (Figs. 129, 152).
The stems of these lianes, like those of Carludovica, produce along their
whole length numerous adventitious roots of quite dissimilar anatomical
and physiological natures (Figs. 154, 155). Some are developed as
ancJioring-roots and are relatively short (often 2-3 decimeters, or even less) ;
they are markedly negatively heliotropic, so that they press themselves
