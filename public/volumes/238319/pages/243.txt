thickness as occur in dry tropical districts. They are, on the contrary, more
frequently quite smooth, or marked by shallow longitudinal and transverse
fissures. Indeed, the forma-
tion of cork is often so
poor that moderately thick
stems are green owing to the
chlorophyll of the cortical
layers being visible through
it. It is possible that the phe-
nomenon of cauliflory, which
will be described further on,
is connected with the feeble
development of bark.
Rarely in the forest has
one an opportunity of gain-
ing an insight into the pre-
cise arrangement of the
branches, for to achieve this
the tree must be felled.
In this respect again the
Buitenzorg garden gives
ample opportunity for study,
although it should always
be remembered that, besides
trees of the rain-forest, it
also contains trees of de-
ciduous forest, of littoral
forest, and even of savannah.
The very striking forms of
umbrella-like trees are quite
exceptional in the evergreen
virgin forest — and even then
they are usually giants of
the forest, whose crowns
tower above the general
leaf-canopy — whilst the still
more striking forms of the
trees with their branches in
tiers seem to be entirely
absent from them. Such
forms of trees are far more characteristic of well-lighted, deciduous, more
or less xerophilous forest, of savannah, and of the highest forest region
in the mountains, in short, of a dry climate. The crowns of the trees
