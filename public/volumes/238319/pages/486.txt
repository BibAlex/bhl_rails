most remarkable in East Africa. One of them, Pyrenacantha malvifolia (Olacaceae),
during the dry season reveals only the stem swollen out in monstrous fashion,

convex surface shoots, hardly as thick as one's thumb, which are beset with mallow-
like leaves, and clamber up through the surrounding bushes. The other, Adenia
globosa (Passifloraceae), permanently bears at the top of its tuberous stem cascades of
arching green, switch-like shoots, which bend down to the ground or support them-

ii. THE DESERT DISTRICTS OF WEST AND CENTRAL ASIA.
The great Central Asiatic desert is a north-eastern branch of the desert
of North Africa and Arabia, and extends from the shores of the Caspian
Sea, about 50 E.. up to Eastern China, at about 120 E.
It is split into a western portion, extending from the Caspian Sea to the
Tian Shan, and an eastern portion, extending from these mountains to the

to the cold temperate belt and possess an extreme climate.
