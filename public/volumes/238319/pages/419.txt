ZONES AND REGIONS [Pt. Ill, Sect. II
The district between the river Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains
possesses typical grassland climate, which it owes in the first place to the
dry winter and the uniformly moist early summer, and, in the second place,
to the moderate amount of its rainfall. It may also be added, that the hos-
tility of the cold winter to trees is increased by frequent north winds
accompanied by severe frost. This district is that of the treeless steppes,
known as prairies.
The plateau between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra has, for the most
part, a desert climate to which the character of its vegetation completely
corresponds.
Finally, the Pacific district, except in its southern desert-like portion,
possesses a pronounced woodland climate ; to the moderate precipitations
in Central California there correspond the xerophilous woodlands ; to the
abundant precipitations of the North with its cold winter correspond the
tropophilous high-forests.
The following tables, borrowed from Hann, give the percentages of the
annual rainfall for the Central Atlantic forest district and for the grass-
land prairie district (Nebraska and Kansas) of the same latitude (about
4 o° N.) :—
