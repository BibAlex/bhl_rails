Further south the annual rainfall, except at isolated spots, sinks below
100 cm. The eastern half of Argentina has at most 70-100 cm. of rain-
fall ; in the west the precipitations are less, they sink to 20 cm. and even
fewer, and the country assumes a desert character (the western monte of
Lorentz).
The eastern parts of Uruguay and Argentina, that lie nearer to the
Atlantic, have an annual rainfall mostly as high as 70-100 cm., and are clad
with pure steppe (pampa). West of the pampas there stretches as far as
the Cordilleras, an extensive district of thorn-woodland with a rainfall de-
creasing to the west ; this is the monte-formation of Lorentz, e spinal-forma-
tion of Hieronymus. This woodland district is subdivided into a subdistrict
relatively rich in precipitations, the eastern monte of Lorentz, with about
40-70 cm. rainfall, and another, poor in precipitations, that to a great
extent may be described as desert. The rainfall ranges from less than
20 cm. at the base of the Andes (Pilciao 13 cm., San Juan 7 cm.) to about
40 cm. on the borders of the eastern monte.
Many explorers have been surprised that the eastern humid district should
produce only grass, but the drier western one woods. They did not know
the difference between a grassland- and a woodland-climate, nor how grass
