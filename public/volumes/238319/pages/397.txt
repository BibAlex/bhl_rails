ZONES AND REGIONS [Pt. Ill, Sect. II
All these cultivated plants together cannot in any way give an idea of
the native Mediterranean woodland, whether as forest, maquis, or garigue,
as so many of their components occur only in the wild state. This for
instance is true of the numerous species of Cistus, which are very common,
particularly on silicious soil, and which, owing to their large white or
carmine flowers, are among the
most beautiful native ornamental
plants of Mediterranean coun-
tries ; their leaves are sometimes
leathery and shiny, sometimes
viscous with resinous exuda-
tions, sometimes very hairy, and
then of softer texture. In no
constituent of the maquis, how-
ever, is the sclerophyllous type
more pronounced than in such
inconspicuous and very common
species as Daphne Gnidium (Fig.
a87,i),Phillyrea media (Fig. 287,
4), Cneorum tricoccon (Fig. 276),
Globularia Alypum (Fig. 287,
6), with their rigid, narrow
leaves, which place themselves
obliquely or nearly parallel to
the direction of the rays of light.
The needle-shape is assumed by
the evergreen cladode in the
rarely absent Asparagus acuti-
folius, and by the leaf in the
species of Erica, which are partly
confined to silicious soil, and
among which is Erica multiflora
(Fig. 287, 5), and also E. ar-
borea, which is especially pro-
minent owing to its almost
arboreous growth. Among these
typical sclerophyllous plants ap-
pear a few of somewhat different appearance, such as Pistacia Lentiscus
(Fig. 286), belonging to the sole evergreen woody genus with pinnate leaves
in the Mediterranean countries ; its deciduous and also pinnate-leaved ally,
Pistacia Terebinthus ; the aphyllous Spartium junceum ; or yet again, the
commonest representative of the few climbing plants, Smilax aspera, which,
however, by its stiff, persistent leaves approaches the sclerophyllous type.
