Chap. IV] TROPICAL DISTRICTS CONSTANTLY MOIST 307
in the virgin forest are as a rule oblong, more or less ovoid in shape,
or very irregular.
In the careful descriptions of Koorclers and Valeton 1 , the form of the crown
is given in the case of the majority of the trees described. In nearly all trees of
the evergreen forest of Java this is described as ovoid, or irregular. Trees with
umbrella-shaped or flattened
hemispherical crowns are re-
presented by Parkia biglobosa
(commoner in thin deciduous
forests), Tarrietia (a rare forest
giant with a somewhat flattened
crown), Dysoxylum mollis-
simum (a rare forest giant
reaching 58 meters in height,
with an irregular umbrella-
shaped crown), and Cedrela
febrifuga (a forest giant with
a hemispherical crown, also
occurring in thin deciduous
forests).
The trees of the tropical
rain-forest are far less
branched than those of
forests in temperate zones.
Many tropical trees remain
quite unbranched, for in-
stance tree-ferns, cycads,
palms, and many small
dicotyledonous trees, such
as Carica Papaya, species
of Theophrasta, and Ara-
liaccae. Many commence
to branch only when they
are two or more meters in
height and have a stem
as thick as one's fist, as
in species of Albizzia.
Schizolobium and other
Leguminosae, Cecropia, and the like ; the branches that appear subse-
quently either remain unbranched, or produce merely a few simple lateral
axes (Figs. 144, 145). Frequently, even in very lofty trees, only three
grades of branches occur, for instance in species of Strombosa, Cinchona.
