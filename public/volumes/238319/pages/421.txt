3. CLIMATE AND VEGETATION IN RUSSIA.
Southern Russia is occupied by treeless steppes, which, in the north and
west, assume the character of meadow, with groups of trees and bushes
becoming ever more and more numerous until they gradually give place
to forests ; to the east and south-east, on the contrary, their vegetation
becomes scantier and they merge into the Caspian desert. On the south
the steppe is bounded by the Black Sea.
