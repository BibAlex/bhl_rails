an Atlantic Northern forest (i on Map 4) and a Pacific Northern forest
(A on Map 4).
The subpolar forest extends, not as a connected area towards the south,

wide districts of grassland and desert. The southern continuation of the
Pacific Northern forest, like the main forest itself, is composed of conifers,
and, at first, represents a belt which extends over about two degrees of
latitude, and, south of 53째, is divided by the desert district of the Great

the most luxuriant if not also the most diversified on the continent.
