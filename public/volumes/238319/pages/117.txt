THE FACTORS
[Part I
is a rather large black bird, unfortunately undetermined, which eats the
petals greedily.
ii, ENTOMOPHILOUS FLOWERS.
The number of flowers adapted for pollination by insects is far greater
than that of flowers adapted for pollination by birds, even in places
where there are ex-
cellent pollinators
among the birds.
Whilst however or-
nithophily shows a
restricted range of
distribution, entomo-
phily has been proved
to exist in all floras,
even up to the limits
of phanerogamic ve-
getation. Only three
classes of insects are
specially active as
pollinating agents,
Diptera, Lepidoptera,
and Hymenoptera,
whereas other insects
are either of no im-
portance or of merely
subsidiary importance
in this respect, and
appear to have called
forth no specially
adapted form of flow-
ers. The three most
important groups of
pollinating agents are
however present
wherever flowers exist,
and have everywhere
caused adaptations
through natural selection ; but their relative numbers are often very
unequal, and this inequality repeats itself in the relative number of
flowers specially adapted for pollination by Diptera, Lepidoptera, and
Hymenoptera respectively. A comparison between cold, temperate, and
warm districts, or between islands and continents, is often very instructive
in this respect.
