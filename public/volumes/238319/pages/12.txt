PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION
The movement which finds expression at the present moment
in the study of Oecological Botany amongst English students of
plant-life everywhere is the fruition of that earlier movement in
the direction of strict observational morphology and experimental
physiology which, in the latter half of last century, received its
greatest impetus from the lucid work of Sachs, illumined by that
of Darwin. Upon that earlier movement the edition of Sachs'
'Textbook of Botany,' published by the Clarendon Press in 1875,
had a profound influence. We believe that this edition of Schimper's
' Plant-Geography' will have no less influence upon the movement
now in progress, and on that ground the volume is a most im-
portant addition to the series of standard botanical books issued
from Oxford. There is not, at the present time, any English
book dealing comprehensively with the subject of Oecological
Botany, and this edition therefore should be welcomed. Its
' precise statement of pending questions ' should not only ' stimulate
research,' as the author hoped, but should also have a steadying
influence in a field of investigation which tempts to trifling.
The untimely death of the author shortly after the translation
was begun has robbed the English edition of modifications and
improvements which he had intended to make, and the book
stands as it is in the German edition.
A portrait of the author and a sympathetic sketch of his
life-work have been prefixed to the translation.
The translator has had the active and valuable co-operation
of Mrs. Schlich in the preparation of his translation. The Index
is also the work of the translator.
Upon critical points the opinion and advice of many colleagues
have been sought for and obtained, formally and informally ; to all
of them grateful thanks are tendered here.
