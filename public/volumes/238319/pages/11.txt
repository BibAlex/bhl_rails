viii AUTHOR'S PREFACE
following : — The directors of the botanical museums and gardens at
Berlin, Buitenzorg, and Kew, Prof. Drude (Dresden), Prof. Dudley
(California), Prof. Flahault(Montpellier), Prof. Hieronymus (Berlin),
Dr. Kornicke (Bonn), Prof. Noll (Bonn), Geheimrath Prof. Pntzci
(Heidelberg), Obergartner Purpus (Darmstadt), Geheimrath Prof.
Rein (Bonn), Prof. Trabut (Algiers), Prof. Volkens (Berlin).
Most of the illustrations of plants were drawn from nature
by Mr. R. Anheisser under my personal supervision and to my
complete satisfaction. Relatively few plates are borrowed from
other books.
Of the four maps, only the third is original and is intended
merely as a preliminary outline. The treatment of the vegetation
in Brazil is based on a sketch kindly placed at my disposal by
Prof. H. Schenck.
General works on plant-geography are seldom cited in the
lists of literature at the end of the chapters. The student of
plant-geography must become familiar with the following works
of this character : —
Candolle, Alph. de. Geographie botanique raisonnee. Geneve,
1855.
Drude, O. Handbuch der Pflanzengeographie. Stuttgart, 1890.
,, Atlas der Pflanzenverbreitung. Gotha, 1877.
Engler, A. Versuch einer Entwicklungsgeschichte der Pflan-
zenwelt. Leipzig, 1879, 1882.
Grisebach, A. Die Vegetation der Erde nach ihrer klimatischen
Anordnung. Leipzig, 1872. French ed. by Tchiatcheff.
Paris, 1877.
In conclusion, it is my pleasing duty to offer my sincere
thanks to Dr. G. Fischer, the publisher, for the great readiness he
has shown in meeting all my wishes.
A. F. W. SCHIMPER.
Bonn,
End of July, 1898.
