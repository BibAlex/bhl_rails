i. THE KINDS OF CLIMATIC FORMATIONS IN THE
TROPICS.
Tropical wood/and, so far as its character depends 011 climate and not
on definite effects of the soil, may be divided into four kinds â€” Rain-forest,
Monsoon-forest, SavannaJi-forest, Thorn-forest. Close shrub-formations
are rare under favourable physical and chemical conditions of the soil ;
wherever the climate is too dry for forests, they are replaced by open,
half-desert and desert-like formations, in which xerophilous shrubs play
the chief part, but trees are not always absent.
The Rain-forest (Fig. ] 24) is evergreen, hygrophilous in character,
at least thirty meters high, but usually much taller, rich in thick-stemmed
lianes, and in woody as well as herbaceous epiphytes.
The Monsoon-forest (Fig. 125) is more or less leafless during the dry
season, especially towards its termination, is tropophilous in character,
usually less lofty than the rain-forest, rich in woody lianes, rich in herba-
ceous but poor in woody epiphytes.
The Savannah-forest (Fig. 127) is more or less leafless during the dry
season, rarely evergreen, is xerophilous in character, usually, often much,
less than twenty meters high, park-like, very poor in underwood, lianes,
and epiphytes, rich in terrestrial herbs, especially in grasses.
The Thorn-forest (Fig. 1 28), as regards foliage and average height, resembles
savannah-forest, but it is more xerophilous, is very rich in underwood
and in slender-stemmed lianes, poor in terrestrial herbs, especially in
grasses, and usually has no epiphytes. Thorn-plants are always plentiful.
The different types of forest are connected by intermediate forms, and
