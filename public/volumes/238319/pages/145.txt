heaps it up into dunes (Fig. 97). The formations of the sandy sea-
shore and of dunes serve as excellent examples of the vegetation of
psammophytes, which are specially well developed in such spots. These
sandy strips of coast are usually subdivided into three zones— the foreshore,
between the ordinary high tide-mark and low tide-mark, the fiat mid-shore,
above the ordinary high tide-mark, and the dunes, which are heaped up
like hills between the shore and the mainland.
Dunes are not always present. The sandy coast frequently rises quite
gradually, without any sharp separating line, into woodland or grassland, or the

mainland rises abruptly beyond the flat shore, without assuming the character of
dunes. Such is the case either when the stretch of coast is relatively calm or
where the sand is either coarse-grained or largely mixed with pebbles and there-
fore heavier for transport by the wind.
The following description of the vegetation on the sandy sea-shore of
Java can be taken generally as representative of the conditions of vegeta-
tion in such habitats: —
The southern coast of Java is in parts covered with tracts of dunes
quite similar to those which, for instance, are so extensive along the
