INTRODUCTION.
Even at a short distance outside the tropics, indeed occasionally within
them, for instance in South China, the periodic change of temperature
makes its influence felt on vegetation. With otherwise equally favour-
able conditions as regards moisture a retardation in the phenomena
of plant-life is unmistakable, and the times of flowering are rigidly
associated with the alternation of cold and hot seasons. Such dependence
is specially evident in plants when they are transplanted from higher into
lower latitudes. Thus the periodic phenomena of introduced Central
European broad-leaved trees in Madeira, where the mean temperature
of the coldest month (January) is 15 C. and that of the hottest (August)
22-2Â° C, resemble those in their native country ; and Viola odorata in Santa
Catharina (South Brazil) produces its entomophilous flowers, according to
F. Muller, from March until December, but at the height of summer
usually bears cleistogamous flowers only.
The lower the winter temperatures, the greater of course becomes the
difference in the vegetation in the cold and hot seasons respectively, in
particular where there is a moist summer-climate. In districts with a
dry summer, for instance the steppes, and to a still greater degree in
