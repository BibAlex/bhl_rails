The Greater Antilles, Jamaica, Hayti, and Cuba possess partly high-forest, partly thorn-
forest or perhaps savannah. It is impossible to give from the available literature any
distinct impression of the vegetation of these islands.
6. CLIMATE OF TROPICAL AFRICA.
A frequent alternation of forest and savannah reveals itself on the west
coast of tropical Africa.
True desert stops a little south of the tropic of Cancer and is replaced by a still
very scanty open woodland vegetation, with Adansonia digitata and Borassus
flabelliformis (Saint Louis, 16 N., 16 33' W., with rainfall 42 cm. ; Goree, I4°39' N.,
17° 24' W., with rainfall of 53 cm.). Tree-growth becomes richer and more luxuriant
further south. Round Sierra Leone (rainfall of 319 cm.) plains and mountains are
covered with high-forest. On the Ivory and Gold coasts (Elmina, 5 4' N., i°2o' W.,
with rainfall of 72 cm. ; Christiansborg, 5 32' N., o° 8' W., with rainfall of 58 cm.) the
vegetation is again poorer. East of Akra, in the Gulf of Benin, true savannah with
fan-palms prevails (Lagos, 9 26' N., 3 30' E., with rainfall of 172 cm., from two years'
observations) ; the country at the mouth of the river Niger (4 17' N., 6° 4' E.) and that
of Kamerun (4 N., 9 40' E., with rainfall of 249 cm.) and Gabun (o° 22' N., 9 23' E.,
with rainfall of 226 cm.) are all covered with rain-forest ; in the highlands of Gabun,
however, savannah rich in trees predominates. South of the Ogowe (o°4o' S., 9 E.)
the savannah gains the mastery even along the coast, and rain-forest is found by rivers
and lagoons only. In Jumba, forest (rain-forest ?), interrupted by savannah, reappears
up to the mouth of the Kiulu, south of which savannah with fan-palms and baobab-
trees predominates (Chinchosho, 5 9' S., 12 4' E., with rainfall of 108 cm.). The last
