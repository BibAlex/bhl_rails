ZONES AND REGIONS [Pt. Ill, Sect. II
and on the lower region of the Sierra Nevada, there are evergreen bushes
and shrubs, among which oaks almost alone dominate over wide areas.
Close to the sea, Cupressus macrocarpa (Fig. 304) is often seen, either
growing in the open or in thin woods.
Descriptions of the character of the vegetation on the coast of California are very
rare. According to C. A- Purpus, in the south-west Sierra Nevada, Quercus Dou-
glasii, Hook, et Arn.,
covers the lower slopes;
at about 2,000 feet a
vegetation of trees and
shrubs of quite a
different composition
commences; these are
the so-called chapar-
rals (Fig. 299), which
clothe a large part of
the Coast Range with
a vegetation that
throughout is similar
in physiognomy and in
the composition of the
flora. Quercus chryso-
lepis, Liebm.( Figs. 269,
275), stands pre-emi-
nent among the trees,
owing to its size and
frequent occurrence.
With it occur the like-
wise evergreen Q.Wis-
lizeni, A. DC, and the
deciduous Q. Kelloggii,
Newb., both tree-
forms, whilst the no
less characteristic Q.
Breweri, Engelm., re-
mains shrubby, and
forms almost impene-
trable thickets. The characteristic shrubs are, in the first place, the rosaceous
Adenostoma fasciculatum, Hook, et Arn. (Fig. 300, 2), an evergreen heath-like
shrub, with flowers like a Spiraea, frequently forming extensive pure thickets.
Common and characteristic also is Ceanothus cuneatus, Nutt. (Fig. 300, 3), a bushy
shrub, attaining a height of two meters, bearing white or bright blue flowers,
and likewise showing a tendency to grow socially and to form a dense thicket.
Purpus further mentions the large-blossomed sterculiaceous Fremontia californica,
Torr., the deciduous Aesculus californica, Nutt., the rosaceous Cercocarpus parvi-
Fig. 304. Cupressus macrocarpa, Harlw., the Monterey cypress
on the sea-coast near San Francisco. From a photograph.
