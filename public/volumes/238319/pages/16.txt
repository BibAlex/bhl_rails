AN APPRECIATION xv
Much more attention he devoted to the adaptive nature of
structural peculiarities fitting- the plants for their mode of life.
He asked whether particular peculiarities of a plant were truly
adaptive, that is, whether they had been evolved for the specific
purpose of enabling- the plant to exist in its present surroundings,
or to what extent they were previously possessed by the plant,
thus enabling it to enter its present home. This entailed an
investigation into the structure of allied plants living under other
surroundings. As examples of such comparative investigations
may be cited Schimper's discussions on the velamen of orchids
and aroids, on vivipary in mangrove-plants, on mechanisms of
seed-dispersal of littoral plants, and in particular on the evolution
of floating tissue, which he investigated by comparisons between
the fruits of inland and littoral species of one genus. His investi-
gation of the myrmecophilous Cecropia is an excellent example of
this method. Having demonstrated the necessity of the protec-
tion against leaf-cutting ants, and having recalled known facts, that
the Cecropia supplies food and home to the protecting army of
ants, Schimper rendered probable the adaptive nature of the
food-bodies by showing their composition and behaviour, and their
absence in a non-myrmecophilous species of Cecropia likewise
growing in Brazil ; and by a further comparison of the two species
he also showed that there was a definite structural adaptation
for facilitating the entrance of the protective ants into the hollow
internodes of the myrmecophilous plant.
Change in the environment occasions change in the composi-
tion and oecology of the vegetation. There is thus between the
oecology and the geographical distribution of plants a reciprocal
relation which renders observations on either of these subjects
helpful in the explanation of the other.
Observations on the local distribution of types of vegetation,
in that they deal with variations of environment associated with
little or no change in climate, frequently render possible the recog-
nition of the factors determining- the original formation of definite
communities of plants, and the analysis of the primary and some
of the secondary factors influencing the structure of the consti-
tuent plants. It was by observations on the local distribution of
epiphytes in the American tropics that Schimper was able to
