unfit for cultivation, changing from loamy clay to pure sand ; the surface is covered
with fragments of silicious rock, ferruginous sand, and ironstone; of water in these
tracts there is no indication. The vegetation is of a stunted character, and the scrub
is nearly destitute of grasses and other herbage ; the few genera of the first are
mostly Neurachne, Stipa, Isolepis, Spinifex, the well-known kangaroo grass, An-
thistiria ciliata, and a few Juncaceae, viz. Xerotes glauca, R. Br., and X. filiformis,
R. Br. ; these grow only in tufts, considerably apart from each other. The absence
of other herbage is as great during the summer; but this almost entire deficiency is

compensated by an endless variety of genera and species of shrubs. The general
impression given by the scrub is dismal, although the great variety of shrubby plants
associated there make it highly interesting to the botanist. These shrubs reach
generally the height of four to six feet, interspersed with stunted and ramified trees
of the genera Casuarina (Casuarinaceae), Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae), Santalum (Santa-
laceae), Melaleuca (Myrtaceae), Exocarpus (Santalaceae), Camphoromyrtus (Myrta-
ceae), Dodonaea (Sapindaceae), Frenela (Coniferae), Banksia (Proteaceae, Fig. 297,
