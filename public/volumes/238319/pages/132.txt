direct rays of the sun, and should therefore necessarily assume about the same
temperature as the soil. Care was also taken that the seedling-trees experimented
with, and which stood in the forest-nursery at Mariabrunner, should be under
external conditions at least approximately similar to those of the different parts
of the crowns of trees in the forest.

Von Hohnel came to the conclusion regarding the amount of water used by
a hectare 1 of beech high-forest 115 years old, that 'according to various
assumptions it amounts to 3.587,000-5,380,000 kilograms of water during the
vegetative season. A beech wood, fifty to sixty years old, during the six months'
vegetative season transpired 2,330,900 kilograms per hectare, and a beech-pole
wood, thirty to forty years old, transpired in the same period 680,000 kilograms. 1
Since the total rainfall, roughly speaking, during the whole year amounted to
7,000,000 kilograms, it corresponded excellently with the results of the transpira-
tion obtained in the experiment 2 .
Besides the few trees that are hygrophilous during the vegetative season,
and alone occur in Central Europe, there are also some that are markedly
xerophilous, in fact some that will thrive on the driest desert-soil. It may-
prove to be one of the most interesting tasks for future botanical travellers
to investigate the conditions of life of these markedly xerophilous trees,
for example those that appear in great variety in dry savannahs and in
tropical deserts.
The depth of their root-system renders it possible for trees to thrive in
areas where long seasons of drought accompanied by great heat recur
periodically, as in the Mediterranean countries, in Cisgangetic India,
and in the Soudan. The incorrectness of the opinion frequently held,
that forest for its proper development requires atmospheric precipitations
at all seasons of the year, but especially during the vegetative season,
is satisfactorily shown by the occurrence of forest in regions with hot
dry seasons.
