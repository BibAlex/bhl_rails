Ch. V] WARM TEMPERATE MOIST WINTER DISTRICTS 513
It were premature to attempt to interpret, on the basis of available
climatic data, the above-mentioned peculiarities of sclerophyllous plants
and of their communities, and, in particular, the distinctions between them
and other xerophytes. There is a wide field open for exact physio-
logical research into this matter. Yet we are already in a position to
demonstrate with probability the utility of the most striking character of

sclerophyllous plants, their evergreen foliage. Vegetation in sclerophyllous
districts, as a matter of fact, is subject to only short yet frequent and

and sometimes to summer drought ; at the same time, only short periods
afford optimal conditions in regard to temperature and moisture. More-
