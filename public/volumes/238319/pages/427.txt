a dry winter and a rainy summer ; the climate bears the character of
a grassland climate, and natural steppe and meadow actually occur over
extensive areas. The feature in steppe districts that is specially hostile to
trees, the prevalence of strong dry winds in winter, is wanting here, for in
the winter the air is very calm. In Eastern Siberia, where but little rain
falls, tree-growth is consequently richer, in the prevailing form of dry thin
coniferous forests ; whilst grasslands and clumps of forest alternate with
one another near the Amur. What climatic or edaphic influences determine
the occurrence of either type of vegetation in this alternation is not yet
decided.
