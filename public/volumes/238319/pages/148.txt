THE FORMATIONS

In many other respects also, Spinifex squarrosus exhibits a close
connexion between structure and mode of life, for example in its leaves,
the waxy coating and structure of which express the difficulty in
obtaining water on the high permeable and salty dunes. Its spherical
infructescence, however, formed of stiff bristles and nearly as big as
one's head, claims special attention. When it is ripe, it breaks off from
its dry stalk and becomes the sport of the wind. Rolling and dancing,
it is hurried along the smooth surface of the sand and allows its fruits
to drop. The bristles are gradually worn away, and the infructescence,

fruits.
Spinifex squarrosus, as regards its mode of growth, belongs to a very
widespread type. A peculiar type, on the other hand, is formed by
the species of Pandanus on the sandy sea-shores, which become firmly
anchored in the shifting sand by prop-roots that grow down from the
branches (Fig. 122).
In many plants living on the sandy sea-shore, at all events particularly
in those that occupy sheltered spots, such obvious adaptations do not
