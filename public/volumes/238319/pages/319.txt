ZONES AND REGIONS
[Pt. Ill, Sect. I
Fig. 213 numerous young plants of Rhizophora mucronata, in various
stages of development, are visible in a shallow pool, evidently of quite
recent origin, on the shore. In other Rhizophoraceae belonging to the
mangrove the seedlings are smaller than in R. mucronata and not always
markedly club-shaped (Figs. 218 and 219).
Vivipary is also exhibited by Aegiceras majus and Avicennia officinalis.
The seedlings of Aegi-
ceras are curved like horns,
and are smaller than those
of the Rhizophoraceae ;
they remain enclosed in
the thin pericarp of the
fruit. Those of Avicennia
which fall, sometimes sur-
rounded by the leathery
pericarp that dehisces sub-
sequently, and at other
times without it, are pro-
vided with a bent and
densely hairy hypocotyl
and with two large cotyle-
dons. The hairs are stiff
and curved upwards, and
fix the seedling to the mud.
In the remaining man-
grove-plants vivipary does
not occur; but the seed-
lings of some species, in
particular those of Acan-
thus ilicifolius and, in
America, of Laguncularia
racemosa, are always
further developed than is
usual in inland plants.
On proceeding more into the interior of the mangrove we find that other
woody species join Rhizophora mucronata and become dominant with
increasing distance from the sea. Bruguiera gymnorrhiza surpasses all
other mangrove-trees in size (Fig. 220). Other species of Bruguiera.
Rhizophora conjugata, Ceriops Candolleana and Kandelia Rheedii, are
smaller trees or shrubs. Sonneratia acida (Fig. 221), which often forms
pure mangrove, is likewise a small tree ; the allied and similar Sonneratia
alba prefers stony ground, and frequently grows by itself in open situations,
outside the true mangrove. Avicennia officinalis also frequently forms
