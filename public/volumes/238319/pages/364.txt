Ch. IV] WARM TEMPERATE MOIST SUMMER DISTRICTS 473
Colopogonium australe, Rhynchosia melanosticta ; Euphorbiaceae, like Tragia volu-
bilis and T. dodecandra ; Malpighiaceae (Heteropteris glabra, Janusia guaranitica) ;
Sapindaceae (Serjania fulta and S. faveolata) ; Cucurbitaceae (Cyclanthera tamni-
folia, Prasopcpon cucumifolius, Sicyos montana). The herbaceous terrestrial flora
is poor; it is composed of a few ferns, broad-leaved grasses, the phytolaccaceous
Petiveria alliacea, and other Dicotyledones chiefly with inconspicuous flowers.

The northern continuation of the tropical rain-forest on the east coast
of America, in Mexico, Louisiana, Florida, also exhibits tropical features
(Fig. 243) foreign to the true temperate forest which will be described
further on, such as Araceae climbing on a temperate form of tree (Fig. 238),
and tree-like epiphytic fig-trees of the banyan-type, but of less huge dimen-
sions (Fig. 239). On the coast of Louisiana and in Central and North
Florida, reminiscences of the tropics are much weaker as regards both
the oecology and the flora ; evergreen oaks (Ouercus virens, Figs. 240, 241)
predominate; the palms belong to temperate species of Sabal, and only
