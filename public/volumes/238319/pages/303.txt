deviations from the climatic type as regards both the nature of the flora
and its oecology. Swampy ground is frequently occupied by pure woods
of certain species of palms. Thus, in Trinidad, I observed Mauritia
setigera forming the sole vegetation in swampy parts of the savannah
of Aripo ; in Venezuela and Brazil, other species of Mauritia (M. vinifera,
M. flexuosa) similarly congregate to form pure woods ; Phoenix paludosa
grows socially in the swamps of the Ganges delta, and so on. Certainly
mixed forests are not wanting on swampy ground, but they are usually
much less rich in species, in particular as regards large trees, than those of
less wet soil. The best known among them are the mangroves of the

tropical shores within reach of tides ; they owe their peculiarities partly
to the saline nature of the substratum, and will be dealt with later on in
connexion with other littoral formations. In contrast with mangrove, the
mixed forest of fresh-water swamps in the interior of Burma, Sumatra,
and Borneo (Fig. 208), has hitherto been very little studied, although
it seems to afford much that is characteristic as regards both flora and
oecology.
Kurz states 1 that swamp-forest is 'the most curious forest in Burma, and of
great interest to the botanist. In fact, its constituent plants are so dissimilar to
