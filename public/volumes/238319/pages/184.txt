Chap. I] CHARACTERS OF THE TROPICAL CLIMATE 229
Mainly, but not exclusively, tropical are the Cyatkeaceae, to which almost
all tree-ferns belong (species of Cyathea, Dicksonia, Alsophila), and the
Hymcnophyllaccac, small, frequently moss-like herbs with transparent
foliage, which cover stems of trees and rocks in moist, shady forests, just
as mosses do with us.
The great mass of tropical ferns belongs to the order Polypodiaccae, which
is also so strongly represented in Europe, and to a considerable extent by
the same genera, namely Polypodium, Aspidium, Asplenium, Pteris, and
so on. Only a few rare Polypodiaceae are tree-like.

The Lycopodiaceac are much less prominent than the ferns, but neverthe-
less of greater significance than in temperate floras. Species of Selaginella
often form the chief covering of the forest soil ; Lycopodium cernuum is
extremely common in well-lighted spots ; other species of Lycopodium as
well as of Psilotum are occasionally common epiphytes.
The Eqitisctaccac are not more strongly represented than in the
temperate zones.
