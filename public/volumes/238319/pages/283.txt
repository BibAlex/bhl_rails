Detmer, who saw the caatingas of the province of Bahia in September (the month
of passage from the dry to the rainy season), makes the following remarks : —
' The dry soil consists of greyish-white loose sand. On it are growing every-
where thorny shrubs, for the most part quite leafless, and forming a dense
undergrowth, which is impenetrable in places and here and there is slightly
overtopped by isolated trees. Between the shrubs often grow a great number of
" mandacarus," trees of Cereus, 20 feet high, the massive stems of which, woody at
the base, give place above to a few thick 4-5 angled ramified branches, which are
studded with long thorns. The soil between the shrubs is covered by very large

After Warming.
" gravattas " — terrestrial Bromeliaceae, with half-parched, sharp-edged leaves,
grouped in rosettes, above which their dried inflorescences project ; in addition
there are only a few other plants, some of which bear greyish-green, extremely
hairy leaves. Short palms with palmate or pinnate leaves are also plentiful.'
Thorn-bush similar to that of the caatingas also appears in South Brazil
at Minas Geraes (Fig. 194). According to Liais and Warming, it is there
confined to rocky limestone hills, and differs from the neighbouring forests
by the much more complete defoliation, by the greater abundance of shrubs
