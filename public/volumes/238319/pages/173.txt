season in tropical continental districts, and must be of considerable im-
portance in relation to geographical botany ; it is well known that in
Bengal thin sheets of water freeze during the night in the dry season.
In districts on the coast, in the forest, and on the hills the cooling induced
at night-time by radiation is much less, thanks to the large amount of
water-vapour in the air, although physiologically it is by no means in-
significant.
The following table gives a summary of mean temperatures in parallel
belts of the tropical zone : —

iii. LIGHT AND THE ULTRA-VIOLET RAYS.
The intensity of the rays of light, like that of the heat-rays, is naturally
greater within than beyond the tropics, and the tropical daylight is
brighter than that of the temperate or polar zones. This feature may
be directly observed in the clearer reflection from the surface of water
and also from that of foliage when wet with rain, and it is very noticeable
in photographs taken in the tropics. True as this is of the luminous rays,
it is equally true of the chemically effective ultra-violet part of the
spectrum.
In the tropical districts of America and of the Asiatic islands that I know, the
intensity of light is however not so strong as in East Africa, regarding the conditions
of light of which P. Reichard writes as follows : ' In the natural features around us,
the dazzling brightness of the air is most striking. The more vertical tropical sun
produces a much brighter light than in Europe. At first the eyes can barely endure
the glare, so that one is obliged to wear blue spectacles and to draw one's hat
down over one's eyes 2 .'
There are no direct comparative observations regarding the intensity
of luminous radiation for different latitudes, but some observations have
been made regarding the chemical rays. Thus simultaneous observa-
tions at Kew and at Para in Brazil on three April days of the year 1 866
showed an intensity of chemical action nearly twenty times greater at Para
than at Kew ; even in August it was 3-3 times greater at Para.
