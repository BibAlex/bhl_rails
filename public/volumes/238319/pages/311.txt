bound together by a confused mass of delicate climbing plants. Should
the trees be less dense, the spaces between them are occupied by stubby
underwood in which young trees struggle for space with true shrubs and
small Pandani, or Crinum asiaticum forms thickets five or six feet high
between the tree-trunks.
' The leaves of these plants are frequently quite large, but nevertheless
they exhibit in their structure the effects of unfavourable conditions in
reference to transpiration, especially in the outer fringe of the formation,
where the soil is richest in salts. The foliage of the larger trees is either
very dense, or, as with so many denizens of dry districts, is disposed
umbrella-like or in tiers ; the leaves are thick and leathery (Calophyllum

juicy (Scaevola Koenigii, Pemphis acidula, Morinda citrifolia, Clerodendron
inerme, Tournefortia argentea, Ximenia americana), frequently in their
younger parts densely hairy (Pemphis acidula, Sophora tomentosa, Tourne-
fortia, Thespesia populnea, Heritiera littoralis), rarely provided with a coat-
ing of varnish (Dodonaea viscosa). Casuarina equisetifolia reminds one, on
a larger scale, of the species of Tamarix in the Mediterranean region ; the
finely pinnate species of Albizzia and Acacia, the bulbous plants, the
narrow and hard -leaved grass, recall dry savannah and steppe.
' As the distance from the sea increases, the protective measures against
transpiration become less pronounced ; the thick, juicy leaves of Clero-
