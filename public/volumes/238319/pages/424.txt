4. THE HUNGARIAN PLAIN.
The steppe of the Hungarian plain exhibits close climatic similarity to
that of South Russia. Hann mentions as its characteristics when con-
trasted with the surrounding forest district — greater extremes of tempera-
ture, limitation of the period free from frost to the actual summer months,
a drier summer (i.e. late summer) and autumn, and dry winds.
Hunfalvy's monograph 1 gives more detailed data regarding the climate of
the Hungarian steppe: —
' In both basins (of the lowland) January is the coldest month, and the mean tempera-
ture sinks everywhere below 0° R. . . . The mean temperature of February is 1-3
degrees higher at some stations, but is still below o° at others. The mean tempera-
ture of March is 3-4 degrees higher than that of February. In April, May, and
June the temperature rises still higher, and attains its maximum in July (at some
stations in June or August). In September and October the mean tempera-
ture falls only moderately, but so much the more rapidly in November and
December. In the western and southern border district, January is relatively
milder than in the lowland, but the summer months also are less hot, and the
temperature of the hottest and coldest months reaches only 16-19 , whilst in the
lowland it is 17-21 .'
On the average the mean relative atmospheric humidity, according to the different
seasons of the year, is as follows: —

The table shows that the relative atmospheric humidity is least in the lowland
and greatest in the highland. In the lowland, however, the average minima of atmo-
spheric humidity are very low, as the following table shows : —
