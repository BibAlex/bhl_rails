The group of branch-climbers \ like that of leaf-climbers, represents
phylogenetically a low degree of liane. The climbing branches in the
least adapted cases differ from ordinary branches by their irritability
only, and are provided with lateral shoots and leaves (Figs. 103, 104).
Branch-climbers are confined to
the tropics and the adjoining re-
gions. Examples occur among
the Polygalaceae, Papilionaceae,
Mimosaceae, Connaraceae, and
other families.
The two following groups
are also tropical and their re-
presentatives are not generally
known.
The climbing organs of hook-
climbers - are metamorphosed
thorns or flower-stalks, which,
after embracing the support,
become considerably thickened.
Examples are found in many
Anonaceae, Loganiaceae, Di-
pterocarpaceae, Rubiaceae, and
elsewhere (Fig. 105).
The watch-spring climbers''
have thin, spirally coiled, bare
climbing organs, which, owing
to the stimulus of contact,
become thicker and harder.
They are found in several
Rhamnaceae and Sapindaceae
(Figs. 106, 107).
The most comprehensive
group of plants endowed with
axial climbing organs is that of
stem-tendril climbers, the climb-
ing organs of whichoften closely
agree in their external features,
as well as in physiological characters, with leaf-tendril climbers; but their
axial nature is often betrayed externally not only by their position but also
by the presence of rudimentary leaves, as in the vine. The group includes
many species, for example in the families of the Vitaceae and Passifloraceae.
