THE FORMATIONS

North Sea. Behind the sandy shore, here rich in lime, there rises first
a range of dunes poor in plants, behind which there are dunes that are
better clad and which serve as a transition to the mainland. Only the
flat shore and the dunes lying nearest the sea exhibit in their vegetation
the characteristic influence of the habitat. Difficulty in fixing themselves
to the loose substratum, difficulty in obtaining a supply of water, a
struggle against the sea-wind, the use of the wind for the transport of
fruits on the smooth sandy surface, all these may at once be inferred
from the remarkable forms that occur.

Adaptations in relation to such conditions are combined in the
clearest manner in Spinifex squarrosus, a rigid bluish grass, with large
globular inflorescences and infructescences T , which latter appear to be
composed of long radially arranged needles, the very long bracts.
Frequently Spinifex alone covers the outermost dunes bounding the Indian
Ocean with numerous apparently independent tufts ; a closer inspection
shows that, in many cases, even widely separated tufts are united by
stolons more or less imbedded in sand, varying in thickness from that

hirsutus.
