beech-woods in early summer, whereas yellowish, brownish, grey, olive-like
tints compose a picture somewhat gloomy but one tinted with innumerable
shades. Here and there on the duller ground glows the bright patch of
the flowering crown of a tree. When I was approaching the coast of
Trinidad in winter, the flowering erythrinas resembled so many fires in
the dark forest. So, in Java, I could recognize the puspa-tree (Gordonia
Wallichii) at a great distance by its snow-white flowers. By the mere
tints of their foliage a native can recognize valuable trees in the richly
figured tapestry of the canopy of the forest. Thus, the cascarilleros of

the Andes look for an elevated point from which they can fix the position
in the forest of the scattered quinine trees.
Even the side view of the tropical rain-forest differs essentially from
that of a European forest ; it is not as with us bounded above by a nearly
level line, but is irregularly jagged, crested, and furrowed (Figs. 131, 132).
In a natural condition, for instance on the bank of water-courses, such side
views of the forest are so overhung with lianes and epiphytes that the
stems are quite invisible and even the crowns appear veiled. In an
artificial side view, due to a forest-clearing, the great diversity in the
tree-trunks, the irregular tangle of lianes, and the variety in the forms of
the foliaged crowns forcibly strike the eye (Fig. 130).
