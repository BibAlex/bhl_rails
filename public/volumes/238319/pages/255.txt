directly against the support ; they grow nearly horizontally, whether it be
owing to diageotropism or to rectipetality. In the histological structure
of the anchoring-roots the mechanical elements are prominent, particularly
in the form of tough fibres, whilst the conducting elements are very poorly
developed (Fig. 155, #)â€¢
The absorbing-roots are markedly positively geotropic and grow down-

wards without branching until they reach the ground ; once there, apical
growth usually ceases soon, while numerous lateral roots spring from the
apical region and descend vertically into the soil. The same thing happens
if the roots reach water. In many species, the absorbing-roots creep over
the surface of the bark, alongside of their own stem ; but in others,
particularly in those that climb high up among the branches, the absorbing-
roots descend freely through the air, and, after emitting terrestrial roots,
