THE FACTORS

not attributable to the mechanical action of the wind. On the contrary,
as Focke was the first to state, the wind must have a power that is directly
destructive of life, as is shown by ' the numerous short stiff projecting
branches which are to be seen on the tops of shrubs and in the crowns of
trees, chiefly on their windward side, in exposed places, and which do not
exhibit any trace of external injury 1 ' (Fig. 51). The directly fatal
influence is, as Kihlman pointed out, the excessive increase of transpiration
caused by the wind. When the wind blows during frosty weather— a time
when the loss of water cannot be made up by a supply from the soil and
from the stem— its action can easily become destructive. Injuries by frost,

as has already been shown 2 , are not ordinarily attributable to the tem-
perature in itself, but are due to desiccation during the frost.
Evaporation is however universally weaker at low than at high tempera-
tures, yet dry, cold winds possess an extraordinarily strong drying power.
A striking example is mentioned by Middendorff, who, on a windy and
frosty day, hung outside his tent a leather glove which after being washed
had frozen stiff — in an hour's time it was completely dry. The drying
action of the wind and its effects are, as will be shown in a later chapter 3 ,
of great geographical importance, since they determine the limits of tree-
growth both towards the Poles and in a vertical direction.
