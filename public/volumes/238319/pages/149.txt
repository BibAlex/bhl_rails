occur. Yet compared with other plants they have always an extra-
ordinarily deep and extensive root-system.
Sandy shore-formations, similar to those by the sea, are also found
by many saline or fresh-water inland lakes; but there the dunes are
usually less pronounced in character, owing to the reduced strength of
the wind and the smaller amount of sand. The formations in question
have been described in much detail and in a very instructive manner
by Conway MacMillan, as they occur about the Lake of the Woods,
Fig. 99. Dunes on the lie anx Sables, Lake of the Woods, Minnesota. Populus tremuloides,
Juniperus communis, and Primus pumila in the foreground and to the left; Elymus canadensis and
Artemisia in the background. On the top of the dune, stunted little trees of Celtis occidentalis and
Cerasus pennsylvanica. From a photograph by MacMillan.
a moderate-sized lake (about 1,500 square miles in area) situate between
Minnesota and Canada. The banks are partly rocky, partly loamy,
partly sandy, and partly covered with humus. Fig. 98 shows the sandy
flat shore, with a vegetation consisting chiefly of willows. Fig. 99 shows
low dunes grown over with various grasses and shrubs.
Obviously the sandy shore of fresh-water lakes differs from that of the
seaside, owing to its poverty in salt, and confers a xerophilous character
only on the vegetation of the higher dunes.
