THE FACTORS

as well as by excessive transpiration. But even this assumption in no way explains
the suitability of the above-mentioned structures. This depends on an adaptability
gained in the struggle for existence, and, like all true vital phenomena, it does not
yet admit of any physical explanation.
The most important natural regions and habitats where physiological
dryness prevails and only xerophytes therefore thrive, are grouped as
follows, according to their physical characters : â€”
i. Deserts, Steppes, and other districts with a dry substratum and dry air,
occasional or persistent great heat, and intense illumination.
2. The Bark of Trees, Rocks where there is rapid drying up of the
substratum, owing to deficient depth.
3. Sandy soil, Gravel, and the like, on account of the rapid drying up of
the substratum owing to its great permeability.

comutum. Plant with succulent leaves. Natural size. After Engler.
4. Sea-shores, Solfataras, which have abundance of soluble salts in
the soil.
5. Peat-bogs, because of the humous acids in the soil.
6. Polar zones, Vicinity of Glaciers in high mountains, where the
temperature of the soil is low.
7. Alpine Highlands, which are under rarefied air and strong insolation
characteristic of the alpine climate.
The plants of all these stations are provided with devices for the safe-
guarding of their transpiration ; they are xerophytes. Reduced surface is
very general in their case. With increasing physiological dryness, the
leaves become smaller in surface but proportionally thicker, more leathery
