ZONES AND REGIONS
[Pt. Ill, Sect. I
The relative humidity of the air usually corresponds to the amount of
rainfall, and is naturally greater in the rainy than in the dry season.
Again, districts on the coast, islands, and mountainous countries are
characterized by a high degree of relative humidity, by which we under-
stand a mean annual relative humidity of not less than 8o°/ o . The
relative humidity rises at night and in the early morning hours up to
saturation, but falls during the day, in sunny weather, low enough at
65-70 c / to exert considerable desiccating effects on vegetation. In
districts with marked dry seasons, the relative atmospheric humidity
during these descends on the average to $$-6$ °/ o , and much lower in
desert districts. Many districts with dry seasons have during the nights
in these seasons a heavy formation of dew, which is important to the
vegetation.
In many districts during the rainy season constant clouds prevail, so
that, according to Harm, a heavy, dark cloudy sky persists for months.
This, however, is by no means the case everywhere, and does not agree
with my own experience of tropical rainy seasons in Trinidad and Java,
during which most days included several sunny hours ; although com-
pletely rainy days were not wanting, yet, on the other hand, bright days
were not less frequent. In Buitenzorg during the rainy season the sky
is usually quite bright before midday, and the bursts of rain, which cause
the high annual rainfall of about 4! meters, for the most part fall only
during some hours after midday, though with a violence unknown in
Central Europe. The dry season in many districts is characterized by
a continuously cloudless sky, whereas in some the dry season exhibits
a cloudiness hardly or not at all less marked than does the rainy season.
The following table, taken from Hann and compiled by J. Murray and
S. Arrhenius, represents the mean distribution of the atmospheric precipi-
tations in the tropical zone and in the neighbouring belts of the temperate
zones l : —
