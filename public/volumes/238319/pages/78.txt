the greater mobility of their segments, the leaves come into contact with
larger quantities of air and their interchange of gases is correspondingly
increased.
Considerable mechanical damage by exceptionally strong storms is
commoner in countries where the weather is usually calm, than in regions
that are normally windy, partly because in the latter the form of growth
assumed by stem and twigs conveys protection, and partly because, as

Hegler proved, a continuous tensile stress occasions an increase of strength
and of the mechanical tissue.
The mechanical effects of the wind are by no means those most
important to the oecology of tall and tree-like plants. They are for the
most part markedly exhibited only where very strong continuous air-
currents prevail, and then chiefly cause harmless deviations from the normal
shape. The destructive influence that in certain areas completely
prevents l the growth of trees and is chiefly exerted during the winter, is

made, that afforestation of the west coasts and islands of Schleswig is impossible '
