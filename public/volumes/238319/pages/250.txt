portions of its axis that have lost their leaves slip down owing to their
weight, and finally rest on the tree in the form of the coils already mentioned.
These coils are well seen in Fig. 149.
Still more peculiar are the climbing devices of the American species of
Desmoncus, which I studied closely, particularly in the forests of Trinidad.
In this case the topmost pair of pinnae are converted into long, powerful,
recurved thorns, so that the elongated rachis resembles a harpoon.
Climbing palms may be oecologically considered as the highest stage of
the class of scramblers (Fig. 150), to which many other lianes in the rain-
forest belong, Bambuseae among others. Many species of Bambuseae

climb high up the tree ; but more frequently they remain within reach
of the underwood, and fix themselves to the branches of the smaller trees
and shrubs by means of their recurved, long and thorn-like vegetative buds.
Special climbing organs are not therefore present in this case, but some
peculiarities of the buds, in particular their curvature, may have arisen as
adaptations for climbing.
Cyclanthaceae and Pandanaceae, which are allied to palms, also possess
lianoid representatives. Of Cyclanthaceae we find lianes in species of the
genera Carludovica and Sarcinanthus (tropical America) ; of Pandanaceae,
numerous species of Freycinetia in the Malay Archipelago and Polynesia
