WATER

Correlations among Xerophytes of Different Habitats.
The contrivances for conserving water, which have been already described,
appear to be identical in xerophytes growing in habitats where the danger
of desiccation is due to most diverse causes — it may be to physical drought,
to coldness of the soil, to abundance of soluble salts or of humous acids in
the soil, or to reduced atmospheric pressure. That we have not here
merely a case of accidental external resemblance may be safely inferred
from the fact that many xerophytes are satisfied with physiologically dry
habitats of the most diverse kinds, but are never found in the much more
physically similar habitats of hydrophytes.
This interchange of physiologically dry habitats may be observed in
West Java. The character of the vegetation in this area, as determined

by the climate, is decidedly hygrophilous ; xerophytes are confined to very
limited stations, the physical character of which varies greatly. Such are,
for instance : —
1. Dry lava-gravels and other stony substrata, as at Gunong Guntur.
2. The bark of trees (epiphytes).
3. The sea-shore, including mangrove-swamps which are still inundated
at ebb-tide.
4. Solfataras. with wet clay soil, impregnated with alum and other
soluble salts.
5. Alpine highlands with rarefied air and strong insolation.
More dissimilar physical conditions cannot be well imagined than those
