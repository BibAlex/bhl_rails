xerophilous character, and consequently by the greater abundance of
thorny and succulent plants.
Thorn-woodland is also richly developed in the Antilles. It is very
extensive, for instance, on the east coast of Jamaica, where it consists in
particular of Mimosaceae and species of Cereus, and, as in Minas Geraes,
it appears to be confined to calcareous soil. Several of the smallest islands

3. TROPICAL GRASSLAND FORMATIONS,
i. GENERAL CHARACTER OF SA VANNAH.
Whilst in regions with rain at all seasons of the year grassland plays
quite a subordinate part and owes its limited appearance to local influences,
in regions with marked dry seasons, especially in Africa and in South
America, it covers extensive areas, usually in the form of savannah, less
