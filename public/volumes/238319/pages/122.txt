sterile, depends on Pronuba yuccasella for its fertilization (Fig. 69). As
the insect is just as dependent on the Yucca for its multiplication, it is
difficult to say which of the two organisms determines the geographical
distribution of the other.
The process of pollination in the Yucca is extremely peculiar. The moth lays
its eggs in the ovary, in which the larvae have to develop at the expense of
the } T oung seeds. In order to render the development of the seeds possible, the
moth effects pollination by introducing pollen into the stigma. Since many seeds

are produced and only a few larvae, both organisms profit equally. Other species
of Yucca are pollinated by other species of Pronuba ; for example, Yucca Whipplei
in California by Pronuba maculata, Yucca brevifolia in the Mohave desert by
Pronuba synthetica.
The dependence of certain plants on their pollinators is also strikingly
exhibited in red clover. This plant is pollinated exclusively by humble-
bees. In New Zealand there are no humble-bees, and red clover therefore
remains sterile. In recent times, therefore, humble-bees have been im-
ported to New Zealand in order that pollination and consequent seed-
formation may take place 1 .
