one, S. Palmetto, attains medium height (Fig. 342) ; epiphytes consist of
only a few herbaceous forms, one of which, Tillandsia usneoides (Figs. 48,
240), frequently dominates the landscape, and is also generally distributed
over the tropics and over the north temperate zones of America. The
broad-leaved forest, however, is very feebly represented in the warm humid
districts of North America, because edaphic influences determine the ap-
pearance of coniferous forest (Pinus on sandy soils (Fig. 244), Taxodium
distichum in swamps (Fig. 48) 1 ).

I found the subtropical rain-forest in North and Central Florida chiefly character-
ized by the evergreen oak, Quercus virens, to which species the tallest trees belong ;
by Magnolia grandiflora, which resembles many tropical fig-trees owing to its large
shining leaves, but in April is adorned with huge white flowers ; also by Sabal
Palmetto, Lodd., a small but slender fan-palm ; and, last but not least, by Tillandsia
usneoides, which spreads a grey veil over the forest. The richly developed under-
wood frequently consists only of dwarf palms (Sabal Adansonii, S. serrulata), other-
wise of very heterogeneous shrubs, which occasionally recall the shrubs of the tropical
rain-forest by the size of their leaves no less than by their systematic position (for
instance Styrax grandifolium, Ait.). The woody lianes are less varied ; the most
