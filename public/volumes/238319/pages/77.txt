by an abnormal tree-growth, if this be present at all, whilst the humbler
vegetation exhibits the effects of the wind to a very small extent, or not at
all. This difference between tree-growth and low shrubby and herbaceous
growth in relation to the action of the zviud, is due to the increasing movement
of the air as the distance from the ground increases.
Some of the results of observations made by Stevenson 1 of Edinburgh
upon the increase in velocity of the wind with the height above the
ground are shown in the following table : â€”

From the above tabular statement it is quite clear that plants
that are only slightly raised above the ground experience the effects of
the wind much less than tall plants, and especially trees. The action of the
wind on plants is partly direct, by tensile stresses and by pressure, and
partly indirect, by increasing transpiration : both these actions are the
more energetic, the taller the plants, or the higher the spots they
occupy.
The direct effect of the wind on the growth of plants is for the most
part strongly exhibited only in places where the wind blows continuously
and with considerable strength. It is a common feature in such localities
that stems and branches are bent away by the prevailing wind from their
normal direction of growth and follow the direction of the wind (Fig. 50).
It is also obvious that such trees also suffer direct damage, by breakage of
branches, rending of foliage, and so forth. The action of the wind in
tearing the leaves of arborescent or lofty plants and tall herbs may, however,
prove to be quite a normal and useful feature, as in the case of the banana
(Fig. 49) and some other plants, the huge leaves of which when young
are quite entire, and remain so in stations that are sheltered from the wind,
but are always torn in more exposed ones. The functional activity of the
leaves is not thereby in any way prejudiced ; on the contrary, owing to
