shores, and whose rapidly growing shoots, frequently several meters long,
generally advance nearest to the sea of all vegetation. Fig. 209 shows the
typical Pes-caprae formation. In other areas, other plants of a similar
habit prevail, so that, for instance, we can distinguish a Canavalia-formation
— named from a papilionaceous genus, several species of which are dis-
tributed on the eastern Asiatic shore — or a Spinifex-formation, and so
forth. Fig. 210 shows how the Pes-caprae formation develops in more
sheltered places. The creeping shoots cover the ground with a network
that is only here and there interrupted by larger gaps. Some other plants

have taken root on the soil that has become firm, in particular some
grasses, and two shrubby species, Scaevola Koenigii and a Croton, are
recognizable.
In still more sheltered spots, however, on less shifting, coarse or pebbly sand,
shrubs become more numerous, and little trees, in the Old World species ot
Pandanus, are added (Figs. 211, 212).
In Eastern Asia in such stations, Pemphis acidula very frequently occurs, a bushy
lythraceous shrub with small succulent leaves bearing silvery grey scales ; Clero-
dendron inerme, a somewhat thorny shrub, whose long branches covered with
