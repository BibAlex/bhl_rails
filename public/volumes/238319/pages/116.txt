thus rubbing first the stigma and then the stamens. The beautiful
colours of the flower fully correspond to those of its pollinator, Nectarinia
Afra.
In New Zealand also pollination by birds has been observed, especially
by Thomson, in Clianthus puniceus, Sophora tomentosa, Metrosideros
lucida, Fuchsia ex-
corticata, Loranthus
Colensoi, Dracophyl-
1 u m longifolium.
Phormium tenax.
These flowers are in
part red -coloured.
Adaptations to
other families of birds
has been proved in
the case of one plant
only, namely Feijoa
Schenckiana(Fig. 64),
an arborescent myr-
taceous plant, which
Fritz Muller discover-
ed in the table-land of
Santa Catharina and
planted in his garden
at Blumenau, where I
had an opportunity of
seeing it in blossom.
The structure of the
flower has been ex-
cellently described by
Fritz Muller. Highly
peculiar are the four
snow-white petals,
which are rolled in-
wards so that only a
narrow slit remains
visible when looking
from above or some-
what from the side.
These petals are fleshy, juicy, and sweet to the taste. As with most
ornithophilous flowers, the stamens also are of a beautiful red colour,
numerous, like a stiff brush, and exceeded in length by the style. The
only pollinator that has been as yet recognized with any certainty
