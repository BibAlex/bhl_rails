ZONES AND REGIONS [Pt. Ill, Sect. II
evergreen xerophilous broad-leaved trees appear hardly anywhere except
within the range of a mountain climate. Thus, for instance, as will be
shown in a later chapter, the)' form extensive bush-wood on the summits of
the mountains of the Malay Archipelago. Essentially different anatomical
adaptations on the part of the leaves, however, distinguish these plants from
the plants of the sclerophyllous woodland of the temperate lowlands with
moist winters. On the other hand, edaphic influences can determine the
colonization of neighbouring districts possessing different climates by the
sclerophyllous woodland. Thus, sclerophyllous plants clothe the sandy
dunes of the savannah-districts in the east of Cape Colony. Moreover,

some few species, such as the laurel and box, have adapted themselves to
new climatic conditions, and appear as accessory constituents in the climatic
formations of other districts. Such cases, however, are of subordinate
importance, except in Australia, where sclerophyllous woodland has a very
extensive distribution. Many features render it probable that West Australia,
where the winters are moist and the summers dry, and where the sclero-
phyllous flora exhibits by far its greatest wealth, is the source from which
the other Australian districts have become colonized.
Within the sclerophyllous districts grassland occurs at two places, namely in the
Sacramento Valley in California and in a part of South Australia. High temperatures
