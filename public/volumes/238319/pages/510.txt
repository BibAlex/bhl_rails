On the rocky slopes of the mountain chains the only characteristic species
are found growing in fissures or in the shade of the rocks : —
Shrubs such as Aplopappus cuneatus, Bigelovia teretifolia, Coleosanthus atracty-
lioides (Compositae), and Hofmeisteria pluriseta (Compositae) ; perennial herbs such
as Arenaria macradenia, Eucnide urens (Loasaceae), and annual plants such as
Macrocalyx micranthus (Hydrophyllaceae), Parietaria debilis, and Pterostegia dry-
marioides (Polygonaceae).
Very peculiar stations are the so-called dry lakes — places where the
water accumulates after a heavy shower of rain, but soon evaporates. The
soil consists of very hard clay and is rich in alkalis, yet not sufficiently
so to give rise to a crystalline efflorescence. In wide valleys between
high mountains, the soil in such stations remains continuously moist, and,

wherever it is not covered with water, exhibits saline efflorescence. Such
places are entitled swamps. The dry lakes are occupied by plants only
along their margins, and there the vegetation consists chiefly of a brush-
wood of Atriplex polycarpon, often accompanied by A. confertifolia and
Suaeda suffrutescens. The swamps likewise exhibit vegetation only on
their margins. The vegetation however is often very luxuriant and dif-
ferentiated into very distinct belts, which are sometimes several hundred
meters wide : —
Nearest to the swamp is a belt of the chenopodiaceous Allenrolfea occidentalis ;
then follow in belts, all growing on a clay soil covered with salt, Juncus Cooperi,
then Sporobolus airoides and Pluchea in company. The plants of the fourth belt
have accumulations of sand round their bases ; they are Prosopis juliflora and Atri-
plex canescens (Fig. 382), sometimes accompanied by Suaeda suffrutescens. The
