daily loss of water was the same in both cases, namely on the average o-6 gram
per hour, but even in this case transpiration during the hot midday hours appears to
have been much stronger in Buitenzorg than in Holland.
Experiments made by G. Haberlandt at Buitenzorg in January, which
is the middle of the rainy season, and at Gratz during the hot days of
August, showed that transpiration in the shade in a moist tropical climate
is much weaker than in Central Europe : —
The humidity of the air fluctuated at the time when Haberlandt made his experi-
ments (December, January), between 70-97 %. ' The minimum (70-80 %) occurred at
about midday, but frequently not till 1 p.m. Then the humidity increased rapidly
as the rain began, and even by 3 or 4 p.m. attained 90-95 %. Omitting slight
fluctuations, which seldom exceeded 5 %, the curve in its typical course remained
from the evening till about 7 a.m. at 93-97 %, and then gradually sank again till
noon V The temperature during the period of observation showed a diurnal variation
of 6-8° C.
'The diurnal curve of temperature, as a rule, showed the following course: —
Between 6 and 7 a.m. the temperature was lowest. The minimum varied, omitting
extreme cases, between 21 and 23 C. During the forenoon the temperature at first
rose rapidly, then somewhat more slowly up to 29-30-5° C. This maximum was
rarely attained by midday, usually not till between 1 and 2 p.m. Then the tempera-
ture fell to 23-25°, sometimes more rapidly, at others more slowly, according to the
cloudiness, or amount and duration of the rainfall in the afternoon.'
