ZONES AND REGIONS [Pt. Ill, Sect. I
The figures observed in reference to the growth of several plants of
Taeniophyllum, in their native habitats, are given in the following table,
which also includes data regarding the photic ration which is an im-
portant factor.

Compared with the greatest diurnal increment of a bamboo-culm as
given by G. Kraus the greatest increment of Taeniophyllum is as 570 :
0-283 mm. or 2013 : [. Hence the culm of bamboo observed by Kraus
grew in round numbers 2,000 times more rapidly than the aerial roots of
Taeniophyllum Zollingeri.
Transpiration.
The great physiological importance of the heating of plants by insola-
tion and the part played in this matter by transpiration are very easily
observed, and have quite recently formed the subject of closer investigation.
The action of insolation is stronger when the air contains much water-vapour
than when it contains little, because dryness of the air causes the stomata
to close. The effect of insolation is consequently most strikingly observed
in moist districts.
Every visitor to the botanic garden at Buitenzorg knows that many
plants, during the later hours of the generally sunny forenoon, usually
exhibit clear signs of incipient wilting ; this continues to increase rapidly
until the occurrence of the afternoon shower of rain, by which time many
leaves hang down quite in a drooping condition, although they are not
unprovided with protective contrivances against transpiration \ During
my visit to Buitenzorg in the midst of the rainy season, fourteen rainless
sultry days passed in succession, and the vegetation presented a parched
appearance such as would hardly have arisen in Europe after a period
three times that length ; the crops were endangered and the population
sought by appropriate weeping-ceremonies to invoke the favour of the
Rain-god. The air remained very moist throughout this dry period, and,
in a less sunny climate, the rich nightly formation of dew would not have
been so ineffective.
