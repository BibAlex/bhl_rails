THE FACTORS
[Part I
of sea-shores, epiphytes) ; in districts with cold winters, they fall off both
in number and dimensions, and only those species that shrink up consider-
ably in winter appear to withstand low temperature for any length of time.
A considerable reduction in
the transpiring surface, a
formation of thorns, a dense
coating with hairs (Fig. 18)
are rather characteristic of
dry air, whilst in moist air
the leaves are more fre-
quently well developed and
glabrous. Warm districts with
prolonged periods of drought,
such as tropical and sub-
tropical deserts, are char-
acterized by the presence of
endochylous succulent plants,
whereas a perichylous con-
struction indicates a plant
accustomed to a more fre-
quent though a scanty water-supply, such as characterizes the sea-shore
and the epiphytic conditions within humid forests. Mobile pinnate leaves

to strong insolation. The leathery foliage of sclerophyllous plants is found
indeed in all formations of xerophytes, but is commonest in mild temperate
