where mutual attrition reduces them, partly to pebbles, partly to sand,
and where the weathered felspars are ground into finely grained earthy
clay. A change in the water-level leads to deposits in river-beds and
along their banks of masses of pebble, sand, and clay, which are some-
times more, sometimes less, frequently, or only exceptionally, covered
again by the water. Such deposits bear an open vegetation, which is
in some cases more transitory, in others more lasting, and the species
growing on them are for the most part characteristic of such habitats

The fragments of the rock finally reach the sea along the water-courses.
If the sea-shores are flat, sand, clay, and small pebbles are thrown up
by the action of stormy waves on the land to distances more or less
above the usual high tide-mark, and their deposits, if neither too much
turned over by the wind nor carried back into the sea, within a few
months bear some vegetation. If this can maintain itself, these new
deposits become gradually fixed and definitely united to the land.
Of the sea-shore deposits, sand is the most extensively developed, as
the wind carries it further inland than clay and pebbles, and frequently
