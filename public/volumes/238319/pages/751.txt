pinnatifida, and a species of Lonicera occur as shrubs, and Phragmites
communis forms the reeds.
The Chenopodiaceae predominate in the desert flora,, especially on exten-
sive saline tracts. A prominent part is also played by Tamaricaceae as
shrubs (Tamarix, Reaumuria), species of Artemisia and Astragalus, Poly-
gonaceae (Calligonum, Fig. 358, in the Gobi species of Rheum), Liliaceae
(Allium, Tulipa), and some grasses.

Most of these plants are small-leaved or aphyllous, and in general pro-
tected against drought in the same manner as in the Sahara. Here also,
plants are some of them dependent on the spring rain, and visible above
ground for only a few weeks, but others are supplied by subterranean water
and bear leaves during the whole, or a great part, of summer. Radde men-
tions the rapid disappearance of the spring flora, in particular of Cruciferae
and grasses, when summer heat begins. The most conspicuous constituents
of the ephemeral flora are, however, tulips, in particular Tulipa uniflora,
which seems to be present everywhere in the Gobi and frequently in large
numbers, and led Przhevalsky to remark about the Dzungarian desert, the
north-west branch of the Gobi, which is otherwise so bare, that ' the plain
was as if transformed by the beauty of its flowering, scented tulips V
