SECTION IV. MOUNTAINS
CHAPTER I. THE MOUNTAIN CLIMATE
PAGES
i. Rarefaction of the Air. Diminution in the atmospheric pressure with increasing
altitude above the sea. Simultaneous diminution in the temperature of the air and increase in
the radiation of heat. Unequal temperature in the sun and shade on mountains. Nocturnal
radiation. Increased intensity of light. Mountain light richer in highly refrangible rays.
2. Atmospheric Precipitations. Increased rainfall as altitude increases. Level of the
greatest rainfall. Reduced rainfall above this level. Perpetual snow. Cloudiness. Reduction
in water-vapour at great altitudes. Rapid alternation of moistness and dryness of the air. Great
intensity of evaporation in the mountain climate . ....... 690-700
CHAPTER II. REGIONS OE VEGETATION
i. Climatic Factors causing the Differentiation of Regions. Distinctive features
and diagnoses of the three regions â€” basal region, montane region, alpine region. Comparison
between mountain-regions and zones. Former exaggeration of the effects of heat. Humboldt's
views. 2. Plant-life in Mountain Regions, i. Mountain-woodland. Mountain-grassland .
Mountain-desert. Sequence of woodland climate, grassland climate, and desert climate with
increasing altitude. Identity of the formations in the basal and montane regions with those of
the lowlands. Characteristic habit of alpine formations, ii. The Features of Alpine Plants.
Alpine habit. Elfin-tree. Shrubs. Cushion-plants. Rosette-plants. Grasses. Xerophilons
structure. Colours, dimensions, scent of flowers. Periodic phenomena. Bonnier's and Kerner's
experiments on the influence of the mountain climate on the structure of plants. Influence of
individual climatic factors. Assimilation and transpiration in alpine regions. Increase of sugar
in nectaries. Application of experimental results to the natural alpine vegetation, iii. The
Occurrence of Alpine Species of Plants in Lower Regions. Occurrence of tropical alpine plants
in lower regions as epiphytes and in solfataras. Differences between arctic and alpine plant-
structure, iv. The Upper limit of Plant-life in High Mountains. Saussurea tridactyla . 701-720

ing to Volkens. Xerophilous character of its basal region. Temperate rain-forest in its mon-
tane region. Physiognomy and flora of its alpine steppe and desert. 4- The Regions in
Tropical America. i. The South American Cordilleras. Temperate rain-forest. Elfin-
