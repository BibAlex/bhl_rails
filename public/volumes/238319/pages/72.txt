taken from the atmosphere through large lenticels, and partly from the
water (Rhizophora, Bruguiera, Avicennia, and others). Less frequently
the air-canals are chiefly found in the secondary cortex (Laguncularia) 1 .
Lastly, in. various Leguminosae the wood is modified into air-containing
tissue and consists of thin-walled, air-carrying tracheids, resembling
cambium-cells in shape and size, and intercommunicating by means of
open pores. Such air-containing wood, if largely developed, causes large
swellings at the bases of stems.
In many cases, certain lateral roots are differentiated as oxygen-pumps,
and in accordance with this function differ structurally from other roots.

Such respiratory roots or pneumatophores (Jost) have been studied by
Schenck in species of Jussieuea inhabiting in numbers, as shrubs or under-
shrubs, the shallow waters of warmer districts (Fig. 47). These plants grow
in still parts of the water, and from their rhizomes creeping through the
mud they develop normal positively geotropic lateral rootlets which
penetrate the soil, and also spongy respiratory roots, which are apparently
not geotropic, but, owing to the air they contain, stand upright in the
water and conclude their growth in length when they reach the surface.
Respiratory roots in contrast with terrestrial roots are simple ; less frequently
