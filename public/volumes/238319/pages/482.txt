of the vegetation is different, and on the whole less meagre than in the north of the
Sahara. The hills, it is true, are entirely devoid of plant-life, but in the wadis,
where subterranean water accumulates, the trees attain large dimensions. They
are, however, usually small-leaved and thorny, therefore of a xerophilous stamp.
To them there belong, in particular, Acacia Seyal, Del., Maerua rigida, R. Br.,
Zizyphus Spina-Christi, Wild., Balanites aegyptica, Del., and the palm, Hyphaene
thebaica. A species of Stapelia grows on the rocks. The granitic sand of the
former water-courses in the wadis is overgrown by Panicum turgidum, Forsk.,
but grasses are otherwise rare.
The east coast of Africa along the southern half of the Red Sea and as
far as the equator, although less poor in rain than the Sahara, is, owing to

the great heat, dry enough to assume the character of semi-desert or desert
in places where the soil is more permeable. Such desert and semi-desert,
due to a combination of climatic and edaphic influences, alternate with less
pronounced % xerophilous formations, for example, in Equatorial East Africa,
between Kilimanjaro and the coast.
Volkens 1 picturesquely describes such a formation (Fig. 351):
' It is a pure steppe of succulent plants 2 , the driest and most unfertile district one
can imagine, but just for that reason covered by a vegetation, the like poverty ot
which I have observed only in the driest desert tracts of Egypt. Every plant is really
