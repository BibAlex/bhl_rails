(sclcrophylly) (Figs. 1 1, 12), fleshy (chylophylly or leaf-succulence) (Figs. 9, 10),
or rudimentary and caducous (aphylly). In the last cases, the axes are rich
in chlorophyll and carry on the process of assimilation. The axes are
sometimes slender like rods, dry and hard, as in Ephedra, Spartium, and
other plants (sclcrocauly), or they
become short and thick, often
even spheroidal, and filled with
mucilaginous sap, as in the Cac-
taceae {cJiylocauly or stcm-succu-
Icncc).
Reduction in surface is often
associated with the production
of thorns, because shoots or
leaves become pointed structures
rich in sclerenchyma and tran-
spiring but slightly, if at all ;
their utility in this form, as pro-
tective organs against animals,
if a reality, is only of a secondary
nature.
Xerophyteswith pinnate leaves
have the power of automatically
adjusting the transpiring leaf-
surface. The mobile leaflets open
out under the moderate illu-
mination of the early morning,
or of a dull day, but close up
under intense insolation and the
profuse transpiration which ac-
companies it. The fact that
plants possessing pinnate leaves
with a relatively large and thin
leaf-surface thrive alongside of
aphyllous plants in the driest
regions proves how perfectly this
arrangement works.
Other leaf-bearing xerophytes
have their leaves, or leaf-like
cladodes, arranged parallel to
the incident rays of sunlight, and are consequently less intensely heated
and illuminated. This peculiarity disappears in many species when there
is no longer any danger of excessive loss of water, for instance in the
mangrove-tree, Sonneratia acida, when it is grown on a soil poor in salts,
