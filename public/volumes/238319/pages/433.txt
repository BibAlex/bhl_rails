frequently covered with gum or resin. Instead of forming protective devices
against transpiration in winter, the leaves are more delicate than are those
of the tall trees in the rain-forest ; they possess a thin cuticle, thin-walled
mesophyll-cells, little or no sclerenchyma, a richly developed system of air-
containing intercellular spaces, superficial stomata. Yet in sunny situations
foliage is better protected against transpiration than is foliage developed in
the shade, possessing a smaller surface and greater thickness, a stronger
development of cuticle, and a weaker formation of intercellular spaces 1 .
The leaves, however, are always placed perpendicular to the mean direction
of incidence of the strongest light, instead of avoiding it by the assumption
of an oblique or parallel position 2 .
In addition to these distinctions from tropical and subtropical trees
a further peculiarity of all trees of cold-winter zones is their much richer
brandling. Whilst in the former branches of a higher order than the fifth
are rare, in temperate trees and shrubs twigs of the sixth and seventh orders
are frequent and those of the eighth not uncommon. Unbranched trees are
unknown in cold-winter countries.
