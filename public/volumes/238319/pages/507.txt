ZONES AND REGIONS [Pt. Ill, Sect. II
stony or even covered with larger blocks, while flat areas more distant
from the mountains exhibit a soil of uniformly fine-grained consistency.
The soil is calcareous, clayey, or silicious according to the nature of the
rock from which the soil derives its origin.
Woody plants are numerous, but all are shrubby, except the species of
Yucca, Yucca brevifolia (Fig. 370), for which Lorrey's name, Y. arborescens,
is more descriptive, and Y. macrocarpa, and both of these plants are con-
fined to the higher parts of the region.
Of the shrubs the following are very common : —
Tetradymia comosa (Compositae), Acamptopappus sphaerocephalus (Compositae),
Amphiachyris Fremontii (Compositae), Aster mohavensis, Atriplex confertifolia, A.
hymenelytra, Bebbia juncea aspera (Compositae), Cassia armata, Cereus Engelmanni,

Echinocactus polycephalus, Ephedra californica, Hymenoclea Salsola (Compositae),
Krameria parvifolia, Lyeium Andersonii, Opuntia basilaris, O. echinocarpa, Salazaria
mexicana (Labiatae). Many of these species, like those of Yucca, are confined to
higher regions ; some appear to be dependent on edaphic influences : thus Atriplex
hymenelytra grows only on silicious soil rich in alkalis, Cassia armata on dry sand.
The commonest herbaceous perennials of the mesas are : —
Cladothrix oblongifolia (Amarantaceae), Euphorbia polycarpa, Lepidium Fre-
montii, and Mirabilis laevis ; whilst among the numerous annuals the following
species are especially common : Atrichoseris platyphylla (Compositae), Chorizanthe
rigida (Polygonaceae), Cleomella obtusifolia (Capparidaceae), Encelia eriocephala
(Compositae), Eschscholtzia minutiflora, Gilia floccosa, Leptosyne Bigelovii (Com-
positae), Plantago patagonica, P. gnaphaloides, and Sisymbrium canescens.
