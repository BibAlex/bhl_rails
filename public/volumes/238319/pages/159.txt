FORMATIONS AND GUILDS
[Part II
The stem of a liane is always constructed upon the same oecological
principle ; its wood is not compact and unbroken as in the stem of a tree,
but fissured in various ways or even subdivided into isolated strands.
Hence various anomalies result, such as those represented in Figs. 108-1 10.
A more detailed account cannot be given here x .
Lianes are further characterized by the great length and width of their

conducting tubes, wood-vessels as well as sieve-tubes, by means of which
the conveyance along the frequently extremely long stem of non-elaborated
sap and of proteids respectively is facilitated.
Geographical Distribution of Lianes.
Lianes thrive in nearly all climates ; they are absent only in the polar area
and in the alpine regions of high mountains, where certain climatic factors
