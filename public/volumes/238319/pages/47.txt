THE FACTORS
[Part I
As a means for promoting transpiration the significance of a well-
developed air-containing intercellular system, such as exists in the leaves
of all hygrophytes (Figs. 25, 26), is self-evident. The very numerous

stomata serve as efferent passages, and they are not deeply sunk in the
surface, as in xerophytes, but are superficial in position, and sometimes
even raised on cones without any protective arrangements.
HydatJiodes (Fig. 27), which are organs for excreting liquid water, whose
wide distribution, variety, and great importance were first revealed by
Haberlandt 1 , are specially
characteristic of hygro-
phytes in a very damp cli-
mate. Early in the morn-
ing under such climatic
conditions, especially in
the tropics, many plants,
herbs as well as trees, are
so covered with drops of
water that not infrequently
a drizzling rain seems to
be descending from the
forest canopy of leaves.
This has been incorrectly
regarded as dew. It owes
its origin much more to
excreting hydathodes, the
activity of which is greatly
increased when transpira-
tion is restricted, but ceases when the air is dry. Hydathodes are epi-
dermal structures of the most varied nature. Sometimes simple, sometimes
complex in structure, they appear in the form of hairs, glandular cells,
