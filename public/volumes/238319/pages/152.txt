Chap. I] THE FORMATIONS 189
4. LIFE OF THE PLANT-COMMUNE IN THE
FORMATIONS.
The various plants composing a formation indubitably stand in the
most manifold relations to one another as well as to the animals — worms,
insects, birds — that inhabit the formation. The question regarding the
nature and mode of action of these relations promises to yield most
important conclusions bearing on the oecological explanation of the
formations, but has hitherto been but rarely approached, and then only
in individual cases l . The floristic branch of geographical botany, on the
other hand, has indirectly yielded valuable material by the compilation
of lists of species that are constantly found growing together. Thus,
according to Flahault, there are always found accompanying Ouercus
Ilex in France, thirteen other species of plants, amongst them Cistus
monspeliensis, Lavandula latifolia, Thymus vulgaris ; whilst Fagus sylvatica
is always accompanied by the following amongst other species : Vaccinium
Myrtillus, Rubus Idaeus, Oxalis Acetosella, Mercurialis perennis. Hock
has drawn up such lists for several German formations. Naturally they do
not hold good for all regions nor for all kinds of soil, as to each agglomera-
tion of external factors there must correspond a definite grouping.
This fact obviously does not take from the value of such compilations,
at least if they are accompanied by accurate data regarding climate
and soil.
To the same category of questions belongs an inquiry into the cause of
the social growth of some species and the invariably isolated appearance
of others. It appears, however, superfluous to inquire more closely into
the hypotheses that have been put forward in regard to these matters,
for they have as yet no solid foundations, except in the case of a few
tropical formations which will be discussed further on 2 .
