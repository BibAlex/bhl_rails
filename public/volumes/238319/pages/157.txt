a support, curl round it. Morphologically the tendrils are either leaves or
axes. Oecologically they are very varied, so that, following H. Schenck,
we may arrange tendril-
climbers, in the widest
sense, into six groups
according to their modes
of climbing : â€”
In leaf- climbers a part,
petiole or blade, of the
otherwise unmodified leaf
is endowed with the ne-
cessary irritability. For
instance, Clematis Vi-
talba is a petiole-climber,
Fumaria officinalis in its
varieties Wirtgenii and
vulgaris a leaf- blade
climber ; Flagellaria in-
dica, a monocotyledon-
ous plant common in the

and considerably thickened twining branch.
Two-thirds of natural size. After H. Schenck.

what old lignified and thickened climbing
hooks.
In leaf-tendril climbers, the leaf, or a part of it, is differentiated as a
filamentous organ functioning as a tendril only. We see this in the pea
and other Vicieae, Cucurbitaceae, and many other plants.
