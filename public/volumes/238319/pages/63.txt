THE FACTORS
[Part I
the temperature went below - 46° C. The individual in question grew on the top
of a fairly high sand hillock near Pittlekaj, exposed to the constant and cutting
north or north-east wind. It had commenced to blossom in the summer of 1878,
but its blossoming was far from being completed when the winter came on and
stopped further progress. Its system of flowers consequently included flower-buds
in various stages of development, recently opened flowers, blown flowers, and some
more or less ripened fruits. Only an insignificant shrivelled remnant of the basal
rosette of leaves remained, but the upper leaves were fresh and vigorous. In this
condition the plant was overtaken by winter, and exposed to its utmost rigour.
We might well believe that it must have been killed, and especially that the tender
flowering parts which were attacked during their development would have been
destroyed by the frost and so prevented from developing further. This, however,
was not the case. When the summer of 1879 began, the plant continued its growth
from the point at which it had been arrested by the approach of winter ; the flower-
buds opened, and from the axils of the fresh upper stem-leaves fresh inflorescences
sprouted forth.'
The fact that the coldest known places on the earth lie within the
Siberian forest-district is sufficient to prove, in the first place, that vegetative
organs can endure without injury temperatures lower than those observed
by Kjellman ; and, in the second place, contrary to a widespread but
unsupported view, that tree-growth is by no means excluded by prolonged
and severe winter-temperatures. Within the district just mentioned is
included, for instance, Yakutsk, where the thermometer not infrequently
sinks to —62° C, and Verkhoyansk, which is, if possible, still colder. Details
concerning the temperature of the latter place are given in the following

As far as is known, at no place on the earth is the temperature so low
that no plant can withstand it. The alleged complete absence of all
