ZONES AND REGIONS [Pt. Ill, Sect. II
fifth belt is formed of Atriplex polycarpa, the sixth chiefly of Larrea tridentata.
Then commences the usual mesa-vegetation.
The oases around the springs and by the flowing waters possess a vegeta-
tion of tropophilous trees and shrubs, such as Populus Fremontii, Prosopis
pubescens, Salix longifolia, S. nigra, S. venulosa, and various herbaceous
perennials likewise differing from those of the desert soil.
The parts of the desert lying
above 1,500 meters forming # the
Upper Son or an region are less
dry than the lower parts and
are characterized by the growth
of isolated trees of Pinus mono-
phylla (Fig. 375). Juniperus
californica, var. utahensis, is also
common here. The shrub-flora
is not less distinct from that of
the Lower Sonoran region. Here
the bushy grey Artemisia tri-
dentata is common (Figs. 376,
377,386), also Ceanothus Greg-
gii, Garrya Veatchii, var. flave-
scens, Kunzia glandulosa, Ribes
leptanthum, R. brachyanthum,
Salvia carnosa. The transition
belt between this region and
that of the Lower Sonoran is par-
ticularly characterized by Yucca
brevifolia. Still higher, corre-
sponding to the increasing hu-
midity, there appear on the
highest mountains of the desert
pine-forests, which agree closely
with those on the slopes facing
the coast.
The adaptations to the cli-
matic conditions, in particular
to dryness, are very similar to
those which Volkens has so ac-
curately described in relation
to the Sahara ; water- reservoirs are however absent except in the case of
the succulent plants (Cactaceae, Fig. 372, Chenopodiaceae), which are
mainly confined to the Upper Sonoran region and to the saline localities
of the Lower Sonoran region. The shrubs are usually dense bushes of
