quite subordinate. The conifers of the south temperate zone are also
chiefly Pinaceae, yet not of the sub-families Abietoideae and Taxodioideae,
as in the north, but chiefly Araucarioideae (Araucaria, Agathis). The
Taxaceae (Podocarpus, Dacrydium), particularly in the eastern hemisphere,
are more important constituents of the forest in the south than in the north.

Monocotyledones.
In the warm temperate belts, as in the tropics, Monocotyledones are
represented not only by grasses and other herbs, but also by tall and
striking forms, which belong chiefly to Liliaceae and Amaryllidaceae, and
only to a very slight extent to the Palmae and Bambuseae so prominent
in the tropics owing to their size, and do not belong at all to the
Pandanaceae and Scitamineae. Thus species of Aloe are in particular
characteristic of South Africa (Fig. 233), species of Yucca (Fig. 234),
Dasylirion and Agave of warm North America, species of Xanthorrhoea
of Australia (Fig. 235), Cordyline australis, attaining 10 meters in height,
of New Zealand (Fig. 236), and the gigantic dragon-tree, Dracaena Draco,
of the Canary Islands.
Mcsothcrmic Palmae arc not numerous, and are confined to a few-
warm tracts, where they are rarely prominent, at least in the wild state.
Their most familiar and most widely spread representative, Phoenix dacty-
lifera, is not known wild ; Pritchardia filifera, which is often planted as
