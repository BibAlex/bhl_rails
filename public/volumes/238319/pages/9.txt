vi AUTHOR'S PREFACE
The connexion between the forms of plants and the external
conditions at different points on the earth's surface forms the
subject-matter of oecological plant-geography 1 , which has only
recently become a prominent subject of interest, although it found
a place in earlier works, especially in Grisebach's valuable ' Vegeta-
tion der Erde,' where, however, it was regarded from obsolete points
of view. The greater prominence of physiology in geographical
botany dates from the time when physiologists, who formerly
worked in European laboratories only, began to study the vegeta-
tion of foreign countries in its native land. Europe, with its tem-
perate climate and its vegetation greatly modified by cultivation,
is less calculated to stimulate such observations ; in moist tropical
forests, in the Sahara, and in the tundras, the close connexion
between the character of the vegetation and the conditions of
extreme climates is revealed by the most evident adaptations.
The physiological branch of geographical botany has made
very rapid progress, owing to the foundation of a botanical
laboratory at Buitenzorg, and to the unusually favourable oppor-
tunity for a residence in the midst of tropical vegetation which
is thus offered to botanists in Java, thanks to Treub's praise-
worthy exertions. It has thus become possible, as Wiesner's and
Haberlandt's pioneering works show, to carry on prolonged and
exact physiological research in a tropical climate. It is to be
hoped that a counterpart to Buitenzorg may soon be established
in the arctic zone ; for an arctic laboratory, with a modest equip-
ment corresponding to the poverty of the flora and the relative
simplicity of the problems to be solved, would be of great service.
The oecology of plant-distribution will succeed in opening
out new paths on condition only that it leans closely on experi-
mental physiology, for it presupposes an accurate knowledge of
the conditions of the life of plants which experiment alone can
bestow. Thus only will it be possible to sever the study of
adaptations from dilettantism which revels in them, and to free
it from anthropomorphic trifling, which has threatened to bring it
into complete discredit. In this respect, we may congratulate
ourselves that scientific botanists are turning more and more to
1 Following Hackel's initiative the most recent name for the science of biological
adaptations is Oecology.
