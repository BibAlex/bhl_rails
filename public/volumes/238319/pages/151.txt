and not remarkably xerophilous plant on such a soil did not appear
wonderful.
As the result of their investigations on the sandy and loamy plain of the
Camargue, which is 35,000 acres in extent and lies in the Rhone delta,
Flahault and Combres have described the gradual conversion of the bare
soil within reach of storm-tides first into open, and later into closed
formations.; They show that if a fiat shoreland tract is withdrawal for

produces is composed of tufts of Salicornia macrostachya growing widely

and on their bushy branches a quantity of sand, small indeed, but
sufficient to render possible the appearance of some new plants, such as
