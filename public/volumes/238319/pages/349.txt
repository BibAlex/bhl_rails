Whilst the western half of the interior of South Africa exhibits the
character of a desert, the eastern half (Orange River Colony and the
Transvaal) is covered with grassland, which, in correspondence with the
dry cold of winter that is hostile to trees, is not savannah but steppe 1 .
Here the winter is very poor in rain, and most precipitation occurs from
November to March, as the following percentages show.

If we neglect the deserts, which will be described further on, and the
rain-forests, which in South Africa are insufficiently known and unimportant,
we obtain the following general propositions that hold good generally for
the warm temperate belts : —
1. The western coast of temperate South Africa has a wet winter and a
dry summer ; the vegetation consists of xerophilons evergreen sclerophyllons
woodland.
2. The southern and eastern coasts and the eastern interior have a
