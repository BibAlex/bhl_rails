object of religious veneration among the Mongols. Gramineae and Com-
positae predominate in the meagre flora of the Gobi. A characteristic plant
is a species of Artemisia, which the winter-storm frequently uproots, tosses
into a heap together with other ill-fated companions, and drives before it
over the expanse. . . .
'For weeks together one has always before one's eyes the same forms,
sometimes interminable tracts tawny with the dried-up grass, sometimes of
blackish fissured rock, sometimes of low hills on the summits of which the
outline of the swift-footed Antilope gutturosa stands out.'
The desert of Khami in the western part of the Gobi is described as follows
by the same traveller : —

The flora and character of the vegetation bear a very similar character in
the Trans-Caspian and Gobi deserts. The cold temperate character of the
flora is revealed most distinctly in moist places, in the oases (Fig. 358), on
the banks of streams, in the gravelly beds of the dried rivers. In these
places there grow only deciduous trees and shrubs of a northern type, espe-
cially Populus euphratica (P. diversifolia), P. alba, P. nigra, Ulmus cam-
pestris, Salix alba, species of Fraxinus ; and in the oases of Sachu (or
Saitu, about 40 N., 94 E.), where Rosa canina, Rubus Idaeus, Crataegus
