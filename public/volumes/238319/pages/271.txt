forest and monsoon-forest, xerophilous woodland, especially in the thorn-
forest, contains arborescent succulents, particularly species of Cereus in
tropical America (Fig. 128), and of Euphorbia (Fig. 198) in Africa.
The shrubs of the savannah are not less xerophilous than the trees.
Their hypogeous parts are very strongly developed as compared with
their epigeous parts, and often form such a massive system of thick
lignified axes that, following Lund and Liais, we may describe some of
them, such as those of Andira laurifolia and Anacardium humile of the
campos, as hypogeous trees. In Andira, for instance (Fig. 188), the
system of rhizomes, consisting of branches as thick as one's arm, frequently

covers an area ten meters in diameter, whereas the epigeous foliage-shoots
are thin and never more than a meter in height. Such hypogeous
axes appear to serve as water-reservoirs, as also do the tuberous woody
rhizomes that occur on numerous small shrubs and bushes in the campos
(Figs. 203, 204).
Thin woody lianes occur in xerophilous woodland, in particular in
thorn-forest, but disappear in the savannah ; but in the savannah, for
instance in the Brazilian campos, there are found erect shrubs belonging
to families and genera that with these exceptions include only climbing
forms. Schenck considers it probable that many of these shrubs have
been derived from lianes and are to be considered as cases of reversion to
