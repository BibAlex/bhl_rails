in forests that are continuous with tropical ones, than in the quite isolated
rain-forests of Valdivia and New Zealand.
In the temperate rain-forest, those constituents that are most intimately
associated with the tropical climate, namely epiphytic Pteridophyta and
Phanerogamia, are mainly tropical in origin, and are so to a far greater
extent than is the case with terrestrial plants ; in fact, the temperate rain-
forest of Nezv Zealand and Valdivia alone has developed truly autochtJionous
epiphyte*, whilst the less humid rain-forest of Japan, Australia, Argentina,

and North America possesses only cpipliytic tropical emigrants or species
evolved from these. Among the latter are to be found the last emigrants
from the tropical flora, such as Tillandsia usneoides (Fig. 240) and Poly-
podium incanum in North America.
Only in a few places outside the tropics are there found combined those
conditions that permit terrestrial phanerogams to thrive on the fissured
bark of trees — and this is the first stage in the evolution of epiphytes — for
we may disregard the occasional occurrence of such plants in cavities of
tree-stems. The cold of winter in particular presents an insurmountable
