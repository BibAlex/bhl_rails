THE SOIL
97
The observations were carried on in the forest of Champfetu near Sens, where
on a small area, calcareous soil (chalk) and silicious soil (sand and sandy clay)
alternate, because the clay and sand overlie the chalk, as tertiary strata, forming
sometimes a thick deposit and sometimes a thin one, or have been completely
washed away. The area in question had been planted with different species
of forest trees, such as Pinus sylvestris, P. Laricio, larch, silver-fir, spruce, oak, birch,
which had for the most part thriven equally well on each of the strata : whereas the
maritime pines and sweet-chestnut trees that had also been planted grew luxuriantly
on the soil that was poor in lime, but remained stunted on the calcareous soil and
soon died ; and so much the sooner, the thinner the upper stratum poor in lime.
Wherever the sandy soil poor in lime was absent, both trees could scarcely live
at all.
The chestnut trees and maritime pines on the calcareous soil differed from those
on the sandy soil, not only by their stunted growth and by the abundance of their
dead twigs, but also by the smaller size and the yellower colour of their leaves, which
in the case of the chestnut were partly white. Thus on silicious soil the pine needles
were 0-175-0-189 m. long and 2 mm. broad, whilst on calcareous soil the length of the
needles was between 0-092 and o-iii m. and their breadth 1-5 mm. The chestnut
leaves on clay and sandy soil were up to 0-253 m - l° n g ar >d 0-072 m. broad, but on
calcareous soil at the most 0-149 m - l° n g an d 0-056 m. broad ; those at the end of the
twig were much smaller, often degenerate and nearly white.
The analysis of the soils from which the specimens of Pinus Pinaster had been
taken, the composition of whose ashes will be given below, gave the following
results : —

In the analysis of the ash of the maritime pine grown on these soils, about equal
volumes of wood, bark, and leaves were used. For the purpose of comparison, Pinus
Laricio, which prefers a lime-containing substratum, was taken from the calcareous soil
and analysed.
