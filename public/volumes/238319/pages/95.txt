The analysed sweet-chestnuts grew on the same soil as the maritime pines. In this case
leaves and wood were analysed separately.

The most striking point in these tabular statements is the great differ-
ence in the quantities of lime and potash. Trees grown on silicious soil
are much richer in potash and poorer in lime tliau those grozvn on
calcareous soil.
The authors draw from these observations the conclusion that abundance
of lime in the soil retards the absorption of potash, whereas it accelerates
the absorption of lime and thereby produces an anomalous condition that
is prejudicial to the plants.
The different percentages of ferric oxide in the ashes is perhaps significant,
although it is less striking on account of the small quantities under considera-
tion. Maritime pine and sweet-chestnut on calcareous soil are much poorer,
especially in their leaves, in ferric oxide than on silicious soil. If we consider
