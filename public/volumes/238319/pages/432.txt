With L=i (I max. = 1-250; I med. = 0-598) thick bright green leaves developed, the
dimensions of which averaged as follows : —
Petiole ...... 29 mm.
Length of blade . . . . . 18 ,,
Breadth of do. . . . . . 29 ,,
With L=$ (I max. = 0-317 ; I med. = 0-167) leaves developed of thoroughly normal
size and dimensions: —

With L = i (I max. = o-i58 ; I med. = 0-082) the same, viz.

With L =jV (I max. = o-o66; I med. = 0-038) the petioles were already visibly
abnormally long and the blades reduced in size.
Most striking was the etiolated character of the experimental plants with L=-£t
(I max. = 0-039; I med. = 0-019), when the petiole attained a length of 145 mm., but
the lamina averaged only 22 mm. in length and 32 mm. in breadth ; the upper surfaces
of the pale green leaves were strongly concave.
In the dark the petioles had attained an average length of 174 mm., whilst the
measurements of the lamina, which contained no chlorophyll, were only 11 and
17 mm.
From the same author we again borrow the following data regarding the conditions
of illumination of the shade-plants of Central European forests : —
Cynanchum Viuceto.xicitm. Grows in the open with h = ^-^ (I max. = 1-0-045) ;
is already visibly languishing with ^Va^- Flowers with L = ^-2 1 .7 (I max.= 1-0-068) ;

Prenanthes purpurea. Luxuriant growth and flowering with L (med.) = T 1 g (I med.

none at all.
Corydalis cava : L=^-L Anemone nemorosa: L (med.) attains^; I med. = 0-089.
Only to L (med.) = .^- is the plant luxuriant, with L (med.) = i it appears only poorly
developed and no longer healthy. Sisymbrium Alliaria : L = J- T l r .
The broad- leaved summer-forest differs from the rain-forest not only in
its general appearance, but also in the appearance presented by its individual
constituents, so far as the features can be shown to depend upon climate.
Summer-green trees exhibit a typical tropophilous character in the combi-
nation of the xerophilous habit of their perennial members with the hygro-
philous habit of their foliage. Trunks and boughs are covered by a thick
coat of cork, which in old age becomes deeply fissured by the formation of
bark ; resting buds arc enclosed in hard scaly cataphylls, and are also
