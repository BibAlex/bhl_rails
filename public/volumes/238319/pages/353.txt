Extra- tropical East and Sonth-East Australia have rain at all seasons
of the year, but tvith a relatively dry winter (in particular August) ; the
maxima are during late summer on the coast, during spring and autumn in
the interior. The rainfall, except on mountain-slopes, is too small for rain-
forest. The absence of dry periods during the spring months whose
favourable conditions of temperature give the climate the impress of a good
grassland-climate, and the mildness of winter, in spite of its relative dry-
ness, renders growth of trees possible. Consequently the type of vegetation
is that of savannah, and along the coast, in accordance with the increased
precipitation, it passes into savannah-forest ; in the interior, however, with
a decrease in precipitation, it passes into steppe, which in its turn, as the
drought increases, is replaced by desert.
