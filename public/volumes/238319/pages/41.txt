THE FACTORS
[Part I
afforded by the bark of trees in a virgin forest, the solfataras, and the alpine
highlands. Yet in West Java the vegetation of these habitats is, to a large
extent, composed of identical species of xerophytes, which are completely
absent from other habitats that have a greater physical resemblance to those
in question but are hygrophilous. Thus, for instance. Vaccinium polyanthum
(Agapetes rosea, Jungh.), Rho-
dodendron javanicum, and R.
retusum grow as epiphytes in
the virgin forest, as terrestrial
plants in the treeless alpine
region and in solfataras ; Ficus
diversifolia is an epiphyte in
the virgin forest, a terrestrial
shrub in solfataras ; Vacci-
nium varingiaefolium, Gaulthe-
ria leucocarpa, Myrsine avenis,
Tetranthera citrata inhabit the
treeless alpine region. All
these plants have conspicuous
xerophilous characteristics. The
same agreement is found in
Japan between the vegetation
of the solfataras and that of
the much higher alpine region.
The conditions of life on the
bark of trees, in the moderately
warm virgin mountain-forests,
and on the hot saline sea-shore
are still much more dissimilar
than in the cases cited above.
And yet there is at least one
plant that grows in both habi-
tats as well as in the solfataras,
but nowhere else — the bushy
Ficus diversifolia. Forming the
first vegetation on the dry lava-
fields of Gunong Guntur, which
are fully exposed to the sun's
rays, at about t,ooo meters above sea-level, I also found the Rhodo-
dendron javanicum mentioned above — elsewhere, an epiphyte in the
virgin forest, a terrestrial plant only in the solfataras and on alpine
highlands — side by side with orchids and ferns which are elsewhere
epiphytic.
