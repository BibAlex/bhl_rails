The vegetation of the Karroo semi-desert, which is at an altitude of
1,800-2,000 feet in Cape Colony, is somewhat less meagre and exhibits
a richer systematic composition. The banks of mostly dry river beds, as in
the northern parts of the littoral deserts, are bordered by acacia-bushes
(Acacia horrida) ; all sorts of shrubs and bushes spring up from the soil,
which is almost bare during the dry season, but from which the verdant
and flowering shoots of numerous tuberous and bulbous plants (Pelargonium
sect. Hoarea (Fig. 362), Harpagophytum (Fig. 368), Liliaceae, Iridaceae,
Amaryllidaceae), sprout forth with the spring rains, if the latter be suffi-

ciently abundant, which, however, is not the case every year. The peren-
nial plants are chiefly succulents, such as species of Euphorbia, Stapelia,
Mesembryanthemum,Crassula, and the remarkable Sarcocaulon(Geraniaceae)
with a protective resinous coating (Figs. 365, 366) ; the remaining plants are
of an ericoid type, and frequently so similar in their vegetative organs that
only a close examination reveals their systematic heterogeneity, and shows
them to include representatives, for instance, of the Compositae, Polygala-
ceae, Leguminosae, Euphorbiaceae, Ficoideae, and Scrophulariaceae 1 . Very
