to mention orchids. The beauty and
scent of many tropical Lepidoptera
denote correspondingly developed
senses of colour and smell, and the
large blue Morphos of South America
and the brilliant bird-like Malayan
Ornithoptera are very common in
their native countries. But some
additional characteristics of many
tropical Lepidoptera may be con-
sidered here. Thus many tropical
flowers have enormously long tubes
(Fig. 66), at the base of which there
is nectar, which can be reached only
by moths with a correspondingly
long proboscis. The longest struc-
tures of this kind are the spur-like
pockets of the labellum of Macro-
plectrum sesquipedale, Pfitzer, a
Madagascar orchid, which are five
decimeters long (Fig. 67). Some
tropical Rubiaceae cultivated in the
botanic garden at Buitenzorg at-
tracted my attention by the unusual
length of their corolla-tubes (Fig.
68) ; moths with a proboscis suffi-
ciently long to be able to suck the
nectar that is at their bases do not
occur in Europe, and possibly not
in any part of the north temperate
zone.
Macroplectrum sesquipedale may
be one of these species whose very
restricted geographical distribution
is connected with that of a genus
or species of insect that pollinates
them. An indubitable case of this
nature is exhibited by several North
American species of Yucca, which
are exclusively pollinated by moths
of the genus Pronuba. Thus Yucca
filamentosa, which is frequently grown
in our gardens but always remains
