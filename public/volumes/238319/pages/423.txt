ZONES AND REGIONS [Pt. Ill, Sect. II
atmospheric humidity in winter is considerable, so that its average for the
whole of winter is not low.
Even during summer, excessive atmospheric dryness offers a climatic
element that is unfavourable for tree-growth. Despite the prevalence of
the west wind, investigators agree that when the weatJier is fine, the air of
the steppe at summer time is extremely dry, and during this season high
temperatures prevail, involving vigorous transpiration.
It follows from what has been said, that the climate of the Russian steppe
district has by no means the character of a forest climate, but rather that of
a grassland climate, including as it does dry winter, moist spring and early
summer {June), and a mild temperature with frequent precipitations during
the vegetative season. The drought in late summer and autumn comes
at the close of the vegetative season, and is therefore without injurious
effects.
Central and Northern Russia have a less pronounced forest climate than,
for instance, the Atlantic territories of North America, and accordingly
possess a much less luxuriant forest growth. The precipitations are far
less abundant, especially during the winter; but the unfavourable influence
of this is to some extent mitigated by the prevalence in the Russian forest
district, in contrast with the steppe, of west winds which, even during
winter, do not possess the destructively desiccating action that characterizes
the east winds. It is also of advantage to the Russian forest district that
its climate is unfavourable to grassland, because the early summer is
relatively poor in rain and the precipitations fall chiefly in late summer and
autumn.
