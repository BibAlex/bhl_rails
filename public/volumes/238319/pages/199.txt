Papeete (Tahiti), 218 cm.; Samoa (Utumapu), 212 cm. At certain spots
in the districts of tropical high-forest we find the rainfall as low as about
150 cm., but no lower. Only on the Amazon are rainfalls of 200 cm. and
more the exception ; there the forest owes its luxuriant growth to the
water in the soil, and it consequently does not form an extensive continuous
area, but is confined to the river-banks.
The distribution of precipitation throughout the months of the year may
be given in millimeters for a few non-Malayan stations in the district of the
tropical high-forest : —

In tropical districts with precipitations at all seasons the forest is evergreen,
and is developed as rain-forest. In districts with a marked dry season the
forest is either less rich in foliage during the dry season, for instance in East
Java, or is defoliated like typical monsoon-forest, for instance in the greater
part of Cis-gangetic India.
The meteorological data at my disposal do not permit of a very precise
statement of the conditions that occasion the leaf-fall in the greater
part of Cis-gangetic India. Besides the distribution of the rain, other
factors certainly intervene, such as quantity of rainfall, temperature, and
humidity of the air.

Ratnagiri on the west coast of Cis-gangetic India, at the foot of the Ghats, is
situated in a district where the forests are leafless in the dry season. The table
shows that the dry season is far more marked than in the Malayan forest-district,
