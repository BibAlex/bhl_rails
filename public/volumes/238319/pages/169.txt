210 ZONES AND REGIONS
subject to a more or less rapid change, attributable, as regards the flora,
partly to historical causes and partly to the inequality in the climatic
humidity, but as regards vegetation, to the climatic humidity exclusively.
According to the nature of the atmospheric precipitations, either the
woodland, grassland, or desert type predominates, and, excluding the
local effects of soil, the type of vegetation changes its character only
on passing to a climate with a different degree of humidity. Tracts of
land bounded by such climates may be termed districts 1 . The various
districts of vegetation, in contrast to the floristic zones, exhibit very
irregular distribution and very unequal areas.
High mountains differ, as regards temperature and humidity, climatically
from the lowlands. Their regions defined by temperature are at the same
time those defined by atmospheric precipitations.
Owing to the great differences between the conditions of vegetation
in mountains and lowlands, and to the manifold oecological relations of
the mountain vegetation everywhere, it appears advisable to separate the
treatment of high regions from that of zones and districts and to devote
a distinct section of the book to the vegetation on mountains. The
sections on zones therefore, except in cases where the exclusion of low
mountains or of the lower regions of mountains would be unnatural, are
devoted to the lowlands.
