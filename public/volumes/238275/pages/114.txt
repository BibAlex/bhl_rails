PREFACE.
This Key ia preliminary to a West Coast Botany for beginners, which "will probably
be completed within three years. The object in publishing this skeleton in advance is
twofold : it will be serviceable in connection with the Popular California Flora, while its
ase will disclose mistakes and weak places which can be corrected and strengthened for
the betterment of the final work.
The material has mostly been drawn from Gray's Synoptical Flora of North America
and the California Botany. Free use has also been made of Gray's and Watson's Contri-
butions to American Botany ; Greene's monographs in the Bulletin of the California
Academy of Sciences, and the contributions of these and other authors in Coulter's
Botanical Gazette and the Bulletin of the Torrey Club.
The intention has been to describe all polypetalous and gamopetalous plants growing
In the region indicated on the title page, except those belonging to the orders Umbelliferae
and Composite ; also all the species in the endogenous orders Alismaceae, Orchidaceaa,
Iridaceffi and LiliaceÂ®. The scope of the West Coast Botaoy will be a little broader,
including some of the Apetalaa and possibly a tribe of the Composite. The introductory
lessons and glossaries will be more ample thaa those of the California Flora.
I shall be very thankful for notes of omisaiona, corrections, criticisms and vug>
gestiona.
