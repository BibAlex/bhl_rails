fruit ripens (Fig. G5). A colored
calyx — i. e., nut green — is said
to be Petaloid. Flowers with-
out petals and those of the Lily
Family usually have j^^taloid
sepals (Figs. GO, 70, 71).
The Corolla is Polypei-
alous when the petals are free
from each other (see Figs. 60,
G8, G9, 73). In Gamopetalous
corollas there are all degrees of
cohesion from the complete
uuiou (Fig. G7) of the Entire
limb to the almost free petals
of a Divided corolla (Fig. 58).
Petals often grow upon the calyx
(Fig. G8). Corollas are Rerjular
(Figs. G7, G9) or Irregular (Fig.
GG, and Fig. 58, p. 3. See also
the figures on p. 11 and p. 88b).
Common forms of regular co-
rollas are riO(cd('(Fig. 58), Scdver-
Jorm (Fig. Gi), Funnel-form
C9
(Fig. 67), and Campanulate or Bell-shaped when the tube expands suddenly
at the base to a width nearly equal to that of the summit and about equal
