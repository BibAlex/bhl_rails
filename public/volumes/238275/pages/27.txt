INTRODUCTORY LESSONS.
There are many other names applied to
fruits, which it is not necessary to define
here.
The Gro-svth of Ovules. You can
not study the development of ovules from the
beginning, without the help of a compound
microscope, but you can easily observe all
stages of growth, from a tiny green speck
to the full-grown embryo. Most seeds are
nearly full grown in ajopearance before the
embryo is more than fairly visible to the
naked eye. The seed coat, filled with a
syrupy or milky, usually sweet, liquid, ap-
pears to constitute the very young seed.
With a sharp knife cut in halves a great
many green peas, in size from half grown
7 upward. You will surely find in some of
them tiny green embryos, and you may get specimens from the size of a
pin's head up to those which tightly fill the seed coat. In Fig. 75, at the
top, is seen — magnified two diameters — the young seed of a lupine, cut so
as to show the young embryo lying in one end. In the same figure is
represented a radish pod, laid open so as to show three of the seeds, two
of which exhibit their partly grown embryos.* Below, at 6, is one of
these magnified, and at a an older one, also magnified. The grown em-
bryo completely fills the seed. Observe the positions of the embryofs in
relation to the stems of the seeds and the stems of the pods. The lower
seed in the radish is fastened to the lower side of the i^od, the middle
seed grows to the upper side. The cotyledons increase much more in
size than the radicle. The embryo evidently grows, in jDart at least, by
absorbing the liquid around it. Suppose the embryo of the lupine to quit
growing at the size represented in the figure, and that the liquid around
it thickens until it becomes solid. Would not the seed thus formed be
albuminous ?
♦These are cut in two. The embryo may be seen through the seed-coat, as represented at 6, by hold
ing it up to the light. Half of the seed-coat is removed from a.
