On the left above is represented
an opeiiing biul of Eschscholtzia.
The cap-like calyx has been split at
the bottom and shoved npAvard by
the expanding petals. Kext to this
bud is an open flower of Mecouopsis and one of its nodding buds. Behind the flower,
and projecting above it to the right, is a stem from wliich the petals have just fallen.
The slender filaments Ijending to one side, as they often do, show the curious pistil
which in time becomes the pretty fluted capsule seen below. To the riglit of the ^leco-
nopsis pod is the tlaree-sided capsule of Platystigma lineare. The stem should have a
few hairs upon it. The two flowers with hairy stems, the nodding buds below, and tlie
rough see<l pod above, belong to Platystemon. Observe the three caducous sepals, just
ready to drop from the opening bud. The smooth plant on the right is Platystigma
Californicum, If you choose you may call this the Smooth Platystigma, and tlie other
species, witii the triangular pod, Hairy I'latystigma. The exceedingly prickly Bristly
Argemone is represented on the right, below, by a bud and a couple of bracts. A pistil
with its white pi-icklcs is imperfectly slu)wu against one of the bracts.
The Order Papaveraceae is characterized by flow urs witli 2 or 3 caducous sepals.
