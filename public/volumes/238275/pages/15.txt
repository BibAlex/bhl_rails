You must have wondered why the cotyledons of a bean, which
never become leaf-like, should appear above ground. It is equally strange
that the albuminous seeds of the peony should behave in the reverse
way. As shown in the cut (a and b), the embryo is very small. In
germination the plumule comes up while the cotyledons become decidedly
leaf-like, and fill the shell which has been emptied of its albumen to feed
them and the plumule. These thin, veiny seed leaves could certainly do
better w^ork above ground than those of most lupines, yet they never come
up. There is another curious thing about the growth of peonj'- seeds,
which you may try to discover.
"When the buckwheat and cotton seeds have begun to sprout,
you can study their embryos. Note how the thin, broad cotyledons of
the former are folded once and rolled up with a layer ot snow-white
starch; and how the speckled seed leaves of the latter are folded along
the center, then outwardl}^ back, and finally crumpled endwise to make
them fit coats too short for them. Maple seeds have curiously crumpled
and folded cotyledons. Indeed, all seeds have interestiug lessons to
teach us.
