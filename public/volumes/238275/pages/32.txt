SYSTEMATIC BOTANY.
Tlieso cliaracteis lead you iu the key t(j the onler Crucifer;e, hut it is not easy to decide
farther, hecause you have not tlie fruit. Look for the pods a few weeks later, and you
M ill tiiid them long and flat, as represented in the
figure at e on the left. You can then determine
the name of the plant. The seed pods here
figured will help you in determining some of the
plants in this order.
The curious flower depicted helow is another
early bloomer. You must cut the flower open
and study it carefully. The four — sometimes
five — petals are joined together, and bear upon
the short tube the four stamens which bug tl)e
pistil tightly and form a beak like that of a bird.
The ovary does not adhere to the calyx, and if a
seed pod is partly grown, it will be easy to see
that the seeds grow upon a central placenta.
Turning to the key you are called upon to de-
cide whether the stamens are opposite the lobes
of the corolla or not. They certainly are op-
posite, so the order Primulaceie is evidently
^vhere our plant belongs. The pretty little for-
eigner Anagallis is here figured, and it will be
