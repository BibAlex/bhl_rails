INTRODUCTORY LESSONS.

to be Perigynous ; or the stamens may grow on the corolla (Fig. 50) as
in most gamopetalous flowers, and in Eschscholtzia (Fig. 49). In the
Orchis Family the stamens grow on the pistil.
Irregular Flowers are those in which parts of the same kind are
unlike in form or size.
Inflorescence. The forms of flower-clusters are almost as various
as the shapes of the flowers, but they
may all be referred to two plans, viz. :
Terminal and Axillary. The Raceme
(Fig. 52) is a simple form of axillary
inflorescence in which the leaves are
reduced to bracts. If the flowers are
sessile (without pedicels) the raceme
becomes a Spike (Fig. 53). If the
older flowers are raised on long pedi-
cels the flat-topped cluster is called a
Corymb (Fig. 55); In an Umbel the
pedicels all grow from the end of the
peduncle (Fig. 56). If these are
very short or obsolete a Head is
formed. A Panicle is a loose com-
pound raceme. A Thyrse is a dense
panicle. Fig. 54 represents a Cyme,
the type of terminal inflorescence. A
many-flowered cyme is a Fascicle ; more
densely flowered, a Glomerule. Cymes
55 and Fascicles resemble Corymbs; but
56. Umbel. 55. Corymb. -^^ ^^^ former, the central flowers are
the older, while in the latter, the younger flowers or buds occupy the
center. Glomerules differ from heads in the same way.
The woodland flowers Trillium and Anemone furnish examples of
the simplest form of Terminal Inflorescence. Their simple stems bear
each one flower at the top. Often flowers seem to be axillary when the
plan of inflorescence is terminal. Fig. 57 illustrates a case of this kind-
