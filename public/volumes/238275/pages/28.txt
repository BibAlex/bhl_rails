SYSTEMATIC BOTANY.
NAMES OF PLANTS: CLASSIFICATION.
In a general way we designate the objects around us by single
names. We speak of a stone, a wolf, or a pine; bat to distinguish the
kinds we naturally use two names, as lime stoue, sand stone; grey wolf,
prairie wolf; nut pine, yellow pine, etc. This is one step in classifica-
tion, and the only one commonly taken. This natural plan of double
names was adopted by the great naturalist, Linnaeus, who gave names to
most European plants, as well as to many of this continent. He wisely
gave the Latin form to his names, since that language (being the base of
most languages spoken in civilized countries) is the natural source of cos-
mopolitan names — those truly common to all people. Botanical names,
then, differ from so-called common names principally in form, and they
have these decided advantages: they more exactly represent the rela-
tions between kinds of plants, and they are names that are common to
peo^jle of all languages. In short, they are the true common names.
It is Bot true that botanical names are harder than local names. The most com-
mon of our ornamental j^lants are well known by their scientific names. Xo one thinks
of calling the following botanical names hard: Geranium; Aster; Verbena; Petunia; Por.
tulaca; Crocus; Phlox; Fuchsia; Iris; Magnolia; Oxalis; Azalea; Dahlia; Lobelia; Ar-
nica, etc. Most people talk familiarly of Camellias, Callas, Begonias, Acacias; etc.:
while cur beautiful California plants, Clarkia, Collinsia, Eschscholtzia Nemophila, etc.,
are well known by their proper names — at least, in other countries.
Generic Names correspond to the second parts of the compound com-
mon names, as oak, pine, rose, etc. Some of these are the old Greek or
Latin names of the plant. Most generic names are either derived from
Greek or Latin words descriptive of some peculiarity of the plant, or tbey
are commemorative of some botanist, as Thysanocarpus, from Greek
words meaning fringe and pod; Kelloggia, iu honor of Dr. A. Kellogg, a
veteran botanist of this coast. Sometimes genera are named in honor of
those who are not botanists, as Fremoutia, HoUisteria, etc.
