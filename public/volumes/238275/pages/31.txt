SYSTEMATIC BOTANY.
learn, since its characteristics are well marked. "We will suppose that
you have before you a very common blue-flowered shrubby plant belong-
ing to that order, a single flower of which is shown in Fig. 58. Knowing
the order, you turn at once to p. 38, and begin to use the key to the
genera.
Carefully removing all the petals, the stamens and pistil appear as in a, Fig. 59.
The filaments are united for tlie greater part of their length into a tube which incloses
the ovary as a sheath does a knife. Of the three sections in the key, then, it is evident
that the second is to be taken. Since some of the anthers have shed their pollen, and
others have not, it is safe to say they are of two kinds— a bud will show the difference
better (b, Fig. 59. ) Moreover the leaves are digitate, and have more than three leaflets
We therefore conclude that the third genus is the one. Our plant is slightly shrubby,
so we pass over the first heading in the synopsis of species. Of the second and third
headings the last seems the most likely to lead us aright. Our flower is blue, so we have
to choose between the second and third species. The words " Slightly woody at the
base," decide us in favor of Lupinus Douglasii, though we should examine more speci-
mens before being quite positive.
Fig. 60 represents a flower of a j^lant
common in the Redwood forests. Three or
more of the dull-colored flowers grow in an
umbel on a very short scape between a pair of
spreading radical leaves. Since the leaves have
parallel veins, and the parts of the flower are
in threes, we must use the Analytical Key
for Endogens, p. 13. You will have no diffi-
culty in referring the plant to the Order Lilia-
CE^. To make the analysis of a plant in that
large order easy, the genera are grouped in t^e bursting anther ceiis
three Series. Heading the characteristics of Series I, we find they do
not correspond with those of our plant, which has no floral bracts, which
has the stamens hypogynous instead of perigj^nous, the anthers extrorse
instead of introrse, etc. Comparing Series II with Series III, we decide
that our x^lant belongs in the former, since the perianth is not persistent,
and the flowers are not in racemes or panicles. § 1, in Series II is wrong,
for our plant has no leafy stem. Since the perianth segments of our
flower are dissimilar we try § 3, under which we refer our plant to the
