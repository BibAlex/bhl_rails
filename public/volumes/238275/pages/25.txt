to a third of the length. Irregular flowers are frequently
Bilabiate or Two-lipped, as shown in the figures a and c on
p. 11, and the figures on p. 88b. When the tube of a corolla
is slender, and the regular or irregular limb is small or want-
ing, the flower is said to be Tubular. The term Perianth is
used to designate the calj^x and corolla taken together. It is
mostly used in describing endogenous flowers (Figs. 70, 71).
Stamens may grow upon the receptacle (Ilypogynous,
Fig. 69), upon the calyx (Perigynous, Fig. 68), U23on the
corolla (Fig. 67), or upon the pistil. Stamens are often
united by their filaments so as to form tubes (Fig. 74) or
bundles; or the anthers are joined, as in the Sunflower or
Sometimes there are two kinds of stamens in the same flower
(Fig. 68). Staminodia are antherless or abortive stamens (see longer sta-
mens in Fig. e, p. 8). Aidhers usually consist of two cells, which are
filled with Pollen. If the upper end of the filament lies exactly between
the anther cells, the anther is Innate. An Adnate anther is attached by
one side to the filament (Figs. 67, 68). A Versatile anther is attached be-
tween its ends b}' one side to the tip of the filament (Figs. 71, 72). The
pollen usually escapes from slits in one side of the anther, as shown in
Fig. 69. This side, which in an adnate or versatile anther, is opposite
the filament, is called the face of the anther. When the anther faces
