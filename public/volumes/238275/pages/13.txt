INTRODUCTORY LESSONS.
a. Lupiniis micranthus;
the first p.uiiiule leaf on
the left. b. Lupiuiis ar-
boreus, asit appears when
grown In saml; the root-
hairs are ladened with
Band. c. Lupiniis densi-
florus. d. The same, after
the cotyledons are fully
developed, and the plu-
mule has appeared.
Lupines or-
dinaril}^ grow as
represented in the
cut at <2, but a com-
mon white-flower- *
ed kind presents at the end of a month's
growth the queer api^earance shown at d. At
first the sprouting seeds appear to be like
those of otber lupines (see Fig. c), but when
the cotyledons open, they are seen to be united
by their broad bases. For two or three weeks the
cotyledons enlarge; not only becoming broader, but
thicker; yet we look in vain for a trace of the plu-
mule. Meanwhile a white pustule has been growing,
which finally' bursts and discloses the partly grow^n
leaves of the missing bud, which has all this time
been hidden in the thick stem below the cotyledons!
Now, the tough leathery skin of these cotyledons is
proof against the nightly frosts that prevail at this
season of the year (December), so they go on pre-
paring food from the air with which to feed the
tender plumule, until it also is strong enough to face c
Jack Frost. If you carefully examine these seeds in various
stages of their growth, you will learn that the plumule is at
the bottom of a short tube formed by the united petioles of
the cotyledons. S^ometimes the plumule breaks out through
