bursting through between the>a.
Do not fail to see for yourself how squash
embryos pry open their tough coats. Soon after the
sprout has gained a foothold in the soil, a little knob
grows on the side of the radicle so as to split more
widely open the point of the seed coat, as sliown in Fig. c.
Then the radicle stem between the knob and the cotyledons,
by growing, pries the seed still wider open, as seen at b below.
Finally, by continued growth, the cotyledons are pulled out
of the seed coat and upward to the surface of the ground,
where they expand, and become pretty good leaves. Seeds
planted edgewise, which of course could rarel}' happen in nature, can not
thus free themselves of their seed coats, and it has been i^roved by a
French botanist (M. Flahault) that seeds which come up with their coats
on do not thrive. The seed at b in the figure was first planted the other
side up. It was turned over when the knob on the right had begun to oi)en
the seed. The radicle, which then pointed directly upward, gradually
straightened, bent downward, and finally the second knob grew, by the
help of which the seed leaves were in a fair way to get out when the draw-
ing was made. Some native California plants get
out of their coats in a similar manner.
Germination of Albuminous Seeds.
You Iiave observed that when seeds without al-
bumen send their cotyledons above ground, the
7 seed coats are usually left behind, but the albu-
minous seeds named in paragraph 5 retain their
seed coats often for several days after they come
up. Examine the coats after they are thrown off,
and you will find none of the albumen which
formed the larger part of their contents before
germination. The enlarged cotyledons tell what
has become of it, and it is now plain why the
coats were retained.
