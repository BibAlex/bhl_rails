INTRODUCTORY LESSONS.
there is usually a bud, or branch, or a flower at the base of a leaf be-
tween it and the stem from which it grows.
Buds and flowers at the ends of stems or branches, are Terminal ,'
when between the stems and leaves, Axillary.
Examine the leaf of a Violet or Pansy. You can readily distin-
guish three parts: A broad Blade ; a stem or Petiole, and a pair of appen-
dages at the base of the jjetiole called Stipules. The latter in the Pansy
are leaf -like. Sometimes they are mere scales, and frequently there are
none at all. The petiole may be wanting, also; the leaf is then said to
be Sessile. Leaves Avith but one blade are —
Simple Leaves. The illustrations (Figures 18 to 32) show the
principal forms of simple leaves or leaflets of compound leaves. Care-
fully compare the blades of your leaves with these shapes. If the leaf
in hand does not correspond with any of the figures, you ma^'' describe it
by combining the descriptive words, or by adding a word. A leaf, for
example, too broad to be lanceolate, and narrower than ovate, if about
half wa}^ between the two forms, is Ovate-lanceolate or Lance-ovate; the
first, if nearer ovate; the latter, if nearer lanceolate. Or, if merely a lit-
tle broader than lanceolate, we may say it is Broadly-lanceolate ; when more
slender. Narrowly-lanceolate ; if slender and nearly as broad in the middle
as nearer the base, it is Linear-lanceolate, etc. So, too, there are interme-^
