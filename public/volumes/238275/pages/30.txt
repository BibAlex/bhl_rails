SYSTEMATIO BOTANY.
three sepals and three petals (i. e., a perianth of six leaves or lobes), three
or six stamens and three or six pistils (generally united to form a compound
pistil with a three or six-celled ovary) the plant is an endogen. When
the leaves are netted-veined, and the parts of the flower are not all in
threes, the plant is an exogen.
It is a good plan to write out a description of a plant before
attempting to ascertain its name. The parts may be described in this
order: Roots, Stems, Leaves, Flowers, Fruit.
You may find a smooth jilant bearing a loose raceme of red flowers,
one of which is represented in Fig. 57. The
floral leaves are all colored, but there are
evidently two sets; viz.; a calyx of 5 sepals
inclosing a corolla of 4 petals. The parts of
the flower, then, are not in threes; and, since
the palmately lobed leaves are netted-veined
the plant must be an exogen. Turning to
the key, we proceed as follows :
The plant must belong in "Division' 1," since by carefully removing the sepals
ami petals we find that the latter are separate from, each other. It must be found under
"A," for there are many stamens. The stamens are free from the calyx and corolla, i. c,
they are hypogynous; so we read the next line: " Pistils, few to many distinct carpels,
rarely one." Our tiower has three distinct carpels, therefore we feel sure that it must
be sought under one of the next five equal hues beginning with "Calyx." As the
calyx is easily shaken off from the older flowers we decide that it is deciduous. The
juice is colorless also. We turn, therefore, to Ranunculace.-e, p. 16. The description
of the order is satisfactory. The key to the genera begins with the heading " * Floweri*
refjuJar.^' Ours is not, for the uj)per sepal is unlike the others. *^ ** Flowers irre[fular ;
tolorcd st'paLs ronspiatous," in right. We now choose between "Upper sepal spurred,'
and * ' Upper sepal hooded. " Evidently the first
is right, and the genus is Delphinium. We find
that the generic description on p. 18 fits our
plant. Tlie last species being the only one with
red flowers, we decide that our plant is Del-
phinium iiudicaule, or the Naked-stemmed Lark-
spur.
The order Leguminosae, or the
Pea Family, is one that you will soon
