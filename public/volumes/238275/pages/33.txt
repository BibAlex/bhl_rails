SYSTEMATIC B0TA>:Y.
well to read the description of
Trientalis, that yoxi may know it
M'hen found.
"When you get a liead of the
purple-blue flower of Brodketi
capitata, figured on page xxiv of
this book, it M"ill be tlie proper
time to study the figures on this
page, and what is here said about
the genus they illustrate.
Upon p. 113 you Avill find the
species grouped under three sub-genera or sections.
/^ Figures a, d, and e illustrate the first, c the sec-
ond, and b the third. The species belonging to
the first section are arranged under two heads
marked by asterisks, and those under the first head
are under subheads marked by daggers. Species 4
and 5 closely resemble number 6, which is put un-
der a different head, because it has six true or
anther-bearing stamens instead of three stamens
and three staminodia. Fig. a shows that three of
^ e / ^i^g filaments came near being antherless. Petaloid

the staminodia (opposite the outer segments of the perianth) are not petaloid, but
resemble true stamens. Observe that the first species is distinguished by staminodia not
notched at the top as shown in the figure. The species in ยง Seubertia resemble the first
three in general appearance, but the stamens and pistils are very different, as is shown
by Fig. c. Observe that the stamens have versatile instead of basifixed anthers; and the
ovary is upon a stipe, instead of being sessile. Douglas' Brodisea, of Oregon, is like
Fig. c, only the base of the perianth is broader, the upper row of stamens have broad
fcases, the stipe is shorter and the flowers are on short pedicels, so as to form a sub-
capitate umbel. The most common species of the third section is the "W'liite Broditea.
Fig. b shows a part of the flower.
The middle figure on the next page represents a plant, the curious cup-like leaves of
which must have attracted your attention. The leaf cups are frequently much larger thars
here shown, and borne upon stems a foot or more in height. Though tlie flowers are small.
