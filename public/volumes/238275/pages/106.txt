GLOSSARY
OF
GENERIC AND SPECIFIC NAMES.
All the generic and specific names found in this work are here deiiued except a few
of obscure or unknown meaning and some which have undoubtedly been overlooked.
Commemorative names are followed by the names — when known to me — of those thus
honored. Specific names are given sometimes in one gender, sometimes in another. The
learner must kuow that, as a rule, if a specific name ends in tis, a, or vm, it may end in
either of the other two to correspond with the gender of the generic name; as. Convol-
vulus Call/ornirvs (Masculine), Polygala Califomka (Feminine), Galium CaVfornicum
(Neuter). Or, the specific name may end in is or c, the former agreeing with masculine
and feminine generic names, the latter with neuter names. The meaning of each name,
where possible, is given in a form suitable for a common or English name of the plant..
