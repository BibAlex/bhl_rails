SECTION 1.â€” THE BEGINNINGS OF PLANT LIFE.
1. If the first rain of the wet season is followed by warm, sunny
weather, sjiecks of green will soon appear among the dry stems of last
year's weeds; and in fence corners or other edd}' nooks where summer
winds have drifted seeds and covered them with dust, you may find per-
fect mats of bab}' plants. With a shovel skim off a few square inches of
this plant-bearing soil, and carefully examine it. Except a few green
needles, which you recognize as spears of grass, most of these little plants
seem to consist of white stems, which split at the top into pairs of green
leaves. Looking sharply, you may find between each pair of leaves a

curiously enough are not like the first two. (Figures 1 to 0). Searching
through the shovelful of earth you will likely find plants in all stages of

ing their bowed leaf-heads into the sunlight. Here, then, is material
from which 3'ou may learn liow plants grow; a lesson, remember, which
no text-book or schoolmaster can teach you. It will be easier, however,
since most of these early wild plants come from very small seeds, to take
