INTRODUCTION.
THE contents (with illustrations) of this pamphlet are
grouped into five parts, as follows :
Part I is a free translation of Prof. Paul Wagner's
celebrated report on "The Rational Fertilization of Agri-
cultural Plants" ("Die Rationelle Duengung"). As this
valuable report, is in a foreign language and not accessible
to most readers, it is believed that a synopsis will prove to
be of much interest to the masses of American farmers.
Prof. Wagner is director of the Experiment Station at
Darmstadt, Germany, and his official experiments in plant
nutrition and in the use of artificial fertilizers, have given
him a world-wide reputation as an agricultural authority.
His experiments, which show that leguminous plants, such
as clover, peas and beans, have the power of assimilating
large amounts of nitrogen from the air, when sufficient
potash and phosphoric acid are present in the soil, and that this
element of plant food can bo used to fertilize succeeding
crops, are of exceedingly great value and make possible
a saving of millions of dollars to farmers.
Part II gives the simplest way of testing the manure
or fertilizer needs of any soil. It explains the nature of
what are commonly known as plot experiments.
Manures, fertilizers, crops for green manuring, or
whatever is successfully used as plant food for the purpose
