PRECAUTIONS NECESSARY IN MAKING EXPERIMENTS
WITH FERTILIZERS.
In the preceding pages it was shown how to make
experiments with fertilizers on a simple and also on a
more elaborate scale. The proposition is to judge the
effect of fertilizers from the actual increase produced by
their use. This is simple, indeed, yet accurate manipula-
tion and many precautions are necessary to make such
experiments really truthful and reliable, and as a guide to
the practical experimenter, the following rules are given :
1. The greatest care should be taken to select a
portion of the field which is as even in fertility as possible.
Lack of uniformity of soil will give misleading results, and
often render the experiments of little value.
2. It is best to select level land for experimenting.
If. such cannot be had, make the experimental plots run up
and down the slope, so that the washings by rain will not
carry the fertilizers from one plot to another.
3. Land that has been freshly cleared, that has been
fertilized in preceding years, or that has been in sod, is not
well adapted for experiments, because such locations are
often uneven in fertility, and, therefore, would not give
reliable results.
4. The experimental field can be measured by a
chain or pole, marked with feet and inches. Each plot
should be indicated by stakes or stones at the boundaries,,
so that the divisions will be well defined. It is best to
