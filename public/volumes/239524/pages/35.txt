SOIL IMPROVEMENT. 99
either case, a sale crop, such as wheat, corn, oats, barley,
potatoes, or other non-legume, should be grown, to be
followed by a legume again, either the following season,
or the second season after. In this way less nitrogen
fertilizer need be bought, and this comprises practically
the whole value of legumes as a fertilizer.
PART II.
HOW TO EXPERIMENT.
In Part I is given in detail the general nature of
legumes or nitrogen gatherers, and the best use to be
n. ade of them. At best, however, legumes are only an aid>
and on many farms and plantations legumes cannot be
gr )wn regularly in such manner as to supply most of the
nitrogen fertilizer needed. There also remains to be
determined on all farms the natural richness of the soil,
that is, its contents in available potash, phosphoric acid
and nitrogen. Chemical analysis informs us how much
plant food a soil contains, but unfortunately it does not
indicate what portion of this plant food is in an available
or useful form. A soil, as we have shown in the preceding
chapter, may contain potash enough for a hundred crops,
and still fail for lack of available potash plant food.
