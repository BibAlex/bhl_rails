POTATOES, 59
per acre of muriate of potash added. The only differ-
ence in treatment between this plot and the preceding
one was the addition of muriate of potash. What was the
result ? Here, the yield was at the rate of 230 bushels
per acre. Notwithstanding this large yield, only about
one-fifth of the potatoes were small in size.
This remarkable increase leads to the conclusion that
potash is the element which exerts the most marked effect
upon the yield of potatoes.

The experiments illustrated on the following page
are described in Bulletin No, 45, published in 1893, of the
Kentucky Experiment Station.
Here the results of the use of different fertilizers
upon corn and fodder are plainly illustrated. Plot No. 10
in the above received an application of nitrogen only, but
shows no increase over the unfertilized plot. Plot No. 5,
which received nitrogen and phosphoric acid, shows but a
slight increase over the nitrogen plot. On plot No. 6,
where potash was added to the nitrogen, the yield was
increased from 27 bushels to 61.7 bushels per acre, or
129 per cent. On plot No. 3, which received potash,
phosphoric acid and nitrogen, the yield was almost
identical with Plot No. 6 ; this shows plainly that potash
is the regulating ingredient in a fertilizer for corn upon
toil such as that where the experiments were made, and
