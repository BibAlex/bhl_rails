PART IV.
RESULTS OF OFFICIAL FERTILIZER
EXPERIMENTS.
Our experiment stations are now at work finding out
what forms and quantities of fertilizers will best supply the
soils and crops at the lowest cost. Although each station
works upon the soils and crops of its own region, the
results of such work are often of great value to the farmers
of other states. Thus, the results with fertilizers for cotton
and remedies for cotton blight are useful to the planters of
all cotton growing states. The results obtained at the
West Virginia and Connecticut stations with fertilizers
upon potatoes may apply also in New York and Ohio.
What is found as the result of a certain kind of fertilizer
upon corn at the Kentucky and Tennessee stations may be
useful to farmers in Virginia and Illinois.
The results of experiments with fertilizers are pub-
lished in many of the experiment station "bulletins." It is
important that the practical information gained in the
experimental fields of the stations should be known to the
farmers, not only of the states in which the tests were
made, but to the farmers of other states. For this purpose
we have selected from experiment station bulletins some
results obtained with fertilizers upon the most common z nc
staple crops. The facts and illustrations here given are Ul
taken from the official bulletins and records.
