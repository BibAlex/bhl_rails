14 PROFITABLE MANURING,
in the form of plant food. Nitrogen is the most expensive
of the three elements of plant food and costs from two to
three times as much per pound as either potash or phos-
phoric acid ; the latter two cost about the same per pound.
A rough example will illustrate the broad general principles
of profitable manuring at its best. Assuming that potash
and phosphoric acid cost each 5 cents per pound, and nitrogen
15 cents per pound, and that to grow a fair crop of clover
requires per acre 90 pounds of potash and 20 pounds of
phosphoric acid, there would be a total cost for plant food
of $5.50 per acre. The crop will contain 82 pounds of
nitrogen, 90 pounds of potash and 20 pounds of phosphoric
acid with a value as follows :
Nitrogen 82 Ibs. at 15 cts $12.30
Potash 90 " " 5 " , 4.50
Phosphoric acid 20 " " 5 " i.oo
Total $17 80
Cost 5.50
Gain $i 2.30
While these results are theoretical, pure and simple,
still they represent the problem of using legumes profitably.
In many crops the margin of profit is narrow, and it is only
by making use of legume nitrogen that the results may
show a balance on the right side. It is not enough that a
farmer in these days must know the nature of manures
generally, but he must also know how to make the most of
and all of them.
