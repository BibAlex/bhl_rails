EXPERIMENT FARM AT SOUTHERN PINES, N.G
This farm was established through the enterprise of
the State Horticultural Society of North Carolina, near the
town of Southern Pines in that State, for the express pur-
pose of making the most thorough experiments with differ-
ent fertilizers on different crops. The plans and operations
are so outlined, that the plant food requirements of a great
variety of crops can be studied in such a manner as to
make the results useful, not alone to the special section in
which these experiments are located, but to every farmer,
vegetable and fruit grower in the United States. It was
essential in this connection to select a locality in a
climate suited to a variety of crops, and a soil of uniform
