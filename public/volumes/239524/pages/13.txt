of increasing the growth of plants, always contain one or att
of these three substances, potash, phosphoric acid and nitrogen.
A luxuriant plant growth is not caused merely by the
manure or fertilizer as such, but by the potash, phos-
phoric acid and nitrogen contained in it. It must be kept
clearly in mind that plants need all three of these plant
foods ; no one of them can do the work of the other two,
nor any two the work of the other one. However rich a
soil may be in any one of them, or in any two, if one is
totally lacking, no plant can grow ; if one of these sub-
stances is present, say only in sufficient quantity for a
quarter crop, only a quarter crop will be grown, even if
the other two substances be present in great excess of the
needs of a full crop.
Once the nature of plant food is well understood, plot
experiments become simple. The idea is to determine
which of the three elements of plant food the soil needs.
This the experimenter learns by "putting the question" to
the soil itself. He applies different fertilizing materials on
different plots, and he gets his answer in the quantity and
quality of crop the plots produce.
Part III includes a description of the Experiment
Farm at Southern Pines, North Carolina. The State
Horticultural Society of North Carolina is conducting
there an elaborate and extensive series of experiments with
fertilizers to determine the needs of different horticultural
Crops in the field. This enterprise is managed with great
thoroughness and the experiments are directed by trained
