A MORE ELABORATE PLAN FOR EXPERIMENTING.
For those who wish to make a more detailed experi-
ment, so as to study the effects of different combinations
of potash, phosphoric acid and nitrogen, a more elaborate
plan is given on page 34.
The plan comprises seven plots of equal size and
separated by paths four feet wide. The size of the plots
must depend somewhat on local conditions and the kind of
crop to be grown. A very convenient size is one-tenth of
an acre. A strip 93^- feet long by 46! feet wide, would
represent one-tenth of an acre in convenient shape. How-
ever, it may be best to arrange differently if the size is not
convenient. Each plot should be numbered separately.
