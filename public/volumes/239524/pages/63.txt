potash alone and Plot No. 9 receiving the same applica-
tion as Plot No. 6, but with potash added. The results
are very striking. The average yield from the unfertilized
plots was 42.9 bushels. Potash alone produced 87 bushels s
which is an increase of more than 100 per cent. Plot
No. 9 produced nearly 127 bushels against 59 bushels
from Plot No. 6, where phosphoric acid and nitrogen were
used without potash, being an increase of 115 per cent
produced by the use of muriate of potash.
One more result may be given, showing the favorable
influence on potatoes, of a fertilizer containing potash.
Recent experiments (by Mr. T. J. Stroud) at Shaker Sta-
tion, Connecticut, confirm the conclusions reached inde-
pendently at the West Virginia and Kentucky Experi-
ment Stations. For the purpose of comparison, the yield
of potatoes from plots numbered i, 2 and 4, all of the
same size, are shown on the preceding page.
No. i shows the yield of potatoes from a plot which
received no fertilizer. The product was at the rate of 73
bushels per acre. About one-half of the potatoes, as you
will see, are small in size.
No. 2 shows the yield of potatoes from a plot which
was fertilized with acid phosphate and nitrate of soda.
Here, the yield was at the rate of 140 bushels per acre.
About one-fourth of the potatoes from this plot were
undersized.
No. 4 shows the yield of potatoes from a plot which
received the igme fertilizer an No. a, but with 140 poundi
