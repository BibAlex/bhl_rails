GREEN MANURING.
of green manuring is not advisable or economical. The
reason is that the nitrogen in its usually soluble form, as
applied in nitrate of soda, changes into less soluble organic
compounds, which are not so readily available as plant food
for the succeeding crop.

on this subject. The ten pots were all manured alike as to

series of five pots each. The five pots in the first series (to
the left in the illustration) were planted to mustard, with
nitrogen applied in the fall. The following spring the
mustard was worked into the soil as a (non-legume?
green manure, and oats were planted. The second series
received the same amount of nitrogen as the first series,
but it was applied in the spring directly to the oats. The
oats in the pots on the right made a stronger growth and
