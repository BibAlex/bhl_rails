GREEN MANURING.
By green manuring is meant the growing of crops for
the purpose of plowing them into the soil to increase its
fertility. One of the objects of green manuring is to enrich
the soil in organic matter, which is valuable, especially with
soils that are either too loose or too stiff. The improve-
ment consists in bettering the mechanical texture, making
soils more retentive of moisture, and consequently less
subject to the effects of drouth. The most important feature,
however, in connection with green manuring lies in the use
of legumes, because these plants are valuable not only for
the organic matter they produce, but also for the nitrogen
they absorb from the atmosphere, which is useful as plant
food for succeeding crops. Plants which are not legumes
do not have this property of taking nitrogen from the air.
Whatever plant food they contain has been taken from the
soil.
Prof. Wagner has made some interesting experiments
showing the value of legumes for green manuring.
Figure 4 is from a photograph illustrating one of
these experiments. The four pots to the left were planted
with oats and all of them received sufficient potash and
phosphoric acid, but the first two were not supplied with
pitrogen, while the other * two received an ample supply.
