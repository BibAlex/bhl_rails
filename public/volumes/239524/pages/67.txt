CORN. 61
wherever it is applied, there is a considerable increase in
the yield.
The illustrations on page 62 show the results of a series
of experiments with corn, conducted by Prof. W. P. Brooks
of the Massachusetts Experiment Station. For the pur-
pose of comparison the yields of two plots of exactly the
same size are given side by side.
The first illustration shows the yield of corn from
two plots, each -fo of an acre :
The one marked "no fertilizer" produced 117 pounds
of stover and 123 pounds of ear corn. The other plots
received acid phosphate and muriate of potash and yielded
ror pounds of stover and 198 pounds of ear corn, that is,
an increase of 61 per cent, over the plot not fertilized
The lower illustration is interesting, as giving a
comparison between the effects of chemical fertilizers and
barnyard manure on corn.
The plot receiving barnyard manure produced 188
pounds of stover and 219 pounds of ear corn. The plot,
which received chemical fertilizers (consisting of nitrate
of soda, acid phosphate and muriate of potash) produced
204 pounds of ear corn, or about the same results as with
the stable manure.
The illustration on page 63 is even more valuable as
showing the marked effects of the potash on corn.
Here we have two plots of same size, one unfertilized
and another fertilized with muriate of potash. Note the
wonderful difference in the yield of corn. The yield from
