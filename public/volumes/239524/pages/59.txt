growing side by side with rows of cotton, thin % and
unhealthy looking.
A few years ago Prof. Atkinson, who was biologist at
the Station, began a series of experiments with fertilizers
for cotton.
Twenty experimental plots were arranged. The plots
were treated differently; some of them received no manure
while most of the plots had applications of the various
fertilizer ingredients, such as acid phosphate, cottonseed
meal and kainit. The most striking results were obtained
from the use of kainit. Prof. Atkinson says: "The yield
on the kainit plots is increased from 70 to 100 per cent,
above that where no fertilizer was used, and an average of
40 per cent, increase over that of any other single fertilizer
or combination, without the kainit, used.* 9
COTTON BLIGHT.
(Rust.)
The next illustration is taken from the same bulletin.
This shows the difference between a strong, vigorous
cotton plant and one that is suffering from blight or red
rust. No cotton planter needs to be told of the great loss
occasioned by this mysterious and much-dreaded disease.
It is more destructive in some places than in others, but
the damage done all through the South amounts to thou-
sands of dollars every season.
