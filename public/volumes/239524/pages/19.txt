PROFITABLE MANURING. IJ
izer chemicals, should contain such quantities of potash,
phosphoric acid and nitrogen, that, as nearly as may be,
all of each is taken up by the crop. A manure or fertilizer
thus proportioned is said to be well balanced.
In the figures referred to in the earlier part of this
chapter, an illustration is given of an attempt to grow plants
without nitrogen, and, through the use of pictures taken
from actual photographs, it was shown that, except in the
case of the class of plants called legumes, plants cannot
make any useful growth without nitrogen. Had Prof.
Wagner withheld either potash or phosphoric acid, no con-
siderable growth would have been made in the case of either
the barley or the legumes. The illustration was made,
however, not to show that any crop or crops can do without
one or another of the elements of plant food, but to show
that a certain class of plants can supply their own nitrogen.
Legumes must have nitrogen as well as other plants, but do
not need much nitrogen manuring. This one point is the
basis of the most important detail of profitable manuring.
Manuring, as already stated, means the use of potash,
phosphoric acid and nitrogen in growing a crop. Profitable
manuring includes the selling of the crop for an increase
over the cost of the manure, cost of seeding, tillage, and
other necessary expenses Thus plant food may be
regarded as something which is bought to grow crops and
sold as crops to repay for the investment. Therefore* the
potash, phosphoric acid and nitrogen converted into crops
should always be sold at a much higher price than they cost
