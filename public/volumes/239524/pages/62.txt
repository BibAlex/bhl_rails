Plot No. 3 weighed 55.8 pounds, and the plants and the
potatoes are shown on the right-hand side. The increased
yield due to the use of kainit and acid phosphate was
reckoned to be at the rate of 16134 bushels per acre.
Referring to Bulletin No. 61 of the Kentucky Experi-
ment Station, dated March 1896, we find some very inter-
esting experiments conducted upon potatoes, which the

The season was an unfavorable one for potatoes, but
all the results obtained plainly reveal the importance of
potash for this crop. The two plots on the left side of
the illustration, Plots Nos. 5 and 6, received no potash,
Plot No, 5 being unfertilized and Plot No. 6 receiving
nitrogen and phosphoric acid without potash. The two
plots appearing on the right side of the picture were
fertilized with potash, Plot No. 4 receiving muriate of
