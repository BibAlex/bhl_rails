5O EXPERIMENT FARM AT SOUTHERN PINES, N. C.
per acre, that is 122 bushels less. On the plot re-
ceiving more than 2400 Ibs. of fertilizer per acre the actual
cost per bushel of potatoes to the grower, including seed-
ing, cultivation and fertilizers used, was only 8 cents per
bushel. Making the same calculation on the yield ob-
tained on the unfertilized plot, the cost per bushel of
potatoes was 50 cents.
These results were obtained in a season which was
favorable to the growth of sweet potatoes. In ordinary
seasons excessive applications of fertilizers often do not
produce such paying results, and medium amounts are
most profitable ; nevertheless, the example shows what can
be done in a favorable season, and this also is a valuable
lesson to the grower.
This brief outline of the operations at the Experi-
mental Farm at Southern Pines will give the practical
farmer some idea of the value and importance of the tests
being made to study the question of how to fertilize differ-
ent crops in the best and most economical manner.
The results thus far obtained have thrown much light
on the problems of plant feeding, and the conclusions
drawn promise to be of great value and usefulness to
every farmer, fruit and vegetable grower in the United
States. The farm management issues publications for the
benefit of agriculture, which may be obtained free by the
applicant, and there will thus be spread, as widely as
possible, practical information of great value to the farm-
ers of the North and South, East and West.
