JO HOW TO EXPERIMENT.
The only reliable way to determine the crop-making
value or power of a soil is by making what are called plot
experiments. Small portions of land, usually one-tenth or
one-twentieth of an acre each, are laid out on an even,
level field. These plots are all broken, seeded and tilled
precisely in the same manner, but are treated differently
as to applications of plant food. Some of the plots receive
no fertilizer, others one or two or all three of the plant
food ingredients and in varying proportions. The crops
are harvested separately from each plot, carefully weighed,
and their quality noted. Thus, the results obtained from
the various plots show the effectiveness of the different
fertilizer combinations in producing yield and quality.
Plot experiments have been made extensively for years
and a great deal of valuable information has been obtained
from them, but it is necessary to continue them more or
less all the time, as soils change quickly when not system-
atically fertilized.
The agricultural experiment stations, as a rule, make
fertilizer experiments, some of them extensively, but the
stations have many problems in agriculture to work out,
and cannot give all their attention to one line of work. In
Europe there are a number of special experiment farms,
confined largely to the study of plant food and soils. In
this country thus far we have but one, the Experiment
Farm of the North Carolina State Horticultural Society, at
Southern Pines, North Carolina, of which a more detailed
account will be given later in this book.
