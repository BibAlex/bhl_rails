PRECAUTIONS NECESSARY IN MAKING EXPERIMENTS 37
have a stake at each corner of the different plots, which
should be marked with the number of the plot.
5. It is best to have the experimental plots long and
narrow, because thus they will average up for unevenness
of soil.
6. It is best to separate plots by paths, in order to
prevent roots of plants of one plot from feeding on the
fertilizer supplied to the adjoining plots.
7. Avoid windy days in spreading the fertilizers, so
that they may not be blown and scattered unevenly over
the plots.
8. All the plots must be treated alike in every respect,
except as to the amount and kind of fertilizer applied. The
same kind and quality of seed must be used over the whole
area. The planting or sowing on all the plots must be done
the same day. (If a part be planted before and a part after a
rain, the experiment may become valueless.) Use every pre-
caution necessary to secure a full stand of plants, and if a
uniform stand has not been secured at the first planting,
plow up the whole field and plant over again. Arrange the
same number of rows on each plot, and the same number
of hills and plants (as nearly as possible) in each row. The
plots should be plowed and cultivated alike, and whatever
operation is needed in the experimental field, should be
carried out uniformly all over the plots.
9. The harvesting of the crop and weighing of yields
must be accurate. Experiments are usually made on plots
of one-tenth or one-twentieth of an acre, and a mistake will
