THE RESULTS FROM THESE EXPERIMENTAL PLOTS
WILL SHOW:
Plot No. i. What the land will produce without any
fertilizer.
Plot No. 2. The effect of Potash and Phosphoric Acid.
Plot No. 3, The effect of Potash and Nitrogen.
Plot No. 4, The effect of Phosphoric Acid and Nitrogen.
Plot No. 5. The effect of a "complete fertilizer," that
is, one containing potash, phosphoric acid and nitrogen.
Plot No. 6. The effect of lime in connection with a
"complete fertilizer."
Plot No. 7. Shows what the soil will produce without
any fertilizer ; it is also a check on Plot No. i, and will
indicate if the land is uniform in composition.
It will be noticed, that one plot in each series received
an application of lime. This will point out if the soil
needs liming. Some soils, through the decay of vegetable
matter in them, or other causes, have become acid or
"sour," and are unsuited for the growth of many crops,
unless lime is added. In cases where land is known to be
sour and notoriously deficient in lime, it is best to modify
the above described plan by applying lime to all of the
plots with the exception of plot No. 6, which is to be left
unlimed for comparison. Lime corrects the acid condition
of the sour soils. The best manner of applying the lime
would be to slack it first and then broadcast during fall or
winter, or at any rate, early in the spring, so as to allow
plenty of time for the material to leach well into the soil.
