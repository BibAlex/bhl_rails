SOIL IMPROVEMENT.
The experiments by Prof. Wagner show, first, that
plants of a certain class have the power of absorbing nitro-
gen from the air, and converting it into such a form that it
serves as plant food. They show, further, how this nitro-
gen may be afterwards employed to the best advantage in
practical planting or farming. The reader, however, should
thoroughly understand that, though these legumes have the
power of absorbing nitrogen from the atmosphere, still they
in turn must be fed with potash and phosphoric acid to
promote full growth. While *it is not known exactly how
much potash and phosphoric acid is necessary to enable a
legume to gather or produce or " make " one pound of fer-
tilizer nitrogen, it may be estimated, by taking the compo-
sition of a number of staple legume crops. The following
table shows the pounds of plant food contained in an
average acre of several legume crops :
