HOW TO EXPERIMENT. 3!
The careful work that is done at experiment stations
and experiment farms is useful mainly for the study ana
definition of scientific principles, and is thus of great value
and importance, the practical application, however, in
individual cases should depend on home experiments.
Not only do the various agricultural crops differ widely in
their requirements of plant food elements, especially when
grown under different conditions, but also the various soils
of the farm show different needs, and the same kind of soil
may vary under different treatment, even from one season
to another. Hence every progressive farmer, who wishes
to economize his resources and to use fertilizers to his best
advantage and with the largest profit, must continuously
study the condition of his soils and crops, and must himself
become an experimenter. Decisive results are rarely
obtained in one season, and frequently the experiments are
spoiled by unfavorable weather, insects, plant diseases and
other causes, therefore, the experimenter is advised to
continue his trials with fertilizers from year to year.
Every farmer will be fully repaid for his time and trouble,
after he definitely learns what his soils and crops require,
and the knowledge gained will be worth many dollars to
him in buying and using fertilizers.
The following simple plan for experimenting can be
carried out by any farmer without difficulty, and enables
him to find out if an increased yield can be produced by
the use of fertilizers.
One acre of land can be divided into three plots of
