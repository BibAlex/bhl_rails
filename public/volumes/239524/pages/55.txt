EXPERIMENT FARM AT SOUTHERN PINES, N. C. 49
bushels. The next illustration shows results from a plot to
which phosphoric acid and nitrogen were applied.
The yield amounted to 43 bushels per acre. As will be
seen from the picture, the amount of first-class potatoes is
considerably larger than obtained from the unmanurcd
plot. The next illustration shows the actual yield obtained
from a plot treated as the preceding one, but with the
addition of potash.
The yield from this plot was 176 bushels per acre.
It must be noted that the plots represented in the two
preceding illustrations were treated with what may be
considered a moderate application of potash, phosphoric
acid and nitrogen. On other plots this application of the
three plant foods was doubled and trebled, and the illustra-
tion represented on page 48 shows the actual yield obtained
on the plot which received the highest application of a
complete fertilizer. The yield was 628 bushels per acre
As it may be of interest, it is stated here that the
actual fertilizer per acre used on this plot consisted of
480 Ibs. Muriate of Potash,
1200 Ibs. Acid Phosphate,
750 Ibs. Nitrate of Soda.
Total, 2430 Ibs.
This quantity of fertilizer used per acre is much more
than ordinarily would be applied upon the farm ; it is what
is considered excessive, nevertheless, in this particular in-
stance the excessive application was both useful and remu-
nerative. An adjoining plot, to which only f of this
amount (1620 Ibs. in ail) was applied, produced 506 bushels
