40 EXPERIMENT FARM AT SOUTHERN PINES, N. C.
and low natural fertility, so that it may represent an average
condition of generally worn-out soils. No place could have
been better suited for the purpose sought than that selected
for these experiments.
The farm is situated in what is known as the long-leaf
pine belt, covering an enormous area of this country and
reaching through the Atlantic States from Virginia to
Texas. Thus it is located in a section which is typical for
a considerable portion of this country and represented in
nearly every southern state. Moreover, the soil, being of a
thin, sandy, uniform texture, is very favorable for these
experiments. It was virgin at the time that the farm was
established, and therefore, uninfluenced by the effect of
previous manuring and other operations tending to make
the soil less uniform. The town of Southern Pines, near
which the farm is located, is easily accessible, a-nd many
farmers avail themselves of the opportunity to visit the
Experiment Farm and to study the operations there as an
object lesson.
The Experiment Farm is divided into two departments,
one of them especially intended for the study of annual
farm crops and the other for perennial fruit crops. It com-
prises in all about 80 acres. The principle employed is
that of plot experimenting, as described in a previous
chapter. Thus the farm comprises certain series, each
series representing a particular crop to be experimented
upon, and each of these series is subdivided into a certain
number of plots treated with different elements of plant
