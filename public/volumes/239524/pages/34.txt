2$ SOIL IMPROVEMENT.
For 203 pounds of nitrogen, as an average, are
required 202 pounds of potash and 49 pounds of phos-
phoric acid. That means for every pound of nitrogen
u made " by the use of legumes, the crop must have used
one pound of potash and about one-quarter of a pound oj
phosphoric acid.
Mucli has been said about clovers " leaving the soil
better than they find it," and it is the common belief
that they improve the soil. This is true in one sense, but
not in another. To illustrate, a clover crop, cut for hay,
removed from the soil per acre about 184 pounds of
potash, 15 2 pounds of phosphoric acid and 212 pounds of
nitrogen. Of this most of the nitrogen may come from
the air, but the potish and phosphoric acid come from the
soil, and when the crop is removed, the soil is poorer by
just that much potash and phosphoric acid. The rowen, or
after-crop, contains nitrogen which may be turned into the
soil ; also, the roots and stubble count for something. At
che same time, all must keep in mind, that the gain is in
nitrogen only, and there is not even this gain if potash and
phosphoric acid are lacking. Clover failure is very
common, indeed, but a farmer rarely stops to think that
exhaustion of the soil in potash and phosphoric acid may
be the cause of it.
To sum up : To use legumes profitably, they must be
well supplied with potash and phosphoric acid, and the
crop either turned under as green-manure, or used as
forage and returned to the soil as farmyard manure. In
