26 PLANT FOOD MUST BE AVAILABLE TO BE USEFUL.
on these two soils, although the sandy soil contained
enough potash for 30 successive crops, and the clayey seal
for 117 and more.
The principle, that potash, phosphoric acid and nitro-
gen, to be useful to plants, must be in an available form,
refers with equal force to plant food contained in artificial
fertilizers, their agricultural value is dependent on and
measured solely by the available potash, available phosphoric
acid and available nitrogen, which they contain. Thus
crude phosphate rock, while very rich in phosphoric acid,
is nearly valueless as plant food, and the phosphoric acid it
contains must be made soluble (available) by treatment
with sulphuric acid (acidulated) and converted into "acid
phosphate," so that it may become useful. The same refers
to crude bones, which contain their phosphoric acid, for the
most part, in an unavailable condition, and must be con-
verted into acidulated or " dissolved bone " to become fully
effective. The potash in potash salts from the Stassfurt
mines is all soluble in water, and, therefore, readily avail
able to the crop. The potash contained in feldspar and
other natural products is insoluble and practically useless,
while that contained in organic matter is slowly available.
Nitrogen is also irregular in availability ; in the form of
nitrate of soda and sulphate of ammonia, it is readily soluble
and available; in dried blood, fish scrap and tankage, it is
more slowly available ; while in leather and wool wastes,
the nitrogen is so slowly available, that they are well nigh
worthless as plant food.
