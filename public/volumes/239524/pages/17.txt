PROFITABLE MANURING. II
least, do riot require any considerable amount of nitrogen
manuring ; and that it would be wasteful to use much
nitrogen fertilizer on such.
We have gone to some trouble to illustrate this point,
as it is the basis of profitable manuring, and must be fully
understood as a fact. For the purpose of profitable manur-
ing, plants may be divided into two classes : First, those
which need nitrogen manuring ; and second, those which do
not need nitrogen manuring. Among the plants of the first
class are wheat, corn, oats, rye, barley, potatoes, beets,
turnips, cabbage, etc. Among those of the second class are
peas, beans, vetches, serradella, cow peas, alfalfa and all the
clovers. Plants of the second class are called legumes.
They have the power of drawing the nitrogen from the air
and changing it into forms suitable for plant food. This
power is due to the action of certain bacteria which infest
the roots of plants of this class, and whose presence is
recognized by the growth of little knots on the roots, the
so-called root "nodules," as shown in the illustration
Fig. 3 on the next page.
We have spoken of potash and phosphoric acid to
ialance the nitrogen ; this means that if a plant is supplied
with a certain amount of nitrogen in plant food, a certain
amount of potash and phosphoric acid must also be supplied.
If the amount of nitrogen is reduced by one-half, the potash
and phosphoric acid also may be reduced by one-half ; if
this is not done, the extra half of the potash and phosphoric
would not be of any use, there being no nitrogen to
