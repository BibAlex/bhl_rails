CORN. 63
the unfertilized plot amounted to 89 pounds of stover and
52 pounds of ear corn, while from the plot receiving mu-
riate of potash were gathered 180 pounds of stover and
167 pounds of ear corn. Here the increase of stover is
100 per cent, and that of ear corn 300 per cent., due to
the use of potash.
MURIATE OF POTASH.
NO FERTILIZER.
Thus, the experiments with corn at the Massachusetts
Experiment Station show, as they did at the Kentucky
Station, that the yield of stover and ear corn follows the
amount of potash in the fertilizer.
