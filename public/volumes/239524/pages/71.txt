PART V.
USEFUL TABLES*
Farmers and planters must do a little thinking on
their own account, to apply any useful information to
their own surroundings. At best, scientific experimenters
can only give general directions all farms cannot be
studied in detail, and there are no two farms exactly alike.
We have given in this book such information that a
thoughtful farmer should be able to figure out his local
needs. As a general aid, the following tables are given,
taken from reliable sources.
