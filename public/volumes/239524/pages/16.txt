PROFITABLE MANURING.
fertilized with potash and phosphoric acid, the remaining
two (marked N) also received potash and phosphoric acid
and in addition nitrogen in the form of nitrate of soda.
The increase of growth in the pots where nitrate of soda was
used, shows the effect of nitrogen. Stated in figures, the
gain was three to one. This experiment was made with soil
known to be deficient in nitrogen, and serves to show

beyond doubt that these two crops cannot be grown to
advantage unless there is enough nitrogen supplied to
balance properly the potash and phosphoric acid.
Figure 2 shows the same treatment, the plants in this
case being Vetches. The results show that some plants, at
