PREFACE.
following pages are intended to make clear to
practical farmers the broad principles of scientific
manuring, and their use in every-day farm work. Farmers
need have no fear that scientific farming goes beyond their
powers of understanding. It is plain and simple, and does
not call for extra outlay in time or money ; but it must be
studied carefully. The scientific farmer knows why he
does things, hence he is always able to make the best of a
good season, and also of a bad season. When a certain
plan of working fails after many seasons' successful use,
there must be a cause for the failure. The science of
farming aids the farmer in studying out such causes, so
their presence may be known in time and the danger of
failure checked^ that a whole season's work may not
be loft
