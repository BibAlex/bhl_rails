food in various combinations. Thus one plot receives no
fertilizer at all ; another plot is fertilized with only potash
and nitrogen ; a third plot has potash and phosphoric acid,
while a fourth has all three elements of plant food, namely,
potash, phosphoric acid and nitrogen. Further variations
are made by increasing and decreasing the amounts of
potash or the other two ingredients. On some plots lime
is added, while green-manuring is given to other plots in
order to study its effects. These experimental plots usually
are 1/20 or i/io of an acre in size and are separated by
paths and roadways. Each series is cultivated, harrowed
and treated in the same manner, except as to the amounts
of fertilizer used.
The progress of these experiments is being carefully
noted during the growing season under the guidance of
trained observers, and a careful record is kept of all obser-
vations made, to ascertain not only the rate of growth, but
also the general vigor and health of the plants upon the
different plots, also the effects of wet weather, drouth,
disease, attacks of insects, etc. At the end of each season
the product from each plot is compared in quality with the
yield from other plots, while the quantity grown in each
plot is accurately measured.
The experiments with each particular crop are con-
tinued through a series of many years, so as to obtain an
average and a true knowledge of the various conditions
and effects, from which the irregularities of certain seasons
have become eliminated. It is only after a number of sue-
