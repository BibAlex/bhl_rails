HOW TO EXPERIMENT.
one-third of an acre each (a convenient size would be
ft. x 93! ft.), and fertilizer applied as follows:
No Fertilizer. 1.
I
Phosphoric Acid. 2
Nitrogen.
Potash.
Phosphoric Acid,
Nitrogen.
From this simple plan can be learned the following
lessons:
Plot No. i shows what the land without any fertilizer
will produce.
Plot No. 2 shows the effect of nitrogen and phosphoric
acid, without potash.
Plot No. 3 indicates what effect an average complete
fertilizer will have.
