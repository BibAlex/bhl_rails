POTASH-PHOSPHATE MANURING. 21
The need of potash and phosphoric acid is well
illustrated in another of Prof. Wagner's experiments. The
pots shown in the upper half of illustration Figure 7
were planted to peas, and are divided into three sets of two
pots each. They were treated as follows: First two, no
fertilizers ; second two, potash and phosphoric acid ; third
two, potash, phosphoric acid and nitrogen The three sets
are marked by "O" no fertilizer, "KP" potash and
phosphoric acid, and " KPN" potash, phosphoric acid and
nitrogen. The growth shows that potash-phosphate ma-
nuring was practically as effective as when nitrogen was
added, and that the use of nitrogen fertilizers in this case
was a needless expense.
The lower half of this illustration shows pots treated
exactly the same way, but planted to oats, a non-legume
As the picture shows, the potash- phosphate pots are
scarcely better than those not manured ; but the pots
treated with nitrogen, in addition to potash and phosphoric
acid, made an excellent growth. In other words, the peas
secured practically all the nitrogen they needed, but the
oats have not this power, and unless they are given the fer
tilizer nitrogen, they will fail to make profitable growth
It is scarcely necessary to remark that the results would
have been similar had the legumes, instead of peas, been
any of che clovers, vetches, lupines, soja beans, etc.
From the data already given, Prof. Wagner established
two important conclusions :
T. Sufficient potash and phosphoric acid must be sup-
