TIME OF APPLYING FERTILIZERS.
Fertilizers are either broadcasted evenly all over the
field or drilled in ; and which of these methods is prefer-
able depends on conditions. As a general rule, where
fertilizers are used in small quantities only, they are often
more effective when applied with a drill, because they come
closer to the rows of planted crops. It must be remem-
bered, however, that fertilizers may produce injury when
coming in direct contact with the seed or the young roots
of plants, and this danger, of course, is greater when fertil-
izers are applied with the drill and at planting time, than
when applied broadcast and previous to planting. To
reduce the danger from injury when fertilizers are drilled
in, it is well to dilute them by mixing them with several
times their bulk of mellow earth.
A useful method is to apply the mineral fertilizers, that
is, potash and phosphoric acid, some time before sowing or
planting, so that they may mix thoroughly with the soil.
On some soils it would even be best if the potash and phos-
phoric acid be applied in the fall preceding the planting.
