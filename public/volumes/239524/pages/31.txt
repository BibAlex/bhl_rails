while the second two pots of each soil were given the regu-
lar potash application. While the clayey soil without
potash fertilizer produced a heavier growth than the sandy
soil under the same conditions, the application of potash in
both cases showed a material gain from its use, notwith-
standing the fact that, in all the pots, the soil contained

used, the amount of potash in the top twelve inches of one
acre, was as follows:
Clayey soil 8249 Ibs.
Sandy soil 2110 u
The amount of potash applied to the soil was about
100 pounds per acre, whereas the crop removed only about
70 pounds. This small fertilizer application of available
potash made all the difference between success and failure
