GREEN MANURING.
The difference in growth shows the effect of the nitrogen
added to the potash and phosphoric acid. The four pots to
the right (also planted to oats) received potash and phos-
phoric acid in the same manner, and all four were green-
manured, the first two by a crop of mustard, the second two
by a crop of vetches. These green-manure crops were
grown in the pots the previous season and worked into the
soil.

DIFFERENT RESULTS FROM LEGUME AND NON-LEGUME
GREEN MANURE.
As will be seen from the picture, the effect of mustard
and vetches, when used as green-manure crops, is strikingly
different. Green manuring with mustard (a non-legume)
failed to supply the nitrogen needed, and a very poor crop
of oats resulted practically no better than where neither
nitrogen nor green manuring was used; while vetches
(legumes), being nitrogen gatherers, supplied the nitrogen
needed to make a good crop of t oats, and proved equal to
the nitrate of soda in the first case.
