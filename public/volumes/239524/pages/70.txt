HEMP.
This shows the results of the use of fertilizer on the
quantity of hemp produced. The quality of hemp, which
is a very important item, was likewise improved by appli-
cations containing potash. The yield on the plot receiving
no potash is, as you will see, very small in comparison
with the size of the yield of hemp on the plot which had
an application of potash, phosphoric acid and nitrogen.

HEMP EXPERIMENTS AT KENTUCKY EXPERIMENT STATION.
The experiments were made on blue grass land, much
worn, and considered by most farmers unfit for hemp.
Further results are given in Bulletin No. 27 of the same
station. The results show that a fertilizer containing
about 6 per cent, phosphoric acid, 4 per cent, nitrogen
and 10 per cent, potash will produce good results on hemp.
