*i POTASH-PHOSPHATE MANURING.
plied in order that leguminous plants may be able to draw
a full supply of free nitrogen from the air and thus reach
their full growth.
2. In order that grain and all other farm crops may
utilize the nitrogen present in the soil, it is necessary that
a sufficient quantity of potash and phosphoric acid be also
present in the soil.
A very striking practical illustration of successful
green manuring is in meadows of mixed grasses. Among
the grasses in meadows will be found more or less of clo-
vers and other legumes, and if a meadow be fertilized with
potash and phosphoric acid, these leguminous plants will
show a more vigorous growth and condition.
The grasses of such meadows will also show the bene-
ficial effect of this treatment. The first year or two they
may not seem to do much better than before. That is
because they were not supplied with sufficient nitrogen.
But in the third and fourth years, the grasses begin to
thrive and run rank, because they feed upon the nitrogen
supplied to the soil by the decaying leaves, stalks and roots
of the legumes, the growth of which was promoted by the
use of potash and phosphoric acid.
Every farmer should practice potash-phosphate fertili-
zation on poor meadow fields. It is thus possible to trans-
form an unprofitable " grass meadow " into i valuable
"clover meadow." By repeated and heavy applications of
potash and phosphoric acid, the very appearance of a neg-
lected meadow, which has produced only sour grasses, can
