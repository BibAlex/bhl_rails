January 1977, required the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to
establish labeling and disposal requirements for PCBs, and mandated an
eventual ban on the manufacture and processing of PCBs (Bremer 1983).
Effective July 1979, the final PCS ban rule was implemented, which prohibits
the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, and use of PCBs except
in a totally enclosed system, unless specifically exempted by EPA (Bremer
1983). Although the ban has been in effect for about 6 years, the current
environmental burden of PCBs in water, sediments, disposal sites, and in
deployed transformers and other containers is sufficiently large, estimated at
82 million kg (D'ltri and Kamrin 1983), to present potentially significant
hazards to fish and wildlife resources.

environmental hazards associated with PCBs, with emphasis on aquatic organisms
and wildlife, and review quality criteria recommendations for the protection
of sensitive species. This account is part of a continuing series of synoptic
reviews prepared in response to requests for information from environmental
specialists of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
