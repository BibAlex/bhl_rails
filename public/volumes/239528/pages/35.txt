capable of storing high concentrations of PCBs in their fat without any
apparent detrimental effects, and may be useful as biological indicators for
lipophilic substances, including PCBs (Olafsson et al . 1983). Sea turtles
contain relatively lower levels of PCBs than snapping turtles (Table 2). PCB
concentrations were higher in saltwater loggerhead turtles ( Caretta caretta ),
an omnivore, than green turtles ( Chelonia mydas ), which are vegetarians, again
demonstrating that diet is an important route of PCB transfer (McKim and
Johnson 1983).
BIRDS
In general, most bird tissues and eggs collected had measurable
concentrations of PCBs, and the frequency of occurrence appears to be
increasing. In 1976, 21% of European starlings ( Sturnus vulgaris ) collected
Nationwide had detectable PCBs; in 1979 it was 83% (Cain and Bunck 1983). For
mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos ), PCBs were detected in 39% of wing tissues in
1976-1977, and 95% in 1979-1980 (Fleming et al . 1983). PCBs were detected in
all of the eggs of six species of South African seabirds and in the majority
of eggs from a seventh species in 1981-1983 (de Kock and Randall 1984); in 50
to 55% of eggs of the black-crowned night-heron ( Nycticorax nycticorax ) from
Colorado, Wyoming, Washington, and Nevada taken in 1978-1980 (McEwen et al .
1984; Henny et al . 1984); in all Norwegian seabird fledglings in 1976-1977
(Fimreite and Bjerk 1983); in 77% of eggs of the black skimmer ( Rynchops
nigra ) from Texas in 1981 (White et al . 1984); in 85 to 100% of all gaiiii 51^
tissues examined in West Germany during 1982 (Brunn et al . 1985); and in 99%
of the eggs of the endangered American bald eagle ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ),
including 89% occurrence in breeding areas (Wiemeyer et al . 198T)^
Populations of double-crested cormorants ( Phalacrocorax auritus ) from
Lake Huron are now recovering rapidly, presumably due to a decrease in PCB and
other contaminant residues in eggs (Weseloh et al . 1983). In the late 1960's
and early 1970's, cormorants nesting on the Great Lakes, and in particular
Lake Huron, had eggs that were more highly contaminated with PCBs, DOE, and
mercury, than did cormorant eggs from anywhere else in Canada. Concomitantly,
egg survival, reproductive success, and colony size were either dangerously
low or decreasing. In 1972, colonies were small, they showed high egg
breakage and egg loss (95%), and nearly total reproductive failure (less than
0.11 young/nest). Eggshells were about 24% thinner than normal. Levels of
DDE (14.5 ppm fresh weight) and PCBs (23.8) in eggs collected in 1972 were
higher than other Canadian cormorant populations (Weseloh et al . 1983).
In the past, PCB residues in birds tended to be higher in areas of local
contamination and heavy industrial use or discharge. But with the current
stringent restrictions on PCB use, geographical distinctions are not as clear
(Custer et al. 1983a; McLane et al . 1984), although residues in birds from
industrialized areas still remain comparatively high (Fleming et al . 1983;
White et al. 1984). For example, birds collected near the Sheboygan River,
Wisconsin, contained PCB residues that would be considered harmful to some
