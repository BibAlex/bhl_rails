FW = fresh weight; BW = body weight; LW = lipid weight.
Each reference applies to data in the same row and in other
rows that immediately follow for which no reference is indicated.
^ Except feed concentrates, feed supplements, and feed premixes.
Including fish meal and other byproducts of marine origin, and finished
feed concentrates, supplements, and premixes.
^ Paper products intended for use in contact with human food and
^ finished animal feed.
Excluding heads, scales, viscera, and inedible bones.
^ The zero drinking water criterion for human health protection is based
on the nonthreshold assumption for PCBs. However, a zero level
threshold may not be attainable at this time. A measurable reduction
in potential carcinogenic effects due to exposure of PCBs through
ingestion of contaminated water may be effected through ingestion of
water containing less than 0.0008 ug PCBs/1.
