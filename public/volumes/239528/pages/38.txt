resulted in severe PCB contamination of the sediments--reportecny more than
lOOX greater than any other major river system (Sloan et al. 1983). Edible
portions of fish collected from this area often exceeded the FDA tolerance
level of 5.0 ppm fresh weight (Sloan et al . 1983). Carcich and Tofflemire
(1982) estimated that more than 272,000 kg (perhaps as much as 603,000 kg) of
PCBs were discharged into the River, and that most still resides in sediments
north of Troy, New York. In the Hudson River, levels of higher chlorinated
PCB components typical of Aroclor 1254 have stabilized during 1977 to 1981,
suggesting that a dynamic equilibrium has been reached, and that these
compounds may continue to exist at concentrations close to present levels
(Sloan et al. 1983). Removal of PCB contaminated sediments by dredging from
the Hudson River is now being studied, with greatest effort confined to the
most highly contaminated 8% of the river bed. Disposal, by total containment
and isolation of contaminated materials within a land burial facility, is one
of the more preferred options (Carcich and Tofflemire 1982).
