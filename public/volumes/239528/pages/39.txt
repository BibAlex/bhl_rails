TOXICITY
AQUATIC ORGANISMS
LC-50 values of sensitive species of freshwater and marine organisms
subjected to various Aroclor PCBs varied from 0.1 to 10.0 ug/1 during exposure
of 7 to 38 days (Table 3). In general, toxicity increased with increasing
exposure, crustaceans and younger developmental stages were the most sensitive
groups tested, and lower chlorinated biphenyls were more toxic than higher
chlorinated biphenyls. In most toxicity tests, mortality patterns in
PCB-exposed fish did not stabilize within 30 days (Johnson and Finley 1980).
BIRDS
As a group, birds were more resistant to acutely toxic effects of PCBs
than mammals (Table 4). LD-50s for various species of birds varied from 604
to more than 6,000 mg Aroclor/kg diet, and for mallards more than 2,000 mg/kg
body weight administered orally (Table 4). Signs of PCB poisoning among birds
included morbidity, tremors (which may become continuous), beak pointed
upwards, and muscular incoordination. At necropsy, the liver frequently
contained hemorrhagic areas and the gastrointestinal tract was filled with
blackish fluid (Stickel et al. 1984).
For all avian species, PCB residues of 310 mg/kg fresh weight or higher
in brain were associated with an increased likelihood of death from PCB
poisoning. Residues in brains of starlings, red-winged blackbirds ( Agejaius
phoeniceus ), common grackles ( Quiscalus quiscula ), and brown-headed cowbi rds
( MolothruT ater ), that died after eating diets containing 1,500 mg Aroclor
1254/kg, varied from 349 to 763 mg/kg; surviving birds, at the 50% mortality
point, contained 54 to 301 mg/kg (Stickel et al. 1984). Similar results are
reported for ringed turtle-doves ( Streptopelia risoria ) after 105 days fed a
10 mg Aroclor 1254/kg diet, chickens fed Phenoclor, Clophen, and Aroclor PCBs,
and finches and cormorants fed Aroclor 1254 (as quoted in Stickel et al .
1984). In the field, PCBs were the probable cause of mortality of many
ring-billed gulls that died in southern Ontario in late summer and early
autumn of 1969 and 1973; PCB residues in brains were 310 to 1,110 mg/kg fresh
weight in 67% of the samples analyzed, and 200 to 310 in the remainder (as
quoted in Stickel et al. 1984).
