for selected species of aquatic organisms and Aroclor PCBs, with one
exception, varied from 0.1 to 5.4 ug/1 for the no effect level, and from 0.4
to 15.0 ug/1 for measurable effects (Table 6). The exception was larvae of
the sheepshead minnow (which was especially sensitive) with an MATC of 0.06 to
0.16 ug/1 for Aroclor 1254 (Table 6).
BIRDS
Among sensitive avian species, PCBs disrupt normal patterns of growth,
reproduction, metabolism, and behavior. In general, PCB accumulation is rapid
and depuration is lengthy. Diet is an important route of PCB accumulation.
Concentrations in liver (mg/kg fresh weight) were highest (900) in birds that
fed on fish, followed by species that feed on small birds and mammals (50),
worms and insects (0.65), and lowest (0.2) in herbivorous species (NAS 1979).
Delayed reproductive impairment was documented in ringed turtle-doves
given 10 ppm of dietary Aroclor 1254 for 3 months; residues in the fat of
adults was 736 ppm, and in their eggs 16 ppm fresh weight (as quoted in Heinz
et al. 1984). Hatchability of ringed turtle-dove eggs from the first clutch
was not reduced by consumption of Aroclor by the adults. However, 6 months
later, the hatchability of the second clutch (accompanied by abnormal
incubation behavior) was reduced to 10% of controls; embryos also contained
chromosomal aberrations (Peakall et al. 1972). Mourning doves ( Zanaida
ma cr our a carol inensis ) given dietary Aroclor 1254 for 6 weeks at 0, 10, or 40
ppm were observed for courtship behavior and reproductive effort during days
14 to 44 posttreatment (Tori and Peterle 1983). Doves fed 10 ppm spent twice
as much time as controls in the courtship phase (billing, cooing, nest site
selection), but only 50% of these pairs completed the courtship phase and
progressed into nest building and incubation; of those that nested, nest
Initiation was significantly delayed. Doves fed 40 ppm spent the 30 days
posttreatment in courtship without nesting; most of this group, especially
females, did not respond normally to the presence of a mate. Tori and Peterle
(1983) suggested that the disrupted reproductive behavior observed in
PCB-treated doves was due to reduced estrogen and androgen levels. PCBs have
been shown to degrade estrogens and androgens by increasing the activity of
hepatic microsomal enzymes (as quoted in Tori and Peterle 1983). Hatchability
of chicken eggs was reduced when hens were fed diets containing 20 ppm of
various Aroclor PCBs (1232, 1242, 1248, or 1254). PCB residues in samples of
fat from treated hens varied from 45 to 125 ppm, and in their eggs from 3 to
14 ppm (as quoted in Heinz et al. 1984). Reproductive impairment in chickens
was recorded at Aroclor dietary levels as low as 5 ppm; effects at the 2 ppm
level were not significant (Heinz et al. 1984). American kestrels ( Falco
sparverius ) given 33 ppm of dietary Aroclor 1254 for 62 to 69 days (equivalent
to 9 to 10 mg/kg body weight/daily), showed a significant decline in sperm
concentration, but no compensatory increase in semen volume (Bird et al.
1983). PCB residues in treated kestrels, in ppm lipid weight, were 107 in
muscle and 128 in testes; for controls, these values were 0.4 in muscle and
1.0 in testes. These results suggest that migratory flesh-eating birds
