species tested in the laboratory (Table 2). The main source of PCBs at that
location was a diecasting plant. Granular oil absorbent material behind the
plant contained up to 120,000 ppm of PCBs; runoff and seepage from rain and
floodwaters carried PCBs into the river, subsequently contaminating fish,
especially carp ( Cyprinus carpio ). Whole fresh carp from the Sheboygan River
contained more than 155 ppm of ^PCBs (as quoted in Heinz et al. 1984),
suggesting that fish-eating birds may be especially at risk.
In 1981 and 1982, duck hunters in New York and New Jersey were cautioned
about the consumption of wild waterfowl. At the time, waterfowl from the
Hudson and Niagara rivers contained PCBs in excess of tolerances established
by FDA for poultry (more than 5 ppm fresh weight), although PCB concentrations
found in these waterfowl were below the levels associated with reproductive
impairment or decreased survival of birds (Fleming et al. 1983).
Residues of PCBs in birds are modified by numerous biotic factors
including fat content, tissue specificity, sex, and developmental stage. PCB
residues in birds may also reflect levels due to aerosol transport of these
compounds (Weber 1983), as well as water transport (Norheim and Kjos-Hanssen
1984). Highest PCB residues were in birds with low fat content and in poor
condition on capture (Falandysz and Szefer 1984). Sexual differences in PCB
content are pronounced due to the female's ability to shed a significant
portion of the PCB burden into eggs (Lemmetyinen and Rantamaki 1980).
Developmental stage is an important consideration when collecting bird samples
for PCB analysis (Lemmetyinen and Rantamaki 1980); for example, PCB level is
reduced from egg to fledgling (Fimreite and Bjerk 1983). Finally, residues in
brain appear to be good indicators of PCB stress in birds (Stickel et al .
1984). Concentrations greater than 300 ppm of PCBs in brain (fresh weight)
were consistently recorded in dead or dying ring-billed gulls ( Larus
delawarensis ) and ring-necked pheasants ( Phasianus colchicus ) poisoned by
PCBs, as quoted in Heinz et al . (1984).
MAMMALS
Among mammals, the mink is especially sensitive to PCBs; only 0.64 ppm
PCBs in their diets caused reproductive failure, and 1.0 ppm caused death (as
quoted in Fleming et al . 1983). In western Maryland and in northern Oregon
during 1978-1979 (areas with no recognized large-scale PCB pollution), levels
of PCBs in livers of some wild mink were comparable to those reported for
female ranch mink that failed to reproduce after eating a diet contaminated
with 0.64 ppm of PCBs for 160 days (O'Shea et al . 1981; Henny et al . 1981).
Some fish from the Oregon collection sites contained PCB residues (0.24-2.8
ppm fresh weight) that were equivalent to, or higher, than dietary levels fed
to mink under controlled conditions (Henny et al. 1981).
PCB concentrations in river otters from the Columbia River, Oregon,
during 1978 and 1979, were substantially higher than those reported in the
same species from Alabama. The significance of this is not clear, but
