SUBLETHAL EFFECTS
GENERAL
PCBs elicit a variety of biologic and toxic effects including skin
lesions, a wasting syndrome, itmiunotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, genotoxic
and epigenetic effects, hepatomegaly and related liver damage, and the
induction of hepatic and extrahepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. PCB
accumulations from the diet and from other sources are high, and retention is
lengthy in fatty tissues. Interspecies differences in sensitivity to PCBs are
large, even between species that are closely related taxonomically.
TERRESTRIAL MACROPHYTES
A 5X increase in somatic mutations was observed in ostrich ferns
( Matteuccia struthiopteris ) growing near the Housatonic River in Pittsfield,
Massachusetts, on sediments containing mean PCB residues of 26 mg/kg (mostly
as Aroclor 1254), when compared to ostrich ferns from control areas (Klekowski
1982). No attempt was made to duplicate these observations under controlled
conditions, and no evidence of genetic damage to other plants of the
PCB-contaminated area was found (Klekowski 1982).
AQUATIC ORGANISMS
Bioconcentration of Aroclor 1254 from the medium by selected species of
freshwater and marine organisms varied from 60 to 340,000X (Table 5). Various
species of algae also concentrate PCBs over water levels by 10,000 to 100,000X
(Ernst 1984). Oysters ( Crassostrea virginica ) held for 65 days in seawater
solutions containing 0.0055 to 0.06 ug/1 of di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, or
hexachlorobi phenyls had bioconcentration factors of 1,200 to 4,800X; uptake
was lowest for dichlorobiphenyls and became progressively higher with
increasing chlorination of PCB congeners (Ernst 1984). Similar results were
recorded for Daphnia magna exposed to five different C-14 labeled PCBs for 24
hours. BCFs varied from 473 to 11,232; formulations lowest in water solubilty
(highest chlorination) were accumulated most readily (Zhang et al . 1983). For
all PCBs, BCFs were generally higher with increasing exposure period, with
increasing PCB concentration, and with increasing chlorination of PCB
