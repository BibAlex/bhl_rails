INTRODUCTION
As a result of human activity, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are now
distributed worldwide, with measurable concentrations reported in polar bears
( Ursus martinus ) from the Canadian Arctic, birds and fish from the Great
Lakes, wildlife in Europe, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom, marine
organisms of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and up to 91% of the adult human
population in the United States. Their presence in the organisms has been
shown to cause reproductive failure, birth defects, skin lesions, tumors,
liver disorders, and, among sensitive species, death. PCB toxicity is further
enhanced by their ability to bioaccumulate and to biomagnify within the food
chain due to extremely high 1 iposolubi lity. These, and other, biological
effects of PCBs have been extensively reviewed by Ayer (1976), Roberts et al .
(1978), NAS (1979), EPA (1980), Pal et al . (1980), D'ltri and Kamrin (1983),
Fleming et al . (1983), Ernst (1984), Stickel et al . (1984), Safe (1984),
Simmons (1984), and Lucier and Hook (1985a, b).
PCBs, a group of synthetic halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, were first
prepared in 1881, and since 1930 have been in general use in products that
include heat transfer agents, lubricants, dielectric agents, flame retardants,
plasticizers, and waterproofing materials (Roberts et al. 1978). After 1971,
they were used almost exclusively as insulating or cooling agents in closed
electrical systems, such as transformers and capacitors (NAS 1979).
Environmental contamination resulted from industrial discharges, from leaks of
supposedly closed systems, from disposal of PCB wastes to municipal sewage
treatment plants, landfills, and equipment dumps, and especially through
atmospheric transport of incompletely incinerated PCBs. Long-range
atmospheric transport of PCBs by wind, rain, and snow is now well documented
(NAS 1979). PCBs tend to bond tightly to particulate matter, notably soils
and sediments of lakes, estuaries, and rivers, where they may remain available
for resuspension for at least 8 to 15 years (Swain 1983). The North Atlantic
Ocean seems to be the dominant sink for PCBs, accounting for 50 to 80% of the
PCBs in the environment, while freshwater sediment is a major continental
reservoir (NAS 1979). Other significant reservoirs of mobile PCBs still exist
along with even larger, currently immobile, pools. The latter includes those
materials containing PCBs that are still in service, and those deposited in
landfills and dumps.
Between 1930 and 1975, more than 630 million kg of PCBs were manufactured
domestically (Safe 1984). At present, PCBs are not produced in the United
States. PCB legislation under the Toxic Substances Control Act, effective
