hibernate, such as white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucophus (Sanders and
Kirkpatrick 1977), and raccoons, Procyon lotor (Montz et al. 1982). The
implications of this are not clear, and additional research is needed. Other
systemic effects of PCBs that occur in a wide variety of animal species
include hepatic disorders distinguished by altered porphyrin metabolism,
increased thyroxin metabolism and ultrastructural changes in the thyroid,
inhibition of ATPases, interference with oxidative phosphorylation,
alterations in steroid hormone activities, immunosuppressive effects, and
altered vitamin A metabolism (EPA 1980; Safe 1984).
