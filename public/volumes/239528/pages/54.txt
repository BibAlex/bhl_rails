lowered birth rate, hyperpigmentation, skin eruptions, eye problems, and
negatively altered behavioral patterns. Males were less sensitive than
females; however, when fed diets containing 300 ppm of Aroclor 1248 for one
month, both sexes showed hair loss, purulent discharges from the eyes,
acneform skin eruptions, and hypertrophy of the liver and gastric mucosa.
Rhesus monkeys can efficiently absorb Aroclor 1248 from the gut; 90% of a
single oral dose of 1,500 or 3,000 mg/kg body weight was reported absorbed
from the gastrointestinal tract. This, and the fact that rhesus monkeys were
unable to efficiently eliminate or metabolize certain PCB congeners (i.e.,
2,5,2' ,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl ) when compared to other species, may partially
account for the sensitivity of this species. Infant rhesus monkeys, born to
mothers exposed to 2.5 ppm of Aroclor 1248 in the diet during pregnancy and
lactation, survived over 4 months; PCB levels in their fat declined over a
period of 8 to 23 months.
In Japan, humans were accidentally poisoned by rice oil containing 2 to 3
mg of Kanechlor 400/kg (EPA 1980; Lucier and Hook 1985a, b). Symptoms included
increased eye discharges and swelling of upper eyelids, acneform skin
eruptions, skin pigmentation, hearing and vision problems, gastrointestinal
disturbances, and altered blood chemistry. Infants born of Japanese women
married to afflicted males were small for their age, had unusual pigmentation,
premature eruption of teeth, and exophthalmia (popeyes). Three years after
exposure, 50% of the patients were improving, 40% were unchanged, and 10% were
worse. Even among those said to be improving, many still complained of
headaches, fatigue, weakness and numbness of the limbs, and weight loss.
Impurities in the Kanechlor 400 mixture included polychlorinated dibenzofurans
and dioxins at levels up to 5 ppm, and these may be responsible, in part, for
the observed symptoms in victims.
Mutagenic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic properties of PCBs are
documented. Certain PCB congeners, such as 4-chlorobiphenyl , were highly
mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium in Ames tests (EPA 1980). Aroclor 1221
was less mutagenic, while Aroclors 1254 and 1268 were essentially inactive.
In general, mutagenic activity tends to decrease with increasing chlorination
(EPA 1980). The carcinogenic effects of PCBs have been established in mice
and rats with various Aroclor and Kanechlor PCBs and these, in turn, may
enhance the carcinogenicity of other chemicals (EPA 1980). Experimental data
clearly shows that commercial PCBs cause liver damage which leads to putative
preneoplastic changes and hepatocellular carcinomas; however, these lesions
are observed only after lengthy (11 to 21 months) exposures to relatively high
doses (100 to 1,200 ppm in diets) of these chemicals (NAS 1979; Safe 1984).
PCBs were also shown to inhibit the growth of experimental tumors in rats (EPA
1980); administration of Aroclor 1254 (either dietary or injected) for 5 days
before or after tumor inoculation was more effective than administration
between days 5 and 10. Teratogenic effects of PCBs observed in monkeys and
rabbits include abnormal skull formation of fetuses exposed to high levels of
Aroclor 1254 in utero, and retarded growth (EPA 1980).
Aroclor 1254 at dietary levels of 25 to 100 ppm for up to 3 weeks can
significantly reduce sleeping times in animals that normally aestivate or
