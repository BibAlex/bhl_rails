MAMMALS
The mink is the most sensitive wildlife species tested for which data are
available (Table 4). Diets containing 6.7 to 8.6 mg Aroclor PCBs/kg fresh
weight killed 50% of the mink in 9 months; single dosages administered orally
produced LD-50 values of 750 to 4,000 mg/kg body weight, those administered
intraperitoneal ly produced LD-50s between 500 and 2,250 mg/kg body weight
(Table 4). Recent data (Aulerich et al. 1985) indicate that certain
hexachlorobiphenyls (HCBP), such as 3,4,5,3' ,4' ,5' HCBP, are extremely toxic
to mink; concentrations as low as 0.1 mg/kg fresh weight diet produced an
LD-50 in 3 months, and completely inhibited reproduction in survivors.
However, other HCBPs, such as 2,4,5,2' ,4' ,5' HCBP and 2,3,6,2 ' ,3' ,6' HCBP,
were not fatal to mink under similar conditions, and did not produce adverse
reproductive effects (Aulerich et al. 1985). Additional research is needed on
the toxicodynamics of PCB congeners. Signs of PCB poisoning in mink included
anorexia, bloody stools, fatty liver, kidney degeneration, and hemorrhagic
gastric ulcers (Aulerich and Ringer 1977). The reasons for mink sensitivity
to PCBs are unknown, but large variations in sensitivity to PCBs among species
are common, even among those closely-related taxonomically. The European
ferret ( Mustela putorius furo ), for example, is at least three times more
resistant than mink to Aroclor 1242 (Table 4).
Rats fed diets containing 1,000 mg of Aroclor 1254/kg diet all died in 53
days; mortality started at day 28 (Hudson et al . 1984). These, and other
feeding studies, suggest that a total intake of about 500 to 2,000 mg of
Aroclor 1254 per kg body weight is the lethal level in rats for dietary
exposures of 1 to 7 weeks. Prior to death, rats showed lack of muscular
coordination, eyelid drooping, blanched retinas, morbidity, nasal secretions,
and (with Aroclor 1268) a reddish exudate from their eyes (Hudson et al.
1984). Some rats died at 100 mg Aroclor 1254/kg body weight administered
orally, or about 1/5 of the dietary LD-50 (Hudson et al. 1984).
