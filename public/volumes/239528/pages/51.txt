feeding on a PCB-contaminated food chain might consume enough toxicant to
alter their semen quality in that breeding season; when coupled with altered
courtship, this could reduce the fertility of the eggs and reproductive
fitness of the individual (Bird et al . 1983).
Among comparatively resistant species of birds, no significant
reproductive effects were observed during long-term exposures at high Aroclor
1254 feeding levels in Japanese quail Coturnix coturnix japonica (50 ppm in
diets), northern bobwhites Colinus virginianus T^D ppm) (NAS 1979), and
mallards (25 ppm) (Custer and Heinz 1980). ScFeech owls ( Otus asio ), given 3
ppm of Aroclor 1248 in their diets for two breeding seasons, laid eggs
containing 3.9 to 17.8 mg PCBs/kg fresh weight compared to control values of
0.0 to 0.6; however, reproductive variables, including eggs per clutch,
hatchability, chick malformations, survival, and eggshell thickness, were not
affected (McLane and Hughes 1980).
For most avian species, a reduction in eggshell thickness of 15 to 20% is
suggested as a critical value beyond which population numbers will decline
(Nygard 1983). Pheasants fed 50 mg of Aroclor 1254 weekly produced fewer
eggs, but an effect on eggshell thinning was not apparent before other effects
became obvious (Roberts et al. 1978). However, eggshell thickness of the
peregrine falcon ( Falco peregrinus ) from Norway declined 85% between 1854 and
1976; addled eggs containing dead embryos collected in 1976 had 724 ppm of
PCBs in lipids, and up to 110 ppm on a fresh weight basis (Nygard 1983).
Peregrine populations have declined in Norway, but the high DDT levels (which
cause eggshell thinning) in tissues and eggs--together with measurable
residues of dieldrin and mercury--made it difficult to ascribe thinning or
population declines exclusively to PCBs (Nygard 1983). Mean PCB residues were
significantly lower in eggs from successful nests of the American bald eagle
than unsuccessful nests (1.3 ppm fresh weight vs. 7.2), and may be associated
with eggshell thinning (Wiemeyer et al . 1984). PCB concentrations in eggs were
inversely correlated with shell thickness in the bald eagle (Wiemeyer et al.
1984) as well as the black-crowned night-heron (McEwen et al . 1984; Henny et
al. 1984). However, PCB content is frequently correlated positively with DDE
content (Norheim and Kjos-Hanssen 1984), which is known to interfere with
avian calcium metabolism and to induce thin eggshells. The observed
thickening of eggshells in black-crowned night-heron eggs between 1973 and
1979 in colonies from Rhode Island locations was associated with marked
reductions in both PCBs and DDE (Custer et al . 1983a, b). At present, the
evidence implicating PCBs as a major source of eggshell thinning is
inconclusive.
Loss rates were followed in common grackles fed 150 ppm dietary Aroclor
1254 for 8 days, then given untreated food and killed at 1 to 32 weeks
posttreatment (Stickel et al . 1984). PCB levels in bodies of grackles
declined from 1,300 ppm fresh weight on the day clean food was restored, to
169 ppm 32 weeks later. The overall loss rate was estimated at 0.77% daily
with a calculated biological half-life of 89 days. Similar loss rates were
observed in pheasants given a single capsule dosage of Aroclor 1254 (as quoted
in Stickel et al . 1984). In general, PCB residues in brain are good
