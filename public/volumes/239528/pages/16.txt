predominant in Aroclor 1260, which have lower steric effect coefficients.
Structure-activity relationships, particularly for PCBs, can be applied to
predictive models of contaminant cycling and biomagnification--and promises to
become a fruitful research area.
Pal et al. (1980), in a review of PCBs in plant-soil systems, indicated
three important research needs. First, many isomers of several PCB
formulations have not been studied with respect to their biotransformation,
volatilization, photodecomposition, adsorption, and transport. Second, highly
chlorinated biphenyls, especially tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorobiphenyls,
have not been evaluated for uptake by crops, volatilization, or distribution
in soil layers. The relative build up and assimilation in soil-plant systems
of hepta-, octa-, nona-, and decachlorobiphenyls have not been evaluated or
studied. Finally, data are lacking on partition coefficients of PCBs between
soil and water, water and atmosphere, atmosphere and plant populations, and
during flow in food chains. A similar case can be made for most fish and
wildlife species of current concern.
