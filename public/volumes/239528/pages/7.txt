the more toxic PCBs.
For aquatic life, water concentrations of less than 0.014 ug total PCBs/1
(ppb) appear to afford a satisfactory degree of protection, although
concentrations as low as 0.006 ug/1 resulted in measurable accumulation by
various species of filter-feeding shellfish. Among sensitive species of
teleosts, total PCB residues (in ug/kg fresh weight) in excess of 500 in
diets, 400 in whole body, and 300 in eggs were demonstrably harmful, and
should be considered as presumptive evidence of significant PCB
contamination. Among small mammals, the mink ( Mustela vison ) is one of the
most susceptible species tested; dietary levels as low as 100 ug PCBs/kg fresh
weight caused death and reproductive toxicity. A tolerable daily limit for
mink has been estimated at less than 1.5 ug total PCBs/kg body weight.
Tolerable daily PCB levels for rhesus monkey ( Macaca mulatta ), dog ( Canis
sp.), and rat ( Rattus spp.) were 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 ug/kg body weight,
respectively. For birds, total PCB levels (in ug/kg fresh weight) in excess
of 3,000 in diet, 16,000 in egg, or 54,000 in brain were frequently associated
with PCB poisoning.
