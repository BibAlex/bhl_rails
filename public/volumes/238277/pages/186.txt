Family 83. ERICACEAE. Heath Family.
Shrubs, or occasionally herbs, with simple, exstipulate leaves, and reg-
ular, mostly sympetalous flowers, and mostly with hypogynous 5 (-4)"
merous perianth. Stamens twice as many as the corolline divisions (or
by abortion only as many), hypogynous or attached to the very base of
the corolla-tube, the anthers 2-celled, opening by pores or by short slits,
often bearing inferior appendages. Ovary several (3-10, mostly 5) -celled ;
style i. Seeds with endosperm.
Species 1,350, cosmopolitan. The true heaths (Ericoidece] are almost
confined to Africa and the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts of the Old
World.
Neither the heaths (Ericoideae) nor the Rhododendrons are represented
in Patagonia.
