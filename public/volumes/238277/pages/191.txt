VACCINIUM ULIGINOSUM PATAGONICUM n. var.
Low shrub, 15 cm., with smaller, crowded leaves, 6 mm. long. "With
red edible berries"
Cordilleras of S. Patagon., by J. B. Hatcher, Feb., 1897.
Family 84. EPACRIDACE.E.
As Ericacece ; but usually with i -celled anthers, and stamens isomerous
with the coralline lobes, and often inserted in the corolla-tube. Sepals
not united, but the South American genus has hypogynous stamens,
with 2-celled anthers.
Species 300, in S. Australia, Tasman., N. Zeal., with some species in
New Caledonia, Himalaya to Malaya, Fiji, Hawaiia ; and in Patagonia
and Fuegia.
LEBETANTHUS Endl.
Glabrous, subscandent undershrub, with small, distichous, evergreen
leaves, ovate, acute, serrate ; and axillary short-pediceled, solitary flowers
as long as the leaves. Calyx enclosed in large bracts. Corolla subcam-
panulate. Stamens hypogynous ; their anthers 2-celled.
Species 2, Antarctic Amer.
Lebetanthus is closely related to Prionotes of Tasmania ; J. D. Hooker
calls attention to the fact that they both affect a moist woody region,
contrary to the habit of both Epacridacese and Ericaceae.
