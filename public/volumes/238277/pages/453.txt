MACLOSKIE: ANALYSIS OF ORDERS AND FAMILIES. 911
e2. (Santalales.) Perianth green or petaloid. Stamens as many as the perianth-
segments, or twice as many. Ovary i -celled, superior or inferior; seeds
few, often imbedded in the placenta ; with large endosperm. Plants usually
more or less parasitical.
/. Leaves green, estipulate. Seed solitary.
g. Leaves mostly opposite. Flowers monoecious or dioecious. Ovary
l-celled, i -ovuled, immersed ; fruit a berry. Parasitic shrubs.
Family 26. Loranthacea, Mistletoe, p. 335.
g2. Leaves alternate or opposite. Flowers hermaphrodite. Calyx 4-5-
cleft, its tube adnate to the I -celled ovary. Ovules 2-5. Style
cylindric. Semi-parasitic.
Family 28. Santalacecz, Sandalwood, p. 338.
/2. Leafy or leafless. Flowers dioecious ; the males naked, 2-3-staminate ;
the females with 3 -parted calyx, adnate to the 3 -seeded ovary. Fruit i-
seeded, trigonal, with 3 feathery plumes on the angles. Tree -parasites.
Family 27. Myzodcndracea, Angel's beard, p. 336.
/3. Leafless, fungus-like parasites, only the top of the large solitary flower
visible above ground. Stamens 3 (5), with 3 staminodes. Ovary in-
ferior ; fruit baccate. Family -30. Hydnoracece, p. 344.
d^. Perianth double, the calyx minute, or none. Trees or shrubs with alternate,
estipulate leaves, and perfect flowers. Stamens i-3-seriate. Ovary 4-celled ;
the cells i -seeded. Fruit a drupe. Family 29. Olacacece, p. 344.
d$. (Polygonales?) Flowers cyclic or subspiral, radiate, with a 3-merous tendency.
Ovary i -celled, with i, mostly orthotropous, ovule. Flowers usually small, in
compound inflorescences. Leaves mostly with an ochrea.
Family 31. Polygonacece, Buckwheat, p. 345.
CC. Subclass CHORIPETAL^E or Mesochlamydeae. Flowers mostly hermaphrodite, the
perianth usually sepalo-petalous (i.e., differentiated into calyx and corolla); the
leaves of the corolla being distinct petals and usually colored. In a few genera
the petals are wanting, and then the sepals are petaloid.
(Families 32-82), p. 354-643.
d. Alliances with single bracteoid or petaloid perianth ; yet often sepalo-petalous.
c. (Centrosper males?) Flowers spiral or cyclic, small and crowded, tepalous or
sepalo-petalous, hypogynous. Stamens often isomerous with, and opposite
to the perianth-leaves, yet varying from many to I. Carpels I to many,
mostly syncarpous. Ovary rarely pluri-celled, mostly i -celled, with i-oo-
curved seeds. Embryo mostly curved around endosperm. Chiefly herbs.
f. Tepalous, bract-like, perianth.
g. Flowers greenish ; bracts, if any, not scarious. Styles 1-2. Utricle
rarely circumscissile, mostly indehiscent.
Family 32. Chenopodiacea:, Goosefoot, p. 354.
g2. Flowers green or white, with scarious bracts and 2 bractlets. Utricles
mostly circumscissile. Family 33. Amarantacece, Amaranth, p. 372.
/2. Petalous, symphyllous perianth, usually with a calyx-like involucre.
Style i ; fruit an anthocarp.
Family 34. Nyctaginacca, Marvel of Peru, p. 376.
