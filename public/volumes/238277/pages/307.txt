MACLOSKIE : COMPOSITE. 765
variously convex, naked or with chaff between the flowers. Seeds with
large, anatropous, erect embryo, and no endosperm.
Species nearly 12,000, cosmopolitan.
(Always secure open flower-heads and also ripe fruits. In the analyses,
references to the style-branches in most cases concern only fertile flowers ;
the style of sterile flowers being imperfectly developed.)
PATAGONIAN COMPOSITE.
I. ANALYSIS OF TRIBES.
A. Flowers tubular, with or without a ray of ligulate flowers. Juice watery.
B. Heads homogamous, all the flowers tubular.
c. Anthers basally sagittate, dorsifixed. Flowers never yellow. (Genus i.)
I. VEKNONIE/E, p. 766.
C2. Anthers basally subentire, apically appendaged or not. Styles long, obtuse. Invo-
lucral-scales oo -seriate, imbricate, only slightly unequal. Receptacle mostly naked.
Pappus mostly setose. Corollas 4-5 -cleft, never true yellow. Leaves mostly op-
posite. (Genera 2-4.) II. EUPATORIE^E, p. 766.
CT,. Anthers long-tailed, and apically long appendaged. Styles short, obtuse. Involu-
cral-scales oo -seriate, imbricate, and often spinescent. Receptacle with setae or
with cleft pales. Pappus setose or narrowly paleaceous, mostly oo -seriate. Co-
rollas all 5-merous. Leaves alternate, often spinose. (Genera 57-60.)
X. CYNAROIDE.E, p. 771.
B2. Heads heterogamous, radiate, or abortively homogamous and discoid.
c. Anthers basi-obtuse, apically appendaged.
d. Receptacle mostly naked.
e. Involucral scales imbricated.
f. Style-branches flat. Pappus setaceous, rarely poleaceous or none. Leaves
mostly alternate, rarely dissected. (Genera 5-21.)
III. ASTERE.E, p. 766.
/2. Style-branches truncate or hairy-tipped. Involucral scales i-2-seriate,
mostly herbaceous, subequal, rarely 3 -seriate, with short outer scales.
Pappus mostly paleaceous or awned. Leaves opposite or alternate.
Ray-flowers pistillate, fertile or neuter ; in ours not persisting on the
fruit, rarely none. (Genera 42-47.) VI. HELENIOIDE.E, p. 769.
e2. Involucral scales i-2-seriate, subequal, little imbricated, sometimes with a
calyculus, rarely oo-seriate. Receptacle mostly naked. Styles pencilled,
truncate or appendaged. Hermaphrodite flowers usually fertile. Pappus
setose, rarely none. Leaves mostly alternate. Flowers, especially of ray,
usually all fertile. (Genera 53-55.) VIII. SENECIONE^:, p. 770.
d2. Receptacle with chaff subtending the flowers. Involucral-scales i-oo-seriate,
mostly herbaceous. Style-branches truncate or appendaged. Pappus awn-like,
or paleaceous, or none. Leaves, at least the lower, often opposite. Disk
mostly yellow, and ray mostly homochromous. (Genera 33-41.)
V. HELIANTHOIDE^E, p. 768.
