b. Leaf-segments, 510 mm. long.
c . Calyx, lower lip tridentate. bergii Hier.
C2. Calyx, lower lip trisect. rigidum Hier.
62. Leaf-segments 10-20 mm. long.
c. Calyx, lower lip tridentate. Petals subequal, erect. (Genista elegans.}

C2. Calyx, lower lip trisect, with subulate segments.
d. Petals orange, unequal, wings and keel straight, about twice as long as the vexil-
lum. morcnonis O. Ktze.
d2. Petals yellow, subequal, keel deflex. toninii O. Ktze.

The genus is divisible into two subgenera: (i) Amerophylhim , with
entire leaves ; (2) Trimerophyllum, with trifid or tripartite leaves.
