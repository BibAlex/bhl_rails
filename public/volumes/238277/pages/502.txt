960 PATAGONIAN EXPEDITIONS: BOTANY.
favors the supposition that if ever a connection existed, it must have
been of the nature of stepping-stones rather than of a bridge. There are
also indications of some passage between South Africa and South America,
but as to the nature and limitations of this we are ignorant. In some
instances at least the connection seems to have been via the highlands of
Eastern Africa, and the circuitous route by the Asiatic highlands and
Bering Strait.
As a general rule, the plants appear to us to be a match for the animals
in their power to survive adverse conditions, probably through their
ability to revive after long periods of dormancy. They can passively
extend their spheres, and on reaching new localities they may or may not
experience a conversion into new varieties or species. If the Ice-age
drove temperate plants southwards in North America, we may conclude
that a return of milder seasons would not send them all back again
towards the poles ; but some would be allured by mountain ranges, rich
in moisture and with cool air, to push their way farther south, ultimately
reaching Southern Chili, and a few of them even leaving vestiges on the
mountains of Central America or Peru. Thus the very same species
sometimes occurs in Alaska and at Magellan Straits, as if the northern
plants had made raids southwards, probably on more than one occasion,
and had never failed to leave some of their party behind as permanent
settlers.
