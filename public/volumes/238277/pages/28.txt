486 PATAGONIAN EXPEDITIONS I BOTANY.
perigynous, flowers, with the odd sepal anterior; and monocarpellary
ovary, becoming a legume. Endosperm usually none ; cotyledons large,
fleshy.
Species exceeding 7,000, many cosmopolitan. Some species are
characteristic of particular regions ; especially of Australia, which 'is head-
quarters of the family.
The following subfamilies are sometimes regarded as distinct families.
I. MIMOSE/E : p. 488.
Leaves bi-tri-pinnate or reduced to phyllodes. Flowers regular ; the
calyx-lobes and petals valvate. Stamens isomerous with the perianth-
divisions, or commonly numerous.
II. CESALPINIE^E : p. 491.
Leaves simple, or simply- or bi-pinnate. Flowers more or less irregu-
lar; the posterior petal enclosed by the lateral petals. Stamens 10, or
fewer, distinct or united.
III. PAPILIONACE/E : p. 495.
Leaves simply compound, rarely simple. Flowers papilionaceous ; the
posterior petal enclosing the lateral petals. Stamens 10, mon- or diadel-
phous or distinct ; rarely 9 or 5.
KEY TO THE GENERA.
A. Flowers regular. Petals and sepals valvate. Stamens as many, or twice as many as the petals.
Trees or shrubs with bipinnate leaves, sometimes reduced. (MIMOSE^:.)
b. Anthers glandless. Pod flat, its valves at length separating from the persisting sutures.
I. Mimosa, p. 488.
bz. Anthers with a deciduous gland. Pod convex, straight or twisted. Seeds with endo-
sperm. Petals united. 2. Prosopis, p. 489.
AA. Flowers zygomorphic ; the petals imbricate.
B. Flowers not papilionaceous ; posterior petal internal. Calyx-segments almost or quite
separate. (C^SALPINE^:.)
c. Leaves even-pinnate. Stamens 10 or 5. Anthers basifixed, opening terminally.
3. Cassia, p. 491.
c2. Leaves bipinnate. Stamens 10, subequal. Anthers opening laterally. Ovary free.

pairs. Unarmed trees with handsome flowers. 4. Poinciana, p. 492.
d2. Calyx-lobes long and subequal, nearly valvate. Pod sessile, flat, 2-many-seeded.
Low, gland-punctate herbs or undershrubs. 5. Hoffmanseggia, p. 493.
</3_ Calyx-lobes imbricate in the bud.
