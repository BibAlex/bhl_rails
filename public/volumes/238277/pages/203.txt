Magellan ; Fuegia, passim. ; in steppes by the moderate
rainy-forest region. S. Patagon., by Hatcher in low, wet
ground near Rio Sta. Cruz, Jan. 9. The flowers of the
Hatcher forms are yellowish-purple, and 4- and 5-merous
in the same inflorescence. A more slender form, got by
Hatcher on the Cordilleras of S. Patagon., has the corolla
narrower, and the stems more sharply angled (see var.
gracilis below).
