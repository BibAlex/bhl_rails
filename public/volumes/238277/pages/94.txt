KEY TO THE GENERA.
1. Flowers distinct. Stamens 2-3, on short filaments. Styles 3, united at base. Cotyledons

2. Flowers grouped, one central female and several i-staminate males, enclosed in a calyciform

and glands alternating with the lobes of the involucre. 2. Euphorbia, p. 553.

ledons scarcely as wide as the radicle. Styles distinct. Heath-like. 3. Dysopsis, p. 554.
4. Axillary spikes, apically male, of 5-merous flowers. Ovary tridymous ; styles bifid.
