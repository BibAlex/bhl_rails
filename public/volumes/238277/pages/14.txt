472 PATAGONIAN EXPEDITIONS I BOTANY.
S. Patagon. ; Magellan ; Fuegia.
4. GEUM PARVIFLORUM Comm. ex Smith. (G. magellanicmn Lech, non
Comm., Sieversia albiflora Hook, f.)
Stem few-flowered, tomentose. Leaves hairy, interruptedly pinnatisect,
crenate, the terminal lobe large, rounded, obscurely 5-lobed, the stipitles
dissected. Pedicels thickened, with a basal trifid bract. Flowers nod-
ding; calyx-lobes erect, equalling the white petals. Styles deflexed,
hooked, the appendage as long.
Magellan; Fuegia, alpine at Ushuaia. "Like a small G. ttrbanum but
the flowers differ."
5. G. URBANUM Linn. (Including No. 3 supra. G. magellanicum Comm.)
Stem branching, hairy, erect. Radical leaves quinate-pinnatisect ; the
cauline ternate-palmatisect ; the lobes ovate, crenate-dentate ; the upper-
most i-lobed, ovate. Stipules large, suborbicular. Calyx-segments re-
flexed. Petals ovate, rather large, yellow. Achenial head spherical.
Styles glabrous, hooked.
(N. Temperate Zone and N. Zeal.); Magellan, Fuegia, S. Patagon., at
head of Rio Chico. (J. B. Hatcher.)
J. D. Hooker states that the Magellan plant shows great variations ;
petals of the wild specimens being often yellow, and twice as large as the
sepals ; while in garden specimens the petals are much larger and red or
scarlet. The leaves also differ greatly. Index Kewensis relegates the
Magellan and N. Zealand forms to the Old-World G. urbanum.
8. ALCHEMILLA Linn. (Alchimilla Tournef.)
Herbs, with lobed or digitate leaves, adnate stipules, and small green-
ish clustered flowers. Calyx cup-shaped, contracted at the throat, 4-5-
lobed, 4~5-bracteolate. Petals none. Stamens 1-4, short. Carpels 1-4,
styles basal or lateral, becoming achenes enclosed in the persistent calyx.
Species 35, Europe, mountains of Africa and of W. Amer., from
British Columbia to Chili.
A. ARVENSIS Sm.
Stems branched, leafy. Leaves trifid, pubescent ; lobes cuneate,
deeply cut. Stipules large. Flowers sessile, axillary.
