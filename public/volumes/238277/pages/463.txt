COLLECTORS AND BIBLIOGRAPHY.
i. COLLECTORS.
Philip Commerson, the botanist of Bougainville's French Exploring
Expedition, visited Magellan Strait in 1767-68, and gave to the scientific
world its first collection of the plants characteristic of the region. J.
Banks and D. Solander were the naturalists on Captain Cook's First
Voyage, 1 768-7 1 , and J. R. Foster and his son, G. Foster, and A. Sparr-
man, were on Cook's Second Voyage, 1772-75, which visited the Ant-
arctic regions and the Fuegian islands. Anderson on Cook's Third
Voyage, and Menzies, who was Surgeon and Naturalist on Vancouver's
Voyage, 1791, collected on the Pacific shores of Patagonia.
After the episode of the Napoleonic wars the spirit of geographical and
scientific exploration revived primarily with the French, and afterwards
with the British. In 1817 Gaudichaud sailed under Admiral Freycinet
in two French corvettes on a scientific expedition to New Holland and
the East Indies. In course of their return by Cape Horn with valuable
botanical collections one of the ships was wrecked on a hidden rock.
Gaudichaud's plants, however, were ultimately saved from the wreck, and
were further enlarged by collections made on the Falkland Isles. Ad-
miral d'Urville afterwards visited these islands in another French ship
and increased Gaudichaud's discoveries. Dr. Eights, an American, also
landed on the South Shetland Isles, where he found Aira antarctica, the
most southern of flowering plants. In 1826-30 the Exploring Expedi-
tion under Captain King made further collections in Magellan Strait.
The interest in the natural history of the far south of the American Con-
tinent received a new impulse from the explorations and singularly bold
speculations of Charles Darwin, who went in his early manhood under
Captain Fitzroy as naturalist on board the Beagle, 1831-36. His inde-
fatigable industry and his observations during the voyage, and the charm-
