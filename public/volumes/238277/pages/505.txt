Page 657. Pouteria splendens (DC. sub Lucuma), is P. valparadisaa
Mol., fide IK-S2. Its fruit is rounded or oval, usually bitter. Occurs in
Chili and Patagonia.
Page 669. Collomia linearis Nutt. (1818), is made by IK-S2 a synonym
of C. coccinea Lehm. (probably nearly synchronous).
Page 67 1. Gilia nudicaulis Gray, 1870 (non G. nudicaulis Phil., 1895,
cujus nomen mutandum ; a Chilian plant).
Page 729. Asteranthera ovata Hansk. is identical with A. chiloensis
Hansk ; chiloensis has priority.
Page 781. Gutierrezia (Brachyris) spathulata Phil. (1865) includes G.
gilliesii Gris. (1874) fide O. Ktze.
Page 784. Nardophyllum nardophyllum (O. Ktze., sub Aster). Kuntze's
species appears to us to agree with N. humile in habit, habitat, in char-
acters of head and involucre and pappus ; also in having subconical com-
pressed achenes, and therefore to be generically inseparable.
