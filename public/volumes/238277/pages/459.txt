MACLOSKIE: ANALYSIS OF ORDERS AND FAMILIES. 917
5. Fruit a drupe. Mostly woody plants ; flowers small, racemed,
dioecious in this species. Family 82. Cornacece, Dogwood, p. 643.
CCC. Subclass SYMPETAUE, or Metachlamydeae. Perianth highly specialized, normally
double, with the inner perianth sympetalous ; a few forms however differing from
their allied species by being choripetalous or apetalous.
Families 83-1 13, pp. 644-906.
d. Pentacyclic-isocarpic sympetals. Besides sympetaly, occasional choripetaly obtains.
Staminal cycles 2 or I. Hypogyny is dominant, epigyny rare. Woody plants
and herbs, mostly with simple estipulate leaves, and seeds with endosperm.
Flowers usually hermaphrodite.
e. (Ericales^) Flowers 5 4-merous, obdiplostemonous, or isostemonous through
suppression of the outer series of stamens. Petals free, or mostly united to
each other. Stamens mostly hypogynous, occasionally epigynous, often
inserted on the base of the corolla-tube. Carpels 25, when isomerous usu-
ally oppositipetalous. Fruit a capsule or berry, or drupe.
/. Anthers 2-celled, often with paired appendages, and often opening by termi-
nal pores. Pollen in quartets. Stamens mostly 8-10.
Family 83. Ericacea, Heath, p. 644.
/2. Anthers usually i-celled, and opening by slits. Pollen simple. Stamens
mostly 5 4- Family 84. Epacridacecs, p. 649.
e2. (Primulales.) Flowers 5- (4-8) merous, typically eudiplostemonous, but usu-
ally isostemonous, and the stamens oppositipetalous, with or without rudi-
ments of an outer series. Rarely unisexual and rarely zygomorphic, also
rarely choripetalous. Ovary mostly superior, I -celled, with a basal or free-
central placenta.
f. Seeds usually numerous. Style I.
Family 85. Pritmilacea, Primrose, p. 650.
/2. Seed I, on a long basal funicle. Styles 5. Flowers usually small,
crowded and bracted. Family 86. Plumb aginacece, Leadwort, p. 654.
^3. (Ebenales.~) Diplostemonous or triplostemonous, or with few stamens. Sym-
petalous and hypogynous. Ovary several-celled, cells with I few seeds on
an axile placenta. Woody plants with alternate, entire leaves, and milky
juice. Family 87. Sapotacece, p. 656.
dz. Tetracyclic, anisocarpic sympetals. Stamens epipetalous.
e. (Gentianales.) Flowers regular and hypogynous, usually hermaphrodite ; the
carpels 2, often only slightly connate. Choripetaly and apetaly occur in
exceptional cases. Mostly with opposite, entire, estipulate leaves and endo-
spermous seeds.
/. Stamens only 2, or few. Flowers mostly 4-merous, sometimes apetalous.
Trees or shrubs. Family 88. Oleacea, Olive, p. 657.
/2. Stamens isomerous with the perianth members.
g. No milk-ducts.
h. Ovary 2-4-celled ; stigma lobed (antero-posteriorly). Flowers
4-5-merous ; seeds i-several. Trees or shrubs, with stipules or
transverse stipular ridges.
Family 89. Loganiacea, Strychnia, p. 658.
