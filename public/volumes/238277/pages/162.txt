c. Fruit wingless, with sac-like hollows under the midrib ; ribs often glochidiate-ciliate.

stellate-hairs ; the lower leaves opposite, stipulate. 2. Bowlcsia, p. 623.
c2. Fruit wingless; without sac-like hollows ; transversely oval or circular or rounded-
quadrangular. Fruit dry, more or less dorsally compressed, with 3 -dorsal ribs.

cate. 3. Azorclla, p. 624.
^3. Fruit broadly and dorsally 4-winged. Mericarps peltate, with small, linear commis-
sures. Petals lance-oval.

dorsal callosity. Glabrous herbs, little branching, with palmately cut leaves.
4. Asterisdum, p. 632.
d2. Calyx large, with 5 lanceolate teeth. Petals lanceolate, pointed or slightly

A2. Fruit subglobose, muricate; vittae 5. Leaves palmately 5-3 -partite, the parts tripartite, etc-
6. Sanicula, p. 635.
A$. Fruit walls of weak parenchyme ; the fruit nearly ovoid somewhat flattened laterally, oil
tubes usually 5, weak or obsolete, flowers in dense head-like umbels, with pointed bracts.
Leaves often toothed or lobed, with bristly margins. 7. Eryngium, p. 636.
A^. Fruit walls consisting of weak parenchyme : sometimes with woody layers. Styles arising
from a stylopodium. Oil-tubes arising in the furrows of the young fruit (valleculae), often
afterwards specialized. Umbels mostly compound, with a general involucre of bracts,
and a special involucel of bracteoles.
b. Primary ribs weak or strong, with lateral ribs or with wings. . The valleculas are marked
only by the oil-tubes.
c. Seeds deeply-grooved or hollow on the commissure (by the decay of the raphe).
d. Crystal -glands in the parenchyme surrounding the carpophore. Flowers polygamous.
Fruit ribbed, with very small oil-tubes ; clavate, spurred basewards. Calyx-
teeth none. Leaves decompound. Umbels few-rayed ; bracts and bracteoles
narrow or none. 8. Osmorrhiza (Washingtonid), p. 637.
d2. Crystal glands none. Fruit subglobular.
e. Fruit nut-like, with woody layers ; smooth, showing ribs and oil-tubes only on
drying. Commissure flat, not much narrowed. 9. Coriandrnm, p. 638.
e 2. Fruiting mericarps hanging by small commissures ; externally ovoid-urceolate.
Chief ribs weak or strong.
