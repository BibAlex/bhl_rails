blade. Pinnae with 8-n pairs of leaflets, and the rachis prolonged.
Leaflets broad-elliptical, or elliptic-lanceolate. Flower-heads axillary,
peduncled, globose, is-iy-flowered; one head on the peduncle. Flowers
4-merous, 4 mm. long. Legume i-4-seeded, in joints.

2. PROSOPIS Linn. Algaroba.
Trees or shrubs, with bipinnate leaves, spinose or unarmed ; and small,
regular, 5-merous flowers in heads or spikes. Petals united halfway.
Anthers mostly with a deciduous gland. Legume straight or twisted, with
internal cross-septa.
Species 30, curious both in structure and distribution. Most of the
species are in S. Amer., 10 of these in Argentina, and several in Pata-
gonia; also 4 species in Mexico, Texas and Calif, i in trop. Africa; i
in the Caucasian and Himalayan regions.
Some species, as P. dulcis and P. horrida of Peru, have pods with sweet
mucilage, and form "pastures" which serve as food for cattle. The
Mesquit-tree of Texas, P. juliflora DC., yields gum, and is valuable for
its hard wood.
