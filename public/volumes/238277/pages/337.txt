J. D. Hooker unites this with E. alpinus L. Against this A. Franchet
says, "It differs by having its leaves narrower, linear or linear-spatulate,
always very close on the stem, and the inflorescence is in a long raceme,
though sometimes reduced to a head. Peduncles very short or long, but
always parallel with the stem. Leaves less diverse than in E. alpinus,
and not rosulate at the base. Flowers purplish."
