KEY TO THE GENERA.
A. Embryo curved more than a semicircle. Stamens all 5 fertile, subequal. Ovary 2-celled.
Fruit a berry.
b. Filament fixed on the lower end of the small connective, which lies between the pollen-
sacs ; chief axis of plant elongated.
c. Corolla narrow tubular with narrow border, funnel- or salverform. Stamens inserted in
the tube, not toothed at the insertion. Woody plants, usually with i -flowered axil-
lary flowers. . i. Lycium, p. 699.
c2. Corolla rotate or campanulate, with broad border.
d. Anthers free, opening by longitudinal slits. Calyx close under the fruit, ribbed,
bladderfbrm, enclosing the berry. Corolla rotate. Flowers solitary.
2. Physalis, p. 705.
d2. Anthers connivent in a tube, or free and then opening by terminal pores ; outer wall
thicker than inner. 3. Solatium, p. 705.
b2. Filament dorsifixed in the anther, or, if joining the lower end of the connective, this runs
up dorsally.
c. Shrubs, trees, or herbs, with elongated axis. Corolla crownless.
4. Salpichroa, p. 707.
c2. Herbs with short or creeping axis. Corolla funnelform, with spreading border and
narrow tube. 5. Jaborosa, p. 708.
A2. Embryo straight or only slightly bent (less than a semicircle). Seeds with endosperm.
Stamens all fertile, subequal, or 13 shorter.
b. Fruit a few-seeded berry. Corolla lobes folded in the bud. Woody plants.
6. Cestrum, p. 708.
b2. Fruit a septicidal capsule, with many small seeds. Stamens unequal. Mostly with soli-
tary, terminal or lateral flowers.
c. Shrub. Stamens shorter than the corolla. 7. Fabiana, p. 709.
C2. Herbs. No mid-lobes between the 5 corolla-lobes.
d. Filaments inserted midway or lower in the corolla-tube, which gradually widens
upwards. Stigma shortly 2-lobed. Capsule with unparted, or nearly un-
parted valve. 8. Petunia, p. 710.
d2. Filaments inserted above the middle of the corolla-tube, which suddenly widens
to the border. 9. Nierembergia, p. 711.
A$. Capsule I -celled, I -seeded. (Ovary 2-celled.) Small shrubs with rosulate leaves, and
erect, yellowish-white flowers ; corolla-tube long, with short limb.
10. Bentliamiella, p. 712.
i. LYCIUM Linn.
Shrubs or climbers often spiny, with small, alternate, entire leaves, often
with leaf-fascicles in the axils ; and white or greenish or purplish flowers.
