Stems scarcely angled at base, 3-winged upwards. Stipules leaf-like,
entire ; leaflets 2, linear-lanceolate, entire, pale underneath. Corolla yel-
lowish and glabrous, scarcely equalling the calyx-teeth. Pod erect, gla-

3. L. EPETIOLARIS CloS.
Perennial, smooth, blackish in drying. Stems 1-2 meters high, tetrag-
onal, scarcely winged. Leaves short-petioled ; leaflets linear-lanceolate,
5-7 cm. long. Tendrils long, trifid. Stipules triangular, semisagittate,
3-4 times as long as the petiole. Inflorescence 10-15 cm. long, 4-8-
flowered at its end. Calyx-teeth linear-acute, exceeding the tube, and the
lowest the longest. Corolla purple-violet. Legume linear, compressed,
as large as a leaflet, smooth. Seeds numerous.

Robust plant, laxly pubescent, stem angulate and striate. Lower leaves
with i, the upper successively with 2-4 pairs of lanceolate leaflets, ending
in a stiff point. Stipules semisagittate, linear-lanceolate, in the upper
leaves shorter than the petioles. Tendrils of upper leaves long and
parted. Inflorescence 3-4 times as long as the leaves. Flowers numer-
ous, the rachis and calyx pubescent. Calyx-teeth acuminate, one of them
subulate. Corolla large, blue (?). Legume unknown.
(Chili) ; Chubut, by Carren-leofu (stipules of these sagittate, not semi-
sagittate).
5. L. MAGELLANICUS Lam.
