</3. (Orchidales.} Typically 3-merous and 4-cyclic; stamens i, rarely 2, connate

many and very minute, without endosperm.

embryo with 2 cotyledons. Families 22-113, pp. 325-906.
C. Subclass APETAL^E. Including families with naked or with monochlamydeous flowers ;

d. (Salicales.} Flowers naked, dioecious, with cup-like or tooth-like disk. Stamens
2 oo. Carpels 2, united. Ovary i -celled, with 2 parietal placentae, and many

with simple, alternate, mostly stipulate leaves.
Family 22. Salicacece, Willow, p. 325.

with oily endosperm. Family 24. Urticacece, Nettle, p. 330.
</3- Perianth cyclic, bract-like or petaloid, rarely differentiated into calyx and corolla.

and adnate to the petaloid segments, only the anthers free. Carpel i ; seed
mostly i. Chiefly woody plants, with alternate, estipulate leaves.
Family 25. Protcacece, p. 333.
