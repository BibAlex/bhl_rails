MACLOSKIE: SCROPHULARIACE^. 713
rigid, spreading, apically truncate leaves. Leaf-bases dilated to a pericla-
dium, concave ventrally, costate-carinate dorsally. Flowers long-exsert
from the upper axils; sessile, solitary, 2-bracted. Calyx short (3 mm.),
5-cleft, the lobes as long as the tube. Corolla tubular, white, 8 mm. by
1.5 mm.
S. Patagon., by Rio Sta. Cruz.
5. BENTHAMIELLA PYCNOPHYLLOIDES Speg.
Cespitose. Leaves minute, ovate-scaleform, densely imbricate, entire,
apically thick, green, acute, basally dilated, and with woolly edge.
Flowers long, exserted from upper axils, sessile, solitary, 2-bracteolate.
Calyx-lobes equalling the tube. Corolla pale-violascent, twice as long as
the calyx.

Family 100. SCROPHULARIACE^E. Snapdragon Family.
Herbs, shrubs or trees, with exstipulate leaves and perfect, sympetalous,
mostly zygomorphic flowers. Stamens epipetalous, mostly 4 and didyna-
mous, sometimes only 2, rarely 5. Ovary superior, 2-celled (rarely i-
celled), the cells being antero-posterior, with axial placentae. Style i,
often apically 2-lobed. Fruit capsular. Seeds numerous, endospermous.
Species 2,300, chiefly in temperate climates.
KEY TO THE GENERA.
A. The 2 dorsal corolla-lobes (or by their fusing the upper lip), cover the lateral lobes in the
bud. Basal leaves or all opposite. Fifth stamen changed or none. (ANTIRRHINOIDEJE.)
b. Corolla 2-lipped, the lips urceolate, concave. Stamens 2, dehiscing by slits.
I. Calceolaria, p. 714.
62. Corolla regular or 2-lipped, its lips flat or convex. Fruit a many-seeded capsule.
c. Corolla spurred, having a tube and a palate nearly closing the throat. Flowers ter-
minally racemed or spicate. 2. Linaria, p. 719.
C2. Corolla not spurred, nor basally saccate. Inflorescence usually simple. Stamens all
inserted in the corolla-tube ; anthers 2-celled. Calyx 5 -toothed or 5 -cleft. Capsule
4-valved.
d. Capsule loculicidal. Stigma capitate. Seeds large, few. Erect shrubs. Leaves
few, often reduced. 3. Monttea, p. 719.
d,2. Capsule loculicidal and septicidal. Seed-ridges free or coalescing. Anther-cells
partly fused. Herbs, woolly or glandular. 4. Stemodia, p. 719.
^3. Corolla regular. Calyx 5-parted, its dorsal lobe longer or broader than the others.
Anther-cells touching or ultimately fusing. 5. Monnicra (Bacopd), p. 720.
