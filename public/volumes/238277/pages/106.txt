2. DISCARIA ARTICULATA (Phil, sub Colletia} Miers.
Leafless, glabrous; branchlets strict, having 3 internodes, articulated,
ending in a spine. Flowers crowded, with 4 stamens. Pedicels as long
as the white, glabrous calyx ; calyx-teeth erect, broadly triangular. Petals
lanceolate, equalling the calyx-teeth. Genitalia included.
"The lines joining the stipules prove it to be Discaria, not Colletia"
(O. Ktze.)
(Chili) ; Patagon. in shrubberies near Carren-leofu.
3. D. COGNATA (Miers sub Notophcena].
Branches long, virgate, angled-striate, glabrous, with long, pungent
