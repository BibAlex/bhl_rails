MACLOSKIE: ANALYSIS OF ORDERS AND FAMILIES. 913
g2. Endosperm none. Leaves mostly alternate, and estipulate.
h. Sepals and petals 4. Stamens 6, tetradynamous, or fewer by abor-
tion. Carpels 2, united, with a false septum. Radicle folded on
cotyledons. Family 44. Cruciferce, Mustard, p. 421.
h,2. Flowers 5-merous, radiate. Stamens 6 to many, not tetradyna-
mous. Ovary mostly I -celled.
Family 45. Capparidacea, Caper, p. 454.
^3. Flowers spirocyclic, unsymmetrically 4-7-merous, small, in racemes
or spikes. Capsule 3-6-lobed, I -celled, opening prematurely at
apex, with parietal placentae. Small herbs, with glands for
stipules. Family 46. Resedacece, Mignonette, p. 454.
/2. (Sarraceniales.) Flowers spirocyclic to cyclic, sepalo-petalous, hypogy-
nous, radiate, 5-(~4-) merous. Stamens 5 (4-20) ; ovary i-3-celled.
Marsh-herbs with basal leaves having viscid hairs, insectivorous.
Family 47. Droseracece, Sundew, p. 455.
^3. Perigyny common ; but apocarpy and hypogyny still occur. Immersion of the
gynecium in the floral axis often induces syncarpy and epigyny of perianth
and stamens. (Resales?) Flowers cyclic, rarely spirocyclic, sepalo-petalous
or rarely apetalous, hypogynous to epigynous, radiate or zygomorphic.
Carpels often free, or sometimes united, occasionally with thick placentae,
and many-seeded.
f. Seeds usually with endosperm.
g. Flowers completely isomerous (or occasionally diplostemonous).
Sepals partly united. Seeds small, with scanty endosperm. Fleshy
herbs, with simple, alternate, estipulate leaves.
Family 48. Crassulacea, Stonecrop, p. 456.
g2. Diplostemonous. Leaves opposite or whorled, stipulate. Petals
smaller than sepals or none. Shrubs or trees, with small flowers in
heads or racemes. Family 50. Cunoniacece, p. 466.
3. Normally diplostemonous. Leaves mostly alternate, estipulate. Petals
normal, mostly half-epigynous. Carpels few, often 2, united, with
diverging beaks. Herbs or shrubs. Seeds endospermous.
Family 49. Saxifragacece, p. 457.
/2. Seeds mostly without endosperm. Leaves alternate, stipulate. Flowers
5-merous.
g. Carpels oo-i, buried in the receptacle, or mounted on a disk, or in a
pome. Flowers regular ; stamens numerous, often perigynous.
Family 51. Rosacece, Rose, p. 467.
g2. Carpel usually a single legume. Flowers mostly papilionaceous, with
10 stamens, or subpapilionaceous, or regular with many stamens.
Odd sepal anterior. Family 52. Ltgtamnosa t Pea, p. 485.
^4. Flowers usually with 5-4 cycles. Apocarpy and isomerism occur ; but syn-
carpy and oligomery of gynecium prevail ; pliomery of this is rare. Stamens
often 10 or fewer.
/. (Gerattia/es.) Flowers cyclic, sepalo-petalous or apetalous, rarely entirely
naked, normally 5 -merous. Carpels 5-2, rarely more, united, but often
