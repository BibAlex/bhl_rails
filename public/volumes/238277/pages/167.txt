GENERIC SUBSECTIONS.
1. Fragosa. Stems pulvinate or covered by imbricating leaves, or divided into long branches

4. ScJtizeilcma. Cespitose, stoloniferous ; like Hydrocotyle ; leaves in rosettes or scattered, not
imbricated ; umbels stalked ; involucral bracts numerous ranunculus.
5. Huanaca. Low, with radical rosettes of long-petioled leaves, whole or lobed or partite.
Flowers on long pedicels, in many-rayed umbels with an involucre of leaves ; as acanlis,
6. Pcctophytum. Cespitose closely leaved, with old stems surrounded by sheaths of old leaves.
Terminal umbels amid the upper leaves ; each pedicel swollen below the ovary and articu-
lated ; as glcbaria, lycopodioides, nivalis, trifurcata.
