(Brazil); Patagon., by Rios Negro and Sta. Cruz; Port Rawson. By
J. B. Hatcher at Rio Chico de Sta. Cruz, March, 1897, female (determined
by O. Hoffmann, who writes, "De Condolle writes 'folia integerrima.'
They are not always so. Also Baker says in the Flora Brasil., 'folia
interdum minute dentata.' We have collected examples like yours from
Sello.") The Hatcher specimen has the leaves remotely serrate. Plant
nearly a meter high, heads corymbed, outer involucre scales nearly ovate,
all chestnut colored, with whitish margins. Achenes long, ovoid, com-
pressed, lo-striate, rounded at top where the fine, silky, abundant pappus
is inserted ; pappus more than twice as long as the involucre.
