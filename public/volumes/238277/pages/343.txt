21. BACCHARIS Linn.
Shrubs or herbs, with dioecious, discoid, small or mid-sized heads,
female in the fertile plants, hermaphrodite in the sterile. Anthers basi-
obtuse. Achenes compressed, usually 5-1 ocostate. Papptis-setce copious,

(Fig. in Eng. & Prantl, iv, 5, p. 171.)
Species 300, chiefly in trop. Amer.; some in U. S.; in W. Indies. Of
many only one sex is known ; consequently the specific characters are
derived chiefly from the leaves. Young leaves and twigs frequently
bearing glandular hairs which produce a colorless secretion. (Volkens.)
