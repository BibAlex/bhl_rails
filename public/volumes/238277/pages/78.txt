536 PATAGONIAN EXPEDITIONS; BOTANY.
(O. A. Peterson) on pampas near Coy Inlet, in fruit Nov. 23, 1896.
Magellan (Dusen). Called Alnlerillo in N. Patagon. "It is considered
useful for cattle in Paraguay, Patagonia, and neighboring regions, as it
springs up fresh after each fall of rain. Doubtless introduced from Europe,
it has spread nearly over all South America. In Peru it extends from the
coast to 3,700 meters high." (J. Ball.) A. Gray remarks on the hygro-
metric twisting of the "tail" of its carpels, as pushing them into the
ground. Its taproot being long, strong, yet not thick, may promote its
speedy reappearance on the return of rain.
