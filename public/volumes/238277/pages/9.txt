KEY TO THE GENERA.
A. Carpels 5-2 (or 12-1) verticillate, either on a special receptacle or immersed in the persisting
axis, each with 2-00 seeds. Filaments from a broad basis, smaller upwards. Sepals often
obsolete. Fruit of follicles free or connate. Seeds wingless, coriaceous or wrinkled.
Stamens perigynous. Mostly shrubs. I. Spircea, p. 468.
A2. Carpels 52, connate with the inner wall of the hollow, floral axis, and with each other,
becoming in fruit a fleshy pome.
b. Carpels several seeded, the seeds in two series. 2. Cydonia, p. 468.
b2. Carpels 2-seeded. Floral axis pyriform to globular. 3. Pynis, p. 469.
A 3. Carpels few or many, on a disk, distinct, each 1-2 ovuled, becoming I -seeded achenes or
drupelets.
b. Floral axis flat or convex. Filaments narrowing from a broad base.
