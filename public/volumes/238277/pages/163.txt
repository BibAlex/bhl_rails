c2. Seeds flat on the commissures ; raphe often protruding, rarely receding.
d. Lateral ribs and 3 dorsal ribs subsimilar. Seeds semi-circular in cross-section, with
broad endosperm.
e . Ribs of fruit slightly protruding. Mericarps hanging together by a narrow com-
missure. Only vallecular oil-tubes, or none. No crystal -glands in pericarp.
Lower leaves divided, sheathing-petioled. Flowers white.
/. Mericarps with 5 equal ribs ; oil-tubes vallecular, or more or none. Calyx
teeth none or minute. Petals ovate-acute, entire, apex sometimes inflexed.
Leaves pinnate, or further cut. Involucres varying.
12. Apium, p. 639.
/2. Fruit long oval or mericarps cylindro-concave, smooth. Oil-tubes one in
each furrow. Petals clawed, cleft, the lobes unequal, apex sessile in the
deep notch. Terminal and lateral umbels. Calyx-teeth obsolete ; styles
short. Bracts and bracteoles pinnate.
13. Amnri, p. 641.
/% Fruit cordate-ovoid to didymous or shorter. Oil-tubes many, fine. Calyx -
teeth long, persisting. Petals apically inflexed. Styles short Leafy-
stemmed marsh-plants. Bracts and bracteoles many, small, persistent.
Leaves mostly once-pinnate. 14. Slum, p. 641.
e2. Ribs of fruit strong, and often wing-like ; the side-ribs broadening the commis-
sural face of the mericarps ; the carinal and sutural ribs subequal.
/. Fruit short-ovoid or obconic. Stylopodium broad, obtuse. Marginal ribs
thick and broad, not winged. Mericarps dorsally broad-round, not com-
pressed, smooth. Oil-tubes i in each furrow. Carpophore obsolete.
Creeping plants with simple umbels and terete leaves. Flowers white.
15. Lilceopsis (Cratttzia), p. 641.
/2. Fruit ovoid-cylindrical, dorsally compressed, smooth. Mericarps some-
times with small wings. Lateral ribs imbricating, strong ; the other ribs
mostly small. Oil-tubes 4 vallecular, 2 commissural, large. Flowers
green-yellow. 16. Faeniculum, p. 642.
/3. Fruit ovoid-cylindrical, not dorsally compressed, smooth. Ribs subequal,
all broad-winged. Seeds with broad, often pentagonal cross-section.
Petals obcordate, notched, whitish. Calyx teeth none or minute. Sev-
eral vallecular oil-tubes or minute. Leaves ternately compound.
Bracts and bracteoles several, narrow, some divided.
17. Ligusticum, p. 642.
^3. Side-ribs of fruit much broader than the 3, often slight, dorsal ribs ; forming
small double wing-like processes of the paired mericarps. Seeds small in
cross-section. Bracts and bracteoles mostly none. Leaves pinnate.
Flowers yellow. 18. Pastinaca, p. 642.
i>2. Secondary ribs over the oil-tubes, usually exceeding the primary ribs and armed by barb-
less or barbed spines. Bracts pinnate ; bracteoles entire or toothed. Flowers chiefly
white. Leaves pinnately decompound. 19. Daucus, p. 643.
