more numerous than, the hermaphrodites. Achenes silky, some of the
hairs often elongate, like an extra-pappus.

Chiefly woolly herbs, with alternate leaves and discoid heads of pistillate
and perfect flowers. Involucral scales several-seriate, their points dry.
Receptacle naked. Anthers tailed. Pappus single, of capillary bristles.
Achenes oblong or obovate, not ribbed.
Species 120, widely distributed. ( J. D. Hooker, in Flora Antarctica,
questions the specific validity of many of the species.)
