Phaca, low, synochreate, glabrate to hoary ; branches subprocumbent,
terete. Stipides small, acutely bidentate. Leaves mediocre, one third part
of the petiole naked, imparipinnate, with about 6 pairs of plane cuneate,
bilobed leaflets, their lobes acute. Racemes axillary, not half as long as
the subtending leaf, few-flowered. Calyx scarcely white-puberulous, 5-

refract, sublinear, triquetrous-scaphoid, acute both ways, with obtuse
margins, pale-glabrous, scarcely nervulose.
