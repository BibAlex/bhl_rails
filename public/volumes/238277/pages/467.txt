2. BIBLIOGRAPHY.
For the names of species and their general distribution, our chief reliance
has been the Index Kewensis as amended and supplemented by O. Kuntze's
Revisio Plantarum and by Engler and Prantl ; also the American text-
books, such as Gray's Synoptical Flora, and Britton and Brown's Illus-
trated Flora; Coulter's Rocky Mountain Flora, and Sereno Watson's
Botany of California. For the characteristic Patagonian plants we use,
beside the older works, as Persoon's Synopsis and DeCandolle's Prodro-
mus, the Flora Antarctica, and the great works of Gay, of the Philippis,
Reiche and the Argentine botanists, and most of all Carlos Spegazzini's
and Per Dusen's recent contributions.
For characteristic field-notes we are indebted chiefly to this last men-
tioned contribution, and to Hooker, to Cunningham, and to Hatcher, and
as to North Patagonian plants to Ball's paper in the Linnaean Society's
Journal.
The subjoined list indicates the books and authorities which we have
found most serviceable for descriptions of the Patagonian species.
