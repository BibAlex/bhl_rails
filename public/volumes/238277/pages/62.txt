Unarmed ; laxly racemed. Perennial, quasi-glabrous, really hispid.
Branches subsimple, remotely leaf-bearing. Leaflets on upper half of
petioles, 3 pairs, thick, spatulate. Racemes terminal on the branches.
Calyx-teeth long. Corolla orange, twice as long. Legume many-jointed.
Chubut, in dry places near Lago Musters ; S. Patagon., along Rio
Scheuen, branch of Rio Chico.
36. P. TRIFOLIATUM (Gill.) O. Ktze.
Ptilocarpum. Unarmed ; hoary-pilose, perennial, with many short
