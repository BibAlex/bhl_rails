6l6 PATAGONIAN EXPEDITIONS: BOTANY.
A2. Land plants with broad leaves and mostly dioecious spiked 2-merous flowers. Carpels 2,
styles 2, but seed i, stamens 1-8. 2. Guntiera, p. 617.
AI. Aquatic plants with whorled narrow leaves and polygamous, i-merous flowers. Carpel i,
style i, seed i, stamen i. 3. Hippuris, p. 618.
1. MYRIOPHYLLUM Linn.
The submersed leaves divided into capillary segments ; emersed leaves,
if any, less divided. Flowers axillary, 2-bracted, usually monoecious, the
males above ; sometimes dioecious ; 2-4-merous and diplostemonous.
Ovary 2-4-celled; cells i-ovuled. Styles 4. Fruit splitting into 4 meri-
carps.
Species 20, extra-tropically cosmopolitan. (Fig. in Eng. & Prantl, iii,
7- P- 2 34-)
i. M. ELATINOIDES Gaud.
Monoecious or dioecious. Leaves 3-5-whorled, the lower capillaceo-mul-
tifid ; the upper shorter, lanceolate to ovate or broad-oblong, occasionally
opposite, entire or dentate, or pinnatifid, obtuse, sessile. Carpels rather
short, broad-oblong, dorsally convex, glabrous.
(Australia and New Zeal.); Falklands, in freshwater lagoons and run-
ning streams, abundant. Magellan (R. O. Cunningham); S. Patagon.;
Rio Chico ; N. and E. Fuegia.
2. M. PROSERPINACOIUES Gill.
Dioecious. Leaves all submersed, similarly pectinate-pinnatifid, 4-5-
whorled ; their segments 20-25. Pistillate flowers axillary, apetalous ;
stigmas 4, plumose. Young carpels glabrous. Hair-like bracts among
the leaves.
(Chili; naturalized in parts of N. J., U. S.); N. Patagon.
3. M. SPICATUM Linn.
Submerged leaves whorled and dissected. Floral leaves ovate, entire
or serrate, shorter than the flowers, or none. Spike about 5 cm. long,
like a leafless interrupted spike. Carpels rounded on the back.
(Eurasia and N. Amer.); S. Patagon.; Valley of Sta. Cruz, by Hatcher.
Near the base of the stem many of the submersed leaves are opposite
and undivided, linear-acute, 5-nerved ; some of these sending lacinia out
from their margins ; and many of them are closely covered with Diatoms.
