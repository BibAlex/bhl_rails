KEY TO THE GENERA.
A. Staminodes none, or the outer stamens as filaments or petaloid. Petals mostly flat. Seeds
i-2-seriate on the 3, rarely 5, parietal placentae. Leaves -usually alternate.
i. Mentzelia, p. 586.
A2. Fertile and sterile stamens intermingled, the fertile antipetalous, the barren as nectary-scales,
antisepalous. Petals cucullate.
b. Capsule opening apically, 3(-5)-lobed, mostly clavate or obconic, rarely twisted. Leaves
opposite and alternate. 2. Loasa, p. 586.
b2. Capsule opening apically by 3-lobes, cylindrical. Leaves 2-3-pinnatisect. Flowers
sessile. (Grammatocarpus.) 3- Scyphantlms, p. 589.
3. Capsule opening below, not apically, turbinate, often spirally twisted. Leaves opposite,
decussate, with stinging hairs.
c. Stem terete. Flowers usually cymose. Placenta; broad or 3-parted. Capsule thin-
walled. 4- Cajoplwra, p. 589.
c2. Stem quadrangular. Flowers solitary on axillary peduncles. Placentae first fleshy,
afterwards dry and enlarged for disseminating the seed. 5. Blumenbachia, p. 590.
