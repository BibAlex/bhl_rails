Grisebach regards the above as a variation of B. anthemoides, with
broader leaf-segments, and sometimes with 10 or 5 involucral lobes.
BOOPIS RIGIDULA PATAGONICA Hieron.
Leaf-segments very narrow-linear. Involucres of larger heads 8-cleft,
of smaller heads 5-cleft ; the lobes triangular, ending in a subulate tooth ;
margins toothed. Flowers shorter. Calyx-segments 1-3 for each achene.
N. Patagon., mostly by hills near Rio Negro; near mouth of Rio
Chubut.
14. B. SCAPIGERA Remy. (Plate XXVI.)
Stems numerous, scapiform, naked or sparsely leafy at top, 12-15 cm -
high. Radical leaves rosulate, spatulate, half-pinnatifid, long-attenuate,
glabrous. Upper leaves shorter, subentire. Heads terminal, solitary,
rarely 2. Involucre s-y-leaved, its leaves short, connate. Outer pales of
receptacle dilated-leafy ; inner narrow. Corolla tubular, its limb of 5 ob-

subcapitate. Achenes crowned by the 5 persisting, obtuse calyx-leaves.
Chili ; S. provinces ; by Hatcher near Rio Sta. Cruz. (Determined from
Remy's description in Gay's Flora chilensis.}
15. B. SQUARROSA Miers. (B. australis Dene, non Gris.)
Glabrous, subcespitose ; stems or peduncles subscapiform, very numer-
ous. Radical leaves many, and other cauline ones shorter, linear-lanceo-
late, incised-serrate, the segments remote, angulate, mucronate, often sub-
recurved, narrowed to a long, flat petiole. Peduncles i -headed, leafy
under the apex. Involucre cup-shaped, 5-cleft beyond the middle. Seg-
ments linear, acute, toothed. Pales shorter than the flowers, linear-
spatulate.
Magellan.
B. SQUARROSA var.
Leaves and scapes shorter and thicker than in the preceding.
S. Patagon., by Rio Chico.
2. GAMOCARPHA DC.
Involucre dentate, consisting of about 6-12 scales, connate high up.
Receptacular fimbriae acute, connate in alveoli. Flowers all fertile.
Calyx-lobes 5, elliptical, obtuse. Corolla 5-cleft, lo-nerved. Anthers in-
