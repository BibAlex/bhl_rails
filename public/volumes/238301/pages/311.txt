tlie life-history of six of these organisms. These life-cycles cannot he
here recounted. Suffice it now to say that each of them multiplied
enormously by self-division (fission), but that the life-cycle in each
case began and ended in a distinct genetic product — call them what we
choose — spores, germs, or ova.

I have drawn from Nature, in the six respective cases, the con-
dition presented by each organism at the time of emitting its spores.
Fig. 1 is the genetic product of an oval monad, with a pair of
flagella ; it rapidly increased by fission ; then in a remarkable man-
ner a pair blended, became one in the form of a sac, the sac burst
and poured out, as the drawing portrays, innumerable spores, which
were watched continuously until they were seen to develop into the
parent condition. Fig. 2 gives a similar product of another form, dif-
ferent anatomically and in all the details of metamorphosis, but yet
passing through the states of fission, blending into a sac, and (as seen)
the emission of spores ; wliich were again watched into the parent con-
