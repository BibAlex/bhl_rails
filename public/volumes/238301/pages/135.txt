The true curvature of the metal may be approximately deduced
from considering the radius of the circle described by the workman's
arms, and the handle of the adze.
The edge of the adze is convex (Fig. 12), the projection in the
middle being so formed for the same reasons as influenced the curva-
ture of the edge of the axe already alluded to.
The curvature in the blade also serves (though partially) as a ful-
crum, for, by slightly thrusting the handle from him, the workman
may release such flakes of timber as are over the adze, and yet so
slightly adherent as not to require another blow. Thus the adze when
applied lever-fashion discharges its duty as the curvature in the claw

of a hammer does. Fig. 13 is a gouge-formed adze ; a modification
of this is used in making wooden spouts, and similar hollow work.
Many of the remarks applied to axes and adzes also apply to pick-
axes. It may suflice to refer to two forms of this tool ; they difler
not so much in the operative points as in the size and distribution of
the material.
The one i;sed by paviors is long and light, and of large curvature ;
the other, used by stone-masons and quarryinen, is short-handled and
heavy, much material being concentrated in the head. There is also
another form of this instrument used on kegs, for the purpose of driv-
ing home the wooden wedges ; in this form there is no point, the tool

is rather that of an elongated hammer, the ends being provided with
" panes " of difierent foi-ms, set ofi" at different angles. Such tools may
properly be consigned to the class of hammers.
The pavior's, the mason's, and the quarryman's picks are the three
to be very briefly considered. The first is properly a lever, and no
