in ail unusual manner, probably for convenience in holding putty^
which he often carries " dabbed " on the handle. In some cases, as in
the working of copper vessels which have been silver-plated or gilt,
the coats of the precious metals are so thin that, although the weight
of a hammer-head is required, yet even the wooden hammer of the
plumber, or the still softer leaden hammer of the engineer, is equally
unsuitable, and therefore the workers in these metals cover the face
of their hammers at times with one or more layers of cloth.
The veneering hammer is compound, one end being formed of
metal and the other of wood. The metal end is used as a squeezing-
hammer (if such a term may be employed), and the wooden end as a
tapping-hammer, to ascertain by the sound produced where the veneer-

The stone-mason seems to claim a universal choice. As to mate-
rial, he has and frequently uses hammers made of wood, of iron (steel-
faced), and of an alloy of lead.
In some cases the hammer and the anvil mutually change places,
the hammer of wood, the anvil of metal, or the converse. Xor is the

of the woods themselves, so varied are those chosen by different crafts
for the employment of each craft.
Hammers with and without handles are in use — hammers of various
weights, from half an ounce to ten pounds, and from fifteen to fifty-six
pounds are now employed as hand-hammers. The angles of attach-
ment of handles to heads are various: the position of the centre of
gravity of the head in reference f o the line of penetration of the handle
is various; the faces have various convexities; the panes have all
ranges and forms, from the hemispherical end of the engineer's ham-
mer, and the sharpened end of the pick and tomahawk, to the curved
