SOCIETY AN OKGANISM/
By HERBERT SPENCER.
THE question, What is a society ? has to be asked and answered
at the outset. Until we have decided whether or not to regard
a society as an entity, and until we have decided whether, if regarded
as an entity, a society is to be classed as absolutely unlike all other

and realism into another sphere, a nominalist might affirm that, just
as there exist only the members of a species, while the species con-
sidered apart from them has no existence, so the units of a society
alone exist, while the existence of the society is but verbal. Instanc-

the close of the lecture, proves itself to be not a thing but only a
certain arrangement of persons, he might argue that the like holds
of the citizens forming a nation.
But, without disputing the other steps of his argument, the last
step may be denied. The arrangement, temjjorary in one case, is
lasting in the other ; and it is the permanence of the relations among
component parts which constitutes the individuality of a whole as
distinguished from the individualities of its parts. A coherent mass
broken into fragments ceases to be a thing ; while, conversely, the
stones, bricks, and wood, previously separate, become the thing called
a house if connected in fixed ways.
Thus we consistently regard a society as an entity, because, though
formed of discrete units, a certain concreteness in the aggregate of
