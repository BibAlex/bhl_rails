LINGUAL DEYELOPMENT IN BABYHOOD/
By H. TAINE.
THE following observations were made from day to day and taken
down on the spot. The subject of them was a little girl, whose
mental development took the ordinary course, being neither precocious
nor the reverse.
From the first, probably by reflex action, this child cried inces-
santly, kicked, moved all its limbs, and perhaps all its muscles. It
was also doubtless by reflex action that, during the first week, she
moved her fingers, and even grasped for some length of time the finger
of another person. Toward the third month, she began to touch with
her hands, and to stretch out her arms, but did not yet know how to
guide her hand ; she essayed movements of the anterior members, ex
periencing the consequent tactile and muscular sensations — nothing
more. In my opinion, out of this enormous multiiDlicity of movements,
continually repeated, will be separated, by gradual selection, inten-
tional movements having an object and attaining it. During the last
fifteen days (age, two and a half months) I have observed one move-
ment which is plainly an acquired one : on hearing its grandmother's
voice, the infant turns its head in the direction from which the sound
proceeds.
There is the same spontaneous training for the use of the voice as
for movements. The vocal organ acquires dexterity just as the limbs
do. The child learns how to produce such or such a sound just as it
learns how to turn the head or the eyes, i. e., by constant efibrts.
Toward the age of three months and a half, while in the country,
the child was brought into the open air, and laid upon a carpet spread
in the garden. Here, lying on her back or on her face, she for hours
at a time would work with all her limbs, uttering a multitude of difi*er-
