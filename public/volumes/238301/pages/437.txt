The experimental determination of the color-constants is beset
with a considerable amount of difficulty, even in the simplest cases,
such as cardboards covered with pigments. The Ijcst mode of pro-
ceeding appears to be to call the luminosity of white cardboard 100,
and then to determine photometrically the comparative luminosity
of the colored cardboards. The measurement of the amount of white
light reflected along with the colored is still more troublesome, and
the result likely to be somewhat less exact, while the determination
of the tone, or third constant, is moderately easy under favorable
circumstances. One of the uses of such determinations is the pro-
