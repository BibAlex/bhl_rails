BLASIUS'S THEORY OF STORMS.

will be condensed into masses of cumulus clouds banked up against
the top of the cold current, and arranged over the horizontal stratus
clouds. Thus is produced the combination of cumulo-stratus cloud,
as represented in Fig. 4, and which is characteristic of progressive
summer storms.

To the tornado-cloud produced by a whirl of air, and resembling
an inverted cone, Prof. Blasius gives the name of conns, which is
both distinctive and appropriate.
These four typical classes of clouds — viz., cumulus, stratus, cu-
mulo-stratus, and conus — indicate and characterize tlie four different
classes of storms.
Predictiox of Storms. — With the foregoing facts and classifica-
tions in view. Prof. Blasius's method of predicting the approach of
storms, " by their embodiments the clouds," can be verified by any
careful observer of ordinary intelligence.
Winter Storms. — When in winter, while the wind is blowing
from the north, thin, hazy bands or stripes of stratus clouds appear
low in the southern horizon, it indicates that the warm current from
the south is flowing northward, sloping over the polar current, and
that the condensation of its vapor into cloiads, by successive undula-
tions, has commenced in the upper and colder regions of contact.
More and more of these stratus clouds gradually appear, until they
cover tlie entire southern sky and reach the zenith. This may require
