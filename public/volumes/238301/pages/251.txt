SKETCH OF ALEXANDER BAIN.
PROFESSOR BAIN, of the University of Aberdeen, is a repre-
sentative man of the modern school of English thought, who has
done his best work in the field of psychology. His elaborate treatises
upon the human mind now take a leading place in our literature, and
are used as text-books in many colleges and universities. Besides this
more special line of inquiry, to which Prof. Bain has given prominent
attention, he has also been very active in the general field of higher
education as lecturer, examiner, and author. He was born at Aber-
deen, in 1818, and entered Marischal College, in the university of that
town, in 1836, where he took the degree of M. A. in 1840. From 1841
to 1844 he taught as deputy the class of Moral Philosophy in Maris-
chal College, and 1844-'45 he had charge of the class of Natural Phi-
losophy in that institution. In 1845 he was elected Professor of Nat-
ural Philosophy in the Andersonian University at Glasgow. In 1847
he was appointed by the " Metropolitan Sanitary Commission" their
assistant secretary, and in 1848 he was transferred to the same office
in the General Board of Health, a post which he resigned in 1850.
From 1857 to 1862 he held the position of Examiner in Logic and
Moral Philosophy in the University of London. During several years
from 1858 to 1870 he held the office of Examiner in Moral Science in
the India Civil Service Department, and in 1860 he was appointed by
the crown Professor of Logic in the University of Aberdeen. In 1864
he was reelected examiner in the University of London, and continued
to hold that position till 1869. ProÂ£ Bain's first literary production
is said to have been an article in the Westminster Jieffiew, published
in 1840, and he subsequently contributed much to the pages of that
periodical. In 1847-'48 he wrote text-books on astronomy, electricity,
and meteorology, in Messrs. Chambers's school sei'ies, also several of
Chambers's " Papers for the People," and the articles on " Language,"
" Logic," " The Human Mind," and " Rhetoric," in the " Information
for the People." In 1852 he published an edition of the " Moral Philoso-
phy of Paley," with dissertations and notes, " The Senses and the In-
tellect," his first independent and systematic work, appeared in 1855,
and in 1859 wa^ followed by " The Emotions and the Will," thus com-
pleting a new methodical exposition of the human mind. In 1861
appeared from his pen " The Study of Character," including an ex-
amination of phrenology. In 1863 he published an English Gram-
mar, and in 1866 a "Manual of English Composition and Rhetoric."
His more recent works are: "Mental and Moral Science," 1868;
" Logic, Deductive and Inductive," 1870 ; and " Mind and Body," con-
tributed to the "International Scientific Series," in 1873. In 1874
appeared "A Companion to the Higher English Grammar," "Exam-
