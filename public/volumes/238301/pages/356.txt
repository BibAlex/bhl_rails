WHAT ARE BATS?

and which, in the bat, by their contraction, strike the wings down^
ward in flight.
Every one present miist have observed, when carving a fowl, that
there is a ridge or keel to the breastbone, and that a voluminous mass
of muscle — the breast of the fowl — is situated on each side of such

keel. Now, our bat has not got such a mass of muscle on each side
of the keel of its breastbone as has the bird, and for a very good
reason. In the bat, as in ourselves, the muscles which antagonize
those just noticed (and which draw the arms away from the breast)
are situated in the back ; but, in the bird, both the muscles which
strike the wings downward, and those which raise them ujDward, are
together placed upon the breast, and hence its much deeper and
more conspicuous keel. Still, though the muscular structure of the
breast of a bat is not so perfectly arranged for flight as is that of a
bird, it is an approximation to bird-structure, and one we can well
understand from the similarity of action. But it may puzzle some of
my hearers at first to think why the mole, of all creatures in the w^orld,
should have a breastbone at all like that of a bird. But a moment's
reflection will make it obvious that the mole also requires most pow-
erful breast-muscles, in order that it may dig its way through the soil
with the wonderful speed Avith Avhich it docs dig through it. Similar
causes produce similar effects, and thus it is that the mole, like the bat
and the bird, comes to have a keeled breastbone.
