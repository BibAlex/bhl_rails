AXES AND HATCHETS, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 189
size of the timber and the character of the fibre, A hatchet is handled
with the centre of gravity nearer the cutting-edge than the line of the
handle ; an axe with the centre of gravity in the line of handle pro-
duced. Of this, however, more hereafter.
The mode of attaching a handle to an axe in the bronze age is
very instructive to us. The illustrations are suggestive enough, and
need only a passing remark. It will be observed that for the pur-
pose of handling, some of these axes are socketed, others wedge-
pointed. The socketed ones were evidently handled as we handle
socketed chisels. There is, however, one peculiarity, and that worthy
of consideration. These bronze hatchets have in many instances a
semicircular, ring-like projection [see Figs. 4 and 5), the object of
which was for a long time a puzzle, but the suggested mode of
handling the implements, if correct as seen in the diagram, points
to a knowledge of directions of tension and of pressure, which engi-
neers at the present day cannot but admire. If anyone has ever
struck a common hatchet to any great depth into timber, and care-
lessly endeavored to loosen it by raising the extremity of the handle,
he may have found the handle separate from the metal near the junc-
tion of the two. Now the withe, or lashing, shown in this bronze in- .
strament, has been put, as we should put it at the present day, in
order to strengthen the connection at this, the weakest part.

Figs. 3, 4, 5, are examples of the modes of handling these ancient
bronze hatchets. Fig. 3 is the most primitive. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5
illustrate the mode adopted to strengthen by tension-cords the weak-
est part of the handle. A remnant of this tension-cord is probably
