Fouque in gaseous exhalations from petroleum-wells at Petrolia (and
Fredonia, New York) ; the third in similar exhalations from wells at
Pioneer Run.

Pelouze and Cahours carry the marsh-gas series to Cj^Hj^, but
Warren concluded that it terminates with C,Hjj„, and that the oils of
higher density and atomic numbers belong to the ethylene series.
On inspecting the above table it will be seen that numbers 4, 7, 9,
11, 13, and 14, have a common difference of about 30° C. between each
in succession, in regard to their boiling-points ; and that numbers
6, 8, 10, and 12, have a similar common difference, and are each about
8° higher in their boiling-points than the ones next below them. On
this account, Warren divided them into two groups ; but he included
here another C^H^^, with a boiling-point of 8 to 9°, which is, according
to Sadtler, a mixture of the two given in the table.
Besides the members of the marsh-gas series given above, Ameri-
can petroleum yields liquids boiling above 300° C, which on cooling
yield a solid mass called paraffine, white and transparent when pure.
It probably is a mixture of the higher members of the series C^H^n+j,
and on heating in a sealed tube is converted into a mixture of several
paraffines and olefines of lower molecular weight, liquid at ordinary
temperatures (Fownes).
Of the ethylene series, Warren has found in Pennsylvania petro-
leum, decylene, C,„H^^, boiling-point 174.9° ; undecylene, Cj^II^,, boil-
ing-point 195,8°; and bidecylene, Cj^H^^, boiling-point 216.2°; these
have a difference of about 20° C. in their successive boiling-points,
No higher series of hydrocarbons is yet known from Pennsylva-
nia petroleum, but members of the benzol series, CJl2„_„, have been
found in other petroleums. Thus De la Rue and Mtiller, in 1850,
found benzol, toluol, and xylol, in Rangoon tar ; Busscnius and Eisen-
stuck discovered xylol in petroleum from Sehnde, Hanover ; Pebal
and Freund detected benzol, CJI^, toluol, C,H^, xylol, CJI,„, cumol,
CgH,^, and cymol, C,JIj^, in naphtha from Boroslaw, Galicia; De la
' Not yet obtained in a pure state.
