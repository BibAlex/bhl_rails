presence of moisture in their walls. This
moisture may be held either mechanically,
as by capillary attraction in the bricks,
mortar, and plaster; or chemically, in the
hydrate of lime. Moisture held mechani-
cally is removable by air and warmth;
chemically-held moisture is removed grad-
ually by the action of carbonic acid con-
tained in the air. A writer in the English
Mechanic suggests the use of a dew-point
thermometer as a means of determining
whether a house is sufficiently free from
moisture to be inhabitable. If we take a
reading of this in the open air, in the shade,
and protected from wind, we have the actual
