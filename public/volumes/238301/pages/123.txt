straw-index / I\ shown in Fig. 13. By its means you immediately
see both the effect of the first induction and the consequence of
touching any part of the system with the finger. The plate N rests
over the ball or turnip T^ the position of the straw-index being that
shown by the dots. Bring the rubbed tube near T': the end iVof the
index immediately descends and the other end rises along the grad-
uated scale. Remove the glass rod; the index II' immediately falls.
Practise this approach and withdrawal, and observe how promptly
the index declares the induction and recomposition of the fluids.
While the tube is near T, and the end iVof the index is attracted,
let T' be touched by the finger. The end iVis immediately liberated,
for the electricity which pulled it down escapes along the chain and
through the finger to the earth. Now remove your excited tube.
The captive negative electricity diffuses itself over both balls, and
the index is again attracted.
Instead of the chain you may interpose between the balls one
hundred feet of wire supported by silk loops. Tliis is done in Fig.
14, which shows the wire w supported by the silk strings JS S S, and
where, for the ball or turnip, the cylinder C, on a glass support G, is
substituted. Every approach and withdrawal of the rubbed glass
tube H is followed obediently by the corresponding motion of the
index.
Or, substituting a carrot, a cucumber, or other elongated conduct-
or for the ball 7", Fig. 12, you cause your rubbed glass tube to act
upon a greater extent of surface. You thus decompose more elec-
tricity and produce a greater attraction.
Repeat here an experiment, first made by a great electrician named
-^pinus. I wish you to make these grand old experiments. Support
an elongated metal conductor, or one formed of wood coated with
tin-foil â€” even a carrot, cucumber, or parsnip, so that it will be insu-
