THE CONSTANTS OF COLOR

rriHE tints produced by Nature and art are so manifold, often so
-L vague and indefinite, so affected by their environment, or by
tbe illumination under which they are seen, that at first it might well
appear as though nothing about them were constant ; as though they
had no fixed properties which could be used in reducing them to
order, and in arranging in a simple but vast series the immense mul-
titude of which they consist.
Let us examine the matter more closely. We have seen that when
a single set of waves acts on the eye a color-sensation is produced,
which is perfectly well defined, and which can be indicated with pre-
cision by referring it to some jDortion of the spectrum. We have
also found that, when waves of light having all possible lengths act
on the eye simultaneously, the sensation of white is produced. Let
us suppose that by the first method a definite color-sensation is gener-
ated, and afterward by the second method the sensation of white is
added to it: white light is added to or mixed with colored light.
This mixture may be accomplished with an ordinary spectroscope, by
removing the scale from the scale-telescope, and replacing it by a
vertical slit, as indicated in Fig. 1, which is a view from above. Then,
if white light be allowed to enter this slit, it will be reflected from
the surface of the prism into the observing-telescope, and we shall
find that the spectrum is crossed by a vertical band of white light.
By moving with the hand the scale-telescope, this white band may be
made to travel slowly over the whole spectrum, and furnish us with
a series of mixtures of white light with the various prismatic tints.
{See Fig. 2.) The general effect of this proceeding will be to diminish
the action of the colored light ; the resultant light will indeed pre-
