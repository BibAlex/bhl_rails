it may appear to sight, a compound of tAvo or more elements ? " He
takes various specimens of quartz, some perhaps from the granite, others
from some other rocks, and subjects them to the analytical processes
of the laboratory : the result is, that he finds all quartz, no matter
what its color may be, whether white or pink or black, or pure and
colorless as glass, to be a compound of the metalloid silicon and the
gas oxygen ; in other words, that it is an oxide of silicon, to which
he assigns the name silica. By a series of analyses he is able to cor-
relate the quartz of the granite with all other forms, and they are
many in which this mineral occurs. The flint of the chalk, the white

veins so often met with in the older slaty rocks, the agates picked up
on the sea-shore and elsewhere, the beautiful crystals known as cairn-
gorms, amethysts, and others, are all found to be but varying forms
of the same substance, colored sometimes by adventitious matter, as
iron, etc. ; and he finds, too, that the exquisite skeletons of some of
the sponges, the delicate valves of the Diatomacece and other minute
specimens of organic life, consist of this very same silica, which is
indeed one of the most important compounds entering into the struct-
ure of the earth's crust. Suppose the student next picks out one of
the feldspar-crystals: this on analysis will be, as was the quartz, found
to be also a combination ; in it he will also find silica, but the silica
in this instance is found to be combined with the metals aluminium
and potassium— in fact, is a double silicate of alumina and potash.
There are many varieties of feldspar: some of them differ from that
most common in granite, which is called plagioclase, in containing
lime or soda instead of potash ; these are also distinguished from the
orthoclastic series by their crystalline structure, which will afford, as
we shall see, a ready method for their recognition, when they are
