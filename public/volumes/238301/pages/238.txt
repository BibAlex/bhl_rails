CEETAIN PHASES OF BIED-LIFE.
By CHARLES C. ABBOTT, M. D.
nvrrOT WITHSTANDING so general an interest has been taken in
-i-M studying the habits of our birds, by both scientific and amateur
naturalists, there are several phases of bird-life to which little or no
attention has been paid ; at least scant reference, if any, has been
made to thera, in ornithological literature.
One such feature of bird-life is the mode of acquiring the range of
flight-power characteristic of each species. A careful and long-con-
tinued study of our birds in their chosen haunts, free from all unnatural
(i. e., human) persecution, has enabled me to detect but little variation
in the flight-powers of the individual^ of any species of bird observed
â€” far^ loss than in the general range of their habits ; but still, such
individual variation, I think, does exist. A bird is not a perfectly-
adapted machine, capable of faultlessly filling its destined place in
Nature, and unerringly performing everything required of it. With
the simple growth of the feathers of the wing, there does not come
