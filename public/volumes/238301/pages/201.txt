The plane of meeting between these two currents is more or less
inclined northward in the northern hemisphere, for the reason just
stated; and the lower end of the plane, or the space of air between
these two currents where they meet on the surface of the earth,' con-
stitutes the centre line or area proper of the storm, and the region of
lowest barometer. The horizontal plane beneath this inclined plane "

is the geographical extent of the region affected by the storm and the
region of low barometer. The place where the currents meet is con-
stantly changing with the changing seasons, following the sun north-
ward in summer and southward in winter. These changes of locality
do not, however, take place in one continuous movement of the at-
mosphere ; but with successive oscillations, like the waves of a rising
tide, each succeeding wave advancing farther and receding less than
the one before it, until its most northern or southern limit is reached
— as represented by the numbers 1 and 2 in the diagram— when the
oscillations in the opposite direction again begin. Whenever the
lower end of the plane of meeting between the two opposing currents
at B oscillates or passes over any place on the surface of the earth, it
will cause storm or change of weather there — a change of wind, of
temperature, and of atmospheric pressure.
