progressive condensation of fibres, and to that extent an increase in
the difficulty of the work.
The equally-inclined sides of the wedge-form of edge hitherto
alone described as belonging to axes, and the equal pressure this form
necessarily exerts upon each side if a blow is given in the plane of
the axe, suggest what will be the action of an axe if the angle of the
wedge is not bisected by the middle line of the metal. Assume that
one face only is inclined, and that the plane of the other is continu-
ous to the edge, then let the blow be struck as before. It will be
obvious that the plane in the line of the fibres cannot cause any sep-
aration of these fi,bres, but the slope entering the wood will separate
the fibres on its own side. Suppose a hatchet sharpened as pre-
viously described, and one as now described, are to be applied to
the same work — viz., the cutting from a solid block the outside ir-

to prepare it for the lathe. It may be briefly stated that the hatchet
described in the second, case would do the work with greater ease to
the workman, and with a higher finish, than the ordinary equally-in-
clined sides of the edsfe of the common hatchet. Coach-makers have

use is shaped as in Fig. 10. The edge is beveled on one side only,
and, under where the handle enters the eye, may be noticed a piece

order to steady the blade in its entrance into the timber in the plane
