color ; but soon they begin to grow darker, their contents shaping
into little round bodies, which when ripe are dark-colored and fill
the capsule to repletion. These little bodies thus produced in vast
numbers in the swollen ends of these vertical threads are termed
spores^ and answer the same purpose for moulds that seeds do for flow-

ering plants. From the same base several of these capsules are pro-
duced, varying in age fr^ra threads with their tips little swollen, to
the tall and aged ones which have ripened and scattered their sjiores.
This mould has much the habit of the strawberry-plant, throwing out
runners or stolons, which take root and in turn become new plants to
increase and continue the species. In the culture we have often seen
this mould hanging from the bread on the rack to the plate below, a
distance of four or five inches, with here and there the stolons with
their fruit-clusters hanging in mid-air (Fig. 1).
The fruiting which has been described is asexual, and the spores
thus formed can be likened to the bulbs in the axils of the leaves of
the tiger-lily and other reproductive bodies in flowering plants which
do not result from a fertilized ovule. Several trials were made to cul-
tivate the sexual fruit of this plant, but without success ; another
member of the same genus (Jlucor Syzygites), which grows on decaying
toadstools, produced them under the bell-jar in large quantities. When
this plant reaches the proper stage of development for the formation
of its sexual fruit, the tips of various filaments become noticeably swol-
len. Two of such enlarged ends grow toward each other and finally
meet by their extremities, or rather by the blending of the processes
which each cell puts out, thus forming at first a small cell between
the two united filaments. As maturity is reached, this zygaspore ac-
