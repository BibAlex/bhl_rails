THE MECHANICAL ACTION OF LIGHT.'
Bt WILLIAM CEOOKES, F. E. S.
TO generate motion has been found a characteristic common, with
one exception, to all the phases of physical force. We hold the
bulb of a thermometer in our hands, and the mercury expands in bulk,
and, rising along the scale, indicates the increase of heat it has re-
ceived. "We heat water, and it is converted into steam, and moves
our machinery, our carriages, and our iron-clads. We bring a load-
stone near a number of iron-filings, and they move toward it, arrang-
ing themselves in peculiar and intricate lines ; or we bring a piece of
iron near a magnetic needle, and we find it turned away from its ordi-
nary position. We rub a piece of glass with silk, thus throwing it
into a state of electrical excitement, and we find that bits of paper or
thread fly toward it, and are, in a few moments, repelled again. If
we remove the supports from a mass of matter it falls, the influence
of gravitation being here most plainly expressed in motion, as shown
in clocks and water-mills. If we fix pieces of paper upon a stretched
string, and then sound a musical note near it, we find certain of the
papers projected from their places. Lattei'ly the so-called " sensitive
flames," which are violently agitated by certain musical notes, have
become well known as instances of the conversion of sound into motion.
How readily chemical force undergoes the same transformation is
manifested in such catastrophes as those of Bremerhaven, in the
recent deplorable coal-mine explosions, and indeed in every discharge
of a gun.
But light, in some respects the highest of the powers of Nature,
has not been hitherto found capable of direct conversion into motion,
and such an exception cannot but be regarded as a singular anomaly.
This anomaly the researches which I am about to bring before you
