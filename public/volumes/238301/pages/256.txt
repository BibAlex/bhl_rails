VOICE m MAN AND IN ANIMALS.*
By EMILE BLANCHARD,
of the paris academy of sciences.
MAN possesses language, and makes large use of it, while, on the
other hand, not even the most intelligent animals have the
power of designating objects, or of translating sensations into articu-
late speech. In this respect the distinction between man and beast
is very marked. It has at all times been cited as an evidence of man's
exceptional place in Nature. The physiologist, however, discovers an
articulate voice in many animals. Some mammals give utterance to
vowels and consonants, but the result is only one syllable repeated
without variation. Birds, better gifted than the mammals, can sing,
and also possess a brief vocabulary : the goldfinch pronounces several
words, which it repeats again and again in moments of pleasure. It
lias a word to express its ill-humor, as also a word for calling atten-
tion. In all this we see faint traces of language, notable witnesses of
the unity of a phenomenon the gradations of which are wanting.
Some animals live in society, others travel in flocks. In such ag-
gregations there is plainly developed a sort of language adapted for
establishing concert of action among the individuals. In building
their lodges, how could beavers make a regular division of labor, and
so perfectly coordinate their work, if they were unable to understand
one another? The marmot, acting as a sentinel, could not warn its
fellows of the approach of danger, if it did not possess the power of
giving a signal, the meaning of w^hich they understood. When swal-
lows are about to migrate, some of them appear to be concerned
about the performance of tlie periodical voyage some time before the
rest : they flock together and utter their call ; they flit hither and
