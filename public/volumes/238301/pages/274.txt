OUR COMMON MOULDS.
407
In Fig. 9 is given a mould which makes its home on decaying herb-
age, and is found to perfection in old waste-heaps where weeds and
other green matter have been deposited. So common is it, that a cult-
ure is more a matter of convenience than necessity. The fruit-stalks
are upright, considerably branched at the top, with the spores borne
in bunches at the ends of the filament. At a is a much enlarged view
of one of these naked heads of spores, and another where the spores
have mostly fallen away. As the fruit-stalks grow old they break
down in every way, giving the appearance of a forest over which a
tempest has passed.
Of the black moulds Fig. lO shows a common and very simple rep-
resentation. It grew as a sooty coating on a culture made of sliced
raw potatoes. It is so very simple that any space taken for descrij)-
tion seems unnecessary. The black spores are nothing more than por-
tions of single or branched filaments cut oflf in a very regular manner.

Fig 11.
In Fig. 11 is given the general structure of a large number of re-
lated moulds which grow wherever they can get a foothold. The
drawing was made from one found on some turnip-roots left upon the
ground over winter. Like many others, it forms an olive-brown, vel-
vety coating of considerable thickness ; and, because of their low
habits and inobtrusive nature, they pass readily for dirt or decay, and
are seldom noticed. They are the lowly forms which some of the
highest of the fungi assume in passing through one stage of their
polymorphic existence.
A score of other species of moulds deserve mention here which are
found on various substances either forced under the bell-jar, or grow-
ing naturally ; but we know how unattractive such descriptions would
be without accomj)anying figures, and therefore pass them by.
