WRAT ARE BATS?

preceded in early Tertiary times by others which were more or less
intermediate in structure. This is not the case as regards bats.
Bats, as soon as they appear at all, appear as thoroughly and as per-
fectly organized bats as are those living among us now.
This leads us to speculate upon questions of origin ; but, before so
doing, let us see that we have a clear idea of what a bat is, and can
give a good definition of it.
In order that we may have this clear idea, we must consider for a
few moments zoological classification.
The whole group of animals is fancifully termed the animal king-
dom, in contradistinction to the world of plants — the vegetable
kingdom.

This vast mass of animals is subdivided into a number of very
large groups, each of which is a called a sub-kingdom. Thus, we have
the sub-kingdom to which we ourselves belong — the vertebrate sub-
kingdom ; the sub-kingdom of insects, etc. ; that of snails, cuttle-
fishes, etc., and so on.
Each of these various sub-kingdoms is again divided into certain
subordinate, but still very large groups, each of which is called a
class.
Thus, the sub-kingdom Vertebrata is made up of the class of
man and beasts, tliat of birds, that of reptiles, that of frogs, toads, and
efts, and that of fishes.
