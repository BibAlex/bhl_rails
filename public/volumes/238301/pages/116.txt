PETROLEUM. 153
having only a sliglit odor like that of fat-oils, while the hydrocarbons
that are condensed after passing over have a very offensive odor.
The very last distillates from all of the destructive distillations are
called " cokings," and are distilled by themselves, yielding mainly
crude lubricating oil. The carbon separated in the stills contains
some caustic soda, which can be obtained as carbonate by burning
the carbon and lixiviating the ashes. The sulphuric acid used in
agitating the oils is known as " sludge," and is sometimes sold to the
makers of superphosphate of lime, although it has been occasionally
successfully reconverted into oil of vitriol. The following list in-
cludes the commercial products which have been made from petro-
leum, being those already mentioned, with the exception of cymo-
gene, which is distilled from gasolene, and condensed by a pump:
1. Cymogene, specific gravity 110° Beaume; boils at 32° F. (0° C.) ;
used in ice-machines. 2. lihlgolene, sp. gr. 100° B. ; boils at 65° F.
(18.3° C.) ; extremely volatile, producing by its rapid evaporation a
temperature of —19° F. ; used as a local anaesthetic. 3. Gasolene^
sp. gr. 97°, 90°, 88°, and 86° B., as required by the market. The very
light gasolene is ordered in small quantities, probably for ice-machines.
The others are used in gas-machines, for which they are admirably
adapted, and for various exceedingly dangerous lamj^s and stoves
designed for their combustion. 4. Naphtha^ sp. g. 70° to 76° B. ;
boils at 180° F. (27 C), when of 70° gravity; used in manufacture of
oil-cloths, cleansing, as a solvent for paraiBne, etc. ; sometimes fraudu-
lently mixed with the higher-priced illuminating oils, or with crude
petroleum, to be again sold to the refiner ; also sold, under various
names, as a burning-fluid, notwithstanding tlie certain danger attend-
ing its use. 6. Benzine^ sp. gr. 65° to 62° B. ; the boiling-point for
65° B. is 300° F. (149° C.) ; used in making paints and varnishes. 9.
Illuminating oil {kerosene), sp. gr. 45° to 50° B. ; boiling-point for
45° B. is 350° F. (177° C). " AsU-al " oil and " mineral sperm " are
particularly safe varieties, freed with care from explosive compounds.
7. Luhricating oil. •' Neutral " lubricating oil has a specific gravity
of 29° B., and boils at 575° F. (301.5° C). 8. Paraffine, sp. gr. 0.87° ;
fusing-point for commercial paraffine about 110° to 150° F. (43.3° to
65° C), according to its purity ; boiling-point about 698° F. (370° C.) ;
used for making water-proof fabrics, candles, lubricators, matches,
chewing-gum, etc.
The refined illuminating oil should be free from more volatile
compounds, which cause it to give off" vapors that explode when
mixed with air and ignited. Dr. White, President of the New Orleans
Board of Health, found that, on adding to oil which " flashed " at
113° F. one per cent, of naphtha, the mixture flashed at 103° ; with
two per cent, at 92° ; Avith five per cent, at 83° ; with 20 per cent, the
oil itself burned at 50° ("Report on Petroleum to New York Board
of Health," Dr. C. F. Chandler, 1871). Dr. Chandler has found that
