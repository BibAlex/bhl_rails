increased size of the cerebral ganglia, and also to further development
of some of the ganglia pertaining to the ventral cord, with concentra-
tion or even suppression of others.
In such insects as butterflies, bees, and dragon-flies, in which the
visual organs are enormously developed, and in which the power of
vigorous and sustained flight is correspondingly increased, the nervous
system attains its maximum of development among the Arthropoda.
The brain of these creatures differs from that existing in all other
members of the class by reason of the great development of those
portions of it in relation with the visual organs. A ganglionic swell-
ing is frequently found where the nerve joins the brain (Fig. 0,^,)and
in some insects there are also small ganglionic swellings at the cor-
responding parts of the anteimal nerves.
As in spiders, the oesophageal ring is very narrow, owing to the
greatly-diminished size of the oesophagus in the imago forms ot higher
insects. The double upper or cerebral ganglion is, however, con-
nected in all insects with a sepai-ate sub-ocsophageal ganglion, from
which nerves are given off to the mandibles, the maxillEe, and the
labium, though in spiders, crustaceans, and myriapods, as I have befure
stated, this part has no existence separate from the thoracic ganglia.
In insects the three thoracic ganglia also often preserve a separate
existence (Fig. 6), though in such higher types as I have named above

these ganglia are more frequently fused into a single, lobed mass.
The eight abdominal ganglia, which are always much smaller than
the thoracic, continue to have a separate existence among some of the
less developed types of insects, though it is more frequent for some,
or even all, of them to disappear.
The stomato-gastric system also attains considerable complexity
