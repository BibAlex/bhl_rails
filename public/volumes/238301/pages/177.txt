MISCELLANY.
A Moth that bores for its Food.â€” The
order of Lepidopttra, which includes moths
and butterflies, is almost universally char-
acterized as possessing a flexible trunk,
by means of which the insects suck up
the nectar of flowers. Indeed, the pos-
session of a flexible trunk is commonly re-
garded as one of the distinguishing char-
acteristics of this order. A few years ago,
however, a French botanist, M. Thozet, then
residing in Australia, discovered a moth
(Ophideres fuUonica) which possessed a
trunk so rigid as to be able to pierce the rinds
of oranges and suck their juice. Another
AustraUan observer having since called at-
tention to the depredations of this moth, M.
J. Kiinckel was led to examine the trunks of
Ophideres which had been sent to him from
Australia by M. Thozet. This trunk he de-
clares to be a perfect instrument, and says
that it would be an excellent model for the
making of new tools to be employed in
boring holes in various materials. It re-
sembles the barbed lance, the gimlet, and
the rasp, and hence can pierce, bore, and
tear, at the same time allowing liquids to
pass without impediment by the internal
canal. The tw o applied maxillae constitut-
