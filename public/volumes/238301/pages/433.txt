sent to the eye more light, but it will appear paler ; the color-element
will begin to be pushed into the background. Conversely, if we now
should subject our mixture of white and colored light to analysis by
a second spectroscope, we should infallibly detect the presence of the
white as well as of the colored light; or, if no white light were pres-
ent, that would also be equally apparent.

Taking all this into consideration, it is evident that when a par-
ticular color is presented to us we can affirm that it is perfectly pure,
viz., entirely free from white light ; or that it contains mingled with
it a larger or smaller proportion of this foreign element. Tliis fur-
nishes us with our first clew toward a classification of colors : our
pure standard colors are to be those found in the spectrum ; the col-
ored light coming from the surfaces of natural objects, or from painted
surfaces, we must compare with the tints of the spectrum. If this is
done, in almost every case the presence of more or less white light will
be detected ; in the great majority of instances its preponderance
over the colored light will be found quite marked. To illustrate by
an example : If white paper be painted with vermilion, and compared
with a solar spectrum, it will be found that it corresponds in general
tone with a certain portion of the red space; but the two colors never
match perfectly, that from the paper always appearing too pale. If,
now, white light be added to the pure spectral tint, by reflecting a
small amount of it into the observing-telescope, it will become possi-
ble to match the two colors, and, if we know what proportion of white
. light has been added, we can afterward say that the light reflected
