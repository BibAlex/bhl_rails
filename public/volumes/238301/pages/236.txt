strips of raetaL furnished Avith rows of points. From P P' wires pro-
ceed to the knob C, which is insulated by the horizontal stem, (r,
from the stand of the machine. This insulating stem may be abol-
ished with advantage, the wires from Pand P' being rendered strong
enough to support the ball C. At C sparks may be taken, a Leyden-
jar charged, the electric mill turned, while wires carried from it may
be employed in experiments on ignition.

" Seldom," says Riess, " has an experiment done so much to de-
velop the science to which it belongs as this of the ignition of bodies
by the electric spark." It aroused universal interest : the experiment
was repeated in all royal houses. Money was ready for the further
prosecution of electrical research. The experiment afterward spread
among the people. Klingenstierna astonished King Frederick of Swe-
den by igniting a spoon of alcohol with a piece of ice. Riess con-
siders it probable that the general interest thus excited led to the
discovery of the Leyden-jar, which was made soon aftei-ward.
Cadogan Morgan, in 1785, sought to produce the electric spark in
the interior of solid bodies. He inserted two wires into wood, and
caused the spark to pass between them : the wood was illuminated
with blood-red light, or w^ith yellow light, according as the depth at
v/hich the spark was produced was greater or less. The spark of the
Leyden-jar produced within an ivory ball, an orange, an apple, or
under the thumb, illuminates these bodies throughout. A lemon is
especially suited to this Experiment, flashing forth at every spark as
a spheroid of brilliant golden light. The manner in which the lemon
is mounted is shown in Fig. 32. The spark occurs at s. A row of
eggs is also brilliantly llltimiHated throughout at the passage of every
spark from a Leyden-jar.
