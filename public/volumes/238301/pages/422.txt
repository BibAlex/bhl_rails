and this with all the accuracy that it is pos-
sible to give on a map of four miles to an
inch, and in 200-foot contour-lines. Fur-
ther, the general quality and disiributiou of
timber, bottom, agricultural and unavaila-
ble lands are made the subject of investiga-
tion, while botanical, natural-history, and
other specimens, are collected. The greater
part of the volume treats of the geology,
mineralogy, and mining industry of the re-
gion surveyed. Then there are separate
reports on the Tertiary flora of the North
American Lig^itic, on ancient ruins in South-
western Colofado, and on topography and
geography.
Village Communities in the East and
West. By Sir Henry Sumner Maine.
New York: Holt & Co. Pp. 425.
Price, $3.50.
The six lectures which give to this
volame its leading title were first published
in 1871, and have now reached a third edi-
tion. Their object is to trace the resem-
blances existing between the early stages
of Western civilization and the existing sta-
tus in many parts of India. Other scholars
have shown the relations between modern
European languages and the Sanskrit ; the
author's task is to point out the relations
between the civil institutions of the East
and West. Besides the lectures on village
communities, the present volume contains
sundry other papers, viz., one on the effects
of observation of India on modern European
thought, three addresses to tlie University
of Calcutta, an essay on the theory of evi-
dence, also one on Roman law and legal
education.
Commencing with the July number, the
Fenn Moiithly will hereafter be published
for the Penn Monthly Association, by Jos.
H. Coates & Co., Philadelphia. The editor-
ship and ownership remain unchanged.
