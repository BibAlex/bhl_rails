together not only the fingers but the toes also (which is not the case
in bats), and has a true interfemoral membrane extending from the
hind-legs to the tail.

There is no other such instance in beasts, or in any existing rep-
tiles; but web-footedness is carried to such an extreme degree in a
certain frog found in Borneo as to give rise to the conjecture that it
was a flying animal.
Mr. Wallace, in his travels in the Malay Archipelago, encountered
in Borneo a tree-frog (Jihaeophorus), to which he considered that the
term "flying " might be applied. He tells us :
" One of the most curious and interesting creatures which I met with in
Borneo was a largo tree-frog, which was brought me by one of the Chinese
workmen. He assured me that he had seen it come down in a slanting direction
from a high tree as if it flew. On examining it I found the toes very long and
fully webbed to their extremity, so that, when expanded, they offered a surface

and the body was capable of considerable inflation. The back and limbs were of

As the extremities of the toes have dilated disks for adhesion, showing the creat-
