436 THE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY.
The greater part of the increase in commerce since IV 70 Ijas occurred
within the last fifteen years, and the annual gain now is greater than
the total traffic in the middle of the last century, and tenfold greater
than the traffic at any time before the discovery of America.
The advance in the other nations of Europe generally has not been
so rapid as in England, yet it is remarkable. The exports of France
rose from $400,000,000 in 1840, to $700,000,000 in 1869 ; those of Aus-
tria from $40,000,000 in 1842, to $160,000,000 in 1869; and those of
Russia from $50,000,000 in 1851, to $125,000,000 in 1869. In the
United States the progress has been more rapid than in England.
The total aggregate value of the exports and imports (excluding
the precious metals) of the fifteen leading commercial nations was
$6,000,000,000 in 1860, and $9,600,000,000 in 1870. These figures are
astounding, and nothing but figures can give us a correct idea of the
overwhelming magnitude of the present, and the relative insignificance
of the past. And if now commerce gains nine per cent, annually,
whereas before the steam age it did not increase one per cent., shall
we not exalt the age of steam, which has brought the improvement ?
It is to be observed that the forces which have caused the wondrous
development, instead of having reached the culmination of their in-
fluence, are only beginning to get full swing, and that the new com-
merce has not yet had time to exert its power. Statesmen and people
do not yet comprehend the vastness of the commercial interests, nor
have the merchants and capitalists yet learned how to combine to
prevent the legislative follies of past ages. Commerce is destined to
be the great bond of peace between nations, and they will be com-
pelled soon to organize a league to administer international justice,
and to protect the vast interests involved in their trade. They must
adopt new rules for their new circumstances. The policy which miglit
have been beneficial in a national point of view in 1700 would be
foolish now. "Commerce," as John Stuart Mill said, " first taught
nations to see with good-will the wealth and prosperity of one an-
other. Before, the patriot, imless sufficiently advanced in culture to
feel the world his country, wished all countries weak and poor and
ill-governed, but his own." Now, he understands that the greater
their wealth and prosperity, the greater also will be that of his nation ;
in the same manner as the individual merchant or mechanic thrives
better with rich than with poor neighbors and customers. But we
are told that the spirit of our age is bad ; it is too materialistic ; it is
hostile to sesthetical and spiritual influences ; it exalts money and ma-
chinery. The meaning of this complaint is that its authors have not
been properly educated, and they find that the Avorld is not in sym-
pathy with them. They measure it by their ignorance and prejudice,
and conclude that it is wrong. In all ages such lamentations have
been heard about the progress of the most beneficent changes. The
discredit into which many of the old metaphysicians have fallen is
