WHAT ABE SPECIES?

the course of their development, run through a series of changes of
the same order as those which are postuhited by the evolution-tlieory
for life in time.
Again, tlie facts of geographical distribution, as now known, are
absolutely incomj^atible with the hyjjothesis that existing animals and
plants have migrated from a common centre, whether Mount Ararat
or any other; and, by demonstrating the similarity of the existing
fauna and flora of any locality to that which inhabited the same area
in the immediately precedent epoch, have furnished a strong argiiment
in favor of the modifiability of species. Thus, it is not too much to
say that the facts of biology known at the present day are all con-
sistent with and in favor of the view of species entertained by La-
marck, while they are unfavorable to, if not incompatible with, those
advocated by Cuvier; and that, e^en if no suggestion has been
offered, or could be offered, as to the causes which have led to the
gradual evolution of species, the hypothesis that they have arisen by
such a process of evolution would be the only one which would have
any scientific foundation.
The great service which has been rendered to science by Mr, Dar-
win, in the " Origin of Species " is that, in the first place, he has mar-
shaled the ascertained facts of biology in such a manner as to render
this conclusion irresistible ; and, secoadly, that he has proved the fol-
lowing proposition : Given, the existence of living matter endowed
with variability, the interaction of variation with the conditions of ex-
istence must tend to give rise to a differentialism of the living matter
into forms having the same morphological relations as are exhibited
by the varieties and species which actually exist in Nature.
What is needed for the completion of the theory of the origin of
species is, first, definite proof that selective breeding is competent to
convei't permanent races into physiologically distinct species ; and,
secondly, the elucidation of the nature of variability. It is conceiv-
able that both the tendency to vary and the directions in which that
tendency takes effect are determined by the molecular constitution of
a living body, in which case the operation of the changes of external
conditions will be indirect, and, so to speak, permissive. It is con-
ceivable, on the other hand, that the tendency to vary is both origi-
nated and directed by the influence of external conditions, while it is
also conceivable that both variation and the direction which variation
takes are partly determined by intrinsic and partly by extrinsic con-
ditions. â€” The American Cyclopaedia.
