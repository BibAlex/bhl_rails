IN all languages there exist sounds — vowel and consonant — repre-
sented by the letters of the alphabet. This, in the opinion of some
linguists, is an evidence of a common origin, while naturalists hold it
to be the inevitable effect of the functions of an organ whose confor-
mation scarcely differs in any perceptible degree between one race
and another. Nevertheless languages differ very much in the number
of their intonations. If, in this respect, the languages of uncivilized
nations stand lowest, it does not necessarily follow that the languages
of the most highly-civilized peoples must hold the highest rank. The
Hindustani is distinguished by an unparalleled abundance of conso-
nants ; the Semitic languages surpass the Greek and Latin, as also the
languages of modern Europe ; the dialects of Polynesia afford instances
of the greatest poverty of consonant sounds. Of the Hurons and
Mohawks of North America, who habitually kept the mouth open,
it is asserted that they knew nothing of the use of the labials —
articulations so natural to us that we might be disposed to regard
them as instinctive. Sundry nations eschew the use of hissing and
trilling sounds ; ^ others have no gutturals. Some years ago, pref-
erences for harshness or for softness of language seemed to us to
show that neither the vocal organs nor the auditoiy perceptions are
absolutely identical in all races of mankind ; ' this is now rendered
more probable by multiplied observations and experiments. We know
how great is the difficulty of rendering certain sounds in a foreign
language, and hence it is that words change in migrating from place
