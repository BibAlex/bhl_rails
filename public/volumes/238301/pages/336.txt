Scott. This will be speedily followed by
" Our Mutual Friend," by Charles Dickens,
which will be succeeded by " The Last
Days of Pompeii," by Bulwer.
In the prospectus of the Quarterly Bul-
letin of the Xuttall Ornithological Club, it is
stated that " papers received from resident
and corresponding members of the club, to-
gether with such matter pertaining to birds
as may be gathered from other sources,
will make up the contents. It is proposed
to issue 16 pages quarterly. Starting, how-
ever, with 28, we hope to receive sufficient
aid to warrant the continuation of a like
number, and to make the work at least self-
supporting." $1 per year. Published by
H. B. Bailey, 13 Exchange Place, Boston.
The American Catholic Quarterh/ Re-
view takes the place of the defunct Quar-
terly Review edited by the late Dr. Orestes
A. Bro\.'nson. The new periodical, how-
ever, will occupy a wider field than its
predecessor, embracing within its scope not
only theological, philosophical, and politi-
cal, but also historical, scientific, and liter-
ary discussions. It has a strong editorial
staff, and among its contributors are the
foremost Catholic litterateurs and scholars
of the United States and England. $5 per
year. Philadelphia: Hardy & Mahony, 505
Chestnut Street.
