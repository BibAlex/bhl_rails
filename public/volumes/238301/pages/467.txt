of the sheath of the proboscis. Each ganglion is pyriforra in shape,
and connected with its fellow by means of two commissures, one of
which passes over, and the other underneath, the proboscis. It is diffi-
cult to trace the ultimate distribution of the nerve-fibres in these ci'eat-
ures ; so that, although fibres can be followed nearly up to the pigment-
spots, none have been detected in immediate continuity with them.

The inferior commissure between the two ganglionic masses is shorter
and broader than the upper, andj while it serves in part to bring the
two ganglia into communication, it is also partly composed of com-
missural fibres, uniting the two great lateral nerve-trunks. These
start from the ganglia, and, proceeding along the sides of the body,
give otf numerous branches to the longitudinal and circular muscles
between which they are situated.
The pyriform ganglia are mostly of a pink or reddish color, and
they are crowded with small nerve-cells. They represent the brain as
it exists in these animals, and we have here, perhaps, a type of the
simplest form which this organ could assuTue among active creatures
possessing a distinct bilateral symmetry. Tactile and possibly gus-
tatory impressions, together with impressions produced by light or
darkness, doubtless come from the anterior extremity of the organism
to the pyriform ganglia on either side, and are thence reflected along
correlated channels in the great efi'erent bundles, proceeding to the
muscles on one or both sides of the body, and also to the muscular
proboscis. Other departments of the nervous system may exist in
these animals, though as yet none have been detected.
lu the common earthworm the nervous system is somewhat dif-
ferently developed. The lateral ganglia of the Nemertidce are re-
placed by two upper ganglia, connected by lateral commissures with
