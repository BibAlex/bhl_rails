scribed it at length. A current of steam heated to incandescence,
meeting crude petroleum as it drips slowly over cast-iron shelves,
takes up all the oil and carries it to a chamber where it meets an air-
blast and passes on to the combustion-cliamber. This is a cellular
tier of fire-bricks occupying the sjtace over the bridge-wall of an ordi-
nary furnace. Here the combustion begins, and thence the flames
pass into the furnace, heating the six piles of iron, of 500 pounds each,
which form a charge. Eight tons of boiler-jdate can be worked off' in
ten hours with 800 gallons of crude petroleum, to which should be
added 500 pounds of coal for generating and heating the steam. Pe-
troleum is also used as a source of power in hydrocarbon engines
(G. B. Brayton's), its vapor being mixed with air and ignited.
Peoduction AND Value OF Petroleum axd its Pkoducts. â€” When
the first abundant supplies of petroleum were obtained, the demand for
it as an illuminator was small, and it could be bought at the wells for
ten cents a barrel, or was even allowed to run to waste (Wrigley),
but as the consumption increased the price rose steadily, reaching, in
1864, $13.75 per barrel. The average prices per barrel at Titusville
are given below, taken from StowelVs Fetroleum Reporter, Pittsburg :

according to Wrigley, has been as follows :

The yield for 1859 is put at about 2,000 barrels by Mr. S. II. Stow-
tll, who has also kindly furnished the following statistics :

The total value of the crude oils at the wells, up to the end of 1874,
is given by Wrigley as 8235,475,120, with an additional value for
