OUR COMMON MOULDS.

With the spores of this mould repeated sowings have been made,
with gratifying results. When a slice of fresh bread was placed in
the bell-jar and certain marked places were sprinkled with spores by
means of a pair of forceps, in the course of twenty-six hours those spots
sown were covered with the young mould, while all other places were
entirely free from it. In one case a fresh slice of bread was wrapped in
a piece of paper, with the exception of a star-shaped figure cut from the
paper, which came in the middle of the slice. Over the whole a slice
of mouldy bread was shaken so gently that no spores were seen to
fall; the paper was then carefully removed, and the bread placed under
the bell-jar. After the usual time a fine star of blue mould made its
appearance, soon spreading over the whole of the bread. One could
as easily write his name in mould on bread as with clover-seed upon
the soil, though it would not be as enduring an inscription.
It seems difiicult for some people to see how the spores of these
various moulds can exist almost everywhere, ready to grow when the
first opportunity offers itself. With the hope of making this matter-
appear clearer, the following calculations have been carefully made :
The blue mould (Petiicilliurn criistaceutn) is very favorable for the esti-
mation of the number of spores produced, as the heads are quite open,
and the spores are naked and distinct.

A piece of decaying apple was selected, because the mould can be
removed from that portion covered with the smooth skin without be-
ing mixed with foreign matter. When the mould was still young and
no spores had fallen away, it was viewed with the high power of the
microscope. There were usually twenty filaments to each head, and
twenty spores on a filament, or 4,000 spores to a head or single stalk.
