42 THE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY.
including the discovery of the long-sought northwestern passage, and
of its inutility. The exploration of the antarctic circle as far as the
73Â° of south latitude, and the remarkable discovery that the ice-bound
regions, both of the Arctic and Antarctic, were, at a former period of the
world's history, covered with a luxuriant vegetation, and that plants
and animals then existed there in great abundance, which are found
now only in the tropics, or in the more southern parts of the temperate
zone.
And finally our own explorations of the great Western region,
between the Mississippi and the Pacific, by Fremont, Emory, Simpson,
Marcy, Stansbury, Sitgreaves, Gunnison, Beckwith, Whipple, Wil-
liamson, Parke, Warren, Ives, Reynolds, Macomb, Mullen, Wheeler,
and other gallant, efiicient, and distinguished, military oflicers con-
ducting reconnoissances or expeditions across its plains, deserts, and
mountains, accompanied in these expeditions by scientific civilians, to
whose labors we are indebted for our knowledge of its geology, agri-
cultural resources, and natural history. Among strictly scientific
works by civilians I should also enumerate Whitney's survey of Cali-
fornia, followed by King and Gardner's belt of geological and topo-
graphical survey across the Xorth American Cordilleras, Hayden and
Gardner's survey in the Rocky Mountains, and Powell and Thompson's
of the great caiions of the Colorado, through whose united labors so
much, of the geography of this vast region has become known ; its
great mountain-ranges, extraordinary caiions, wonderful geysers, deep-
ly interesting ruins of a prehistoric and semi-civilized people of whom
we know but little ; its lakes, rivers, majestic cataracts, broad areas
of cultivable land, already largely and to be still more extensively
settled, and finally the millions it has yielded in gold and silver ; a
region so vast beyond the one hundredth meridian, that it will be
twenty years before we obtain proper maps of it, unless the Govern-
ment is more liberal in providing for its exploration and survey than
it has hitherto been.
To these geographical labors and explorations within this period
in various parts of the globe must also be added extensive researches
of a geographical character, such as deep-sea dredgings, for the inves-
tigation of the temperature of the ocean, the movements of submerged
currents, the plant and animal life existing at great depths, and the
configuration of the bottom of the seas. The observation and study
of oceanic currents and their cause. The distribution of heat north
and south of the equator by the instrumentality of these currents, and
its efiects upon climate, as well as the efiect of the currents from polar
regions in modifying the heat of the equator. The meteorological ob-
servations in respect to the course of the winds ; and the investiga-
tions of the laws and of the cause of hurricanes, cyclones, and other
aerial disturbances. The magnetic observations in elucidation of the
difficult subject of terrestrial magnetism. The numerous measure-
