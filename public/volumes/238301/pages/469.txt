In the leech we meet with some variations in the arrangement of
the nervous system, of a kind analogous to changes subsequently to
be spoken of as occurring in higher forms of life. The nervous sys-
tem becomes more concentrated. There is no longer a ganglion for
each segment, but one for every three or four segments of the animal ;
and the two ventral cords approximate so closely as to be almost
fused into one. In the common medicinal leech, for instance, there is
a bilobed ganglion (a) above the mouth, which receives fibres from
the tactile lips, and also ten distinct filaments from as many pigment-
spots {h b) or ocelli, situated round the margin of this upper lip.

From this bilobed ganglion, which corresponds with the brain proper
of higher animals, a cord descends on each side of the oesophagus,
and the two unite in a heart-shaped supra-oesophageal ganglion (c),
from which afierent nerves are given oiF to the muscles whose busi-
ness it is to move its three saw-like jaws, as well as to the muscles of
the oral sucker. This lower ganglion in part corresponds with the
" medulla oblongata " of vertebrate animals. It is continuous with
the double ventral cord, on which twenty equidistant rhomboidal
ganglia are developed. Each of these ganglia gives off two nerves
