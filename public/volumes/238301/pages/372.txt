they meet with when, after the water has retreated, the soil first becomes dry,
and then hardens. The water in the aquarium was drawn off little by little as

passed, and already the hardened earth showed a number of cracks ; through
these a small quantity of air is admitted, which supports respiration.
" On the seventieth day I examined the earth, and found that the two ani-
mals had met with such conditions as enabled them successfully to live through
the artificially-produced dry season : they were enveloped in cocoons, and were
full of life, as was shown by their motion on being touched ever so lightly.
