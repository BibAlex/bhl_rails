THE MECHANICAL ACTION OF LIGHT.

What, then, is the cause of the contradictory action in these two
bulbs â€” attraction in one, and repulsion in the other ? It can be ex-
plained in a few words. Attraction takes place when air is present,
and repulsion when air is absent.
Neutrality, or no mov.ement, is produced when the vacuum is insuf-
ficient. A minute trace of air in the
apparatus interferes most materiall)''
with the repulsion, and for a long
time I was unaware of the powerful
action produced by radiation in a
" perfect " vacuum.
It is not at first sight obvious
how ice or a cold body can produce
the opposite eficct to heat. The law
of exchanges, however, explains this

perfectly. The pith-bar and the whole of the surrounding bodies are
incessantly exchanging heat-rays ; and under ordinary circumstances
the income and expenditure of heat are in equilibrium. Let me draw
your attention to the diagram (Fig. 2), illustrating what takes place
when I bring a piece of ice near the apparatus. The centre circle
represents my piece of pith ; the arrows show the influx and efflux of
heat. A piece of ice brought near cuts ofi'the influx of heat from one
side, and therefore allows an excess of heat to fall on the pith from
the opposite side. Attraction by a cold body is therefore seen to be
only repulsion by the radiation from the opposite side of the room.
The later developments of this research have demanded the
utmost refinement of apparatus. Everything has to be conducted in
glass vessels, and these must be blown together till they make one
piece, for none but fused joints are admissible. In an investigation
depending for its successful prosecution on manipulative dexterity, I
have been fortunate in having the assistance of ray friend Mr. Charles
Gimingham. All the apparatus you see before you are the fruits of
his skillful manipulation, and I now want to draw your attention to
