LESSOJVS AV ELECTRICITY.

These experiments are now made "by rendering the coatings of the
Leyden-jar movable. Such ajar may be charged, the interior coating
may be lifted out and proved unelectric. The glass may then be re-
moved from the outer coating and the latter proved unelectric. Re-
storing the jar and coatings, on connecting the two latter, the dis-
charge passes in a brilliant spark.
Make a jar with movable coatings thus : Roll cartridge-paper
round a good flint-glass tumbler, G^ Fig. 29, to within about an inch
of the top. Paste down the edge of the paper, and put a paper bot-
tom to it corresponding to the bottom of the glass. Coat the paper,
T^ inside and out with tin-foil. Make a similar coating, T\ for the
inside of the tumbler, attaching to it an upright wire, TP^ ending in a
hook. You have then, to all in|;ents and purjjoses, a Leyden-jar.
PiQ. 29.
Fig. 30.
Charge the jar, and by means of a rod of glass, sealiug-wax, or
gutta-percha, lift out the interior coating. It will carry a little elec-
tricity away with it. Place it upon a table and discharge it wholly.
Lift the glass by the hand out of the outer coating. Neither of the
coatings now shows the slightest symptom of electricity. Restore
the tumbler to its outer coating, and, by means of the hook and in-
sulating rod, restore the inner coating to its place. Discharge the
jar: you obtain a brilliant spark. The electricity which produces
this spark must liave been resident in and on the glass.
You can charge your jaf with a rubbed glass rod, though a machine
in good working order will do it more rapidly.
Sec. 22. Ignition by the Electric Spark. â€” Various attempts had
been vainly made by Xollet and others to ignite inflammable sub-
stances by the electric spark. This was first efiected by Ludolf, at
