Xeotropical region is not only distinguished as the headquarters of
the Phyllostomidoe, but also by being altogether destitute of the fly-
ing-foxes and RhinolophidcB.
Such being the relation of bats to space — their geographical dis-
tribution — what are their relations to time — their geological distri-
bution ?
I assume that my readers are acquainted with the fundamental
facts and laws of geology, and know that the successive layers, of
which the superficial crust of the earth is in very various degrees com-
posed, are classifiable into three sets : 1. The Primary or Palaeozoic
rocks ; 2. The Secondary or Mesozolc rocks (from the Trias to the
Chalk inclusively) ; and, lastly, 3. The Tertiary or Cainozoic rocks,
extending upward from the Chalk to the present day.

Remains of beasts more or less closely resembling some of those
existing now in Australia are found low down in the secondary rocks,
namely, in the Triassic and Oolitic formations. Generally speaking,
however, beasts such as those which now exist are not found deeper
than the Tertiary strata, and this is the case with bats.
The oldest fossil bat yet known is represented by a few teeth
found in Eocene deposits in Suffolk, The oldest perfect fossil bat is
the Ves2)ertilio Parisiensis of the gypsum-bed of Montmartre, near
Paris.
Some forms of existing beasts, however, which are noio distinct
enough, such as the ox and the pig, or the tapir and the horse, were
