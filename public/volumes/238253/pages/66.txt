BRANCH ARTHROPODA
Arthrop'oda may be characterized as animals having bi-
laterally symmetric segmented bodies with jointed appendages
and a chitinous exoskeleton. The segments of the body are
not so numerous as in the worms.
This branch includes a vast assemblage of animals which
are widely distributed over the earth. They vary in habitat,
l)eing aquatic, terrestrial, subterranean, aerial, or some com-
bination of these.
Some are of direct use in furnishing food for man, as the
lo1)ster and the bee. Many cross-fertilize plants, and are thus
of indirect use to man. As common examples of this branch
may be named the lobsters, crabs, crayfishes, spiders, " thou-
sand-legs," and insects.
The digestive system is between the circulatory system and
the nervous system. It is not much coiled, but runs almost
straight through the body. (See Fig. 69.)
The circulatory system consists of a dorsal blood-vessel
open at the anterior end. The blood is pumped forward. It
fills all the irregular spaces of the body, through which it loathes
all the tissues and makes its way back to the dorsal vessel.
The corpuscles are colorless and ameboid.
The respiratory system consists of gills in the aquatic forms,
and of air-tubes or tracheae in the insects and other terres-
trial forms.
The nervous system consists generally of a double chain of
ganglia, connected by a double nerve cord, running along the
ventral side of the body. (See Fig. 69, A''.) We should expect
to find a pair of ganglia to each segment, but several ganglia may
be united, as in the crayfish, where there are thirteen well-marked
ganglia, the three anterior ones uniting to form the so-called
brain.
Multiplication. â€” The sexes are usually distinct. Multiplica-
tion is generally by fertilized eggs.
