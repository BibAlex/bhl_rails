cardium. It consists of sinus venosus, auricle, ventricle, and
comis arteriosus. The blood, which is red, goes from the gills

venosus, from which it passes through the parts of the heart in the
order named, and the circulation begins anew.
Respiration is by gills except in the lung fishes, which take the

open on the exterior by gill-slits. They are attached to the
branchial arches and are persistent through life.
