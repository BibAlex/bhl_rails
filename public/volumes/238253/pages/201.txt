ones devour many grasshoppers and other insects. They regurgitate the
indigestible portions of their prey in httle oblong balls or pellets, which may
be found on the ground under the trees in which they nest. Owls nest in
holes in trees or banks, and lay from three to five pure white eggs. They
feed at night when the rats and mice are about. Thus they are of more
benefit than the day-feeding hawks.
The great horned owl is the only species which is harmful to man, and

rats eat in a year? Probably more than one great horned owl would eat,
and a lot of corn besides. The investigations at Washington prove, how-
ever, that, although many rats and mice are eaten, so many small birds
and domestic fowls are destroyed by it, that one is justified in shooting the
great horned owl.
Burrowing owls (see Prairie dogs) nest in the abandoned nests of prairie
dogs, but do not live in the same nest with them.
