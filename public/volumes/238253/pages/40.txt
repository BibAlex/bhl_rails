In England the annual loss of sheep killed by the liver-flukes is estimated
at $1,000,000, and it has been known to reach $3,000,000 in one year.
There have been a few cases of this parasite found in man.
CLASS III. CESTODA
A tapeworm {Tw'nia so'liwn) is a parasite in the intestine
of man. It is ribbon shaped (Fig. 27), being much narrower at
the attached end, the head, or scolex.

shaped sucker on each of the four sides. The attachment is

Segments. — The remainder of the tapeworm, except a short
])ortion immediately posterior to the head, is made up of a series
of segments or proglottides, the number of which varies in differ-
ent species. In Taenia solium there are about eight hundred and
fifty segments, while in the smaller species there are three or four
hundred, and in the larger species, several thousand. These
segments or i)roglottides are derived from the head by a kind
of budding. Thus it is that so long as the head remains the
tapeworm continues to grow.
Digestion. — There is no digestive system, the nutrition
simply being absorl^ed from the liquids of the host.
The nervous system consists of a pair of ganglia, from which
two main nerve-cords extend bad: through the length of the
worm.
The excretory or water-vascular system consists usually of
