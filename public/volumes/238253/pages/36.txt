CTENOrilORA
31
Tho Ortocoral'Ui, or (hose foriu.s which have, cisht tentacles, are found
in all seas, holli in shallow water and at f^reat depths. They include
the opfian-pipe coral, Ihe precious red coral (Contlliuin rubruin) of the Medi-
terranean Sea, and the sea-pens and (Jk; sea-fans. The mesoslca of many
oc'tocoraila contains irrcfiular calcareous si)icules.
"^riie sea-pens { I'citndluld'rcd) usually form an elorifiated (;olony. The
8t(!m, one end of which is embedded in the sand (jr mud of the .sea bottom,
is supported by a (calcareous or horny skeleton. The distal ])()rtion is dis-
tended like a feather and bears the dimori)liic polyps.

The sea-fans {(for<)<))iii'c<'fi) ( l*'ig. 21 ) have a brandied colonial axis formed
of horny or calcareous substance; from the ectoderm, with spicules in the
nies()ti;lea.
In .some cases the skeleton formed by the spicules forms a liranched
axis, as in Coralliuni rithruiii, or it may form a " .series of cormectcd tubes
for the individual, as in t heorgan-jjiju' coral (Ttibi/)'ora)." "The red coral
is found only in the Mediterranean Sea at a depth of from 10 to 20 fathoms."*
