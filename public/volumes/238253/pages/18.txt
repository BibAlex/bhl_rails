INFUSORIA 9
Weir, in his " Dawn of Reason," tells of observations with an
Actinoph'rys, in which it was seen to discriminate between starch
grains and uric-acid crystals.
Protozoans are also known to be responsive to heat and light.
Weir also states as his opinion that all animals can distinguish
day from night. The question remains as to whether or not
this is ascertained by sight. However this may be, there can
be absolutely no vision, because there is no mechanism for it.
Importance of Protozoans. — (1) They furnish, either cUrectly
or indirectly, food for all higher forms of life. (2) They are
scavengers of decayetl organic matter. (3) By thcMr countless
numbers throughout the ages, vast formations of chalk or lime-
stone have been made. Myriads of them are still sinking to the
bottom of the ocean as Gloh'tgeri' na ooze or Radiolarian ooze.
Since these animals are aquatic, geologists know that wherever
these vast formations are found, th(Te was once tlie sea. (4)
Some of them are parasitic in the lower animals and in man,
causing diseases which are ofttimes widespread and serious.
