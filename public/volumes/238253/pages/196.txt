WATER BIRDS

Order VIII. Paludic'olae, as the name indicates, are marsh-
inhabiting birds. The crane is a famiHar example.
The coot, or mud-hen, is abundant in reedy swamps, near
smaU creeks and shahow lakes. It is an excellent swimmer. Its
foot is scalloped or only half-webbed. It is omnivorous.
The rails and cranes resemble large or overgrown Limicoloe. The young
are precocial. These birds usually feed on surface materials rather than

book, U. S. Dept. of Agricul., 1907.)
by probing in the mud, as the plovers and snipes do. The rails are chiefly
marsh or swamp birds of medium or small size. The Virginia rail is a little
smaller than a quail. " He is an odd-looking bird, with a half-quizzical,
half-cynical expression. His eyes are blood red and deeply sunk in the
long, narrow head."
The cranes (Fig. 2.3.5), of which there are but three species in North
America, are easily distinguished by the long bill, long head, very long neck,
short, broad wings, short tail, and very long legs. They fly in single file
with legs and neck outstretched. The cranes resemble the rails in general
structure, but the herons in external form.
