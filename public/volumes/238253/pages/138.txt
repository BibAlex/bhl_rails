Size and Number. — Fishes vary in length from an inch or less
to 30 or 40 feet. Kellogg says there are about "15,000 species
of fishes known, of which 3000 species live in North America."
Is it any wonder they vary in size, color, and habits? They are
the best adapted of all vertebrates for an aquatic life.
Covering. — The epidermis consists of many layers of proto-
plasmic cells with a very thin cuticle. The secretion of mucus
by the great numbers of "slime-cells" of the epidermis gives to
fishes their slippery skin. The epidermis contains also pigment
cells. The dermis consists of numerous layers of connective

tissue and furnishes the dermal or exoskeleton or scales which are
usually embedded in pockets of the dermis.
In many fishes the scales overlap each other. In the brown
trout, for example, the greater portion of each scale lies under
the one anterior to it, and the remainder, a small triangular por-
tion, is covered by the epidermis only. The scales sometimes
receive a layer of enamel or vitrodentin from the epidermis.
(1) The placoid scales are rhombic, plate-like bodies often bearing
a spine covered with vitrodentin. These scales are placed close
together, but do not overlap. (2) The ganoid scales also are
