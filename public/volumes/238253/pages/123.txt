puddle is small, it may be filled up with less expense. If neither can be
done, then spraying with kerosene along the edges of the banks and the
surface of the water every two or three weeks should be resorted to. The
oil kills by contact many adults and larva^ among the grass and weeds, and
by coating the surface of the water with a film of oil the " wiggle-tails "
are suffocated. Many females also are killed by this film of oil when they
return to the surface to deposit their eggs. All open barrels (Fig. 130)
and cisterns should be screened, so that the female mosquito cannot get to
the water to deposit her eggs.
The gall-gnats (Cccidofnyi'idcF) are the smallest flies, but their great num-
bers and their gall-forming habits make them great enemies of plants.
There are about a hundred species in the United States, most of which are

destructive to cultivated plants. The minute reddish or white eggs are
deposited on or in living plants, and the maggot-like larva; probably imbibe
their food through the skin.
The Hessian fly belongs to this family. It is a tiny blackish midge which
lays its eggs (Fig. 131) in the sheaths of leaves some distance from the
ground. The larva lives between the base of the leaf and the main stalk
and feeds upon the sap of the growing wheat. There are four or five broods
a year, both spring and winter wheat being infested. It is estimated that
the ravages of this insect cost the farmers of this country $10,000,000
annually. Were it not for its natural enemies, a half-dozen hymenop-
terous parasites, it would soon take the whole crop of wheat, rye, and
barley. The chief remedies which the farmer can use are the late planting
