loswn, which is not present in birds. The brain (Fig. 259), with
a few exceptions, is convoluted.
The special senses are all present except in some Cetacea,
where the olfactory membrane is degenerate and the sense of
smell is lacking. The organs of sight and hearing (Fig. 260)

on the base and tip of the tongue and on the soft palate, is more
highly developed than in any other class.
The sense of scent or smell is highly developed. Correlated
with the development of smell is the presence of odoriferous
glands in many mammals. The odors may serve for recognition,
