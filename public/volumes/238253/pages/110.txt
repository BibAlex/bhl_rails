cannot talk back." The soinifl is made by " stretching and relaxing a pair
of corrugated tympana or parchment-like membranes by means of a
muscle attached to the center of each."'
The strangest freak in all insect life is the periodical cicada or seventeen-
year locust (Fig. 113). It is the longest lived of all insects, for while
other insects pass from the egg to imago form in a few days or weeks, or, at
the most, in one to three years, this insect requires from thirteen to seven-
teen years for this development. In the spring the female cuts slits in
tender twigs and lays her eggs therein. In about six weeks they hatch
and the nymphs spend the reciuired seventeen years, or, in the case of a
southern form, thirteen years, in the ground. They feed by sucking the
juice» of tender roots. In the spring of the seventeenth or the thirteenth
year — as the case may be — they crawl up to the surface of the ground,

undergo their last molting, and emerge as clear-winged cicadas. This
insect is a fine example of protective resemblance. One may be within
a few inches of a " singing " cicada and not be able to see it, so near the
color of the tree trunk or ground is it. The adult life is short. They lay
their eggs, sing th?ir songs, and die.
The plant-lice or aphids (Aphid'idw) are among our most common and
destructive pests in the green-house, field, and orchard. There are many
species, most of which are small, the largest barely reaching the length of
T inch. The small, soft, usually green body is somewhat pear shaped.
Wingless forms are most numerous, but there are forms in almost every
brood which have two pairs of delicate transparent wings, the anterior
pair of which is the larger. " The two wings of each side are usually con-
