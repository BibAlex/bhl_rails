herbivorous diet. In the upper jaw the canines are usually
degenerate. Tlien^ are generally no incisors, never more than
a single pair, and in their place is a thickened calloused pad.
The canines of the lower jaw have taken the form of incisors.
The molars are selenodont, with crescent-shaped cusps; the
stomach is usually divided into four compartments (Fig. 273),
the rumen or paunch, which receives the food when it is eaten;
from here it is regurgitated and chewed again as cud. It is
then passed into the second division of the stomach, the re^icw^wm,
from which it passes into the third division, the omasum; and
from there to the true stomach or ahomasum. These animals

are usually large and many of them bear horns, which are larger
(or exclusively) on the males.
The Chev'rotain belongs to the primitive Asiatic and African family
Tragu'lidte. It is the smallest ungulate living to-day. It has both deer-
like and pig-like characteristics. It is hornless and the stomach has but
three divisions.
The camels and llamas {Caviel'idce) have long limbs, with no trace of
second and fifth toes. The rumen has smooth walls, and from it are devel-
oped the water cells (Fig. 274). Camels are wonderfully adapted to their
desert home by the sole pads on their feet; by their sandy color; by their
long necks, which give long range of vision and enable them to reach the
desert shrubs on each side of their path; by their cartilaginous mouth, which
enables them to eat the hard and thorny plants of the deserts on which no
other animal could subsist; by their small ears; by the valve-like folds by
