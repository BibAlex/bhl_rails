these germs unless it has been infected with them itself. Stegom'yia
jascia'ta (Fig. 127) is the yellow-fever-carrying species, so much dreaded in
our southern states. It has been
established by observation and ex-
periment^ that these mosquitoes, if
they have bitten persons affected by
malaria or yellow fever, actually
carry these diseases, also that Sleg-
omyia Jascia'ta and Cu'lex fati'gans,
var. skusii, and Anoph'eles rossii
carry certain forms of filariasis.
These organisms belong to the
round worms or Nematoda (see
p. 41). The most common form of
filariasis is elephantiasis. In this
disease the legs and arms are af-
fected. One leg may become so
enlarged as to weigh as much as
the rest of the body, or the arm
may become a foot thick and horri-
bly repulsive. In Samoa, says Kel-
logg, fully one-third of the natives
are attacked by this incurable dis-
ease, which, though slow and almost
painless, is certainly fatal. Ma-
laria, so widespread in the United
States, becomes even more prevalent and more often fatal in the tropics.
Millions die from it every year. In a single year five million persons died
of malaria in India alone. Hence the mosquito is to be classed not sim-
ply as a great annoyance, but as an insidious foe to health and life.
