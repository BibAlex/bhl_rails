LAND BIRDS 295
The sharp-shinned hawk is small (length, Hi inches), with a long square
tail marked by widely separated dark hands across it, the widest one
nearest the end. The principal food is song birds, so this hawk should be
destroyed wherever found. Cooper's hawk is dark brown with grayish and
brownish spotted under jjarts. Its tail is round. In food habits it is much
like the sharji-shinned hawk, and it should be destroyed.
The red-tailed hawk (Fig. 241), more often called the chicken-hawk, is
a great destroyer of injurious mammals. Poultry and other birds do not
constitute 10 per cent, of this hawk's food, and all other beneficial animals
which it eats added do not make 15 per cent. So its record is 85 per cent,
as a friend, against 15 per cent, as an enemy, of the farmer.

owl of tne Arctic regions (30 inches long). The owls (Fig. 242) {Bubon'idce
and Slrig'idfr) have a soft plumage, hence their silent flight. Their eyes are
large and dilatable, enabling them to see well at night. The face is so
broad that both eyes look forward. They are immovable, so that to look
in another direction the head must be turned. They have a peculiar voice,
a screech in our little screech owl and a " who-hoo-whoo " in the great
horned owl. When one is camping in the woods the sound of this bird
gives one queer creepy feelings until one knows what is making it. Owls
live chiefly on rats, mice, frogs, snakes, and rabbits. Some of the smaller
