is here inflected and forms a tube dipping down into the body
cavity, but not reaching the bottom of it. The lower end of this
tul)e or esopliagus (which is really the beginning of the ali-
mentary tube of higher animals) corresponds to the mouth of
the Hydra, so that the tube is lined with ectoderm. The mouth
is the only external organ, and serves both for the entrance of
food and the ejection of waste. The body cavity about this
tul)e is divided by thin partitions into radiating spaces.
No actinozoan is microsco])ic. All are long lived. One in an
English aquarium lived more than sixty years. ^ The sea-ane-
mones and all true corals producing reefs and islands have the
number of their tentacles in multiples of six.

The Sea-anemones (Fig. 17). — As one gazes in wonder at
the sea-anemones in their marine home, he can scarcely persuade
himself that those beautifully colored objects, so flower-like —
hollow cups with their petals and sepals of such wonderful tints
— are else than flowers. But he touches one, the " sepals and
petals " close in upon his fingers, they tingle, and he finds that
this flower-like object is an animal and that the " sepals and
l^etals " are tentacles. A very difl'erent appearance it makes
when the body has been drawn down close to its attachment by
the longitudinal muscles, while the circular muscles shut in the
