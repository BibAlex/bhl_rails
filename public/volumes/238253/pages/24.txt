BRANCH CCELENTERATA
This branch comprises our fresh-water Hydra, and a few
alHes, and the marine forms, jelly-fishes, corals, and sea-ane-
mones. This l)ranch finds representatives from the shore line
and the surface to the profound depths of the ocean.
The body, which is usually radially symmetric, consists es-
sentially of a two-layered sac, which is open at one end and
closed at the other, and in which there is a simple or branched
gastric cavity. The outer layer is called the ectoderm; the
inner layer, the endoderm, and a gelatinous non-cellular layer
between them, the mesoglea. Some coelenterates are soft-
bodied, others secrete a calcareous or limy substance called
coral. Around the free open end of the sac-like body are a
varying number of tentacles.
Nettle Cells. — Stinging or nettle cells are characteristic of
this branch, except in Cetenoph'ora, where they are replaced
by atlhesive cells. These stinging cells, which are especially
abundant on the tentacles, contain a fluid, and a spirally wound
thread provided with barbs, which, when the animal is disturbed,
are discharged into the body of the intruder, paralyzing it. It
is then seized by the tentacles and drawn into the mouth.
Size. — Coelenterates vary in size from the little fresh-water
hydra, a fraction of an inch in length and of the diameter of a
pin, to the giant jelly-fishes, as the Cya'nea, which sometimes
reach 7 or 8 feet in diameter and have tentacles more than 100
feet long.
Locomotion. — Some members of this branch are free, as the
jelly-fishes; some are permanently fixed; as the Corals, while
some, as the Hydras, are temporarily fixed, moving from one
position only to adhere to another, and thus making slow pro-
gression.
Multiplication is both sexual (by eggs) and asexual (by
budding) .
Origin. — They are of ancient origin, being abundant in the
Cambrian Period.
