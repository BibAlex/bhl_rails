water in the cold regions, but the water taken into the mouth
does not pass out through the blow-hole. The nose is directly
connected with the windpipe, so that a whale can breathe while
swimming through the water with its mouth open. The eyes
are relatively very small, and there are usually no external ears."
(Traces of external ears in the porpoise are recorded by Professor
Howell.)^ The opening of the ear is minute. The cervical
vertebrae are very short and more or less fused.
The skin is smooth and shiny, like coach leather, and a thick
coating of fat immediately underlies the skin. The Ijlubber or
fat from whales yielded much profit from its oil until the modern

whales has almost excluded the whale industry from the oil
trade. The toothed whales feed upon fish and larger marine
animals, while the whale})one whales feed upon minute Mollusca,
jelly-fish, and Crustacea.
The toothless whales are those in which the teeth, present in
the eml)ryo only, are replaced in the adult by ])aleen or whale-
bone (Fig. 267), a horny ])roduct of the epithelium of the mouth,
which consists of a large number (from 330 to 370) of horny
plates hanging down like curtains in pairs, one on each side of
the mouth, nearly meeting each other in the middle, each pair
immediately behind another. The lower edges of these horny
