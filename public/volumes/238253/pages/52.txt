lengthen the sea-urchin in the direction of the mouth to aboral
surface, and you have the form of the sea-cucumber. The
crinoid also reveals this plan, not so clearly defined, but it is to
be seen by the careful observer. The number of rays varies in
the starfish, the author having found them with four, six, or

The Skeleton or " Test." — The body wall is composed of a
thick leathery substance. In the mesoderm, under the epi-
thelium, calcareous plates arise, many of which are armed with
spines for protection. They are greatly protected also by their
resemblance to their environment.
Geographic Distribution. — All echinoderms are marine, l)eing
al)undant even in the deep sea. They are found in all parts of
the globe, but are most abundant in the tropics. At the breed-
ing season most of the free species frequent the shallow waters
