210 BRANCH CHORDATA
(see Fig. 170, Keni'ora), the scales are either ctenoid or cycloid.
These fishes vary in shape. They vary in size from our little
darter, 1^ inches in length, to the "horse-mackerel," which may
weigh as nmch as a cow. They differ in habits from the pre-
daceous, swift pikes and pickerels to the peculiar flounder on
the l)ottom of the sea.
The Remora (Fig. 170) is a lazy fish. It has a sucker on
top of its head, by which it holds fast to sharks or larger fishes,
and thus saves itself the effort of locomotion.
Order I. Crossopteryg'ii. — There are only two existing genera,
Polyp' terns and Calamoichthys, of Africa.
Order II. Chondros'tei (Sturgeons) (Fig. 171). — They have
paired fins with no basal lobe, supported by dermal rays. The
pelvic fins are abdominal. The vertel)ral column consists of the
notochord with cartilaginous arches. The tail is heterocercal.

1899.)
The mouth is ventral, projectile, and toothless, and sucks up
worms and larvae from the muddy bottom. The surface is
roughened by separate scales and by five rows of bony plates.
Sturgeons are found in streams and lakes of the Northern
Hemisph(Te and are the largest fresh-water fishes. Those of the
lower Columbia River sometimes weigh from 800 to a 1000
pounds.
From the swim-l)ladder of the sturgeon, glue, cement, court-
plaster, and isinglass are made. The egg-masses, called roe,
furnish caviare.
Order III. Holos'tei. — Familiar examples of this order are the
gar-pike and the mud-fish, often called dog-fish, of the streams
of the central states.
The skull is ossified. The scales are ganoid or cycloid; the
tail, di]:)hy cereal or homocercal. The pelvic fins are abdominal.
