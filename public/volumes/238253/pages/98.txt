morphosis is incomplete. The nymphs, hke those of the
dragon-fly, are aquatic. They are provided with gills. Those
who advocate the aquatic ancestry of insects believe that the
spiracles are the openings left when the gills were lost, but certain
species of stone-flies retain their gills — though shrivelled and
probably functionless — and have wholly independent spiracles.^

The larvse of stone-flies are flat and cling closely to the surface
of stones in the swiftest portion of the stream. They cannot
live in stagnant or foul water. Their resemblance to a fossil
is almost perfect. This resemblance is their protection from
their enemies, the fishes. These larval stone-flies are good bait
for trout.
ORDER IV. ODON'ATA
Dragon-flies. — To this order again belongs^ a single family,'
the Lihdlu'lidm, or dragon-flies (Fig. 100). They have many
common names, as " mule-killers," " snake-doctors," and
" devil's darning-needles," but, in spite of these terrifying names,
they are all perfectly harmless to man.
