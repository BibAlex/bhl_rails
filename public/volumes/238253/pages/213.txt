Important Biologic Facts. â€” Birds have, in common with
reptiles, the quadrate bone, and but one occipital condyle.
They are wonderfully adapted to their aerial mode of life by
their feathers, by the modifications of the fore limbs into wings,
and by the air-filled cavity of the bones. Birds are warm-
blooded (homoiothermal), the heart being completely divided
into right and left halves. The fusion of the bones of the hand
and the tibiotarsus and the tarsometatarsus are peculiar to
birds. Nest building, as well as incubation, is peculiar to this
class, though, in rare instances, fishes build nests and reptiles
practice incuV)ation.
