on one side, is the atrial aperture, for the exit of the current.
Sea-squirts are destitute of head and hmbs. The ventral heart
enclosed in a pericardium is situated between the gill region and
the stomach. This heart has the peculiarity of changing the
direction of its contractions. When the blood has been driven
to the gills for a while it rests a little, and then forces the blood
in the opposite direction.

The "sea-squirts" were formerly called "Tunicates," until a
study of their larval stage showed them to have vertebrate char-
acteristics. The larva has a slender finned tail containing a
notochord and a nerve cord. They furnish an example of retro-
grade development. They are free for a few hours, then be-
come fixed and lose the notochord and nearly all traces of their
vertebrate characteristics which promised a higher develop-
ment.
