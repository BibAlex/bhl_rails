CLASS III. AMPHIBIA
To this class belong the toads, frogs, salamanders, and
newts. The skin is smooth, as in the frog, or warty, as in the
toad, with a glandular secretion. It is often highly colored
owing to the pigment cells in the deep layers. In the common
"tree-toad," as well as in some of the
terrestrial frogs, the color may be
changed to harmonize with the en-
vironment. No amphibians are ma-
rine. Most of them are aquatic or
semi-aquatic. In the adult stage some
are terrestrial, some arboreal. They
are usually carnivorous in the adult
stage, but the larvae may be herbivo-
rous. They hibernate in the mud at

They make fine specimens for study in a tank or tub, since
many of them will endure captivity a good while.
