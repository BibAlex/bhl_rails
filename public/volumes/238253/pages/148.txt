by gills, but when the water gives out or becomes unfit for use

They are interesting as showing how land forms may have
originated from aquatic forms. There are only three existing
genera: the Lepidosi'ren, of the Amazon; the Cer'atodus (Fig.
169), of Australia, and the Protop'terus, of Africa. The Protop-
terus (see Fig. 168) "can live out of water, it burrows in the
mud at the dry season and builds a cocoon lined with mucus in
which it remains quiescent until the wet season."^

To this extensive sub-class belong our bony fishes, including
most of the living fishes. It contains thousands of species.

Familiar examples are the perch, sunfish, catfish, trout, carp,
