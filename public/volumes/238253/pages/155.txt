tliough there are scores of others. The vakie of the annual out-
put of our streams and coasts is at least $50,000,000.
Each nation reserves all fishing rights within three miles of its
coasts. Outside of this the sea fishes are open to the world.
The largest sea fisheries are those of the Atlantic coast of the
United States, Canada, and Newfoundland, and next in im])ort-
ance are those of northern Europe. Thousands of fishermen
from the United States, Canada, and France are engaged in the
cod-fishing on the foggy banks
of Newfoundland, whose shallow
waters furnish an abundance of
food for the cod, and make these
the greatest cod-fisheries in the
world. The fisheries along our
New England coast supply most
of the fresh cod-fish for our home
use. Gloucester is the largest
fishing port of the United States
and su])])lies a large part of the
salted cod-fish for our use. "The
Columbia and other rivers of our
northwest coast, including Alaska,
furnish our largest salmon fisher-
ies. The salmon canning industry
of Alaska is said to be the largest
of the world."
The demand for this whole-
some food product, together with
recklessness, has caused the de-
struction of certain species in
many waters. To i:)revent their extermination the United
States Government has a Bureau of Fisheries which has es-
tablished fish-hatcheries in almost all the states. In these the
spawn are cared for until they hatch, and when old enough the
young fishes are shipped to various localities for stocking ponds
and streams; or, the eggs themselves may be distributed. The
food su]i]ily of these fishes is also ])rotected or introduced, and
their enemies, diseases, and life histories are studied. The
annual distribution of eggs and young fishes numbers more than
