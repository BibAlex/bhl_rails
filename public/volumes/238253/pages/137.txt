slimy and very smooth. The gills of the lampreys open into a
respiratory tube lying below the gullet.

They are parasitic on fishes and also devour crustaceans. The
slimy eels bore into fishes and eat the flesh.
CLASS n. PIS'CES
To this class belong the true fishes, common examples of
which are the sunfish, perch, salmon, catfish, carp, and trout.
They are aquatic, gill-bearing, poikilothermal, usually scaly,
bilaterally symmetric finned chordates.
Shape. — The typical fish is wedge shaped (Fig. 158) at both
ends, so that it can pass rai)idly through the water. The head
is large and pointed, with the viscera situated near it, while the
trunk is long and tapering, for the attachment of muscles to flex
the tail in locomotion. Usually the body is more or less flat-
tened from side to side, though it may be quite cylindric, as in
the eel, or flattened dorsoventrally, as in the adult flounder, or
the body may be long and slender, as in the pipe-fish and ribbon-
fish. The shape conforms largely to the habits and habitat.
The fishes having the under side flattened usually swim near or
rest'upon the bottom at some time, as our catfish, ])ut the l)road
forms, flattened aljove and below, like the skates and flounders,
live upon the bottom and are not built for speed. The "flat
fishes" in early life have the position common to most fishes, but
in adult life the dorsoventral plane becomes horizontal instead
of vertical, the eye lies upon the upper side, and the color of the
upper side becomes dark like the dorsal side of most fishes, and
the under side light like the ventral side.
