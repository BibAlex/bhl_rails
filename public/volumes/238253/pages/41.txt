four principal trunks extending throughout the scolex and
proglottides.
Multiplication and Development. — Each proglottis, as it
matures, becomes hermaphroditic. Since these proglottides
are originally developed from the head, the posterior ones are
oldest. When filled with embryos, they are detached and pass
out with the waste material from the intestine. When taken
into the alimentary canal of the hog with its food, the hooked
embryos bore through the intestinal wall and into the voluntary
muscles, where they grow and
continue to develo]) until they

reach the bladder-worm stage, or cysticercus. When pork
containing a cysticercus is eaten, unless it has l)een killed by
thorough cooking, the head is everted from the l^ladder-like
covering and is attached to the intestinal wall of the host,
where proglottides are rapidly developed. These mature in
ten or twelve weeks.
Species. — There are many species of tapeworms. One form,
Tcenia saginata, which occurs in man, is ol)tained through
eating beef cookefl rare; anoth(^r form, Tcvnia solium,'^ already
mentioned, from eating pork; and an(^ther, Bothrioceph'alus
^ Tcenia solium is sometimes found in the encysted or intermediate stage
in the muscles, eye, or brain of man. The eggs are thought to have been
taken into the stomach with lettuce, cress, and the like, which had been
watered with liquid manure.
