ADELOCHORDA

Neural Cavity. — The upper or neural cavity contains the l)rain
and the spinal cord.
Hemal Cavity. — Below the vertebral colunni with its neural
cavity is the large cavity of the body, the hemal cavity, which
contains the heart, lungs, digestive organs, and other viscera.
Skeleton. — Most of these higher forms have an internal bony
skeleton or a cartilaginous one, as in some fishes. The vertebral
column, or backbone, is composed of a varying number of bones,
each called a vertebra, hence the branch is named Vertebrata,
or, if named from the notochord, Chordata.
Divisions of the branch are usually
made to distinguish the primitive groups
(Fig. 152) or Protovertebrates, from the
true Vertebrates.
The Protovertebrates consist of three
separate groups or sub-phyla, not closely
related to each other, but each, in a
primitive way, is entitled to relationship
with the Chordata or Vertebrata.
SUB-PHYLUM AND CLASS I.
ADELOCHORDA
The Balanoglossus is the principal
genus of this group, though two deep-
sea forms {Rhabdopleu'ra and Ceph'alo-
dis'cus) have a notochord, and the latter
has a pair of gill-slits, but in other ways
they are like the i)olyzoans. The Bal-
anoglossus (Fig. 154) is a small marine
chordate. Its surface is ciliated. It is
from 1 to 4 or 5 inches in length, and, by
means of its proboscis, burrows in the
mud along the seashore. A study of the animal or of a good
figure will show that it has (1) a dorsal nerve cord, (2) a
notochord, and (3) gill-slits.
Body Regions. — The Balanoglossus is divided into three
body regions: the proboscis, a club-shaped hollow anterior por-
tion opening exteriorly by a single pore; back of the proboscis
Fig. 154. — Balano-
glossus: p, Proboscis;
c, " collar "; gs, gill-
slits; enlarged. (From
