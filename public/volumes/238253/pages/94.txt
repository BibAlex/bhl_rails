INSECTA 123
Hearing. — Many insects have sound-producing organs and
auditory organs; and it has been proved by experiment that they
hear. The ear of the grasshopper or locust, a small tympanic
membrane, is situated at the anterior end of the abdomen, while
that of the katy-did and cricket (Fig. 95) is situated on the tibia
of the fore-leg. There is a special auditory ganglion. The
mosquito has its auditory organs in the antennae in the seg-
ments next to the basal ones, through which the sound or vibra-
tions are carried by many fine auditory hairs, and from which the
auditory nerves lead to the "brain." It is thought that the
male mosquito finds his mate by her song.
Sight. — Insects usually have both simple and compound
eyes, though either kind may be found alone; and a few in-
sects are blind by degeneration. The ocelli, or simple eyes,
are usually three in number and form a little triangle on the
Fig. 95. — The front leg of the cricket enlarged, showing the ear at a.
top of the head. Each of them is supplied with a special nerve
from the " brain." It is thought that the ocelli can do little
more than distinguish light from darkness and that their range
of vision is restricted to an inch or two in front of the head.
The compound eyes, two in number (see Fig. 84), are usually
large and conspicuous, often composing more than two-thirds
of the entire head. Each compound eye presents from twenty
to several thousand polygonal facets, or windows, which, alto-
gether, form the cornea. It is thought that the range of vision
of the compound eyes is two or three yards. The larger the
eyes, the wider will be the range of vision, while the smaller
and more numerous the facets, the sharper and more distinct
will be the image. Experim.ent and study of the structure of the
eye, says Kellogg, " indicate that, at best, the sight of insects
cannot be exact or of much range."
