tries or under leaves, and in the spring they are sometimes
found in large numbers on the surface of ])ools of water or upon
the snow.
Campo'dca stnphyli'nus, which is regarded as the most primitive hving
insect, belongs to this order. It is about j inch long, white, wingless,
and flat. Its body is exceedingly
soft and delicate. It is widely dis- '^'
tributed.
The "fish-moth" {Lepis'ma sac-
chari'na) of the house (Fig. 9S), which
is neither a moth nor a fish, is sil-
very white, with a yellowish tinge
on antenna^ and legs. It is about 5
inch long, has three long caudal ap-
pendages, and feeds chiefly upon
sweet starchy materials, often at-
tacking starched clothing and the
paste of wall-paper and book-bind-
ings. It may be gotten rid of by
sprinkling fresh pyrethrum powder
in the places infested or by spraying
slightly with nicotin or formalin.
The "spring-tails" {Collem'bola)
have a forked spring attachetl to the
next to the last segment of the ab-
domen, by means of which they leap
from a few inches to a foot in the air.
The " snow-fleas " collect in large
numbers on the snow in spring.
They are often a cause of great an-
noyance where maple sugar is made.
Surely the insects of this Fig. 9S.— Lepis'ma sacchari'na,

structure and their similarity
of somites, show their worm ancestry, though some species
show much more complexity of structure. It will be interest-
ing for the student to consider how, from such a generalized
primitive form as Camyodea staphylinus, nature can produce,
by modification of parts, an insect of highly complex structure.
ORDER II. EPHEMER'IDA
The May-flies, in the adult form, are insects of a day, but
they pass two or three years in the larval stage. When they
emerge from their larval condition into their winged form
