stars. The one most common on our shores (Ophiopholis) is
of a " general red hue spotted with brown and paler red."
CLASS III. ECHINOIDEA
The globular or disk-Hke sea-urchins have the pentameral
plan, as a cleaned " test " or shell (Fig. 44) will show.
The body wall is composed of several hundred pentagonal
calcareous plates arranged in regular order in twenty rows,
the whole forming a sort of thin case or shell (see Fig. 44).
Fig. 44. — Sea-urchin (EchVnus micros^toma) with spines nearly all removed
from " test." (Chapin and Rettger.)
The ossicles, or plates, are armed with very long sharp spines
for defense (Fig. 45). Alternate rows of plates are perforated
for the passage of the tube-feet, there being no grooves. These
ten rows of perforated plates constitute the ambulacral areas,
and the ten rows of unperforated plates constitute the inter-
ambulacral areas.
Color. — The colors are ])rown, olive, purple, red, green, or blue.
The protective resemblance is good.
The ambulacral system of the sea-urchin is similar in plan
