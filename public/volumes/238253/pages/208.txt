LAND BIRDS
305
The black-masked Maryland yellow throat is one of the tiny warblers
often seen in the Mississippi Valley. He haunts the thicket. His song,
" witchery, witchery, witchery," is characteristic of his active, nervous
energy.
The little black and white warbler, often called the black and white
creeper, is about 5 inches long. It is a more active climber than even the
true creepers, hanging from the under surface of branches and twigs or
flitting from tree to tree. It is usually silent. Its occasional " see-see-see "
is thin and wiry.
The wrens, thrashers, and the mocking-bird (Fig. 250) {Troglodyt'idce)
include many fine singers. They are inconspicuously colored birds, feed-
ing near the ground. Many of them like the low scrubby tangled growth
so dear to the catbird, which cheers us all the summer day, rain or shine.
This bird does valiant service as a caterpillar hunter, especially when
feeding the young.

The creepers (Ccrthi'idop) do good work in keeping down the pests of the
tree trunks all the year around.
The nuthatches (Par'idce) also help in tree keeping, as do our little chick-
adees, which stay the winter through.
The thrushes (Tur'(lid<r) are usually fine singers. The best known are
the much-loved robin and bluebird (Fig. 251).
There are several other families of Passeres, but lack of space forbids us
to dwell longer on this fascinating subject.
Economic Importance. — Millions of dollars' worth of farm
products are destroyed annually by insect pests, but if these great
hordes of marauders were not held in check by their natural
enemies, the birds, the devastation would be so great in a few
years as to cause actual famine.
