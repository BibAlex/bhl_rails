disjointed: up, Uropatagium; /, furcula; c, eercus. (Drawn by J. S.
Kingsley.) (From Packard's " Zoology," Henry Holt & Co., Publishers.)
Some are diurnal, as our common butterflies; others are noc-
turnal, as the bed-bug; some, crepuscular, as the moths. Some
are solitary; others gregarious, or social, as the ants and bees.

three well-marked regions — the head, thorax, and abdomen.
