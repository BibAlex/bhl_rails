Mosquitoes flourish alike in the heated moist regions of the tropics and
in the frigid regions of ice and snow. Many species have their haunts and

exclusively in brackish water. They are found even in arid regions far
from water, where it is probable they lay their eggs in the ground. So,

A very easy and successful way of getting rid of mosquitoes in a pond
which will sustain fish is to stock it with such fish as the " top-minnow,"

Dragon-flies also should be encouraged and protected, since their nymphs

upon the mosquitoes. In fact, if it were not for the dragon-flies, life in the
Hawaian Islands would be almost intolerable on account of the hordes of
mosquitoes. Pools and marshes should be drained, or, if the pool or mud-
