(Icrm, which is ciliated. The endoderm also forms the axes
of the tentacles. There is also a layer of endoderm between the
radial canals extending from the circular canal to the gastric
cavity. Between the endoderm and the ectoderm, which
covers the convex surface or ex-umbrella, is a much-thickcnied
jelly-like mass of the mesoglea, while between the endotlerm
and the ectoderm covering the sub-umbrella there is a thin
layer of mesoglea. The ectoderm, of course, covers the tenta-
cles, where it is well supplied with stinging cells. At the margin
the ectoderm of both the sub- and ex-umbrellas forms a narrow

fold or shelf, the velum, which hangs down when at rest, but
draws up like a diaphragm across the bottom of the umbrella
when the bell contracts. By the forcing out of the water the
animal is forced forward, and so locomotion is effected. Around
the outside of the velum is a row of tentacles, usually four or
some multiple of four in numljer.
Muscles of a longitudinal character control the tentacles,
while circular striped muscles surround the sub-umbrella and
velum, and, Ijy contracting the umbrella and velum, produce
locomotion.
