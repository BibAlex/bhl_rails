The genus Llama includes the llama, alpaca, huanaco, and vicunia.
They differ from the camel in their smaller size and the absence of the hump.
The llama was used m Peru as a beast of burden for centuries before the
Spanish Conquest, and is still the only trustworthy carrier in the higher
Andes. Its flesh is coarse antl unpalatable, and its hair is coarser and in-
ferior to that of the alpaca. It defends itself by "spitting," that is, forcibly
ejecting not only the saliva, but the contents of the stomach at any offender.
The discharge is injurious to man's eyes. The llama can also kick and
bite. The alpaca is a smaller variety, bred in Peru and Chile for its thick
growth of black to gray or yellowish woolly hair.

The deer family {Cer'vida;) is distinguished from all other ruminants by the
presence of true bony antlers in the male; the European reindeer and the
American caribou have antlers in both sexes. These antlers may be little
or much branched. They are never fused with the skull and are usually
shed annually. Each year the new ones are larger and provided with one
more tine. It takes the antlers from ten to sixteen weeks to grow to matur-
ity. During the greater portion of this time the males are weak and inof-
fensive. At this time the does are rearing the young (fawns). When the
new antlers are fully developed (about October) (Fig. 276) the males are
as savage as tigers.
The white-tailed Virginia deer (Odocoi'leus vir(/i>tia'nus) is our most
widely distributed deer. It weighs about 250 pounds, is light brown in
summer and reddish brown in winter, with the under parts of throat and tail
pure white. It crouches and carries its head low, and saves itself by clinging
