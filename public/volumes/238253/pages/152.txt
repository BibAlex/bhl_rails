Many kinds of flounders lie upon the left side upon the sea bottom.
The youns flounder is somewhat cylindric, has an eye on each side, and
swims vertically like other fishes. The eye moves over by successive stages
until both eyes arc upon the upper or right side (Fig. 177). The mouth
also becomes crooked and the under side of the fish becomes white. The
upper side is colored and its color may be changed to suit the surroundings.
" The blind flounder does not adapt its color to its surroundings."
The halibut sometimes attains a weight of 400 pounds and a length of
6 feet. It is found on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Sub-order Acanthop'teri. — The spiny-rayed fishes constitute
a large group, including the greater number of the marine fishes
and many fresh-water species. The sticklel)ack, ]iereh, nmllet,
mackerel, our river bass anti sea bass, and our common sunfish
belong here.
The perch is a carnivorous fish found both in fresh water and along the
seacoast and is widely distributed. These fishes spawn in winter, forming
nests in the gravel near the shore.

The bass and sunfish are common in our streams. The black bass is
found in clear running water from the St. Lawrence to Dakota and south to
Arkansas (Figs. 17S, 179). Its length is 1 to 2 feet and it weighs from 2 to
7 pounds. It varies in color, the adult being olive green. It is a great
game fish. The sunfishes have short compressed bodies. They are
carnivorous, gamy, and usually brightly colored.
The green sunfish (Lcpn'nn's ri/ancU'iis), common in streams east of the
Mississippi, makes a nest of gravel in the shallow water and deposits several
thousand eggs, which the male guards.
The seventy species of mackerel (Scom'bridft) are all marine. In early
summer great schools ajjpear on the shores from Greenland south to Cape
Hatteras. The young from one female number from 500,000 to 600,000.
