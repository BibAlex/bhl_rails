CLASSIFICATION OF AMPHIBIA
229
phibians of the tropical regions. They have from two hundred
to three hunch'ed vertebrae. There are no gills or gill-slits in the
adult stage. Their mode of locomotion is much like that of the
earthworm. It is produced by the peristaltic motion of the
skin, aided by the numerous ring-shaped constrictions. The
eyes are vestigial and concealed beneath the skin.
The only family is Coecili'idce, with some forty species. Some genera,
as Ichthyophis, have small scales embedded in the skin. Others, as the
Typhlonectes of Guiana and Venezuela, are scaleless. T. compressicauda
is 18 inches long and j inch in diameter. Its color is from an olive brown to
black, which is the general color of most species. Some, as Ichthyopkis, are
oviparous; others, as Dermophis, are viviparous.
Order III. Urode'la or Cauda'ta. — These are the tailed and
limbed amphibians. They have four limbs, as in the toads and
Fig. 187. — Siren {Si'ren lacerti'na). (Chapin and Rettgcr, Englehard &
Co., Publishers.)
frogs; or two, as in the Siren. The skin is smooth and slimy.
Locomotion is accomplished mostly by body motion, aided by
the weak limbs, in strong contrast with the limb-motion of the
frogs and toads. They are not very common as compared with
frogs and toads. Newts and salamanders are examples.
Siren'idae is a small family of two genera of one species each. The
"mud-eel" {Siren lacertina) (Fig. 187) of the southern United States is 2 or
3 feet long. Posterior limbs are wanting, and the weak anterior limbs have
four digits. The tail is long, compressed, and thin. There are three pairs
of gills, but they atrophy in the young and are redeveloped subsequently.'
The mud-eel is a harmless creature, burrowing in the mud of ponds aiid
ditches. Dorsally it is dark colored, but lighter ventrally. Sometimes
