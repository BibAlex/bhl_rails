dermal bonos, all fused into one bony carapace which is covered
by epidermal plates. The plastron consists of epidermal plates
underlaid with bony shields. The head, limbs, and tail may be
more or less withdrawn under the carapace for protection; in
some forms so completely that there is no part of the turtle
visible outside of the shell.
They have four short, strong, clawed, pentadactyle limbs, or,

ends."^ The pelvis is strong, consisting on each side of the
pubis, the ischium, and the ilium. These meet at the articular
surface of the hind limb. The vertel)r8e are few as compared
with those of the snake. Those of the neck fit into one another
with ball-and-socket-joint. There is no trace of a sternum or of
sternal riijs.
Digestive System. — The tongue is usually soft and wide and
not extensible. The eso]ihagus is covered with " conical pro-
jections pointing toward the stomach." There is no cecum.
