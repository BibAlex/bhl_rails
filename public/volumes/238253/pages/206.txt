LAND BIRDS

pearance, for think of the bol^ohnk, the magpie, the jay, the
grosbeak, the tanager, the cardinal, the oriole, and the modest
little wax-wing. Each brings to one's mind a different type of
beauty. The temperate zone contains the sweetest singers in all
the bird world. The great majority of this order live upon insect
food, wherein lies their greatest value. Others live on weed
seeds and waste grain, and, lastly, on fruit in its season.
The fly-catchers {T yran' nido') (Fig. 246) are found only in America,
being especially abundant in the tropics. They number over 350 species.

Of the thirty species that breed here, not more than a half dozen are
permanent residents of the temperate region. They feed on insects, mostly
injiu'ious ones, which they catch while on the wing.
The true larks (Alau'didce) are chiefly Old World birds, there being about
100 species in Europe, most notably the skylark. We have only about a
dozen of this family, the horned and shore larks. The " meadow-lark "
belongs not in this family, but with the blackbirds.
Of the crows and jays {Cor'vidxp) we have about twenty-five of the two
hundred species. They are migratory only to a certain extent, being
winter residents except in the North. They are omnivorous, ea,ting fruits,
seeds, insects, and, in some cases, the eggs and young of other birds. This
last habit is by far their worst one. They have unusual intelligence.
