BRANCH CCELENTERATA
The nerve ring surrounds the margin between the circular
muscles of the umbrella and those of the velum. At the bases
of two of the tentacles of each quadrant there are sense organs.
They probably aid the medusa in determining in what direction,
with regard to the vertical, it is swimming, that is, whether it is
moving up, down, or sidewise. In other medusse the simplest
of eyes, red pigment spots, which may or may not have a lens,
are found.
The food of the medusa consists of l)oth plants and animals.
It is very voracious and grows rapidly after leaving the colony.

Multiplication. — After a time either eggs or sperm cells
develop, and are set free in the water, where they unite with
those of some other medusa and develop into the tiny larval
form, which soon attaches itself and grows into a hydroid, to
bud and branch and produce again the medusse, thus repeating
the life-cycle and the reproduction by alternation of genera-
tions.
There are more than a thousand species of the class Hydrozoa. In
some forms (Fig. 15), as the Hy'dracHn'ia, there are several classes of
individuals — the nutritive, the defensive, and the reproductive — with
