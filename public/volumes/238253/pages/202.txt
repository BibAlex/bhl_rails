Order XIII. Psit'taci. — Parrots or paroquets are usually
highly coloretl, harsh-voiced tropical birds, with thick, stout
bills. The upper half of the bill extends down over the lower one.

about 500 species of these birds. They live on fruits and seeds.

in Florida and along the Gulf coast to Indian Territory."
Order XIV. Coc'cyges. — This is an Old World order of trop-
ical birds, "classified together in one miscellaneous group only
because they belong to no other order."
Kingfishers are a large family of about two hundred species, chiefly of
tropical birds, represented in the United States by three species. The
belted kingfisher (Fig. 243) is our common species, describofl by Apgar as
" a noisy, short-tailed, large, straight-billed, crested, blue-backed bird, with
white lower parts and a bluish band across the breast."
