described as belonging to them. It is evident that the sponge
possesses irritability and contractility. It has the instincts of
self-preservation and of the perpetuation of its species. No one
can correctly interpret the psychologic phenomena of any
animal until he has passed through the same psychic phenomena
as that animal, and then become a man with the memory of
these experiences and what they signified to that animal. Since
we cannot do that, we must be content to infer the significance
of certain biologic phenomena from comparison with our own
experiences.
Environment. — As has been said, sponges are greatly in-
fluenced as to their shape by th(^ objects to which they are at-

tached and by the depth and currents of the water. They are
much more nearly uniform in deeper waters. The plastic
sponge well illustrates the influence of gravity (geotropism)
upon an animal. It also shows rheotroyism}
Protective Resemblance. — Their protective resemblance is
exceedingly good. They look so much like the seaweed and
other aquatic vegetation that they are well concealed from
the animals which prey upon them, such as worms, crustaceans,
mollusks, and other marine invertebrates. Their tough, horny
texture and their silicious or calcareous spicules are also a
means of protection. Their characteristic odor, said to re-
semble garlic, makes them distasteful to fishes.
