of rolling up into a ball when surprised. Its protective resem-
blance is good. Its locomotion is by crawling or running.
Some of the marine Arthroatraca are parasitic on crabs and in
the mouths of fishes.
CLASS II. ARACH'NIDA
Arachnids are arthropods with the head and thorax generally
fused into a cephalothorax, bearing six pairs of appendages.
The first and second pairs are for biting. Then follow Jour
pairs of walking legs. There are no antennae, the eyes are simple,
and the abdomen is apodal.^
The a])domen varies much. It is
short in the spiders, long in the
scorpions, or is fused with the
thorax, forming a stout body in
the mites.
They are usually oviparous. How-
ever, some scorpions and some mites
are viviparous. They are generally
terrestrial, but some live in the
water. There is no well-marked
metamorphosis.
Order I. Scorpion'ida. — Scorpions
(Fig. 76) are arachnids with long
slender bodies ending in a poison
fang. The head and thorax are
fused and bear several pairs of
jointed appendages. The abdomen
consists of a broad anterior and a
narrower posterior portion. There
are several pairs of eyes.
Respiration is by means of four pairs of lung-sacs opening
on ventral side of abdomen from the third to sixth segments.
Food. — They are carnivorous, feeding upon spiders and in-
sects, which they seize with their pincers and sting to death.
Multiplication. — They are viviparous. The mother cares
for the young with great solicitude, carrying them about at-
tached to her body.
