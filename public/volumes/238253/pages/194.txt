The herons are variously called the bittern, the great blue heron, the
green heron, the great white egret, and the " squawk." Many have
ornamental crests and plumes. Some herons stand in waiting, while
others run rapidly and noisily through the water, depending on their
agility in capturing their prey. Some stalk slowly and silently along in
shallow water, the head carried in front in a line with the shoulders, and
the large eyes scrutinizing every object in the water. Herons and ibises
are gregarious, nesting and roosting in flocks, but feeding individually.
