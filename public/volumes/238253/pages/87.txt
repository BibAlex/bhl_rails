BRANCH ARTHROPODA
The head bears the compound eyc^s and simple eyes (when they
are present), one ])air of antenna', and three pairs of mouth
parts, which vary according to the character of their food.
Hence the mouth parts may be adapted for chewing, lapping,
sucking, or piercing — " all referable back to the chewing type.
These are, in turn, modified legs."^
The thorax has usually three well-mark<Ml segments — ])ro-
thorax, mesothorax, and metathorax — as in the grasshopper.
Each segment bears a pair of jointed ventral legs. The two
pairs of wings, when present, are outgrowths of the dorsal por-

tion of the meso- and metathorax. Som(>times th(^re is but
one ])air, and in a few cases none.
The abdominal segments vary in number and usually bear
no paired appendages except, sometimes, on the terminal seg-
ments.
Covering. — Over the greater portion of the surface of the body
the cuticle or external layer of the skin is made firm and horny
by a substance calletl chitin. This forms an exoskeleton for the
protection of the soft parts within, and, by its rough interior
surface, provides points of attachment for the numerous small
but strong muscles.
