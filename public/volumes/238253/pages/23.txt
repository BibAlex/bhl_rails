Symbiosis. — Examples of syml)iosiH arc found among them,
as that of the sponge and the crab. The sponge attached to the
crab is carried about by it and given better opportunity of ob-
taining food and oxygen, while the crab, in turn, is concealed
from its enemies by the sponge. In the fresh-water sponge, a
green alga sometimes grows, giving the green color to the mass.
Various small marine forms are found in the sponges, giving
good examples of commensalism. Sponges are never parasitic.
Fig. 7. — Spongers at work. The " sponge hook " is a three-toothed
curved hook attached to a pole, the length of which varies with the depth
of the water. The sponge-glass is a common water-pail with the bottom
knockf^i out and a pane of window glass put in its place. It is used for
seizing below the surface where the water is disturbed by ripples. (Cobb,
in Circular 535, U. S. F. C, 1902.)
Use. — They are of use as food for other animals, and their
skeletons form a very useful article of commerce.
The sponges of shallow water are obtained l)y men in boats,
with a dredge or a long-handled hook or rake (Fig. 7) ; those of
the deeper waters, by divers. They are then exposed to the
air for a time and then heaped up in water again in tanks
