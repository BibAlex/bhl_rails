is reduced. The corpus callo.suin, if ])resent, is rudimenatry.
Parameles possess u true allantoic pla(!enta. Many thousand
skins of the opossums are used yearly. The hair is used in
making hats and felt. The fur and leather of the kangaroo
are also used.
The opossum family (Didel'-phidce) consists of pendactylous, plantigrade
mursupiaLs. The pouch is present or absent according to the species. The
great toe is hirge and separable f'roni the others, making the foot prehensile.
The tail is long, prehensile, and usually covered by a scaly skin and a few
scattered hairs. There arc two distinct genera. The first has been divided
into several by some authors.
Fig. 263. â€” The female of Didel'phys dorsig'era, one of the South American
opossums, carrying its young upon its back. (After Nicholson.)
r.enus Didclphys comprises twenty-three species, most of which are
tropical, being found in Mexico, Central America, and Brazil, but never in
Australia. It is represented in the United States by the common opossum
{Diihl' phuA virgiiiid'tKi). Its hal)it of feigning death or "])laying 'possum "
when confronted by an enemy is well known. It is about the size of a
large cat. Its nose is pointed, its eyes and ears large. It is arboreal and
nocturnal. It cats anything from insects to small reptiles and birds, and
also devours nuiskmelons and certain mushrooms; indeed, it is almost
omnivorous. It does not hibernate. Its young are about i inch in length
and are carried in the pouch for about eight weeks. After this, in some
speci(>s, they are carried on the back (Fig. 263), their tails interlocking
with that of the mother.
Tasmanian marsupials (family Dasynr'idoe) are distinguished from the
American opossum by fewer incisor teeth, a rudimentary first digit on the
fore and hind feet, by the absence of a cecum, and by a non-prehensile tail.
