habitat. The burying beetles (Fig. 120) (Necroph'orus) pro-
vide food for their young by burying carrion, as a dead mouse or
bird. When it is covered over with earth the female lays her
eggs upon the carcass. They soon hatch and the larvae feed
upon the food thus provided for them.
The food of the adult Coleop'tera also varies much. Some,
as the ground beetles (Carah'tdce), are predaceous. Others, as
the carrion beetles, feed upon decaying animal matter, while

others, as the Colorado potato beetles, are voracious plant
feeders, making this order of much economic importance.
Other familiar examples are the apple-tree borers, the
wire-worms, fruit and grain weevils, and the white grubs of the
June beetles (Fig. 121).
The tiger beetles (Cicindel'idce) are usually of a beautiful metallic green
or bronze, bandccl or spotted with yellow, though some are black, while
those living in white sand are exactly the color of the sand. They are
the most active of all beetles, running and flying well. They may be
found on bright warm days on dusty roads or along the banks of streams.
