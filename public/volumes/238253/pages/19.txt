BRANCH PORIFERA
All animals except the Protozoans are multicellular and are
classed as Metazoa.
Differentiation. — In all we find, to a greater or less degree,
division of labor among the cells, or the differentiation into tissues
and organs for sj^ecial functions.
Reproduction. — True sexual rei)roduction is the characteristic
method among Metazoans.
Porifera. — These acjuatic, many-celled animals were formerly
considered as plants. Indeed, they look like seavveetls among
the rocks at the bottom of the sea. Most of the sponges are
marine, but there are a number of fresh-water forms.
Fresh-water sponges are widely distributed, and are attached
to weeds ^or submerged objects along the margins of clear
springs or ponds.
Sponges vary in color from a greenish hue to red, brown, or
flesh color. All of the soft parts, as well as the skin or covering,
is gone from the commercial sponges.
Their shape, as is seen in the sponges of commerce, is irregu-
lar even in the sam(^ species; it varies with the environment, in
order that the sponges may adapt themselves to the surface
to which they are attached or the depth and currents of the
water. Their size varies from a fraction of an inch to two or
three feet in diameter.
Structure. — The body of the Porifera consists of many cells
arranged in two layers, an inner, or endoderm, and an outer, or
ectoderm. There is a middle undifferentiated layer (mesoglea).
The simplest sponge is cylindric or vase shaped (Fig. 4),
while others, more complicated, consist of a system of branch-
ing tubes. At the free end of each is a small opening, the
oscidum, or exhalant orifice, while the walls of the cylinder are
perforated by exceedingly minute inhalant pores. The ecto-
derm consists of flattened cells, which are also found to extend
for a short tlistance inside the osculum, while the rest of the tube
