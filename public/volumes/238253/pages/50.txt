BRACHIOPODA
49
The shell is only partially filled by the body, and the valves are lined
by the mantle lobes, whose free edges are bristled. The mantle lobes
enclose a large mantle cavity. In the body is a spacious coelom, which is
extended into the mantle lobes. The coelom contains the digestive tract,
the liver, and the reproductive organs. The latter are chiefly in the
mantle lobes. The digestive tract, which is bent much as in the Polyzoa,
consists of gull(>t, stomach, and intestine. The mouth is surrounded by the
tentacled lophophore or " arms." The inner surface of the tentacles is
covered with cilia, which set up currents in the water and sweep minute
animals and algse into the mouth for food. The heart, usually present, lies

dorsal to the stomach, to which it is attached. The nervous system con-
sists of an esophageal ring. Sense organs are usually wanting in the
adult.
Important Biologic Facts. — For the first time, according to
the classification used, a closed system of blood-vessels and
red blood-corpuscles are found.
The digestive tract has been developed into gullet, stomach,
and intestine, and a liver also appears.
The Brachiopoda were formerly supposed to l)elong to branch
Mollusca. But the valves of the shell are dorsal and ventral,
not right and left, while the tentacled lophophore, the character
of the nephridia, and the modified trochos])here larva all tend
to show relationship with members of branch Molluscoida.
