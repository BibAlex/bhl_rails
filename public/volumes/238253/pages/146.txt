the pectoral fins Ijeing much expanded. The skin is roughened
by spines or prickles. Rays most generally live on the bottom of
the sea, feeding upon fishes,
moUusks, crabs, and other bot-
tom-frequenting animals.
To the order Sela'chii belong
the skates (Fig. 166), sting-rays,
and torpedoes or electric-rays.
The saw-fish ray also belongs
to this order. Its formidable,
sharp-toothed snout, several
feet in length, makes it a
dreaded enemy. It disables
its prey by dashing into a
school of fishes, striking right
and left. Then it eats its dis-
abled prey at leisure.

SUB-CLASS II. HOLOCEPH'ALI
This group is represented
on our Atlantic coast by the
Chimce'ra monstro'sa (Fig. 167).
The Holoceph'ali were formerly abundant, but are now repre-
sented by only a few genera. The skeleton is cartilaginous and
the skin is smooth. These are very peculiar looking fishes, as a
glance at Fig. 167 will show. The nostrils and mouth are ven-

form, but differ from them by the large head and small mouth.
"Fossil remains are found from the lower Jurassic rocks upward."
