HOLOTHUROIDEA

more worm-like in appearance. Some are so long and slender
that they are sometimes thought to be worms.
The size varies from | inch in one species found upon the
Massachusetts coast, to 3 feet, in another species found in
Monterey Bay, California.
The body wall is tough, leathery, muscular, and not so rigid
as in the starfish or sea-urchin, although minute calcareous
spicules are scattered throughout it.
The tube-feet may be in rows, or scattered, or entirely want-
ing, depending upon the species, of which several hundred are
recorded. The sea-cucumbers
move with their long axis parallel
to the ground. They creep along
with the help of the tentacles.
Protective Resemblance. —
Their colors, which are reddish
brown or yellowish, harmonize
so closely with those of their en-
vironment that their protective
resemblance is almost perfect.
As the animals rest on the bot-
tom of the sea with their feathery
tentacles spread out they closely
resemble the vegetation of the
sea bottom. A person may
stand within a foot of the sea-
cucumber and not see it.
The alimentary tube (Fig. 47)
is several times the length of
the animal, and the intestine is
coiled in a uniform manner.
The food of the holothurians consists of organic matter
obtained from the sand which they swallow, or of small animals
which they capture with their tentacles. They are nocturnal
in their feeding habits, resting quietly during the day on the
bottom of the sea or buried in the sand.
The respiratory system consists, probably, of the so-called
" respiratory trees," two hollow, much-branched organs open-
ing into the cloaca, which is periodically filled with water.
