snakes and crocodiles are dangerous to man.
Important Biologic Facts. — The embryonic membranes, the
amnion and the allantois, first appear in this class. Respiration
is by lungs. True nostrils appear. The heart is four cham-
bered in Crocodilia.

" I have considered the birds,
And I find their fife good,
And better, the better understood."
(MeDonald.)
In existing forms, birds are feathered chordates having no
teeth, but from jialeontology we learn that some of the fossil
birds (Figs. 209-212), as the Archwop'teryx (Fig. 212), of the
Jurassic Period, had teeth and a long vertebrated tail.
Birds have several characteristics in common with reptiles,
among which are the large eggs, the lack of a complete dia-
phragm, the quadrate l)one connecting the lower jaw with the
skull, and the single^ occipital condyle. It is believed that in the
early stages of their development birds floated in the air by
means of a patagium, or wing membrane, and that even "feath-
ers were used at first as a means of sailing down" after having
crawled up to some height by the use of claws on the "fingers,"
vestiges of which are yet shown by many birds, such as the
turkey, the vulture, certain ostriches, swans, thrushes, and
young gallinules, which have claws variously located on the
wing tips.
Covering. — The lower part of the legs is covered with hard,
reptile-like scales, or epidermal shields, for protection. The
beak and claws are also horny epidermal structures.
