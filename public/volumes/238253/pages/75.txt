100 BRANCH ARTHROPODA
Hermit Crabs (Fig. 73). — There are a number of species of
hermit craljs which are not true crabs, but are more hke the
lobster and crayfish. They have the habit of backing into
empty univalve shells which they carry about with them and
into which they may withdraw for protection. This hal)it has
resulted in a soft-skinned, reduced abdomen, with a spiral
twist and with no appendages except a pair of hooks for hold-
ing on to the inside of the shell. The abdomen is always hidden
in the shell. The head, thorax, and legs project when the
animal is active, but are withdrawn when danger approaches.

As it grows it discards its shell and hunts a larger one. Some
of these hermit crabs have a peculiar commensal life with cer-
tain sea-anemones (Fig. 73), which they carry about on their
shells. If the sea- anemone becomes detached the crab hunts
another and places it on its shell. The crab is protected from
its enemies by the stinging threads of the anemone, also by
its resemblance to the seaweed, while the anemone is assured
of a fresh food supply by being carried from place to place by
the crab.
Crabs are other examples of this order. The cephalothorax
