Hearing. — The " ears " consist of a pair of small tympanic
membranes, situated on the basal segment of the abdomen in
the locust and on the tibiae of the forelegs (Fig. 95, p. 123)
of the cricket and katy-did. Associated
with each tympanum is a vesicle filled
with liquid and an auditory ganglion, which
is connected by a nerve with one of the
thoracic ganglia.
Feeding. — All Orthoptera have biting
mouth parts, and bite off and chew their
food. Most of them are vegetable feeders,
l)ut the mantis is carnivorous. The locusts
or grasshoppers have at times wrought
great havoc with man's crops, as both
sacred and secular history tell us.
Leaping. — In the leaping Orthoptera the
posterior pair of legs is especially adapted
for this purpose. They are large and long,
and when walking the knee-joints are much
higher than the insect, thus giving leverage for their prodigious
leaps, in which they rival the fleas in their athletic records.
The metamorphosis is incomplete, the young (nymphs)
(Fig. 103) differing from the parents in size and absence of wings
(Fig. 104).

The cockroaches (Blat'tidoe) are nocturnal insects, found about the
pantries and water-jMpes of our dwellings, though in the North, according
to Conistock, our native species lives in woods and fields. One may often
find them hiding under bark, sticks, and stones. The jaws are strong and
toothed, and they are greedy little creatures, devouring anything they can
get, " eating book-bindings and bed-bugs with equal alacrity." The body
is flat and slippery and the legs are adapted for rapid running, enabling
