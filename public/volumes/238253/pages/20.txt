is lined with a single layer of peculiarly shaped columnar cells,
each possessing a llagelluni.
The skeleton is developed in the middle layer and may
consist of silicious or of calcareous spicules of a great variety of
form, sometimes they are anchor shaped,,
and again others are club shaped, spear
shaped, or cruciform. The so-called glass
sponges sometimes have beautiful silici-
ous skeletons. In other cases the skele-
ton consists simply of fine, flexible, inter-
woven fibers of tough, horny spongin.
It is the skeleton, denuded of the flesh,
or sarcode, that covers it in life, which
forms the commercial sponge. A few
sponges have no skeletons.
Nutrition. — There are no organs of
digestion, circulation, or respiration in
the sponge. The food consists of micro-
scopic plants or animals, or of minute
particles of organic matter floating in
the water. The food-laden water enters
through the inhalant pores and is carried
by the movement of the flagella through
the canals or paragastric cavities. The
food as well as oxygen is taken up l)y
the cells lining the canals and by the
ameboid cells. The waste is carried out
by the outgoing currents of water, which
empty through the osculum, or, if the
sponge is complex, the oscula.
Locomotion. — At first the larval sponge
is free swimming, by means of cilia.
It soon becomes fixed to some stone
or other object or animal, and assumes the fixed ways of its
ancestors.
Multiplication. — (1) Asexual, by external budding and the
consequent formation of a united colony, or ])y internal gem-
mules; (2) sexual, thus insuring the perpetuation of the species.
Sponges are hertnaphroditic, that is, both the male elements
