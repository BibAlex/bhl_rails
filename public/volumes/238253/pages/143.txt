BRANCH CHORDATA
The brain is of the vertebral type, but small, and occupies but
a small portion of the cranium. The cerebrum is comparatively
small. The cerebellum is sometimes large. The optic and ol-
factory lobes are conspicuous (Fig. 161). The medulla is also
present, all the parts being distinct and visil)le from above.
The brain sends off at least ten pairs of
nerves.
The Senses. — Of all the sense organs,
the most noticeable are those along the
lateral line. The lateral line on either
side of the fish from tail to head is
"marked by a groove in the scales which
opens to the exterior by numerous canals
through the scales." (Examine several
scales along the lateral line.) The func-
tion of the lateral line is possibly to as-
certain the water pressure at different
depths.
The skin and especially the lips are
the seat of the sense of touch.
The eye has several peculiarities. The
lens is very convex, owing to the slight re-
fraction from the light in passing from the
water into the cornea. The eye is short sighted, since light is
so absorbed by water as to render objects a short distance away
invisible. Lids are wanting or very poorly developed. Only

a few fishes have a nictitating membran(\ There are no tears.
Through disuse for generations the cave fishes have lost their
sight (Fig. 162).
