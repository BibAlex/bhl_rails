238 BRANCH CHORDATA
Reptiles always breathe by lungs. "The air is drawn into
the lungs of snakes, lizards, and crocodiles by the play of the
ribs."i
The nervous system is somewhat more highly developed than
in the amphibians. There is a middle and an inner ear. The
eye has an upper and a lower movable eyelid and also a nicti-
tating membrane (Fig. 196). True nostrils antl salivary glands
appear first among the reptiles.
Reptiles are oviparous, ovoviviparous, or viviparous. There
is no metamorphosis.
In ecdysis the skin may be cast in one piece, as in all snakes
save sea-snakes and in most lizards; in strips, as in some lizards;
in little pieces, as in the western horned toads; or in flakes, as in
the geckos. Some tortoises shed the whole outer layer of epi-
dermal shields periodically.
Gadow briefly defines Reptilia as "monocondylia with a scalv
skin."
Reptiles live longer than most warm-blooded animals. A
turtle in the Zoological Park, New York, says Ditmars, is esti-
mated to be over three hundred and fifty years old.
ORDER I. RHYNCHOCEPHALIA
Rhynchocephali is represented by Sphen'don punda'tum
(Hotte'ria) of New Zealand. It is a lizard-like, four-limbed,
pentadactyle, nocturnal, carnivorous reptile.
Its color is dark olive green, with small white or yellowish
specks on the sides. Its length is from 15 to 30 inches, while
fossil forms were sometimes 6 feet long. A row of spines ex-
tends along the back. Its means of defense are biting and
scratching. It burrows. It lays about ten hard-shelled white
eggs in the sand.
Gadow has "come to the conclusion that they are dull, not
companionable creatures." Their sound is a grunt or croak.
For an interesting description of this living fossil read Gadow,
"Amphibia and Reptiles," pp. 294-300. Look at the picture of
the skeleton and state the branch, class, and ordinal character-
istics you see.
