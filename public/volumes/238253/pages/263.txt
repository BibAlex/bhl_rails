392 THEORIES OF DEVELOPMENT
grees, it has been possible to demonstrate in man the existence
of several characters which show Mendelian inheritance.
Though most of the evidence has relation to abnormal or dis-
eased conditions, investigations are now being made concerning
pedigrees of normal characters. One of the most easily ob-
served is the natural color of the eye. "To what extent eye
color may be valuable as a criterion of race it is at present im-
possible to say, but if it is ever to become so, it will only be
after a searching Mendelian analysis has disclosed the factors
upon which the numerous varieties depend.
"A discussion of eye color suggests reflections of another
kind. It is difficult to believe that the markedly different states
of pigmentation which occur in the same species are not as-
sociated with deep-seated chemical differences influencing the
character and bent of the individual. May not these differences
in pigmentation be coupled with and so become in some measure
a guide to mental and temperamental characteristics?"^
