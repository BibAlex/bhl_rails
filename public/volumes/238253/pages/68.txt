CRUSTACEA

antennules are also provided with olfactory hairs. Many of
this order are marine. Some, however, live in brackish or in
fresh water. They live usually at the bottom of their aquatic
habitat.
Order III. Copep'oda. — As examples may be named para-
sitic fish lice and the fresh-water cyclops. Respiration takes
place over the entire body surface.
The Cyclops (Fig. 65) is a small,
white, shelless animal with elongated
segmented body. It has a rather large
eye in the center of its heatl.
Order IV. Cirripe'dia or Barnacles.
— These fixed, marine, shelled crusta-
ceans are very abundant along the
seacoast, the rocks being covered with
them in places. Their food consists
of small animals in the water. One
may see thousands of barnacles snap-
ping their food as the waves and tides
dash over them.
Some forms attach themselves to
crabs, moUusks (Fig. 52), or even to
whales, while others are true external
parasites, sucking the juices of the ani-
mals to which they are attached. The
parasitic forms are extremely degenerate.
Since they have no power of loco-
motion by which to escape their ene-
mies, the barnacles (Fig. 66) are pro-
tected by shells capable of " complete
closure." The body is flexed ventrally
and bears six pairs of cirri, which are used in straining small
organisms from the water and in carrying them to the mouth.
The mouth is surrounded by a pair of mandibles and two pairs
of maxillse. Barnacles are hermaphroditic, but cross-fertiliza-
tion may occur. They have a metamorphosis, having first a
nauplius and then a cypris stage, the latter developing into
the fixed adult (Fig. 67). This order furnishes a good illus-
tration of the principle that inactivity leads to degeneration.
