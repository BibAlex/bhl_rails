108 BRANCH ARTHROPODA
The crab spiders {Thomis'ida') are so-called because of their short broad
form and peculiar habit of walking sidewise or backward. " They spin
no webs, but lie in wait for their prey."i Some brightly colored species
conceal themselves in flowers. Their protective resemblance is so good
that insects visiting the flower often light within reach of the spider before
seeing it. They live about plants and fences and hibernate in winter under
stones and bark.
The jumping spiders {At'tidce) have stout bodies and short legs, bright
colors, and conspicuous eyes. They jump quickly sidewise or backward
for a long distance. They make no webs except those in which they hiber-
nate or lay their eggs.
The Running Spiders {Lycos' idee). — These are the familiar hairy dark-
colored spiders fountl under stones and logs. They depend upon their
speed for the capture of their prey and run very swiftly. They resemble
in appearance antl habits the so-called tarantulas of the Southwest, but are
smaller. The claws of their mandibles move horizontally. Their eyes are

of different sizes. Some of these spiders build tubular nests in the ground
and line them with silk. They sometimes conceal the entrance with leaves
and sticks. They often drag the egg-sac, a large gray ball, after them. In
genus Lj/co'sa the young (Fig. 79) climb upon their mother's back. The
female of another genus, Dolomc'des, carries the egg-sac " in her mandibles
until the young are ready to hatch, when she fastens the sac in a bush and
spins a web of irregular thread about it in which the young remain for a
time."
Order Acari'na. — These arachnids have stout bodies, there
being no apparent segments, the abdomen being united with the
cephalothorax. There is no heart nor l)lood-vessels. The res-
piration is performed by means of tracheae. They are generally
oviparous; some are viviparous. Many are parasitic (Fig. 80).
