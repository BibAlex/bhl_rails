G4 BRANCH ECHINODERMATA
intestines. The interradial anal opening (see Fig. 49) is
situated near tlie mouth.
Multiplication. — Crinoids muhiply by eggs, which pass
through complex changes before reaching the adult stage.
Habitat. — The living crinoids are deep sea animals with
the exception of two genera, which live at a less depth. Some
have been dredged from a depth of 11,100 feet. At this depth
the water pressure must he enormous.
Geologic Distribution.— Primitive types (the cystids and
blastoids) of this group are among the most ancient fossils.
True crinoids appeared before the close of the Cambrian
Period. They reached their culmination in the Carboniferous
Period. The crinoid fossils of this period are so numerous that
many beds of limestone are composed principally of them.
Burlington, Iowa, and Crawfordsville, Indiana, are noted for
their numerous and well-preserved fossil crinoids. Crinoids,
though formerly of such vast numl)ers, are now almost extinct.
Important Biologic Facts. — Echinoderms are radially sym-
metric, but embryology shows that they have developed from
the bilateral type. It is reasonable to regard those classes of
echinoderms as the more ancient which have the radial sym-
metry less completely developed.^
The locomotor-ambulacral system is found in no other
branch.
The echinoderms are a singularly isolated group, and we
look in vain among the known members, living and fossils, of
other branches for any really close allies.
