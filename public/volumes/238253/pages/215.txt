and caudal. The cervical or neck vertebrae are nearly always
seven (there are six in the manatee, and six, eight, or nine in
some of the sloths) . So the length of the neck depends upon the
length, not the number, of the vertebrae. The dorsal vertebrae
carry ribs and vary in number (from nine in Hypero'odon^ to

number, usually inversely, as the dorsal, their sum being rather
constant. The sacral vertebrae are fused together. They are
absent in Ceta'cea and Sire'nia, where there are no functional
hind limbs. The caudal vertebrae vary from three to fifty.
