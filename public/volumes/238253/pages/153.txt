BRANCH CHORDATA.
As they go north after spawning vast numbers are caught, whole fleets
being engaged in catching them. The mackerel is phosphorescent and the
light from these enormous schools is so great that they can be seined at
night. They are sold either fresh or salted. One of the largest and swift-
est of the mackerel tribe is the sword-fish, in which the upper jaw is de-
veloped into a long, bony, sword-like projection (see p. 205). This forms a
strong weapon, as the fish dashes into schools of fishes, cutting and slashing
and devouring them. It has been known to pierce the wooden and copper

The sticklebacks are found in both North America and Europe. They
derive their name from their formidable dorsal spines. They are small
marine or fresh-water fishes.
Sub-order Pharyngog'nathi includes the Wrasses and "flying-
fishes." The pectoral fins of flying-fishes (Fig. 180) are large,
and serve as parachutes when the fishes leap from the water.
Sub-order Plectog'nathi. — To this group ])elong the file-fishes,
which are often protected by plates or spines, and in shape are
very deep and thin. They are common from Cape Cod to Cuba.
Here also belong the trunk-fishes, which are enclosed in a
"box" made up of bony plates or scales, the tail, mouth, and fins
being movable.
The porcupine fishes are covered with sharp spines. The
Gymnodon'ta or "swell-fishes" can inflate their bodies into spheric
sacs. Their flesh is poisonous.
Sub-order Lophobran'chii. — These fishes are covered with
rings of large plates. They have club-shaped tufted gills, no
