on worms. The body has a chitinous covering. The cephalo-
thorax is arclied and bears the large compound eyes and two
simple eyes. The abdomen is almost hexagonal and ends in a
long caudal spine. On the ventral side of the cephalothorax
are six pairs of appendages, used for securing food and for
locomotion. The last pair, the operculum, is broad and leaf-
like and covers the five pairs of leaf-like branchial appendages
of the al^domen. These appendages are for resi:>iration. The
shape of the body, its hard covering, marginal spines, and its
color, which harmonizes with its environment, afford it ample
protection and defense.
There are several other orders, but these will suffice for our
purpose in the present work.
CLASS III. MYRIAPODA
The name indicates myriad footed, hence the common name,
thousand-legs. A myriapod is a worm-like tracheate arthropod
with a distinct head, a round or flattened
body composed of many similar segments,
to each of which is attached one or two pairs
of appendages. Myriapods have one pair
of mandibles, one pair of antennae, and
numerous ocelli. " A few species are injur-
ious to agriculture, while others are to be
classed among our friends."
Order I. Chilop'oda. — These are myria-
pods with the body flattened, with fifteen
to one hundred and s(»venty or more seg-
ments, each bearing a single pair of legs,
and with long, many jointed antennse (Fig.
83). The mouth parts are adapted for bit-
ing. The opening of the poison gland is
on the first pair of legs, which are used
with the mouth parts. This order includes
the centipedes, as Litho'bius, common under
stones. The bite of the true centipede
{Scolopen'dra) is fatal to insects and to
other small animals, their prey, and painful or even dangerous
to man.
