BRANCH CHORDATA
The spotted salamander (Ambhjs'toma puncla'tum) is our common species
in the Mississipjn Valley (Fig. 191). It is dark brown or blackish above,
marked with about thirty irregular yellow spots. It is found in wells and
cellars. It is oviparous.
One species {Amblys'toma tigri'nuin), which is found in Mexico and Cali-
fornia and even in New York and Minnesota, affords a striking example of
neoteny,^ or the " more or less complete retardation of development, or the
retention of partially larval conditions."- If the pond in which this axolotl,
or larva (Fig. 192), lives begins to dry up, its gills, fins, and tail shrink, and
finally disappear, the animal begins to breathe air, and gradually becomes a
terrestrial salamander.^ But if it is reared in deep water or forced by deep
walls to remain in aquatic conditions, the larval or aquatic gills and tail
are retained, even after sexual maturity has been reached. One would
think this was a forcible proof of the influence of environment on the
development of the individual, but the strangest part of it is that it is said

there have sometimes been found, side by side with these prolonged larval
individuals, others apparently of the same species which have completed
their metamorphosis.^
The newts or tritons all prefer moisture without heat. In the mating
season they take to the water, undergo various changes, and become
aquatic. After the breeding season is over, they become terrestrial, hiding
in cracks or in the sand. Some estivate in the hot dry season. They
hibernate usually in the ground, but sometimes in ponds. The food con-
sists of insects, centipedes, and snails. " They do not drink, but soak them-
selves in water. "•^
