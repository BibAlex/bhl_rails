258) vary in size, shape, and number, depending on the en-
vironmental habits. In all but the Cetacea the ends of the digits
are protected by horny epidermal coverings, variously termed
hoofs, nails, or claws. Rudiments of these are found in the
embryos of the Cetacea, thus suggesting their terrestrial origin.
The Digestive Organs. — One of the peculiarities of the
digestive organs in mammals is the development of the salivary
glands. The teeth are "heterodont" (Fig. 254) instead of
" homodont," as in some of the lower classes of chordates.

Some mammals have no teeth, at least not in the adult stage.
The teeth are attached to the premaxillary, maxillary, and den-
tary bones, and to no others. These heterodont teeth may be
classed as incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. The teeth
would indicate an omnivorous feeding habit, but this is not true
for all mammals. Some are omnivorous, some carnivorous, and
many herbivorous. The teeth often give a hint as to the feed-
ing habits, as well as proving an important element in classifica-
tion.
