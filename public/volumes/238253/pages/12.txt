PRINCIPLES OF
ECONOMIC ZOOLOGY
BRANCH PROTOZOA
The animals of this branch are one celled and microscopic,
or very small. These cells may unite, but as the union is not
organic, it is said to form a colony, and not an indivitlual animal
as is the case in the higher forms. A colony may consist of a
few cells, as in Gonium, or of many cells, as in Volvox.
Since protozoans are so minute and their soft protoplasmic
substance is so easily dried up, they are usually aquatic, but
some forms are parasitic, while others, as Amoe'ba terric'ola, are
terrestrial, but these live or remain active in moist places only.
Protozoans are most abundant in salt water, or in stagnant pools
of fresh water, and are found in almost all parts of the globe.
Since, l)y reason of their simplicity, protozoans are adapted
for living where other animals could not exist, they are supposed
to be the oldest or first animal life, and it is believed that they
existed in the Archaean time.
Numbers. â€” There are many thousands of species of these
protozoans, each species differing from all others in some
detail, yet all agreeing in their unicellular simj^licity. Only a
few of the typical forms can be mentioned.
CLASS I. RHIZOPODA
The lowest class, or Rhizop'oda, is represented by the Amoeba
(Fig. 1). It is an irregular mass of colorless, semifluid, or jelly-
like living protoplasm destitute of a cell wall. There is no dis-
