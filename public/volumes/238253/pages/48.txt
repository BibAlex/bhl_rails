GASTROTRICHA 47
The nervous system consists of a dorsal ganglion with which
are connected one or more eye-spots. There are peculiar tactile
organs which consist of " rod-like structures ti]:)po(l with deli-
cate sensory hairs." There are excretory and reproductive
organs.
They are dimorphic (of two forms). The sexes are separate.
The males are rarer, much smaller, and less highly developed
than the female. The female lays thin-shelled summer eggs
of two sizes — the larger developing into females, the smaller into
males — and thick-shelled winter eggs, which in the spring de-
velop into females.
The majority are free swimming, l^eing propelled by the
trochal disk, but the Bdelloida also have a looping movement
like that of the leech.
The rotifers may be dried up in the mud for several months,
and upon being brought into contact with water they revive, or,
some think, their contained eggs bring forth live animals.
When in the dry condition they may be carried long distances on
the feet of birds or by the wind.
CLASS II. DINOPHILEA
These, like the rotifers, are modified trochospheres. They are minute
and worm-Hke. They have a prostomium or head, a body of five to eight
segments, and a short tail. Both the body and the head are ciliated. The
Dinophilea are marine. In the aiTangement of the nephridia in pairs,
eorresponfling to the imjjerfect segments, and in the tendency to seg-
mentation, they resemble the Anniilata.
CLASS III. GASTROTRICHA
This class reseml)l('S the Rotifera, though the relationship is not close.
The class comprises a small number of minute fresh-water forms with
spindle-shaped bodies, flattened ventrally. The dorsal surface bears
several rows of cuticular [)rocesses, while the ventral surface has two rows
of cilia.
