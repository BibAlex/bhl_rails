102 BRANCH ARTHROPODA
sometimes called " swimmino; crabs " because they have the
last pair of thoracic l(^j>;s flattened and paddle-like, adapted
for swinmiing sideways cjuite rapidly. They have large sharp
lateral spines. The strong chelipeds are adapted for cutting.
Each of the other thoracic appendages ends in a point with no
forceps.
The little "fiddler-crab" lives in salt marshes along the Atlantic coast.
The male has one \n^ ami one little cheliped, which he brandishes grotesquely
when disturbed.
The spider crab (Macrochei'ra) of Japan sometimes measures from 12 to
16 feet from tij) to tip of legs, but the body is only a few inches — about a
foot — in width, making them very peculiar creatures. At a little distance
they look like immense sprawling spiders.
The little oyster crab, found so often in our dish of oysters, does
no harm to the body of the oyster, but its life within the shell insures its
food being brought to it by the currents of water made by the oyster to
bring its own food. This is a case of commensalism' where there is a decided
advantage to one animal and none, so far as known, to the other, yet the
intruder does no harm.
Order III. Arthros'traca comprises both marine and fresh-
water forms. The first thoracic segment, and sometimes the

second, is fused with the head and bears maxillipeds. The eyes
are usually sessile. Gammarus (Fig. 75) is a fresh-water form.
The Pill-bug. — If one searches under old boards or logs he
will find a small gray or brownish fourteen-foot ed crustacean,
truly terrestrial, with depressed body and with gills on the ab-
dominal appendages. It is called " pill-bug " from its habit
