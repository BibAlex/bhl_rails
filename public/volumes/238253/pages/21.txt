(sperm cells) and the female elements or eggs (ova) are con-
tained in the same individual (Fig. 5). It is from the union
of a sperm cell with an ovum that the new individual sponge
is developed. The sperm cells and the ova rarely mature at
the same time in the same individual. Hence, the ova in the
canals of one sponge are fertilized by the spermatozoa of an-
other sponge, which are carried to them by the afferent currents
of water in the canals, thus insuring cross-fertilization. The
eggs are retained in the canals until the blastula stage of their

development is reached, then they are set free and pass
out at the exhalant opening or osculum. The fresh-water
sponges (spongilla) bear small, seed-like bodies called gemmules
toward the approach of winter. The parent sponge dies, the
gemmules remain dormant until the next spring, when the rising
temperature calls them to renewed life. They grow into
mature spongilla, bear other gemmules, and thus the life-
history of their race is repeated.
