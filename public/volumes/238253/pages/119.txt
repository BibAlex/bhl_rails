The Wings. — As the ordinal name indicates, these insects
have two membranous wings. No fly has more than two
wings and only a few are wingless. They have, however,
vestiges of a second pair, calletl halte'res or balancers, ending in
short knobs. They are used in directing the flight and are be-
lieved by some to be auditory organs.
Family Mus'cidae. — The common house-fly {Mus'ca donies'tica) is too well
known for our fonifort. It hibernates. One will recall having seen flies
about the house during the winter. They breed about stables in the sum-

mer. The eggs, numbering about one hundrctl, hatch in about twenty-
four hours. The soft, white, cylindric, footless larva is called a maggot.
It feeds and grows for about a week, molting twice, and then pupates
within the larval skin, or puparium, for another week. It then makes a
circular opening in the puparium and emerges as the adult fly, thus giving
time for a number of generations. In a sunmier the offspring of a single
fly may reach incredible numbers. It is now known that the principal in-
sect agent in the spread of tyi:)hoid fever is the common house-fly, and
great care should be taken to prevent its breeding. All human and hor.se
excreta should be kept in fly-tight vaults and si)rinkled with chlorid of
lime or quick lime at least once a week, unless wanted for fertilizing
purposes. All garbage cans and swill pails should be kept covered, and
