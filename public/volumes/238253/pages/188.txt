The skin of a \nrd is thin and the body is not uniformly
covered with feathers (Fig. 213). There are many bare spots,
as may be reacUly seen by turning l)ack the feathers on the neck

on a papilla of the derma. "^ A large wing feather, for example,
is made up of the central stalk and the expanded part, or vane.
The hollow portion of the stalk nearest the body is the quill,
and the remaining part, the rachis or shaft. The vane is com-

barbule interlock with those of the next and thus hold the parts
of the vane together. In down feathers the hooks are lacking.
