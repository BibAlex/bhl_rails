of plants. The sucking beak consists of the labium, which, to-
gether with the labial palpi, is modified into a jointed sheath.
This incloses the mandibles and maxillse, which are changed
into long, piercing stylets.^ The labrum or upper lip is small or
rudimentary. There are usually four wings. In the typical
Hemiptera, as exemplified in the sub-order Heterop'tera, the
character of the anterior wings is a distinguishing feature.
The basal portions of these wings are thickened and parch-
ment-like, while the terminal portions are membranous and
overlap when the wings are folded over the back. From the
character of these wings the order gets its name — hemi, half,

and pteron, a wing, i. e., the Hemip'tera or " half-winged "
insect. The second pair of wings are membranous and fold un-
der the fore wings when not in use. The electric-light bugs,
bed-bugs, water-bugs, and squash-bugs are familiar examples.
In the sub-order Homop'tera the anterior wings are not thick-
ened, but are of the same structure throughout, as in the cicada.
In the sub-order Parasi'ta are found wingless parasitic hemip-
tera which prey upon certain mammals, for example, the head
and body lice of man, dogs, cattle, hogs, sheep, mice, and
rabbits.
