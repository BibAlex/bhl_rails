waves, or the transporting, by the same means, of the debris
to which they are attached in later Hfe.
Symbiosis is exemplified by Hyd'ra vir'idis, or the green
Hydra, the color probably being due to the presence of small
green algce.
Another species found in Russia, Polypo'dium hydrifor'me,
of which little is known, is parasitic on sturgeon eggs.^
A Hydroid Colony (Fig. 11). — Suppose a hydra-like animal
to butl and branch until it looked like a tiny bushy shrub. This
will give you some idea of these plant-like hydroids. These
hydra-like animals, or polyps, are connected by a system of
tubes, the common stem or axis bearing many individual zooids.

Obelia (Figs. 12, 13) is a good representative of such colonies.
The axis is made up of a creeping horizontal portion and of
vertical axes. The short, alternate, lateral branches of these
axes bear zooids at their extremities, or, again branching, the
polyps or zooids are borne on the second set of branches. When
these zooids are immature, they are little, club-shaped enlarge-
ments. When mature, the polyps are surrounded proximally by
a little glassy, protective cup, the hydrotheca, and distally bear
about a score of tentacles. These are the nutritive zooids,
for division of labor is found here. The tentacle-bearing indi-
viduals procure the food, and since the tubes are all hollow
