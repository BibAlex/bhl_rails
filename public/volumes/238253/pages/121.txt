three long projections on the head. It may be distinguished also by the
way it alights. The Culexis "hump-backed" with the l)eak pointing down-
ward, while in the Anopheles the body and beak lie in the same plane. The
eggs of Culex are laid in a boat-shai:)ed mass, while the eggs of Anopheles
are laid " singly and at random," but run together, forming irregular groups
or strings. The larva of Culex hangs with the head down, so as to keep the
end of the respiratory tube, which is borne by the next to the last somite, in
contact with the air. The larval stage lasts about five or six days or longer
in unfavorable conditions. The larva of Anopheles has a very short rcspi-

ratory tube, and con.sequently lies in a horizontal position just under the
surface film in order to obtain air. (This explains how it is that kerosene
oil " poured upon the troubled waters " d^'stroys the larva?. They are
simply drowned or suffocated as the surface film of oil excludes the air.)
The larval stage lasts from twelve to fourteen days.
The mosquito larva, after growing several days and molting twice, changes
into a club-shaped pupa (Fig. 126), the head and thorax being greatly en-
larged, while the abdomen is slender. At the caudal end is a i)air of leaf-
like locomotor or swimming appendages. It takes no food, and when un-
disturbed it floats upon the water, but when disturbed it is active, thus difTer-
