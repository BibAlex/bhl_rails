above which is the conical htj-postome, at the apex of which is the
mouth. The muscular fdx'rs of the ectoderm extend lengthwise,
while those of the endoderm extend around the body.' If
disturbed, the Hydras protect themselves l)y withdrawing into
a tiny sphere, while the tentacles contract until they look like
so many small buds. The endoderm has flagellate cells lining
the gastro vascular cavity.
