nate enough to escape being eaten by birds finds a place for a nest,
or is taken possession of by workers, and a new colony is founded.
The males and females lose or divest themselves of their wings.
Termites usually feed upon rotten wood, but some species
attack soft plants and live wood, or even cloth, paper, and leather.
In Africa these insects sometimes build pyramidal nests twenty

iron."^ Many species of insects have been found living a com-
mensal life with termites, " a sort of insect economy termed
termitophily."
ORDER VI. ORTHOP'TERA
This order comprises some of our most familiar insects, as
the cockroaches, mantids, leaf-insects, walking sticks, short-
horned grasshoppers (locusts), long-horned grasshoppers, and
crickets.
The Orthoptera usually have two pairs of wings. The
anterior wings are thicker and overlap or cover the posterior
wings when the insect is at rest. The walking-stick is wingless.
