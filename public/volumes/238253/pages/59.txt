60 BRANCH ECHINODERMATA
The nervous system is upon the same plan as that of the
starfish.
Multiplication. — The eggs are laid in the water and fertilized
by the tadpole-like sperm cells. Some forms have a marsu-
pium, or brood-pouch, in which the eggs are hatched.
Development. — After fertilization, segmentation of the egg
takes place until the bilaterally symmetric young " pluteus,"
which is very unlike the adult, appears. It is free swimming
and lives on minute organisms it can procure in the water. As
it develops it takes on the radiate or pentameral plan of its
branch. The '' sand dollars " so common on both the Pacific
and the Atlantic coasts are flat sea-urchins with short spines.
Geologic Distribution. — A primitive type of sea-urchin ap-
peared in the Ordovician period.'
CLASS IV. HOLOTHUROIDEA
Holothurians are free, and a close examination reveals the
pentameral plan of the branch, although they are more or less
bilaterally symmetric.

The shape (Fig. 46) is much like that of the garden cucumber
in our common varieties, but some are long and slender and
