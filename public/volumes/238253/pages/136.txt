CYCLOSTOMATA 195
Locomotion. — The Amphioxus has a median dorsal fin which
extends over the tail both dorsally and ventrally. The tail,
that portion of the body posterior to the alimentary tube and
filled with muscle, is the chief organ of locomotion. It is noc-
turnal, swimming about at night, but quickly returns to its
burrow if disturljed. It can burrow in the sand with either head
or tail.
Nervous System. — A simple dorsal nerve lies above the noto-
chord. It does not reach entirely to the front of the body. Its
anterior tip is called the cerebral vesicle, in which there is an
eye-spot. There is also possibly an olfactory organ consisting
of a simple pit reaching from the skin down into the anterior
tip of the nerve cord.
SUB-PHYLUM IV. CRANIA'TA OR VERTEBRA'TA
These are chordates having a brain or skull. The group
includes fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
The body is usually elongated and more or less cylindric.
The mouth is situated anteriorly, Ventrally and near it, ex-
cept in Cyclostom'ata, are the paired nostrils. Situated in
the head there are also a pair of eyes and a pair of ears,
though the ears are not always external. Gill-slits are
never more than seven in number, and partially or alto-
gether disappear in the adult air-breathing forms. There
are one or two pairs of jointed limbs, but in some cases they
are rudimentary or wanting.
CLASS L CY'CLOSTOM'ATA
The animals of this class inhabit both fresh and salt water.
They have no lower jaw. The mouth is suctorial, the skull
cartilaginous, the notochord persistent, and the teeth horny.
The neural arches are rudimentary. There are no limbs or
scales and no paired fins; but unpaired dorsal and caudal
ones are present. The class includes the lampreys (Fig.
157) or "lamprey-eels" and the hag-fishes. The skin is
