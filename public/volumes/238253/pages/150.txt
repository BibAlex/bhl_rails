The spiral valve is present. The double air-bladder aids in

The gar-pike (Fig. 172) has a cylindric body covered by
rhomboid, bony scales, which are coated with enamel. The
snout is long and bony and armed with sharp teeth. This fish
is voracious. There are three species found in the fresh water of
North and Central America, including Cuba. They are from
5 to 10 feet in length.

The three foregoing orders are often spoken of as Ganoids.
Though now insignificant, they were abundant in the Paleozoic
and Mesozoic Epochs.
Order IV. Teleos'tei. — The skeleton is well ossified. The tail
is usually homocercal. There is no spiral valve save in one
genus. The scales are cycloid or ctenoid (Figs. 173, 174), or,
in rare instances, the body is naked. The operculum is always
