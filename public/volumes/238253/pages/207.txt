The orango and black Baltimore oriole (Fig. 247), one of the most beauti-
ful, as well as useful, of our summer birds, destroys many tent eaterpillars
and other hairy larvie which few birds will eat. If one has ever known
his rich, clear w histle, one can never forget it or fail to recognize it when the
bird arrives about the first week of May. The delicate hanging nest,
which the female weaves of grass and hair and strings, is a marvelous ac-
complishment. It is suspended far out near the end of a small flexible
twig, where cats and boys cannot come. The elm is a favorite nesting tree.

Grackles or blackbirds are common summer residents. They are said
to have the same bad habit as the jays and crows, of eating the eggs and
young of other birds, though they eat also many injurious insects.
The cowbird lays its eggs in the nests of other birds. It should be killed
and its eggs destroyed.
The largest family {Fringill'idri') of birds (about .500 species), containing
the finches, sparrows, and grosbeaks, is represented everywhere except in
the Australian region. They are chiefly seed-eating (Fig. 24S) and so are
less migratory than insect-eating birfls. The sjiarrows are plain-inhabiting
and are protectively colored, while the more arboreal grosbeaks and
finches are rather brilliant.
