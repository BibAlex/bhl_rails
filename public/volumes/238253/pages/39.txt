BRANCH PLATYHELMINTHES
Platyhelmin'thes, or Flat Worms, have three germ layers,
the ectoderm, the ineHoderm, and the endoderm. They are
flattened dorsoventrally and are bilaterally symmetric. They
have no skeleton, no circulatory system, and no ccelom or body
cavity. They have an anterior and a posterior end, but rarely a
distinct head.
The nervous system is composed of superesophageal ganglia
and lateral nerve-trunks.
The excretory system consists of water-vascular tubes.
There is no anal opening.
Development is sometimes with and sometimes without a
metamorphosis.
Habitat. — Some, as the liver-fluke and the tapeworm, are
parasitic; others, as Planaria, live in fresh water. Some live
in moist places or in the mud at the bottom of ponds and
streams; while others, as Leptoplana, are marine.
Size. — The jmrasitic forms are sometimes 30 or 40 feet in
length, while the free forms are but 2 or 3 inches in length.
These are often found under stones, and are exceedingly deli-
cate.
Protective resemblance is very great in some species, while a
few are nearly transparent.
CLASS I. TURBELLARIA
The class Turbella'ria consists principally of non-parasitic
forms which are ciliated externally. There is usually a diges-
tive cavity. The prevailing shape is leaf-form, like that of
Plana'ria. Some marine forms, however, are shaped like " a
thin ribbon with puckered edges," others may be thickened and
band-like, as in the land planarians, while others approach the
shape of a cylinder. Locomotion is performed by the fine
vibratile cilia which cover the surface. The ectoderm contains
sensory and gland-cells.
