of a long muzzle.
The pipe-fish resembles the seaweed and has the power of
changing color to suit its environment. It feeds upon small
Crustacea and mollusca. It is found on both European and
American shores.

The sea-horse (Fig. 181) has the muzzle at nearly a right

and thus avoids being transported, unless perchance the seaweed
is floating, when the fish is carried far away from its birthplace.
It resembles the seaweeds among which it lives — an Austra-
lian species having reddish streaming filaments resembling
plants.

and river trout, the white fish, catfish, the black, white, and
rock bass, and the ])erches are important fresh-water fishes,
