bathes the tissues, then goes into the larger median ventral
sinus below the thorax and abdomen, from which it is conducted
to the gills. After being conveyed to the gill filaments, where
it is aerated, it is returned to the heart through the pericardial
sinus. The blood enters the heart, or dorsal vessel, through
three pairs of openings, one on each side, a pair on the top, and
another pair below. Valves prevent the blood from returning
through these openings.

Respiration. — The plume-like gills are attached to the
basal joints of the legs. They are situated in partially
closed chambers between the body wall and the carapace.
The water is drawn in and out by the " gill-bailers," parts of
the second maxillse, in their vibration back and forth. In
passing over the gills the water is separated from the lilood by
an extremely thin membrane. Through this meml)rane the
carbon dioxid is thrown off and oxygen taken into the l)lood.
Nervous System. — Several ganglia unite to form the supra-
