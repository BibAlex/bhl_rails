BRANCH CHORDATA
chord is a smooth, elastic rod typically developed from the endo-
derm, extending along the median line between the alimentary
tube and the central nervous system. It is encased in a tough
sheath or membrane and "forms an elastic supporting structure."

In the higher forms the notochord is replaced by a segmented
cartilaginous or bony vertebral column.
These three characteristics may not be easily recognized by
the beginner as he looks at the worm-like Bal'anoglos'sus, the

sac-like sea-squirt, or the small fish-like or worm-like Am'phiox'us
or Lance'let, but, passing by these low forms to the fishes, frogs,
reptiles, ])irds, and mammals, one readily finds that the body has
two cavities instead of one, as in the invertebrates.
