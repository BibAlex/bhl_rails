BRANCH CHORDATA
The strange development or change of the flounder from a sym-
metric to a "flat" fish demonstrates the principle that special
habits of life result in special modifications of structure which
fit the animal for those habits.
The lung-fishes (Dipnoi) show many advancements toward
the air-breathing conditions, such as the swim-bladder used as
a lung and the partly separated auricle, and the flipper with a
central axis rather than a fin, so that zoologists are led to be-
lieve that they may represent the division of fishes from which
the amphibians sprang.
