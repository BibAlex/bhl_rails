ORTHOPTERA 139
rubbing together the specially modified wing covers. These grasshoppers
abound in our meadows everywhere. If you would know how perfect is
their protective resemblance, try to find one which you have seen on the
wing, after it has alighted. Some species found in caves are wingless,
colorless, and blind. Their antennae and hind legs are developed to a great
length.
The katy-dids, of which there are several genera, are rather large, usually
green insects. They live upon trees and shrubs, feeding upon foliage and
tender branches, though they sometimes eat animal food. Only the males
tell us " Katy did " or " she didn't." They usually " sing " at night from
July or August until frost. They are not gregarious. Their thin, finely
veined wings are almost indistinguishable in the foliage.
Closely allied to the katy-dids, but looking more like crickets, are the
wingless grasshoppers, the cricket-like grasshoppers, and shield-backed

grasshoppers. They are dull colored and live under stones and rubbish
or loose soil.
The crickets, of which there are few species, have the wing covers flat
and overlapping'above, and bent sharply down at the edge of the body like
a box cover. The antennae are long and the ovipositor is spear shaped.
They include the mole crickets, true crickets, and tree crickets.
Mole crickets (Fig. 109) are fitted for a burrowing life. The front tibite
are broadened and shaped somewhat like the feet of a mole. They feed
upon the tender roots of plants, and sometimes injure potatoes (Fig. 110).
The true crickets, our familiar black species, live in houses or fields.
They usually feed upon plants, but some are predaceous. The eggs, laid
in the fall, usually in the ground, hatch in summer. Only a few of the
old crickets survive the winter.
