HOW ABOUT HERBS
Butterfly Plants
Tanya ]ack5on
Did you notice that there were
more butterflies this summer
than in recent years past? I can
remember that, in Portsmouth
twenty years ago, 1 could count as
many as 200 IVlonarchs flitting
about the autumn asters and
meadow flowers when 1 went out
for a walk. Last year, I literally
counted on one hand the number
I saw I am overjoyed to see the
increased numbers this year.
There are, of course, reasons
for this Butterflies have had a
rough time of it, what with the
terrible freeze in Mexico that
killed millions of the IVlonarchs
that hung helpless in their winter
habitat trees and the other seri-
ous weather difficulties encoun-
tered in recent years as they've
migrated northward But we are
culprits as well, building highways
and houses, frequently mowing
and eliminating their food sup-
plies and making lawn where
there once were meadows.
Many states throughout the
country are now planting meadow
flowers on roadsides and we, as
individuals, can help as well.
As now is the time to think
about plants for next year, you
may want to think about stocking
a selection for customers who
want to grow "butterfly gardens "
There's a wonderful array of small
decorative shrubs and perennials
that appeal to butterflies. A But-
terfly Garden need not be a wild
meadow of milkweed.
At the Urban Forestry Center,
we have several shrubs, including
Clethra alnifolia. This especially at-
tracts Swallowtails. Planted just
outside the office door, its fra-
grance fills the air and attracts
people as well! Its white blossoms
are followed by seedheads that
remain throughout the winter and
the leaves turn brilliant yellow in
fall. Like the more common
Buddleia davidii, it's hardy only
through Zone 5. However, I am se-
riously searching for New jersey
tea {Ceanothus amerkanus). Hardy in
Zone 4, it's three to five feet tall
and flowers in spring, attracting
spring butterflies. Unfortunately,
Japanese beetles like it as well.
Last year I purchased a swamp
milk weed (Asc/epifls incarnarta "ice
Ballet') from Rolling Green Nurs-
ery. That has been such a suc-
cess! It grows quickly, makes a
spectacular show of white umbrella-
shaped blossoms enjoyed by
Monarchs and Viceroys. The vanilla-
scented flowers are followed by
green pods very similar to milk-
weed pods and the plant is hardy
to Zone 3 It's a wonderful native
plant and should be used so
much more!
There are other perennials that
attract butterflies. My favorites in-
clude ioe Pye weed [Eupatorium
spp.), purple coneflower [Echinacea),
mountain mint {Pycnanthemum),
Mexican sunflower (Tithonla rolundifo-
lia), and all the asters and yarrows.
Last year, my little neighbors
next door, Kathleena and Lauren
Meats, established and encour-
aged a row of common milkweed
plants along the fence that sepa-
rates the properties. You know,
they are rather lovely — tall and
green, now forming the unusually
shaped pods. And we had butter-
flies! More than we could count!
Why not establish a Butterfly
Garden at your business, thus en-
couraging customers to establish
one of their own? The butterflies
themselves will add beauty and
pleasure. And with a little encour-
agement, they will return year af-
ter year.
