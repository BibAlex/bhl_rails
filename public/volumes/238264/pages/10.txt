CGGA Tackles
Greenhouse Taxation
{Plugged \n, Issue 2, 1997)
After two years of debate and re-
search, the Connecticut Green-
house Growers' Association issued
in late )une voluntary guidelines
for assessing greenhouses and
their equipment for property taxes
in the states 169 towns. It's be-
lieved to be first such document
prepared by a state greenhouse
association the United States and
may form the basis for similar
moves in other states.
The guidelines took months of
research for CGGAs Legislative
Chairman Frank Hufner (Cedar Hill
Farm, Newtown), Executive Direc-
tor Bob Heffernan, Len Van Win-
gerden (Grower Direct, Somers)
and the University of Connec-
ticut's lohn Bartok.
CGGA also worked closely with
the Connecticut Tax Assessors As-
sociation, providing a tour for a
delegation of assessors on March
13 at Woodland Gardens in Man-
chester and, later, a three-hour
briefing for over 100 assessors at
their annual meeting on )une 3.
Connecticut's 169 towns are es-
sentially 169 fiefdoms, where each
local assessor decides on his own
how the town will assess green-
houses and their equipment.
There was no uniformity from town
to town.
Also, local assessors — lacking
other data — were referring to na-
tional guides such as Marsfiall and
Swift, where suggested values for
greenhouses were dramatically ex-
aggerated and out-of-line with the
Connecticut economy.
There were no laws in the Con-
necticut General Statutes govern-
ing the taxation of greenhouses
until 1991, when the Connecticut
Nurserymen's Association suc-
ceeded in pushing through the
legislature an exemption targeting
overwintering hoop houses.
Gradually, other farmers (dairy,
etc.) began putting up green-
houses for a variety of uses: stor-
ing equipment, calves, etc. That
drew the Connecticut Farm Bureau
into the issue. In December, 1995,
the group came to the CGGA and
proposed a bill for the 1996 legis-
lative session that would become
essentially a uniform greenhouse
taxation statute applying to all
towns.
The CGGA Board asked the
Farm Bureau not to introduce such
a bill, feeling that without badly
needed research and consultation,
the bill would do more damage
than good. A task force was
formed to investigate the issue,
but, unfortunately, because of
changes in Farm Bureau staff,
CGGA became the sole group in-
vestigating.
Early on, the Board had to de-
cide whether to shoot for legisla-
tion that would dictate how towns
assess greenhouses or for some
sort of voluntary guidelines devel-
oped with the state assessors' as-
sociation
CGGA opted for the voluntary
route, holding out for legislation
when and if the voluntary guide-
lines were deemed to have no im-
pact — perhaps two or three years
in the future
The final version of the guide-
lines went through ten drafts, hav-
ing been circulated to numerous
in-state growers who had experi-
ence in greenhouse construction
and to out-of-state greenhouse
construction companies. In every
case, the per square-foot figures
for new construction were much
lower than the figures being used
by assessors across the state.
CGGA is to be congratulated for
openly dealing with a volatile is-
sue, looking for solutions that
would be fair to a number of in-
terest groups.

PPA's Plant of the Year
The Perennial Plant Association
will be promoting purple cone-
flower {Echinacea Purpurea 'Magnus')
as its 1998 Plant of the Year.
Hardy to Zone 4, the cone-
flower's solitary daisy-like heads
on long (2-4 feet) sturdy stalks are
familiar in New England gardens
and the PPA's promotion of
'Magnus' should increase their
general popularity.
For information and promo-
tional materials, contact the PPA
at 3383 Schirtzinger Road, Hilliard,
OH 43026. The phone number is
614-771-8431; fax, 614-876-5238.
