1800s by a man named, of course, Eli Howes. New
cultivars, the result of controlled crosses, are making
their mark and will likely drive the industry in the fu-
ture, but native selections still dominate the scene
Propagation of plants is rather simple. Planting ma-
terial (cuttings) is obtained by mowing vines from a
well established planting of the cultivar wanted. Cut-
ting material is kept moist until spread, either by
hand or mechanically, on prepared bog sites, gener-
ally in May in New Hampshire. These loosely spread
cuttings are then pressed into the soil either with the
cleats of a small crawler or with a device that re-
sembles a disc harrow, except that the discs are
quite thick and blunt-surfaced. Once set, cuttings and
surface soil are kept moist with frequent, light over-
head irrigation. After a couple of weeks, roots will de-
velop on stem surfaces below ground and axillary
buds above ground will break and produce shoots.
Within a year or two, the entire surface of the bog
will be covered with new vines.
Many of those wild cranberry bogs 1 visited when
young have disappeared, lost to development and
gravel mining, but small pockets of wild cranberries
are still out there, waiting to be discovered. One
special wild cranberry 1 have taken a liking to in the
past several years is what 1 call the mountain cran-
berry, Waccinium oxycoccus, although it is perhaps more
accurately called the small or European cranberry. It
is more winter-hardy than the American cranberry
{V macrocarpon) and is relatively common at higher el-
evations in Coos County where 1 pick a few each fall.
Like the American cranberry, 1 find these sweet
enough to eat readily out-of-hand and the flavor is
just great The cranberry is, after all, one of the great
original tastes of America
