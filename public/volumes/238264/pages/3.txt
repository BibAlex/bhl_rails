w
f e liave a special name for the trees that come
from our farms — ^ArcticMist.™ When you order
ArcticMist, ' ^' you are not just buying a tree, but all
of the time, attention, and care — from seedling to
shipping — that goes into creating a safe, healthy, and
beautiful Christmas tree.
We plant from seed to achieve maximum quality
control. All ArcticMist^^^ trees are heavily needled and
have dense conical shapes. Their lovely blue color, rich
fragrance, and good needle retention make them ideal
Christmas trees. Fraser, balsam, white spruce, and pine
(white, scotch, and red) are available. In addition, we
are introducing fralsam, a fraser-balsam cross. Wreaths are
also available.
Since our famns are in New Hampshire and
Vermont, we harvest our trees later in the season than
many other growers. We also do everything we can to
minimize moisture loss after harvest and during shipping.
You can order the number of trees that is right for
you — from 25 to a trailer load. We can arrange shipping
or you may pick up the trees yourself We respect your
schedule and guarantee on time delivery. Our trees arrive
individually wrapped and ready for sale. All you need to
do is remove the wrappers and set the trees out — no
broken brandies, no last minute trimming.
