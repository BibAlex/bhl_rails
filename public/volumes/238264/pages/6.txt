FROM THE BOARD
Endowment Update
Peter van Berkum
I hope you are all familiar with the New Hampshire
Horticulture Endowment by now We had our intro-
ductory "Take off" at the New Hampshire Plant Growers'
Summer Meeting and this was met with enthusiasm.
We've been writing about it in the newsletter. Then, we
had our first real fund-raising event — The Phon-a-thon!!!
We're thrilled to say we were met with great re-
sponses. By the end of our two-day phon-a-thon, we'd
raised $60,000! Unbelievable — since our initial goal is
$100,000, we're better than half-way there!
The responses on the phones were very encouraging. ..a
lot of support, everybody pitching in. We no longer
have any doubt that we will reach our goal this year.
First, I'd like to thank the volunteers who sat in on
the phone: Richard Campos, Nancy Carlisle, Doug Cole,
Susan Englund, Dave Giurleo, Tammy Hathaway, Ann
Hilton, lohn Howes, Henry Huntington, Dennis Kathan,
IVlac McPhail, Scott Murray, Bob Rimol, Rick Simpson,
Bill Stockman, George Timm,
and Kirk Wyant.
The list of donors is
getting quite long. This is
something we are very proud
of — the amount of support
coming from our members,
as well as from other peo-
ple in the trade. The fol-
