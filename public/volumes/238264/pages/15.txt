THE GREEN THUMB
OF NORTH HAVERHILL-
a Peaceable Kingdom
The Green Thumb of North
Haverhill began in 1981,
when Priscilla Brown, dis-
satisfied with the selection
of plants offered at her employer's
floral shop in Woodsville, left to
begin growing plants herself. She
and her family — her husband Alden
and sons Clinton and Scott — put up
a 25'x44' double-poly quonset-style
house that fall "I really didn't know
if this would work out or not," but a
crop was ready for sale on Mother's
Day, 1982. "1 grew everything — gera-
niums, petunias...! overgrew — 1 had
a lot of things in cold frames"
People came, and, that fall, a sec-
ond house — a 14'x72' double poly —
was put up to the right of the first.
In 1985, a third house was put up
to the left and, later, a fourth was
put up behind it.
Today, a line of structures sits
parallel to the road Beside the
greenhouses is a 22'x24' garden
shop. Beside this (although slightly
further back| is a gazebo. Both of
these were put up maybe six years
ago. Beyond that is a 10'x44'
wooden lath house in three sec-
tions forming a crescent. The lath
house replaces an earlier one made
of telephone poles that collapsed
in a wind storm two years ago. Both
the gazebo and lath house are of
pressure-treated wood
Behind this line, the land slopes
downward (the gazebo and lath
house are built on fill) to Granny
Clark's Brook, then rises slightly to
woods and — eventually and more
steeply — to Black Mountain Five
acres were cut and stumped. A few
trees — maples in the open areas,
hemlocks and birch by the brook —
were left standing Two areas of
marsh were left as well and cattails
planted.
A lawn was created — by both
hydroseeding and hand-sowing.
This is not mown field, but
trimmed, green lawn and its unex-
pectedness contrasting with the
woods and marshes around it
makes it dramatic. Mass plantings —
potentilla, spirea, a hedge of high-
bush blueberry — are used around
trees and as backdrops for gar-
dens — perennial, shade, "vegetable,
cutting, and dried flower" — set into
the lawn.
■'I like the twisted, the gnarled,"
and an "ODDesy garden" highlights
unusual material — weeping pine,
weeping crab apple, Harry Lauder's
walking stick — plants not normally
found in North Haverhill gardens.
A garden of native plants is
planned, but many natives are al-
ready here. Steeplebush {Spirea
tomentosa) grows in the marshes and
along the stream "There's no reason
why this shouldn't be in people's gar-
dens," Priscilla says, and, alongside
the commercially available varieties
of spirea, it seems to fit in well.
Mountain ash (Pyrus amerkana] is
offered in the nursery display area,
but she wonders why striped maple
(Acer pensylvankum), a small tree
with conspicuously striped bark,
isn't. Another plant that grows along
the stream is the purple flowering
raspberry [Rubus odoratus). Its maple-
shaped leaves and rose-like blos-
soms add to the August landscape.
The wild and the commercial seem
to blend comfortably here in a
Peaceable Kingdom of plant life.
Water is everywhere — its sound
is an important element. "The
whole place is infested with
springs. An old man in his eighties
water-witched for us and found
three springs below the spot where
the gazebo was built. We dug and
found water just below the surface.
We've enclosed them with tile and
capped them. One is piped to the
house and another to the green-
houses and nursery; the third is a
reserve."
Two spring-fed ponds have been
created. The Trout Pond, a 125'x
200' body of water on one side of
the display area (the Browns' home
looks down onto it), is a major focal
point. There's a small beach of
sand on one end, but it's twelve
feet deep on the other; stairs lead
down from the lawn below the
house to a small deck where
people stand to feed the fish —
some very prosperous-looking
brook trout. Otter, beaver, and
mink sometimes take up resi-
dence — and are removed, but most
of the time, these trout definitely
lead the good life.
