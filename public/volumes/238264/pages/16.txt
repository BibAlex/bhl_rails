thusiastic help. Lillian Kimball has

years. Another woman, Karen

PEOPLE IN THE NORTH COUNTRY
often "wear many hats," and
Priscilla wears several. She whole-
sales to an outlet in Plymouth. She
sells dried arrangements made from
materials she grows and gathers
herself. After Columbus Day, she
shuts down, but reopens after
Thanksgiving, when, for four days a
week, she sells cut-your-own Christ-
mas trees from a neighbor's lot
across the street. The owners live
in Connecticut — they plant and
maintain the trees; The Green
Thumb sells them and gives the
owners a percentage of the money
made. Customers bring saws and
can cut any tree for $15.00; in the
shop, garlands and wreaths are
made and sold. The business
closes for the winter the week be-
fore Christmas
It should be said that the land-
scape — although the components
were there — didn't "just happen."
The nursery/greenhouse is one of
several interconnected family enter-
prises. Alden (who worked as a me-
chanic at the local |ohn Deere deal-
ership before beginning the land-
scaping side of things) and two
sons run a landscape installation
and maintenance business. Clinton
(who once planned to study ac-
counting at Northeastern), is a part-
ner and does design work and
oversees crews Scott has chosen
not to be a partner — he's foreman
on the commercial jobs; his busy
season is winter, when he grooms
for Loon Mountain and runs his
own snow removal business. They
have the equipment — tractors,
bucket loaders, a hydroseeder —
with which to do fairly large jobs.
Although the entire family genu-
inely loves the outdoors and "the
natural," they have unsentimentally
shaped this arcadian landscape.
Growth has always been intuitive —
one aspect leading into another The
Browns recently acquired the adjoin-
ing eleven acres — to be used for
bagged goods, equipment storage,
and parking. (Clinton admits "our traf-
fic flow is non-existent... it's some-
thing that needs to be worked on."|
That will be next year's project. ..along
with a natural garden, a fern garden,
a new drip watering system for 1000
mums...
'We had no idea what this would
turn into when we started," Priscilla
says. What it would turn into? It's
hard to tell— The Green Thumb of
North Haverhill seems to have just
begun. (BP)

Remember to Provide
Adequate Combustion Air
The cold weather is here and In order to
keep out the blasts of Old Man Winter, we
shut our windows and doors and drape plastic
over the fans and shutter openings. But waltl
Now that we're all snug and warm, we've cre-
ated another problem — your gas or oil furnace
Inside the greenhouse needs a steady flow of
combustion air. This air supply must come from
outside the greenhouse. In order to do this, you
must allow one square Inch of free area per
1000 BTUH of Input. For example. If you have a
Modlne PAE 125 gas unit, you would need to
create an opening of Il''xl2' to provide ad-
equate combustion air.
Only with the proper air supply will your
heater run at peak efficiency and return the
most heat from the fuel that you purchase.
