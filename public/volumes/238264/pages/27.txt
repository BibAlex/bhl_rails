Recertification Meeting
OCTOBER 29
On Wednesday, October 29, the New Hampshire
Plant Growers Association will sponsor its bien-
nial pesticide applicator recertification meeting,
at which five consecutive hours of presenta-
tions give participants five credits toward recertification.
The meeting will be held at The Inn at Amoskege Falls,
21 Front Street, Manchester. There will be three speakers in
the morning, two in the afternoon. Speakers include Robert
Kapinus, UniRoyal Chemical ("Uniroyal Crop Protection Prod-
ucts'); Bill Romp, Mycotech ("BotaniGard ES, a Myco Insecti-
cide"); Samuel Weils, Olympic ("A Triple Threat Program and
IPM").
Registration starts at 8:30. The first presentation is at
nine. Lunch is on-your-own; a restaurant is on the premises.
This meeting is free to members; there is a $35.00 fee for
non-members.
By now, members will have received a flier giving more
specific information; if there are still questions, call Robert
Demers at 603-625-8298.
This is an excellent opportunity to receive a block of
credits while learning about new pest-control products and
visiting with your colleagues. And, for members, it's free.
