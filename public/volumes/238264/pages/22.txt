target range of heights throughout the production
season. In the example crop, the growth curve was
scaled so that the pinch height on August 5 was b.75
inches, and the final target height at shipping on No-
vember 8 was between 16 and 19 inches.
If you have more than one shipping date or culti-
var, you will need to make several graphical track
curves. Each graph will apply to a group of plants
that has the same pinching and shipping date, culti-
var, and temperature and light control location in
your greenhouses.
person measure each time and measure the same
plants (as long as they continue to represent the av-
erage crop height) to keep your monitoring as consis-
tent as possible.
If sample plants are touched regularly during mea-
surement, they will elongate more slowly than the
rest of the crop, so make sure you are not inadvert-
ently adding an extra height control to your sample!
Use a yardstick to measure total plant height, in-
cluding the pot. We recommend making a crossbar
that slides over the yardstick. The crossbar can be
Step 2. Monitoring the crop.
Once or twice a week dur-
ing the production season,
measure plant height from
a sample of at least five
plants for each graph.
Make this regimen part of
the regular work plan so
that, for example, every
Monday and Thursday, an
employee measures
heights and plots them on
the graph. The sample
plants should be spread
out across the area the
crop occupies and should
represent the average crop
height. Have the same
