as critical pointe). Here it consists, in the neighbourhood of that
same point, in a double system of curves of hyperbolical shape,
as may be seen in the annexed figure, separated by two curves,
of which the equation is obtained by putting p = pTk- To the first
approximation the system of isobars is represented by the equation

Avhich represents hyperbolae, of which the one asymptote is :

The connodal line. In order to find the projection of the connodal
line on the x, y-surface we eliminate p — pxk between the equation
of the isobar and that of the border curve; we then find to the
first approximation
{x—XTk)^ '-{v—VTkY (1Ö)
The critical point of contact, the apex of this hyperbola, coin-
cides, like the plaitpoint, to the first approximation with the point

The border curve for a mixture x. If in the equation (8) we con-
sider X as constant and T, hence xjk and vjk as variable, and if
finally we make use of the equation of state of the mixture
(equation (13) I.e. p. 325) to express T in p and v, we obtain the
