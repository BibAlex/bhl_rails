by the dispersion of the singular tangents rMiew bitangents, of which
V are isohited. So for tliis case too the equation (5) hokls good if
we but extend 2'i\ to those higlier singularilics of which the point
is imaginary but the tangent is real.
Points of contact and tangents both real. Now j)oint ajid tangent
of both imaginary singularities coincide. So tlie two branches touch each
other. This may he an ordinary contact or a liigher ojie, as the
PuisEUX-developments of both singularities correspond in tlie tirst terms
(which are then real) ; the unequal terms are conjugate imaginarv.
If t and V denote order and class of each of the siiignlarities and
c a number which need not be known more closely, the numbers
D and 7' respectively of the coinciding points of intersection and
of the coinciding connnon tangents of both branches amount to
^ (6)
This ensues from a relation which always exists for two singular
branches touching each other between the numbers 7) and T, namely
T-D = (,?,* + 1) {^* -f 1) -- (X,* -4- 1) (X,* + 1).
wdiere ,^1* and {i* denote the inflectional indices, v.* and •/.* the
cuspidal indices of both singularities'). This relation was first deduced
by Stephen Smith (I.e., p. 167). If according to (4)^) we express
the indices in order and class of the singularities, we find
T -D-- ,; i; - t^ t^,
or, as in our case t^ =z t^ = t and i\ = r^ = r,
T — D— c' — t\
from which ensue the two equations (6).
If therefore we disperse both singularities in such a way that the
singular points and tangents begin to differ, this causes \Knnt and
tangent to become imaginary, whilst D new double points and T
new bitangents appear. If among these are D" isolated double points
and T" isolated bitangents, then
D" — t i- c' , j
r"^v -\-c'.\
which I shall prove more minutely in my dissertation.
By the dispersion of the singularities the numbers of the isolated
double points and bitangents have become d"-|- /-[-'' resp. t"-}-;--|-c'.
So the equation (5) gives
n + ^r + 2 (r" + + c') + i:' c, = k + x r 2 {Ö' i~ t + c) + r ^.
So before that dispersion
