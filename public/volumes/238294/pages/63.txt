shows the derivatives of the hm^'itnde rehitivelv to the corrections

are omitted to sa\'e room. I shall oidv ui\(^ hereafter their mean
\alnes for the ohserxations of each lind). (See table p. 435).
Nou' the (|iiestion arises >\hat wei.uhts must he assiuned to these
results and how thev w HI he hest cond)ined.
First it miisi he hoi-ne in mind that in HM)! Jauuarv the transits
A\ei'e ohserxed o\ei' 2 threads onlv and ni all the follo\x"in_^' ohser-
\alions oxer 7, e\ce|Â»t in \\\<) cases o\er (5 thi'eads. Tiierefore W3
liave assi<iiied the \\ei,uht Yj *** ^''^^ ^'I'^^f mentioned observations.
Secondlv we must pav attention to special uid'axom-able circum-
staives dui-inu' the observatiojis, and then we lind thai for that
of 1902 Jaji. 24 the star was onlv faintiv \ isiblc Ihrou^ii the
iia/\- atmosphere, and that for the lii-st obser\ation of 1 902 March 25
an uncei'taintv [u-evails about one of the level-readin^us. To these
observations also the xveiii'ht '/., was assigned 'j.
Finally we had to pay lieed to nnfavonral)le geometrical cojiditions
for some obser\ations, xvhich might highly increase the ijdiuence of
some reductioJi elements, ami also to special cases of uncertainty
in ojie of those elemejits. I liaxe already mentioned that on 1901
F'ebr. 25 the observation had been made \\ith very unt;n()ni'al)le
relatixc positions of the moon and the star. The values of the
])arallactic angle were for the moon ami the stai- 124 and 117
respectively, while iu the other cases the most unfavourable \-alne
was 10(S' and the greatest diUei-ence betxNcen the \alues foi' the
moon and the star amounted to o . We now see that owing to this
the derivative relati\ndy to the chronometer-correction is excejttionally
large, while also those relatixely to the latitude of the station and
to the moon's declination ha\-e the largest value heiv.
A special uncertainty on certain days can only be ex[)ecte(l
in the chronometer-correction. A measin-e for this uncertainly is
given 1\\ the interval between the observatio]i of the moon and
the nearest timc-detei-mination, and il appears that this intcrxal
for almost ail the obsei-vations lies between and 3 days, bui
for 1901 Febi-. 25 amounts to (5 and for 1901 Alaivli 3 to 12
da\s. Another liuie-delernnuation had slill been made on Febr. 2<S
