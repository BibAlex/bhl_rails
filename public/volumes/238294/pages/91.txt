with the liquid mixtures, foi- wliicli the hue (Ip represent-s the
molecular volumes.
The point b indicates the mol. vol. of the vapour saturated with
B and e the mol. vol. of the liquid saturated with B. aJxid is the
region of the phase-complexes L -\- G\ the nodal lines drawn in it
connect coexisting [)liases.
The mol. vols, of the vapoui-s coexisting with solid B lie on the
curve be, and the triangle bcf is the region for the phase-complexes
SB-]r G.
The coexisting phases lie in this case on lines traced from ƒ to
the curve be. The triangle bfe is the three-phase-triangle and there-
fore the region for Sb -\- L -\- G.
The line eh, which divides the space under def into two parts,
represents the mol. vols, of the liquids coexisting with solid B. For
smaller volumes this line runs to the left, because in normal cases
the solubilitj of B in A diminishes with decrease of volume.
The quadrangle efhl is the region of the phase-complexes Sn + />,
the coexisting phases are indicated by the small lines drawn in the
figure. Inside delui we have only one phase, viz. liquid, and above
ahe only gas.
The lines eb and eJi are two portions of a continuous curve with
an intermediate ])ortion, which will have two vertical tangents in
normal cases. It is easy to prove this with the aid of the theory
of VAN DEK Waals, and this can be done in a way analogous to
that, in which van dkk Waals *) has proved the existence of two
vertical tangents to the p.i'-cwvye. for solid-liijuid.
We start then from the dilferential ecpiatitm of /' when ,r and 7
vary. (Cout., II i)ag. J 04).
Let us denote the concejitration and the mol. vol. of the solid
phase by Xs and r., aiul that of the coexisting gas phase and liquid
phase by Xf and Vf, the equation is theji :
