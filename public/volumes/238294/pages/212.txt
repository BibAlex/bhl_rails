a. 5.208 gram uf tlie nitration product = 86.U milliniols. were heated
with the equivalent quantity, namely 78.5 c.c, of jz/a-ia sodium methoxide
for one hour in the boiling waterbath. After being poured into water, the liquid
was titrated back with 1.5 c.c. n acid; this after correction corresponds
with 0.2170 gram of meta compound or 4 2 7o-
b. 5.817 gram of the nitration product = 41.3 millimols were treated in
the same manner with the equivalent quantity, namely 79.7 cc. of «/i-gs
sodium methoxide. The liquid was titrated back with 1.55 c.c. n acid;
which after correction for the attacked meta compound (2.6 %) corresponds
with 0.2243 gram, or 3.9% meta comi»ound. The mean of the two determi-
nations is, therefore, 4,1 "/q.
hi this determination of the quantity of nicta com pound it has
been assumed (and such is very ju'obalily ilie case) thai I lie benzene
oi'tlioiiitrofhioride present in the nitration jn'oducl also j-eacts (pianti-
tatively with sodium methoxide.
By renewed treatment of the nitration pro<hict with concentrated
nitric acid in the maimer descril)ed, its solidifyinu point does not
perceptibly alter, for it was found to be at 18°. 8. This had already
been noticed by Dr. Beekman. Still, the t\vice nitrated product now
contains benzene dinitrotlnoride:
a. 1.0015 gram of twice nitrated product was left in contact for 5 minutes
at 15"^ with 8.45 cc. of nj^.c^^ sodium methoxide. The liquid was titrated
8 45
back with 3.9 cc. n acid. Therefore, alkali absorbed -^ — — 3.9 = 0.5 cc.
1.91
n alkali =0.093 gram dinitro compound, or 9.3 "/q.
h. 2.264 grams were treated in an analogous manner with 10.15 cc. of
M/i-yi sodium methocide. The liquid was titrated back with 4.25 cc. J^acid.
10.15
Alkali consumed, therefore — -— — 4.25 = 1.06 cc. corresponding with 0.197
gram, or 8-7 % dinitro compound. The mean of the two determinations is,
therefore, 9.0 ^o-
Now Ave have seen tliat by treating pure benzene p-nitrofhioride
with strong' nitric acid for one hour 'J.2"/„ undergo further nitration.
In the twice nitrated mixture there is present 97o of dinitro- and
47o of meta compound'), tiierefore 877„ of para; 1.27„ of thi;?
represents J"/„ of the whole. This quantity of V/^ must, therefore,
be deducted from the amount of benzene dinitrotlnoride found, in
order to obtain the (piaiitity which owes its existence solely to the
1) 9.0"/o dinitro — 6.4% raonomlro. By subsequent nitration, 100 parts of the
once-nitrated product increase to 100 + (9.0—6.4) or 102.6 parts wliicli contain
4.1 parts of meta, or 4";o.
