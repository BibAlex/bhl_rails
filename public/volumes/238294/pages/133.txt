Fi'oni colnmn C we cannot derive a regnlar conrse in this short
peiioil, so that for tlu>sc isothermals 1 ha\e ninl1ii)lied all the jires-
snres measnred with the aii- manometer by the coefticient J. 0018.
On .Inne 5, H and Ang. 21 points of the boi'dcr curxc have
been dctei-niiiuMl. These conld only be bronuht to liarnioni/,e with
those determined later with the hydrogen manometei' by niiilli|»lying
the pre.ssni'es b\ coefficients which are combined in the following
table together ^vitll that afore-mentioned. Hence this shows the course
of the variation during that periofl.
If we compare these tignres with the values for the nornjal volnme
before and after the measurements, it ap|>ears that almost the entire
variation has taken place during this last period. From .May '01 to
