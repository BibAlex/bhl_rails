From Ihis iiiti'atiou of hciizeiie fluoride it is also shown iu the plainest
manner that the intluence of the lluorine atom oJi the [losition of
the nitro group is quite diiferent from that of other halogens
which in this respeet behave very similarly.

Chemistry. — ''Description of an appavidns for Tegidating the
pre^ssure when (listiliijtg under reduced pre.^i<ure.''' By Jan
RuTTEN. (Communicated by Prof. S. HooGEWKKFt).
(Communicated in the meeting of 1^'ebiuary 27, 1904),
When distilling under reduced [)ressure it is always of importance
to kee[) this constant during the distillation : moreover, the pressure
during the operation must frequentl}' be a delinite one. This is, for
instance, the case in the testing of niiiieral oils, where it is generallv
required that a definite quantity shall distill over at a delinite [)ressure,
which is in general considerably less than thai of the atmosphere,
and at a deiinite temperature.
As it is not possible to keep the pressure sufticiently constant by
the admission of air, the quantity of which is regulated by a screw-
