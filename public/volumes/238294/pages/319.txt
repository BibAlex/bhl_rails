becomes then identical with the denominator of the fraction from (5).
In the denominator we get a correction for tlie part of the cyhndre
y, Avhich falls within more than one distance sphere, or as we maj
also say, for the part of a surface .4, which is found within more
than one distance sphere, if we define this surface ^4 bv the coniH-
tion, tliat it is found e^ervwhere at a distance .y from tlie outer
surface. We shall call tliis surface ^4 henceforth "surface of imi)act",
because the force wliich in a collision acts on the centres of the
molecules, acts in this surtace. The determiuMtion of the numerical
value of the further coefïicients seems an exceedingly elaborat(M\(»ik.
at least Boltzmann amiounced already in the Lorentz volume of tlie
Arch. Neerl. that he wouhl have this calculation carried out for ihe
next coeflicient, but this calculation has not yet 1)een pubUslied. It
seems, however not doubtful to me. that also the iiuuierical value
must be the same as the value found in other ways. At all events
the flnal form becomes also by this method

Now it is not dithcult to show that the only remaining method
for deriving the equation of state, which led to the correction ^^'„2,
must lead to exactly the same equation as (9), when its principles
are consistently applied. As is known, this method assumes, that
the pressure is to be integrated not only oxer the volume i\ Init
also over half of that of the distance spheres: />, because a molecule
whose centre has got on a distance sphere, is sul)jected to exactly
the same force as when it has got on the surface of impact (the
volume enclosed l»y the surtace of iuipact may be put = r). The
volume of the distance spheres, however, is really smaller than b,
because some distance spheres coincide, and we get therefore ^) :

Now VAN DKK Waals Jr. (loc. cit.) has already pointed out. that
it is tacitly assumed here, that the surface of the distance sphere
which is found within another distance sphere ex[>eriences a pressure
= 0, and that therefore, for the sake of consequence, also the parts of
the surface of impact falling within distance spheres, must he supposed
