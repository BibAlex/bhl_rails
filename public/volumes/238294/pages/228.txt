This ridge — the liquid ridge — carries the liquid branch of the
coiinodal of the liquid vapour plait ; the isotherms run o^•er the
ridge from the vapour to the liquid side and from higher to lower
entropy (1. c. PL I, fig. 1.). In the vicinity of the critical temperature
the ridge becomes broader and smoothes down into the double
convex surface (1. c. PI. I, fig. 3) which further forward is everywhere
double convex. For lower reduced temperatures the ridge passes
nearly into an ij e plane. The projection of the ridge on this plane
is a curve along which the inclination {tang-'^ =: absolute temperature
T) decreases towards negative values of the entropy (see fig. 2). The
projection of a cross section of the ridge shows the rapid change
of the inclination in the z; f plane {tang-'^ = pressure ^J) for a small
change of volume. The correspondence of the properties expansion,
compressibility and specific heat, for liquid and solid shows imme-
diately that the representation in the i], e, v coordinatesystem of the
experimentally determined conditions, belonging to one of the solid
aggregations of a material, can be supposed to belong to a ridge
corresponding to the liquid ridge. Also that other solid varieties
require further ridges. So long as we exclusively keep to the
experimentally determined values only narrow strips of these sup-
posed ridges are given for a short distance to the side of the tops
and thus form themselves isolated parts, not connected with the
vapour and liquid regions, of the whole Gibbs' surface for the
special substance.
The various ridges, if we for a moment admit their existence,
will be more or less shifted, according to the densitj', towards zero
volume {v) and according to the fusion and transformation heats
more or less to zero entropy iji). The difference in specific heat of
the modifications, will be given by a variation in curvature. Looking
