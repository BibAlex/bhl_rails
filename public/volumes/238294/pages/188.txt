Ill ihe partk'idar ease that the timctioii 6* satisfies the two nieiiihers
of the equation (3) 8eparately, we have to distinguish two cases
acrordiug- to the double sign in
dn _ &,., ± \/ 8,,^ - e,, d,, djj ^ ^^
The general integral can be written in both cases respectively
1
q — v ], . (5)
6^ = (2 ir ,1" _ 4 ^/ r/ + 4 t/ rp u' v) p — 2 Lu ;,'" ip v)h p d u
Avhere g = (j [ii) has the same meaning as before, whilst /' and r
represent two new arbitrary functions of the arguments jilaced after
these symbols.
Ill these cases the two intermediate integrals are
^ =F i/ ('^ ii" — 9') — ■'■(" ''"' + ^'") = ^' (")'
.'/ + 'V' [" {'■ =F ;/")] = 5 [" (t- =F ƒ/)],
the yalnes of u and v being expi'essed in [> and 7 with the aid of
the formulae (5).
The condition (3) appears, although in a diiferent shape, already
in the excellent dissertation of J. Valyi (Klausenburg 1880).

In "Verhandeling" 5 of the "Kon. Ak. v. W." at Amsterdam Vol.
VIII, I have deduced some formulae expressing the singularities of
the focal developable and of the focal curve in function of the sin-
gularities of a plane curve having no particular position.
In a similar way it is possible to deduce the following formulae
exjU'essing the singularities of the focal de\'elopable and of the focal
curve of a i)laiie curve touching tiie line at infinity times and
