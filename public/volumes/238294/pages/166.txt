X = 0.63). The last value will probably be too large, as the curves
which, according to the afore-mentioned formulae, represent Txr and
Txpi as a function of x, and which for ,v =z almost touch each
other, do not do so for ,v = 1 and hence for larger .?; yield too
large values for 7\r — T^-pi .

and the increase of vapour pressure found at 25°. 55 C. with the
condensation: 0.07 atni. (comp. this Comm. IV, p. 567) allow us
to judge of the pui'ity of the carbon dioxide used. By means of

§ 11. Retrograde condensation. In the annexed plate we give
for the two mixtures investigated curves which represent vnq as
function of v according to the tables given in sections 2 and 3
(p. 579 IF.). The curves for the different temperatures are marked by the
lelters, I)}' which the corresponding isothermals have been indicated.
The numbers on tlie plate hold for the unity 0.00001.

that the liquid meniscus at liie end of the condensation over a certain
range of temperatures appeared or disap|)ear('(l in llio tube. Kienen

these phenomena by the theory of v.an dek Waals on the influence
of gravitation on the thermodynamic equilibrium in mixtures. (Contin. II
