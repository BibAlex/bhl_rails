fig. 148j, and later Saccardo (Syll. IV, 757) assigned the generie
name TriimiKitostroiiKi to a similar fungus.
The speeies, described and represented by llie former, he called
TrlmtiKitostroiiKi Salicls, after its host. Now it deserves notice that
Saccardo foimd a fungus on I'ose hips an<l lirst calle(l it I'lrospor/iini
fructlcold (Fungi Jtalici, j)l. 40), which he later transplaced to y'r/iinn(i-

The characlerislies of the three repeatedly mentioned genei-a can
now be summarised as follo>\s:

united to stiings, forming a close assemblage on a stroma.
