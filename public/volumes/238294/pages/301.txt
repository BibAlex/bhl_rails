I have made a closer stiidv ot" this transfoi'mation ; it is caused by
an ijdramolecnlar ini,uralioii at the Iciminal asymmetric carbon atom.
One might feel disposed to explain the ti-ansformation in an acetic
aidivdrifh' solution l)v an addition and subsequent elimination of"
a molecide of the solvent, such as Fischer supposed to happen in
the mutual transformation of the two isomeric methylglucosides ^).
This view, however, becomes untenable as the transformation can
also take place without the presence of acetic aidiydride. Then
LoBRY DK Bruyn, by sim[)ly melting the (?-isomer m.p. 134° with dry
ZnClg, at once obtained the other compound m.p. Ü12^ T also succeeded
in causing the same transformation in a chloroform solution containing
SOj,. On shaking chloroform Avith fuming sulphui-ic acid, a portion
of the SO, jiasses into the chloroform. This solution has been found
to accelerate many i-eactions by catalytical action. A solution of
the j^-peutacetate in C-HCH, which contained IS. 8 milligrs. ofSO^jjcr
cc. at tirst rotated hut slightly to\\ards the riuiit ; afl(M- a short time
its I'otatoi'v po^vor had inci-cased. The SO., was now removed by
means of dilute alkali and the chloi-oform distilled off. The residue
was recrvstallised from alcohol and in this way the pure «-isomer
m.p. 1 T2^ was obtained.
3. As in the case of the \\\o methylglucosides, the tinal con-
dition in the transformation between the two stereoisomers is here
also an c(|nilibrium : the limit how e\er is situated close to the
form melting at 112"'. A solution |>repared by dissolving 5 grams
of ;?-pentacetate in 100 cc. acetic anhydride (containing 2 grams
of y.iiicchloride) showed an initial i-otatiou of -}" 1 (l>olai'iscoj)e

tiiere exists SS^/o of the a and 12" „ of the ,i-compoiüid. The former
could in fact be isolated in a pui-e condition : in addition also some
ci'jstals which melted at 95 — 9S' and contained Ixdh isomei's.
4. By determining at definite times the said changes in the rotation
the velocity of the mutual transformation could be measured.
It conformed with the formula for the iiuimolecular reversible
