pectose remains behind in tlie stalks. What is drawn ofT by D may
be called "rotting-water", but this water is widely different, at the
starting of the experiment, when it contains much dissolved matter
and few bacteria, from that, obtained in a later i»eriod, when many
bacteria and few dissolved substances occur in it.
The jar A is kept at a temperature of 28 to 35'' C. by placing
it in the thermostat T.
If after 2 or 3 days tiie tlax is removed from .1 it |)roves to
be more or less sufficiently i-otted, if the water sup|)ly has l)ecn
great enongli to refresh the rotting-water tV(Mii 5 to 10 times. Through
our apparatus of 300 cc, 1.5 to 3 1. of water had thus to |)ass.
Whilst in the Laboratory experiment the water is introduced at the
bottom of the jar and drawji otT at the toj) in order to prevent
stopping of the tubes l)y the gases formed by the fermentation, this
would be faulty with experiments on a lai'ger scale, — in this latter
case the heavier rottiim-water should be drained off at the bottom.
