§ 2. In the mixture with the molecular proportion 0.1047 of
oxygen the meniscus b}^ increasing the volume at 21°. 86 C. appeared
at the top of the tube, at 21°. 94 C. it was formed at the mark
44.99 (stirrer below, mercury meniscus at 41.66); at 22M7 C. the
meniscus appeared at the bottom of the tube, at 22°. 09^ C. it was
formed at the mark 43.93 (stirrer below, mercury meniscus at 41.57).
The top of the tube was at the mark 47.40 (cm).
In the mixture of the molecular proportion 0.1994 the meniscus
appeared at 13°.12 C. at the bottom of the tube, at J3°.07 C. it
appeared at the mark 38.5 (stirrer above, mercury meniscus at 37.4);
at 11°. 89 C. the meniscus appeared at the top of the tube, at 11°. 92 C.
it appeared at 42.3 (stirrer below, mercury meniscus at 37.7). The
top of the tube was at the mark 42.97. We may assume that for this
mixture the limits between which the meniscus appears in the tube
are: 13M0 C. and 11°.90 C.
In these observations the volume from the homogeneous state was
increased by small variations; in this case the meniscus even without
stirring appears quickly at its definite place, which is not altered
by stirring. If on the contrary we start from the state where separation
into two phases occurs and the volume is decreased, the meniscus
only disappears after stirring and then suddenly ; hence it seems
that in the former case the equilibrium is established much sooner ^).
§ 3. In order to be able to compare the observations discussed
above with theory, I have found what may be deduced for it if
,v is supposed very small. It may be easily derived from conside-
rations of VAN DER Waals (Contin. II, p. 30 IT.) that the phases
which are in ccpiilibrium are determined by the following pair of
equations :

V the molecular volume in cc, M^ the molecular weight of the
substance of which the quantity in the mixture is indicated by o)
