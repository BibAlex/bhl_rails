1 nsed mv nni\ersal instiMiment described before, and the obser-
vations consisted in notinu' do\vn the inomcMits at \vhich the
visible limb of the moon and the com[)arison stai' attained the same
altitude. The instants of transit ov(M' the horizontal threads were
determined, tirst for the one, then for the otluM- object, either com-
bined with readings of the alidade-level. In this way I have obtained
24 observations of the \^^ limb scattered over 10 Jiigiits and 12
observations of the 2' liml) ovei' 3 nights. 1 regi'et that it has not

The instrument has always been nsed in the same [)osilio]i, telescope

computed for gi\en moments the azimuth and the zenith-distajice of
the moon and the stai-, while the azimuth of the instrument was
kjiowii by means of the hai'bour-light S. Kach time the level was
read just before the transit observations. The reticule has remained
in the same position since February J90I '), so that each time the
transits could be obsei'Ncd o\'ei' 7 threads.
The «listances betwecMi these threads ^vere about 7^ (^, 4^ 4\ 7%

perha|)s be better to sacrifice some transits in oi-der to ti-y to reach
a higher degi'ee of accuracy in the othei'S.
Anothei' result of the ra|)id succession of the sej)arate transits was
that 1 was unable to follo\v the observed object in azimuth during
its transit o\-er the reticule. Hence in some cases it passed in
a somewhat obli()ue dir(M'lion and while I always took care that the
