lateralis humeri, crossing the spina scapulae 3 cm. below the acromion,
following on the dorsal surface of the fore-arm the furrow between radius
and ulna, and passing over the metacarpus of the little finger, between this
and the 4*'! finger to the plant. Next it crosses the latter in a cranial
direction, in such a manner that the plants of the fingers are insensible
with the exception of the 4"i and the 5*'^ circumscribes the plant of the
hand and crosses again the hand towards the radial side, goes upward
again, at first in the direction of the epicondylus humeri medialis, then taking
a bend in the direction of the plica axillaris ventralis, approaching this
very closely, and reaching the mid-ventral line, towards w^hich it is directed
perpendicularly, at the second rib.
The caudal boundary-line starts from the back at the 10'^ vertebra, con-
tinuing perpendicularly on the longitudinal axis, crosses the spina scapulae
and continues parallel with the plica axillaris in a cranial direction until
very close to the cranial border. Between the two a very narrow sensible
area remains. It then takes a bend in caudal direction, reaching the mid-
ventral line at the third rib.
To the left are two insensible spots. One of these is found opposite the
2'^d and S^'d rib at the mid-ventral line. The other, elliptic, is almo.st identical
with that found on dog IV.
