The following papers were read :
Chemistry. — ^'The inchuuj poinl lines of the si/stmi sulphur
-\- chlorine.'' Hy Prof. H. W. Bakiilis Roozeboom and
A. H. W. Aten. '
(Communicated in the meeting of January 30, 1901).
The boiling point lines of this system have already been described
at the meeting in May 1903. These led to (he view that the com-
ponnd S2CI2 in tlie liquid and vaporous condition is but very little
dissociated and also tiiat further compounds occur at a not too low
temperature in liquids with a higher proportion of chlorine.
