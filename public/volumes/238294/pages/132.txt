normal volume was made in the same way as has been described
in Ounm. N". 70 \. These Proc. IV June 21), 1901, p. 107 and in
C'onim. N". 7<S, These Proc. Y\ April U), 1902, p. 7(11 , especially the
same precautions for the constant tein|)eralui-c and |)ressure were taken.
The normal volume was determined at least twice before and
twice after the measurements. It must \)v recoi'ded, howevei-, that
this was not done with the tirsi (luaulity of carbon dioxide of which
