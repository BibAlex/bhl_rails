for the greater pari l>v the (hlfeivut vahies whicdi are adopted for

For Washiniilon 1 could onlv use the \alues given by Xkwcomu in
his Astroiioniicdl Onisfunts p. -M. 1 sup[)osed thai the values given
thei-e for ó'e, if again 1 subtracted fi'om them the reduction to the
"Pnlkowa refraction'", wouhl agree with those which follow inime-
diatelv from the results in the \V<isli'ni<it(>ii ithscrrntioiis ^]. lii this
way I found :

Hence the corrections which must l)e applied to the obliquity of
the ecliptic according to Hanskn itecome:
1862— i8(>7 f)f = + 0".2()
:1H(58- 1<S74 —0.12

Tlie results of Imïanz cannot be correcliMl in thi> way. 1 assumed
for them, according to Xkwcomu's tiual foiuiula fJ ? :=: + 0"-24.
We now can determine (bi-eclly the inllueiice of these cori'ections
on the eo(>flicients of sin n au<l ms n dei-i\-ed from the observations,
l-'or we have as a suflicieut approximation :

and the corrections that nuist be appbed to the coefticieiMs h an<l c
are thei-efoi-e -|- 0.915 ms H d f- and -f 0.9»; sin H <U respectively.
Hence we tind as the cori-ected values of h and r:
