they have passed through eacii other with infinite velocity and as
if further nothing has happened, so also as if the quantity of motion
— of whose motion the pressure of the gas is a consequence —
does not move with Ihe velocity of the molecules, but as if with
every mean path which is described, a distance is saved, which is
a mean of the distances of the centres of the molecules in collisions.
