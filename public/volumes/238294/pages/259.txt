Then we can write the rotationvector in the form :
,a>3 i 4- ^<x>J ^ ^vj^k ^ h (jW, i + ^10 J -\- jtu, k)
or in the form
fl {<Pl i + 7^2 i + ^3 ^O + ^2 (if'l ^" + ^^./ + V's ^O-
The notations h and f are taken from the above-named dissertation
of Dr. W. A. WiJTHOFF; h is defined on page 67 ; f 1 and f 2 on page 78.
The moment of motion becomes
(P, -i- P3) ,a>3 i + (P3 -r I\) .CO, j -f (P, + P,) ,o>, ^- +
+ A |(P, + PJ ,w, i + (P, i- PJ ,a>,i + (P3 + P,) 3C0, k]
or in an other form
1 6, |(Prr, + A, V^)^ + (P'^2 + ^2 »f'2)i + (P'/3 + ^3 ^'3)^1 +
+ I f 2 l(Pi|'i + ^1^1)^+ (Pil'2 + ^^2 ^/ 2)i + (^l^ 4- ^3 r 3) ^'1-
If fp and If? represent the rotation vectors in Rr and /?/, we can
write the rotation :
f 1 'P + f 2 ^%
and the moment
1 R {e, <p + f. If') + (è f,. (.1) V' + \ ^. (^4) f/),
where the notation {Ayp means : A^ (p^ i -[- A^ (pj + A^ (f^ k.
The first and strongest of these terms falls along the rotationvector ;
for a body with equal squares of inertia it is the onlj one; the
second, which, together with the ^'s, becomes stronger as the body is
more asymmetric, we might call the "crossed moment" because its
right part is caused by the left part of the rotation and inversely.
Let us put finally the moment of force in the form f 1 ft + f, r,
where ft and v are threedimensional vectors ; then the above given
formula of the vector can be broken up into the six following
components, given successively by the coefficients of e^ Ï ,8^i, e^ j ,
R'(p, -^ A,ip, = A, ijj, ^3 — .43 V'3 <P, + 2fXi
