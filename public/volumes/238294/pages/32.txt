To the right is found an interrupted sensible area, encompassed between
two insensible zones.
a. The cranial insensible zone is bounded cranially by a line, leaving the
mid-dorsal line at the 6^'^ vertebra (see fig. II, 1), continuing in the direction
of the acromion, and then, avoiding this and the caput humeri, taking a
bend towards the mid-ventral line. It approaches this latter until a distance
of IV2 cm. (see fig. II, 2), continues parallel to it for 4 cm. in a caudal
direction, leaves it again at the third rib, borders cranially the sensible
ventral triangle of the 10 â€¢' dermatoma, thus becoming itself the caudal
boundary line of the cranial insensible zone. As such it recedes to a distance
of 8 cm. from the mid-ventral line, circumscribing next caudally the sensible
triangle, it returns as the cranial boundary line of the caudal (interrupted)
insensible zone to the mid-ventral line, approaching this to a distance of 1
cm., taking again a caudal bend and accompanying it for 3 cm. Next
starting perpendicularly from the mid-ventral line, it continues along the
plica axillaris posterior towards the upper-arm, in a cranial direction and
turns with a sharp curve to the epicondylus medialis. Passing between
olecranon and epicondylus, it circumscribes the first (see fig. II, 2 and 4),
turns on the dorsal side of the arm towards the epicondylus lateralis, and
