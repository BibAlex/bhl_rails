Let the plane curve be of order (x, of class v and let t represent
the number of its inflectional points. Then the singularities of the
evolute or of the cuspidal curve of its focal developable are the following :

Mathematics. — "(>/i /A^^ pos/tioii of the three pohits which a
tiristed curve has in coniinon tntth its osculating lüane.'' By
Dr. W. A. Versluys. (Communicated by Prof. P. H. Schoute.)
(Communicated in the meeting of January 30, 1904).
§ 1. Let d be the section of the osculating plane V in a point
r of the twisted curve C with the developable of which C is the
cuspidal curve; then the twisted cui've C and the section d have in
the point P only two points in common, that is they have in
P a contact of the first order.
