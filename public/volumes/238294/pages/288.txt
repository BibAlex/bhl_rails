With Plücker M we nnderstand by I lie order t of a single sin-
gularity the nninbei* of the points of intersection coinciding in the
(singnhir) point with an arbid'ary hue of irifersection through that
point. If eventually more branches [»ass Ibrough Ihe singular point,
we must of course count lliose points of intersection only, which l)y
a slight displacement of the intersecting Hue are found on the
branch belonging to the singularity in (piestion. (correlative to the
order is the chtss r of the singularity. This class is at tiie same
time equal to the number of points of intersection ap|)roaciiing the
(singular) point along the branch in question witii an intersecting
line passing through that ))oint and al)out to coincide with the (sin-
gular) tangent.
If we regard this last quality as the definition of the class of
a singularity, tlien the development in point coonhnates with the

a manifold singularity must be taken into consideration as many times
as it possesses single singularities. Ilei-e not only tiie higher and
PLÜCKER-singularities must be counted, but also those elements of
the curve, the counting of which has an influence on the ecpuition

and the tangent imaginai-y or reversely. It is clearly inditterent
