approximation its equation is :

as for a simple substance ^). Hence to tlie lirst approximation the
border curve satisfies the law of cor responding states.
That the border curve, apart from the deviations existing already
in pure substances does not altogether satisfy the law of correspon-
ding states, has a double cause. It is not only for mixtures which
differ little from the special mixture a^ that the experimental isother-
mal shows a slight slope, but this is even the case for the mixture
.Tk itself; only at the plaitpoint temperature it is perfectly horizontal
so that already for the mixture .% the border curve must deviate
from the law of corresponding states. If as before ^) we develop the
equation of the experimental isothermal :

only for .Vk=:0 or 1, that is to say for the pure substances, the
third term is left out — and in the same way all the terms which
contain v — vk.
If now by elimination of T—Ti between the equation of state
of the mixture x^ (equation (2), 1. c. p. 323) and the experimental
isothermal (10), we search for the border curve for that special
mixture, we see that the slope of the experimental isothermal only
influences the third term — viz. with {v — v^.)" — in the development
(11) of the border curve, so that this border curve only to a third
approximation shows a deviation from the law of corresponding
