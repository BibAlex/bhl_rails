(_)ii( of llic two values ^t* = ^ i^iid r =: - ensues tluit tlie seclioii
(I, lies near 7^ on tlie convex side of the projection />.
§ 3. Tlie hitter can also he proved as follows for any cnr\c
Avilli the aid of Descriptive (leometi'v.
h' we take the osculating plane T^ in any ])oint of the curve C^,
to be the vei-tical plane of projection and the normal plane of the
curve to he the horizontal one (plane of projection), then the vertical
projection j/' is a curve cutting the axis per|»endicnlarly in a common
point /^ and the horizontal projection y>' is a cur\'e having in F a
cusp with the axis for cuspidal tangent. Let us now constrnct
the vei'tical trace d" of (K The vertical traces of the generating
lines of (^ lie on the laugents to //', liius all on the convex side
of />", \\ hilst those traces are also situated on the same side of the
perpendicular on the axis in P, where also ^/' and p' are lying. So
the curves </" and />" turu the concave side to the same side, whilst
</" ]iear P lies outside p". So the cnr\es </" and //' have an even
jHimher of [)oiuts in common.
Thus if r' and d" had the three points of C', lying in I" in common,
then also //' and t/" would have three points near P in common.
So accordiug to what was jtroved above //' and d" had four points
in counnon. That fourth common point of />" and d" would, lying
on d", also lie on (^ and would l)e the })rojection of a ])oint (2 of
tlie curve (' lying as near to it as one desires. So at the limit the
projecting line of ^^ would be a tangent of ''A Thus neai' /''a tangent
of () might be [lerpendicular to the osculating plane l^, which is
iin|)ossible. So ^'and d" have no three ]ioiiits in common.
§ 4. We can prove moreover as follows synthetically that the
twisted cubic T., has not three points in common with the trace d.^.
If 6', and d., had three ]>oints in common at /-* then d.^ and the
))rojection p^ of C^ on V out of any arbitrary point A would liaxe
three successive points in common. This projection p^ is a cubic
cnrve of class four. The three inflexicmal tangents of />., are the traces
of the three osculating planes through A, thus they are also tangents
to d.,. As the contact of the second order in P must count for three
common tangents and each of the three inflectional tangents of p^
for two common tangents, two curves respectively of class two and
class four would lia\e nine common tangents, which is im[)0ssible.
So the curves ('., and d have at P no three points in common.
