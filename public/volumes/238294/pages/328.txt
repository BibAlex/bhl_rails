fVoin \vliic'Ii ensues the detenrünaiit type for equiangular double
rotation to tlie left :
— jr, — rr, rr, .t^
(III)
and for tliis too the {)foperty of a group can he verified.
If we call (I') the determinant type formed by interchange of the
rows and colunuis of (I), we can remark :
If we reverse the signs in the bottom row of type (II) type (I')
appears.
If we reverse tJie signs in tiie last column of type (III) type (I')
appears.
If we ask oursehes wiiether each arbitrary congruent transformation
can be replaced by tiie succession of a transformation (III) and a
transformation (II) the answei' must be afiirmative ; for we shall have
but to take those transformations (III) and (II) belonging to the
transformations (I') whicli when successively applied transfer the
given initial position into the given linal one. (For those two ways
only the intermediate positions will (Htfer in as far as tliey will l)e
each otiier's retlection with regard to their A^'^-axis.)
This is the algebraic proof of 1".
At the same time it lias become evident that the meaning of
the type (I') is an arl)itrary e(iuiangular double rotation to the
right preceded by a retlection accor(bng to tiie AVii^ij^ (tiiat is the
AV^^xis of tiie initial position) or an arbitrary equiangular double
rotation to the left followed by a reflection according to the A>axis
(that is the AV^ixis of the final position), and that the meaning of
the ty[)e (1) is an arbitrary e({uiangular double rotation to the right
followed by a reflection according to the AVti^xis or an arbitrary
eqniangular double rotation to the left preceded by a reflection according
to the AV^xis.
Thus according to a preceding communication made in this meeting
of the Academy (see page 785) it has been proved that the types (I)
and (I') represent the most general symmetric transformation of S^,
of which the determinant type has been simplified only by jiarticular
choice of the system of coordinates.
We shall now give a i)roof for 2".
