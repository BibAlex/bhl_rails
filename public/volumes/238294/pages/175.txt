This is confirmed (inalitatix elv hul the exact determination of the
lines H'l and K'l and conseqnenlly also of the ternarv entecticum
proved to be impossible.
In this way no more was ol)taine(l tiian is indicated in Fig. 1,
namely the solidifieatioji lines Ad and OD for the mixtures of Cl^
and S^CIo in which no compound had formed and besides these the
series of tiie first solidifying points AH, HEK and KD for the par-
tially combined liquids formed at 0^.
These lines therefore correspond with the accentuated lines in
Fig. 2. The true meitijig ])()int of SCl^, without decomposition ot
the liquid (E F'ig. 2) is therefore not yet known. If SCl^ could have
been prepared in pure crystals, this might have pi-obably been
determined as it would presumably be situated below the tempera-
ture where the liquid couqtound shows perceptil)le deconq)ositi()n.
This is rendered more proitable by the observation that notwith-
standing their minuteness the crystals of SCl^ when rapidly heated,
are quite permanent up to — 20^
Fig. 1 does not agree witii tig. 2 in an important point. In
the latter DK is placed above DG, in the tirst DK is found below
DG. DG represents the lowering of liic melting point of S.^C\^ by
added Cl^ when this remains unchanged: DK when a portion of it
combines with a j»art of the S.X'l^ to SCl^ according to thee(|uation
S.,C1, -f 3 Ci., = 2 SOI,.
If we now compare the total amount of tlie foreign molecules
which occur along with the S.^CM.^, for the same total amount of
Cl.^, these numbers are smallci- in the case of a partial formation
of SCI4 than when this is not the case, xlccording to this suj)position
DK ouglit to be situated liigher tlian DG.
As in practice, the reverse position was found Ave must look for
a cause which may exi)lain this fact. AVc find this by sui)posing
that besides SCI, tiiere is also formed in tiio hipiid a considerable
proportion of SCl^ accordiuu' to the e(|ua1iou
S.,C1., 4- Gl, = 2 SGI,.
By taking this view the ]iumi)er of foreign molecules mixed
with the SjGl., becomes greater ow ing to the formation of SG1._, than
without this.
Tlie formation in the liquid of an amount of SGlg exceeding that
of SGI, \vhicli had already become prol)able by the dilatometric
experiments has, therefore, been confirmed. The slow crystallisation
of SGI4 will now be better understood; but the liquids between Gl.,
and SjGlj should now be considered not as ternary but as quater-
