As, however, tliese apparatus are either somewhat eoiupheated or
else do not always eifect a satisfactory regulation of the pressure,
and as I had very often to carry out distillations under reduced
pressure, I have tried to construct an ap[)aratus which would suit
my purpose. I have used this apparatus ft)r a year aiul a half
and it quite satisfies my requirements.
The apparatus may be used for any ))ressure situated between that
of a column of mercury of a few m.m. and one of about 600 m.m.
in height; the required pressure is ke[»t fairly accurately constant.
For the sake of clearness, the lower half of the annexed drawing
represents a section of the aj)paratus and the upper half gi\es a
view of the latter.
A is a glass lul>e witli an intei'iial diameter of about 19 mm. and
to which is sealed a tube /> '2 mm. wide: H is a trap-bulb; ('a
manomctei' tid)e which stands in the same mercury ^■essel as the
barometer I). .1 is attached to the wooden piece C which may be
moved in -a vertical direcliou between the pieces F. The tube ..4
may be uioxed upwaids and downwards by means of a wheel. ^1 is
placed in a vessel [lartly tilled with mercury; the lower opening of
A is closed with an indiarul)ber stopper having a vertical hole of
about 5 mm. (bameter. To the extremity of the thin tube JJ a [)iece
F is connected; £ is made of wooil, coi-k or rubber and has a
vertical perforation by means of which it may be pulled over the
tube JJ. It has in addition a side /\ (triangular) crevice running as
far as the vertical perforation. The proper action of the instrument
depends on the piece is".
Between the tube C and the barometer D is situated a calibi-ated
scale movable in a \'ertical direction by means of L, which renders
an accurate reading of the pressure possible. From the drawing
it is further sho^vn, that .1 and C are connected by meaiis of glass
T pieces and of thick indiarubber tubes, not only mutually, but also
with the airpump and the space to be e\acuated. (So as not to
