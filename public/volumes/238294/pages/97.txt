we f?et a repetition of what precedes in reversed ordei'. On the
left of /) and on the riuht of (/ we have the same thinjr as in
fig. 4; at p and rj h(n\e\'er. we see soiiiethinu' s|iecial, \i/. that

solution.
We ha\e further seen in fio:. 4 that the succession of cou(hlious
I^J^Si>-\- (r -^ S/i -\- (r—*(r could (tcciii- thcrc for C(»nditi(ins lying
above the curve hh^. h\ fig. 7 this takes |»lace. besides above the
curves hp and r/A, also between the concenti-ations .i\ and .I'j, corre-
s{)onding with the points p and y, for any '///y/V/v/y//// chosen volume,
because the region for SB-\-(r between p and y passes continuously
into the region for Sf--\-/.. Hence this phenomenon will occur much
more frequently for the tyjte of fig. 7 than foj- the type of fig. 4.
The usual succession L -\- S/>-\- (r-^ L -{- (r^ (i is here only
possible for conditions lying within the /--/-cni-ve i'(-\'\_pf^.2f>i^'-
The retrograde phenomenon discussed above will here be observed
for all conditions lying below the branch h^ h^ q of the second
iv^curve and above the tangent drawn to the branch >]<'zj\ from a
point ƒ (between t\ and /\). A very essential point of difference with
the case of fig. 4 is further to be found, first in the circumstance
that with a concentration ,i\ and a volume j\ v^ we pass here sud-
denly from the region L-^Sn-\-(T into the gas region and secondly
that for a composition sli(jhthj richer in B than .r, and with a volume
,/', i\ just at the moment at which all the solid />' would evaporate,
a saturated solution is formed, which reaches its critical temperalurf^
immediately after its formation.
From fig. 7 follows that if we started from a concentration../', with
a volume j\ i\, with which therefore the point <i can l>c leached,
the transition L, -\- Sb-\- (r—^Su-^- G takes place at a temperature
lower than that corresponding to the point /;, so that the points p
and q can never be determined by one experiment, which it is
practically superfluous to mention.
The curves piPp-t, r i\, tt^ and q^qq^, which denote the mol.
vols, and the concentrations of the "fluïde"" phases coexisting with solid
B, have still two vertical tangents, as tliey are in the immediate neigh-
bourhood of /y and <i, from wliicii the retrograde solidification follows.
For the curve *S'*S\, drawn halfway between p and q, the two
vertical tangents coincide in accoidance with the yu'-curve in Fig. 2,
which means, that there retrograde solidification is no longer possible.
