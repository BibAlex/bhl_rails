transformation : for - hi. ^) was fcnmd a constant value wliicli
t • ct^—a
was the same in the ease of eillier isomer.
This average value representing the sum of the velocity constants
of the two conlrary reactions is 0.0095 (the time expressed in hours
and using- ordinary logarithms) at 35° and a concentration of 27o zinc-
chloride. At 45° and 2"/„ ZnCI,, the average constant was 0.028. The
temperature coefficient of the transformation for every lO"" is, there-
fore, 3.01. Further detej'mijuitions were also made with l^/^ solutions
of zincchloride at 45° and the coustant was found to he 0.0135.
This seems therefore to be propoi-tionate to tiie concentration of
the catalyzer.
5. Besides these two isomers, Tankkt (Bull. 1895, 13, 2t)l) ima-
gined to have found a third glucose-pentacetate.
On treating glucose with acetic anhydride and a little yJiM'chloride
and recrystallising the product from alcohol, he ohtaijied from the
mother-liquor crystals with [«]^ ^ -[- 59° at 62'^. This sid)stance had
no sharply defined melting i)oint situated below the melting points
of the above isomers. As he could not etfect a further sepa-
ration of these crystals by recry stal lisat ion, he took it to be a third
modification with a melting point of about S(V, but still occluding
a small (piantity of the other two, Avhich it was difficult to get rid
off. It is however obvious that this so-called third moditication is
only a mixture of the other two. which is deposited from an alco-
holic solution saturated \vith both ('om[)oumls. The following facts
are in fa\our of this view.
J'*^ If it were a third isomer, it might be got perfectly free from
the others by recry stallisation and present a delinite melting point.
2"'*. If we make a mixture of the isomers melting at 134° and
112° so that [a]o = 60° the product will show the same melting-
traject as that of Tanket "'), namely 91—94°.
3"'. A solution saturated with both isomers, and a saturated
solution of Tanret's product appear to contain the same amount of
pentacetate. 1 lla^'e used 50"/„ alcohol as solvent. On shaking at 25°
with an excess of the t\vo pure isomers a solution was obtained
containing 3.08 — 3.iO"/„ of pentacetate; Tanret's product similarly
treated gave a solution containing 3.13 — ^3.14*/,,.

-) Mr. Tanret had the kindness to forward a specimen of liis preparation to
Prof. LoBRY DE Bruvn. With this sample the experiments have been made.
