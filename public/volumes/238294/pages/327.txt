me to relate tlie rotation in S^ to two rotations in aSV The relations
between the elements of the fonr-dimensional rotation and the elements
of the two threedimensional rotations belonging to it have been
explicitly pointed out bv me in "Sitzungsberichte der Berliner
Akademie" of Jnly SO^'i 1896 and in the "Journal fur die reine
und angewandte Mathematik" Vol. 118, p. 215, 1897. I have
particularly found that the components of the velocity of the first
rotatio]! are easily deduced from the components of the velocity of
the two others (compai'e also my lecture at the "Naturforscher Ver-
samndiing" at Hamburg 1901 : "On rotations in fourdimensional
spaces," (Ueber Drehungen im vierdimensionalen Raum).
Mr. Brouwer arrives in his paper also at these results though in
a ditferent way, namely geometrically, whilst I have worked alge-
braically. Mr. Brouwer arrives at a decomposition ("Zerlegung") of
the fourdimensional rotation into two threedimensional ones, whilst
I use the expression coordination ("Zuordnung").

Mathematics. â€” "A/</ebraic deduction of the decomposabilitij of
the continuoas ^notion about a fixed point of S^ into those of
two Si's". By Mr. L. E. J. Brouwer. (Communicated by
Prof. Korteweg),
As the position of aS'^ is determined with respect to a fixed system
of axes by six independent variables and that of 6', with respect to
a fixed system of axes by three independent variables we understand
at once that in an infinite number of ways two S^ motions can be
coordinated to an S^ motion, so that position and velocities ofxS^are
determined by position and velocities of the two >SVs. On such a
coordination Mr. Jahnke has been engaged in the papers mentioned
above and has deduced the relations between positions and velocities
of S^ and the two aSVs. Interpreted geometrically his coordination
amounts to tlie following : Let us suppose in ^S'^ a fixed system of
axes A\ A^^ A', A^^, and a moxable one Y^ Y.^ Y^ Y^; let us con-
sider the part equiangular to the right of the double rotation, which
transfers A\ A^., A"^, A'^ into Y^ Y^ Y^ Y^ ; let us add to it an equal
equiajigular double rotation to the left (namely equal with respect to
the system of axes A\ A^ A^, A^^ ; only with respect to a definite
system of axes can we call an ecpiiaiigular double rotation to the
right and one to the left equal) ; the resulting rotation becomes a single
