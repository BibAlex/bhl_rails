On aecount of the extreme minnteness of its er\ stals and the low

Avliich are in ecpiilibrium with ('1., and S,('l., at the temperature
chosen. As these do not cliange much with the t(Mnpej'atui-e, the
same series (tf nuxtui-es is fairly \vell i-etained on cooli]]"' to the
(uystallisation temperatures. The numbei* of ternai-y mixtui-es whose
crystallisation may be in\esti<iated is, therefore, restricted to one for
each gross comj)osition.
We, therefore, always obtain for the first solidifyiuü' poijits a series
sueh as AH'P]M\'I) in fig. '2, just as if we were dealing with a
binary mixtnre in which a dissociable com[)ound occurred. If, ho\vevei',
the equilibrium in the liquid does not change Avhen CI3, SCl^ or
S.^C1.^ crystallises out, the system oii solidilication must behave as a
ternary one. '
This shonld have appeared in practice by the fact that the curve
of the first solidifying |)oints did not also represent the path of
crystallisation, and, therefore, the mother liquoi- left after cooling
each mixtnre to a lower temperature differed in composition from
that given by the point on the curve corresponding with the
tenq)erature in (piestion. Owing to the nature of the ci-ystals,
however, it was inqiossible to remove the mother-licpior with a
pi])ette.
It was, however, possible to prove in the case of a li(pnd of the
gross composition SCl^ that this does not conqdetely solidify to SCl^
at E', Init only commences to deposit SOI., at that temperature
( — 30°), which quantity increases on further cooling, but in such a
manner that no comi)lete solidilication takes place below — 80°. In
the points on both sides of E' the continuity is still more pronounced
and this makes the accurate detei-mination of even the first solidifying
points very difticult.
In the second place the solidilication of the dilFerent mixtures
ought not to be conqdete in H' or in K', but only in I after traversing
the crystallisation paths II'l and Iv'I.
