and their development, to enable us to form a correct judgment
about their exact position.
With regard to the Nematoda I want to add that to me it seems
to be an error to look upon the parasitical Nematoda as descended
from those which are nowadays found li\'ing freely in the sea or
in fresh water or in moist soil. All these latter are far too uniform
to allow us to look upon tliein as ancestral forms. This phylum can
be better understood, when we consider the parasitical forms as the
older primitive ones and qu the other hand derive the free-living
forms from them, as parasites which have adapted themselves
secondarily to a free existence. What the origin of the parasitical
Nematoda in their turn may have been i-emains an open question
for the present.
Of what has been briefly summai'ised above, 1 hope to give a
more elaborate exposition in the current number of the ".lenaische
Zeitschrift fiir NaturwisseuschatV' which is now going through the
press, in which periodical also IjANo's paper, which induced me to
write this article, appeared. To that number I refer for further
particulars.
