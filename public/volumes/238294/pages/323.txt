The constancy of k\ is seen to come out no less satisfactory than
that of l\, the more so as in each case the value of s has been
determined by means of only two measurements. The coefficient has
been so chosen that for these two observations, which were in Table
III the first and the last but one, and in Table IV the tirst and the
last, the values of k\ should be proportional to those of k.,.
I shall next consider two series from a later publication by Kalfman.\^\
