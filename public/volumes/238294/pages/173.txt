Tliis difference is further shown bv the different crystallisation })aths
wliich on further coolin^ti' are traversed by mixtures of the same
gross composition.
Tliese crystallisation paths start i]i each of the regions mentioned
from th(^ point re|)resenlijig tiie meltijig ]u)int of the solid pliiise,
tliat is from A, 1) and E respectively, and indicate the series of
mother H(|uors which remain, during a continued cooling, at each
temperature. The ci'\ s(allisati(»n ])atlis in tlie tii'st region end in HI
or IG, tliose for the second in Kl or IG, for the third in HI or KI.
The lines 1 and II schenmticaliy indicate two similar paths in the
last region, the xcrtical line EE' is a tiiird one which applies to a
litpiid of the gi-oss composiiion SCl^.
As soon as the ci-ystallisation paths ari-ive at HI, Kl or Gl, the
subse(|ueiil solidilication takes place along these lines, each time
with (lep(»siti()n of two solid phases : CI, -|- '^^^'14 o» HI, S^CL + '^^'^a
on Kl and ('1, -|- S.Cl., (»ii Gl.
Finally the last liipiid solidities in I to a ternary entecticum of
the three |)liases.
This \yould be (he slate of alfairs if — as has beeji said — ^C\^,
S.^Cl.^ and ('1., \yere miscible in all proportions without transformation.
If, however, SGl^ were a dissociable compound whose formation
and decomposition led lo com})lete e(piilibria at all solidification
temperatures, iheii instead of the soliditicatioji described another
would occur along the lines AH', H'E'K', K'D causing the system
to ap|)ear as a binary one in which occurs a componnd which
enters iido equilibrium with its components in the liquid condition.
The position of these lines Ayilhin the tigui-e of the ternary system
is determined by the degree of dissociation of the liquid componnd.
If this is e.vtreuiely small, these lines a]tproach to AH, HEK and
KD, if very large they approximate to AG and (41) and the com-
pound does not appear as a solid j)hase. Solid Cl._, is deposited along
AH', solid S(1, along H'E'K', solid S.,C1., along K'D; H' and K'
are two eutectic points whei-e com|)lete solidification takes place.
These three lines are not only the fii'st series of solidifying i)oints of
the ditferent mixtures, but at the same time the crystallisation paths
of all mixtures.
Now with mixtures of S./'l._; and (M._j neither the first nor the second
case is quite realised. At the low temperatures at which the soli-
difications take ]dace, (!1.,. >S./3I.j and SCI^ behave as independent
components; foi- instance Gl., and S./'l., may be mixed in the ii(piid
condition without entering into combination and in this way the
two solidifying lines AG and GD (fig. I and 2) of these mixtnres
