The question naturally arose ; what could he the caux- of this

An investigation concei-ning this matter soon showed me that the
twigs ^vcl•e normal, and consequently had not heen \isited hy the

that the needles wei-e spotted on hoth sides, hut esj)ecially on the
lower side, with vei-y small hlack specks (Fig- 1).
These sjiecJcs, s|)read at random, sometimes more, sonuMimes less

epiderm, and it soon appeared that they had not heen hidden uiidei-

This residt was not ohtained hy examining cross-sectiojis, which
the \-ery minute specks did not allow to make, hut hy heating the
needles for a few mimites in a ten percent solution of caustic potash,
washing them, making them trans[)arent with chloral-hydi-ale, and
gently pressing them with a co\er-sli|). Under the niicroscoj»e light-
hrown. wavy, occasionally hifiircate<l threads or I'ihhons of varying
hi'eadth were seen oji the leaf, which in various places produce<l
little disks, from which new threads were sent out in some other
direction (Fig. 2).
The threads consisted of articulate hyphae and the disks of a
small-celled parenchym. IJy |»ressing the hiWvv moi-e sti-onu;iy and so
