If we put R"" — Afj^ = a^j and RAp -\- Aq A, = bp, and if we
represent the vector a^ ip^ i + a^ cp^j -\- a^ (p^ k, by (a) (f, we can write
the six equations of motion :
(a) ip= V.{b)xp.(p^ 2Rii — 2Av
{a)rp= V. (b) <p.xp i- 2Rv — 2A^i.
For absence of external forces:
(a) (f z= V . {b) \\i . (fi j
(h)
(a) ip = F . (6) y . ip I
In this form we can directly read :
l'*^ If in the initial position (p = tf', then <p remains equal to if%
i. e. if the initial rotation of S^ is a rotation // to a principal space
of inertia, then the motion remains a rotation // to that space. The
equations of motion for that case can be reduced to a system to be
treated as the well known Euler motion in S^ when the forces are
missing.
2'^'^. For unequal ^'s "invariable rotating" is only possible under
the following two conditions which are each in itself sufficient:
a. for (f and tp both directed along one and the same axis of
coordinate {X-, Y- or ^-axis of the representing spaces) i. e. for a
double rotation of S^ about a pair of principal phmes of inertia;
b. for (p = or xp = 0, i. e. for an equiajigular double rotation
of S,.
It has been pointed out by Kotter (see "Berliner Berichte"
1891, p. 47), how a system of equations analogous with what was
given, can be integrated. (The problem treated there is the motion of
a solid in a liquid). According to the method followed by him the
six components of rotation can be expressed explicitly by hyper-
elliptic functions in the time. If however we have y^, y-^, «/g, if>,, tf'j, if'j
expressed in the time, we have the "cones in the solid" for Sr and
Si. To deduce from these the "cones in space" we set about as
follows. We notice that the moment of motion to the right i?y + (yl) ip
in S^ remains invariable "in space" (in Si that vector changes of
course its direction, but there Rip -\- {A) p remains invariable) ; calling
the two spheric coordinates ("polar distance" and "length") of <ƒ; with
respect to Rp + (A) jp during the motion of .p in space ^h and / and
remarking that each element of the "cone in space" at the moment
of contact coincides with the corresponding element of the "cone in
the solid", we can express i^, x^ and x in the time, with which the
