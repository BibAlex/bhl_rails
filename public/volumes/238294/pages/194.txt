In the circuit of an accumulator (with a negligible resistance)
three resistance-boxes Ra, H^c, l^c aiid a fixed resistance R' are
introduced, of which the first serves to regulate the resistance in
the whole circuit, the second and third serve as shunts for two
circuits A and B in which the observation-element and the battery
of comparison-elements are insei-ted, while the third, a resistance
of 8000 f2 tested at the Phys. Techn. Reichsanstalt serves as a
shunt for the circuit C, in wliich is inserted a battery of Weston-
elements. These side circuits may be connected to the galvanometer,
each by means of its own commutator wdth mercury contacts (as
described in Comm. X". 27 see pi. V) and be commutated in order to
read in how tar we have attained tlie desired zero-adjustment by
regulation of the different resistances and to apply a correction for
the deflection which might have remained.
The principal resistance-boxes are adjusted by means of plugs like
the auxiliary boxes arranged in parallel for tlie finei* adjustment.
Tills is preferable to an adjustment with a slide-wire where also
small diilerences remain ^). As the Ra, Rw ^"d Re are known aitproxi-
mately beforehand, (with an adjustment at — 116° C. about 7290 ii,
40 52 and 40 i2 respectively) the current given by the Weston-
elements will always be very small. In order to make it still less
