followed l)v a double rotation eqniaiignlar to the left."
The |)iane of rolalion of the equiangular (h)uble rotation passing-
through tlie axis of rellectiou remains for both parts of the trans-
fornialion in an unaltered position; it undergoes by the double rotation
a congruent Iransformation and by the reflection a symmetric one.
The plane of I'olation of the equiangular double rotation situated
in the space per|)eiidicular to the axis of reflection i-emains also for
Itolli parts of the transformation in an unaltered position; it is not
transformed at the reflection and undergoes by the double rotation
a congruent transformation.
Those t\vo |»lanes of rotation are perpendicular to each other, so
that geometrically the wellknown property is proved:
"For synunetric transformation of S^ about a fixed point one pair
of jilanes remains at its place; and one phuie of it is transformed
congruently, the other symmetrically."

Dr. Pn. KouNSTAMM. (Comnuinicated by Prof, van der Waals).
Several of the methods ])roposed for the derivation of tlie equation
of state, make use of formulae for the mean length of path. It is
therefore not to be expected that we shall arrive at undoubted results
as to the former, so long as the results as to the latter quantity are
not concordant. Now it is generally known that van der Waals has
found for the length of path and the numl)er of collisions in a gas
with perfectly hard, perfectly elastic spherical molecules:
