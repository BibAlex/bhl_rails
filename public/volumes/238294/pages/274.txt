a great many wells lia\c heen sunk lor niililary piu-jtoses, niosl of
which well^ are about 50 M. t~ A.l*. deep. The le\(^ls in (licni were
repeatedly sounded by me, which, considering their large number,
led to important results. Sjiecially of great signiticancc^ is what those
soundings teach iis, as to the direction in which the deep underground
water moves. Subjoined table, in \vhich, as much as possible, only
wells of corresponding depths lia^e beeu put down, entirely confirms
what I found elsewhere.
Those soundings were done on .lune 5^'' 1903. The distances of
the wells to the H.M. polder itself, one will get by adding 80 M. to
the tigure that expresses the distance between them and the encircling
canal.

Here clearly comes out a motion of the deep underground water,
from the higher polders, north of the Haarlemmermeer polder,
towards this deep ])older. On 1200 M. of distance there is an
inclination of 0.22 M., or 1,8:10000, whereas in other directions,
there is no regular inclination. That indeed no general motion from
east to west or vice versa is to be thought of, naturally follows
from the comparison between the level of the water in ^vells thus
situated. For instance from the following row of wells, all at 25 M.
from the encircling canal of the H. M. polder.
