By subtracting these annual means for eaeli limb as they are
given in the second and third columns of' the table above from Ihe
means foi- the same limb h)r each daj' of the moon's age I obtained
for each jear a set of about 25 residuals and finally I combined
the corresponding residnals of the 8 years with their i-espective
weights.
These mean residuals follow here :

If we assume the adopted values for the inequalities depending
on D to be correct, the two preceding tables show us the effect
of the systematic errors of the obserx^ations. At a first glance at the
second table we perceive that the right ascensions observed at the
age of 4 and 26 days show abnormally great discordances, which
both agree in sign with those which would result if the observers
estimated the moon's diameter to be smaller when observed at
daylight.
If we except these two groups, the observations of the 2"^ limb
no longer show any regular increase, whilst the results for the
1^^ limb between the ages of 5 and 8 days still seem to vary somewhat
regularly. However, after due consideration of the case, I have ulti-
mately assumed the personal error to be constant for the first limb
