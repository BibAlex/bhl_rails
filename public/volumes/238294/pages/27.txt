and this expression is equal to 0, if a\ = ,t:^, but not otherwise.
Without using the equations the same conclusions may be drawn
geometrically from the properties of the saturation curve in the
p — X diagram ; if there are only one mininuim and one maximum
in the j) — .x'l curve, three points of intersection coincide in the critical
point and consequently there is a point of inflexion, if on the other
hand there is a minimum as well as two maxima, four points of
intersection coincide in the critical point and there will be a maximum
of the second order.
The whole argument thus turns on the question, whether it is
legitimate to assume as self-evident, that the point, wiiere .?\ = ,v^^,
remains between the two points, where ( — ^ ) :=i ; that this is
not the case follows from the fact that the condition ^\ = ,i\^ is
totally independent of the condition of critical contact between the
two saturation curves : in fact there are cases, such as those referred
to above, where the point i\ = x^ lies at a far distance from the
critical point, and others where there is no maximum or minimum
at all, either outside or inside the three-phase triangle, such as for
mixtures of ethane with the lower alcohol ^). The question therefore
arises and has to be answered : how does the point where x^ =^ x\,
which is known in many cases to be inside the two other maximum
