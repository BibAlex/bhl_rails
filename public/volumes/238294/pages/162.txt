Then we measured olF for the isotliennals of carbon dioxide which
lay between those of the mixtures, the situation of the former with
regard to the two neiglibonring isothermals of tiie latter ; this was
done for a number of points distributed at regular distances. Let
2\ and 1\ be the temperatures of the two neighbouring isothermals
of the mixture, and T' the temperature which for the mixture cor-
responds to that of the isothermal of carbon dioxide considered, then
r—2\
we obtain a great number of values for the relation tp = — — -.
We assumed that the isothermals coincided best when the mean
square of the differences of </) and the mean tp were as small as
possible.
Table XXIV, which refers to the comparison of the /c^ ^;-diagram
of the mixture 0.1 with that of carbon dioxide shows in the 3^' colunm
the afore-mentioned mean square of the differences, viz. for the
isothermals of 41.95^ C. and 37.09° C of carbon dioxide (after reduction
to the same temperature interval 1\ — 1\) coml)ined, for the different
superimposings of the coinciding systems indicated in the 1^' colunm,
while 1.85 of the mixture coincided with the values of log p for
carbon dioxide given in the 2"^ column.

In table XXV we find the data for the critical points of the mixtures
thus found, combined witli tlie data about the plaitpoints and the
points of contact, and also the critical points of carbon dioxide and
oxygen (the latter according to Oi.szewski). ^)
1) It here appears that in the diagram given in § 4 (p. 587 ) in order to
obtain the best agreement for the area of the larger volumes, the isothermals of
the mixture 0.1 must be moved 5 mm. to the left, those of the second mixture
G mm. to the right. The conclusions about the non-correspondence at the smaller
volumes, however, still hold, tlie deviations even increase.
