A reduced reproduction of the photos and of the results of both experiments,
in as much as they concern the 9*'' dermatoma, put together on, one sheet,
is given by fig. Ill (1, 2 and 5 to the right belonging to dog IX ; 3, 4 and
5 to the left belonging to dog I).
. Dog IX : To the right the sensible area is encompassed by a large insen-
sible zone, extending dorsally from the 4"' to the 12"» vertebra, ventrally
from 5 cm. below the manubrium sterni unto the middle of the neck. Its
caudal boundary-line bends towards the mid ventral line in a forward convex
arch, crossing first the scapular angle, and then following the plica axillaris
posterior.
The description of the boundary-line of the sensible area may begin on
the m. triceps (see fig. II T, 2). From thence it bends on the ventral side of
the extremity towards the sulcus bicipitalis medialis unto the commencement
of the axilla, where it takes a turn in opposite direction, continuing caudally
of the epicondylus medialis humeri, passing on the forearm over the thickest
part of the flexores and reaching along the ulnar margin of the plant, the
back of the hand between the 2'^ and 3'^ finger. Then it returns between the
plant and the back of the fingers (the plant of the 3'^ and 4*^ finger having
retained its sensibility, the back of both not), passing between the 4th and
Fis. IV. 7th and 8^^ root.

Dog VIII. The 7^^ and 8"» root isolated to the right
by cutting through the 4^^^ 5^^, Qn\ 9^^, lO^S 11th,
12th and 13th, to the left root 8 has been cut through.
