The relations (2) and (5) are the same as I have found before ■^)
for the special case m^^ = O, on the edge of the if'-surface, while
the expression for becomes the same when we put xi = or
.i'i-=::l. I also find again for the border curve on the /?, ?; diagram
of the mixtures at the temperature T to the first approximation the
same parabola of the fourth degree :
The plaitpoint, i. e. the apex of this parabola, coincides to the
first approximation with the point prk, vric^Tk- According as the
factor between brackets is positive or negative this parabola is turned
upwards or downwards; in the first case the special mixture has a
minimum vapour tension, in the second a maximum vapour tension.
The isobars. If in equation (18) I.e. p. 327 we consider x and v
as two variable quantities depending on each other and ]) as a
parameter, this equation represents the projection of the system
of isobars on the x, v-surface. If ?«oi ^^ere not zero this system
would resemble a system of isothermals with the point xtu, i^Tk
