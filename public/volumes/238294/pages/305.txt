So from the formnlae (u) ensnes that tlie effect of a reflection is
what we might call a reciprocal Into'chanije of S,. und Si, i.e. a
snchlike interchange that every vector of *S/ takes the place of that
vector of S , which has sul)stitnted itself for it.
Bnt now an arbitrary symmetric transformation of S^ can be
replaced by a reflection preceded or followed by a double rotation;
which is represented by a recipi'ocal ijiterchange of >S',- and *S'/
preceded or followed by a rotation of S,. and one of >S/; therefore:
The arbitrary symmetric transformation of S^ is represented by
an hitercliaiKje of S,- and S' in arhifracii posi/io/i.s.
Let ns now consider that for snch an arbitrary interchange of
Sr and Si a system of coordinates a of S,. is placed on a system of
cooi'dinates ,i of Si whilst that system of coordinates ji of Si itself is
placed on a system y of .S', ; then we can rei)lace the interchange
by a "reciprocal interchange'' placing a on /^ and (3 on a, followed
by a rotation of S,., placing a on y, or also by a rotation of S,,
placing a on y, followed by a reciprocal interchange, placing y on /i
and /9 on y.
Conseqnently we have proA'ed :
"An arbitrary symmetric transformation of aS'^ can be i-eplaced by
a reflection preceded or followed by a donble rotation eqniangnlar
