For tliis iipplication of the formulae of Comm. W. 75 it should
be borne in mind that in the derivation of them we have used the law
of corresponding states, while in § 4 (p. 587) it appeared that already
at the critical volumes deviations could be detected. As long as .v,
however, is very small, the points P for the different mixtures will
lie in an area Avhere according to Kamerlingh Onnes (comp. § 4)
the law of corresponding states may be considered to hold at least
to the first approximation, so that then we find an u and a /? for
the critical points for that area. The same may be said of the points
B. From the numbers given it appears that the values of « and /i
with relation to those points, at least to the first approximation, agree
with those relating to the critical point of the mixtures for the area
of the larger volumes.
For the slopes on the />7'-diagram for the plaitpoint- and the i»oint
of contact curve with small x, we find :
'£üm =-«.451 , ^Y^) =-0.044,
values which agree sufficiently.
For the slopes of the curves which in the same diagram connect
the points K and P we find :

From either side, therefore, there is an approach towards the \ alue
1.610, which both quotients must have for very small x.
§ 9. From the foi-mulae given in § 7 it \vould follow that the
largest |)laitpoint pressure to be expected in mixtures of carbon
dioxide and oxygen would be 132 atms. (with .r = 0.57), while the
largest value for 7'„— ^V' would be expected to be 15'. 7 C. (with
