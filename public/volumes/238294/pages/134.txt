A similar \ariation of an air manometer with the time, probat>l\
owing to the ahsoi'ption of oxygen in the niercnrv, lias also been
noted \)\ Ktknkn and RoissoN (Phil. Mag. Jan. '02 p. 150).
In the mixtm-es of the molecular proportions 0.1 and 0.2 of
oxygen the vai'iations of the noi-mal volume were less than In
1000
those cases we ha^•e acce}ite(l for the normal volume the mean
of the vahies before and after the measin-ements.
On the other haiul, in a mixture with a molecular pi'oportion of
0.3072, w Inch for some weeks had uninterruptedly been exposed to
high pressure, the normal volume of 72.878' cc. before the expe-
riments (15 June '03) had fallen to 70.980 cc. after the e\))ei'iments
(13 Ang.). It being highly ])robable that the variation of the normal
volume involves a considerable variation in com{)osition, the results
of the measui-emenis with this mixture which with regard to the ejid
condensation jji-essnres and vol tones extended to — 14''.7 C., will
not be given hei'e.
This also shows how very imporiant it is that we should be

From the observation of the \'olume occupied \)\ the gas at a
temperature of about 20 ('. and a pressure of about 1 atnios|)hei-e
