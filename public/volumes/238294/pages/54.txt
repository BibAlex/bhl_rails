The latter would liave required a s|)ecial iiiveslii>atioii of those

We have :
1860 1900

Hansen 26"74 8"03
Newcomb 27.00 8.26
Newcomb Sun 26.81 7.97
()n closer eonsidei-alion, however, we see that we t)ughl not to use
the absolutely most pi-obable value of the oblicpiity, but that it is
best to adopt for each sei'ies of ol)sei-vations of the moon the value
wliieh is derived from the observations of the sun whieh have been
made at the same time and with the same instrument and have been
reduced in the same way. For it may l)e easily seen that in this
way we eliminate for the gi'eater part the ei-rors in the refraction,
the fle.xure of Ihe instrument etc. Some systematic errors, namely
those depending on the conditions of the ol)servalions which are
dilfei'eut for the sun and for Ihe moon will be retained undiminished
in the results, yet I hold Ihe course |)roposed here for the best,
uidess elaborate researches on the errors of the oi)servat ions have been
made. In this way, at any rate we may gel some insight into the
iidluence which the values adopted for the reduction elements of the
observations have on the elements derived for the jilanc of the
moons orbit.
20. For Ihe jjcriods discussed l)y Xkwco.mh and l)y myself we
must therefore find the values of the obli(|uily of the ecli[»lic which
folloxv directly from the observations as iIh^ are gixen in the Annals
of Greenwich and of Washington.
For (Treenwich I could use the resulting values given for each
year in the (rreenirich ohsci-rittioiis ajid derive from them Ihe correc-
tions of Hansen's obli(|uity. For 1895 — 1902 these corrections \vere
coml)ined into one mean, i»ut the |)eriod 1862 — 1874 wa^ divided
into two [)arts: 1862 — 67 and 1868 — 74, because in the year 1868
Stone's refraction constant had come into use, which is smaller by
about O-S^/o than that of Bessel. There are also dilFerences between
