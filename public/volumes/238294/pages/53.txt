Considering these i-esult- it seems possihh' tlial we must assume
the existence of a |tei'iodic term in !>. \\\\\ for tiie present \N'e
cannot go farther and we must await the resuHs of other series of
observations before wc can ^ formulate more detinite conchisions.
I will now oidy aihl liie foHowing remark. As within each year
the observations are fairly regularly distributed oxer the anomalistic
revolution, the fact that in the presejit investigation we have disre-
garded the corrections of the h)ngitu(le depending on i] cannot liave
had an appreciable infbietu'e on tlie determination of the A and <•
from the scpai"ate years. ( )n th<' otlier hand an apparent pei-io(Hcity
in the '7 may have ai-isen from it.
The corrections of the longitude albukMl to ai-e of the form:
(\ I -=i .V .v/;/ (ƒ/ -[- ■/)
where */ is a slowly xai-ying angle. The corresponding cori'ecticuis
that ought to l)e a])[)lied to the (hM'liuatioii> are:
iSiS -- 0.40 rr).s / X '^^ ■^■'" (ƒ/ -■ X)
= 0.20 .V .v/// (2 (J f- rr -|- /) — <>.2() .. .s/„ (.t — -/)
i. e. partly nearly half-monthly terms, partly t(n'ins of iojig peri((d
which modify the \alues found foi- <i.
From the largest term in the correction of the longitude:
(SI— \- 1".28 sh, {,1 -f A' — 00°)
arises a term :
(S(S— — ()".2<; .-/■;/ {n — A' -f 90')
which term has a period of 17 years.
