5 M. hclow A. P. — and that the fine-gTaiiied sand intermixed with
cday of the original npperlayers for a great pait \y\\] have been
rephiced bv coarser sea-sand, must considerably have contributed
towards greatly increasing the pression-tall of the deep underground
Avater, at tiie sea-side. At high-tide the flowing o(f however is very
small, and all things considered, the flowing off of the water from
the dunes, at the polderland side, certainly will not be less consideral)le
than that towards the sea.
But let us drop this subject, too few facts being at our dis[)osal
to Judge of that complicated pi-ocess, and watch the influence of the sea-
Avater at a greater distance fi'om the coast. There can exist no doubt
as to the underground of our low-lands being soaked with sea-water. In
none of the borings executed in the last scores of years, if oidy deep
enough carried through, the i)roof of it was laclving; more or less deep,
according to circumstances, but the underground water showing an ever
increasing quantity of salt, highly exceeding that of all })olders ditches
oi' canals, exceeding even that of the Zuiderzee. In or near the dunes,
one inust go much deeper to find sea-water, than in the polders;
and in the |)olders, on higher ground, as a rule, deeper than in those
lower situatcfl. In the Brouwerskolkje, at a depth of 72 M. -7- A.P.,
the percentage of chlorine did not exceed that of surface dune- water,
neither was this the case in wells of the Harlem water-works, deep
.54M.^-A.P.; nor in the one, in the dunes at Elswout, 80 M. -f A.P.
dee[) ; nor in the Rieker polder at more than 50 M. ~ A. P. Near
the Hnis-de- Vraag, in the north-east corner of the Rieker polder,
down to 82.5 M. t- A.P. only 34 m.G. chlorine a Liter was found;
at 46.5 M. -f A.P. iu)t moi-e than 81 in.G. ; and near "Het Kalfje",
on the Amstel, south (»f Amsterdam, at 31 M. ^ A.P., only 47 m.G.
a Liter. At Purmerend, situated in shallow polders, with Summer
Levels of 1.25 to 1.60 M. ^ A.P., but surrounded by the deep
Purmer- (Summer-Level ^ 4.47 M.), the Beemster- (S.L. -^ 4.00 M.)
and the Wijdewormer polder (S.L. -7- 4.50 M.), the water rising from
50 M. ^ A.P., has a quantity of oidy 43 m.G. of chlorine a Liter. The
well-water at Schermerhorn, in shallow i)olders, het\veen the deep
Beemster- and Schermer polders, at 76 M. -f- A.P. deep, contains 170
m.G. chlorine a Liter. Although the underground watei- in those
deep polders, on the whole is brackish, the quantity of chlorine
was only 192 m.G. a L. in the Purmer polder, at about 1 K.M.
from the encircling dike, in the direction of Purmerend on the Wester-
weg, and 600 M. north the church. Similar fresh deep underground
