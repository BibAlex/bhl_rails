§ 3. So we arrive at equation (4) witlioiit making use of the
equation of tlie virial ajid witiioiit speaking of repulsive forces. That
the introduction of tliese and tiie determination of the so-called
"repulsive virial" in the same waj as has been done by Lorentz,
Tait and Boltzmann, leads to the same result, is easy to see, if we
|/2rr;i.v- \/2 .ins''
put everv where ,j mstead of — for the number of
V V
collisions in the formidae used by fhem. The exi»ression (3 does not
depend on any of the integrations and the repulsive virial yields
J' l>
iherefore MT — ,i instead of RT -. This is easv to understand, even
i'
without following the proofs of I^orentz and Fjoltzma.nn, for it is
clear that the term which is introduce<l into the equation of the
virial through the collisions, must l)e ])roportio]ial to the number of
those collisions, as two collisions can never be of a different kin(P).
It seems therefore as if theory really leads to the form expected
by Tait and DiETERifi, ^\ hicli conforms so little with the experiment.
In reality, however, the result is quite dliferent. For — as I pointed
out in my other communication — ^i has l)y first approximation not

by carrying out the division and by neglecting tlie terms of higher

Xow it is true that the other coefficients of this series, C\ and B
excepted, are unknowji, and we might conclude from this, that it
must therefore be iiKHfrcreiit for the present, whether the equation
of state is wj-itten
