OXi Yi Zi (defined in the same place) the S,. and >S'i introduced just
now prove to be identical with those introduced here formerly (see
Proceedings March, 1904, p. 725} so that they represent not oidy
l)y their motions the equiangular motion groups of S^ to the right
and to the left, but also by their vectors the systems of i>lanes equi-
angular to the right and to the left (with direction of rotation) of
S^ and so that the angle of Ihe representing vectors is tlie angle of
the systems of planes themselves.
So also to congruent combinations in the twodimensicmal mani-
foldness formed by the equiangular systems of planes to the right
(left) correspond congruent combinations in S,- (<S,). This is an algebraic
proof for 2"f^. to its full extent.
This deduction has at the same time made clear the meaning of
the four parameters of homogeneity for the general congruent three-
dimensional transformation about a fixed point, namely the cosines
of direction of the vector indicating the corresponding equiangular
double rotation to the right (left) of an S^ of which this S^ is
the Sr (Si) and the svstem of axes in S^ the system OXr Y, Zr
