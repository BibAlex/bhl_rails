From this general formuhi Clausius crnild easily determine 7^ and /
also for our case. He has only lo take into account that in a
collision the centre of a molecule nnist necessarily be on the surface
of the distance sphere of the other. If ^ve. tlierefore, want to delei-mine
tlie numl)er of collisions of the former, we need only see how great
the chance is that this molecule will strike against the surface formed
by the distance spheres.
We get then:
/= -^ P — r
Clausius observes, however, that not all surface elements can be
struck Ity the moving point, viz. not those which are found within
distance spheres. In the same way we must subtract from the
Aolume V the volume lying within the distance spheres. By deter-
mining the area of these surface elements by first a}»proximation,
Clausius obtains:
