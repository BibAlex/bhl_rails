A closoi- sfiidy of tlic ('li;iii,aos in voltiiiie wliicli take place in these

it probable I hat SCl.^ is chietly formed and in addition also SCl^,
The e(|iiilibriinn between S^Cl^, SCl.^, SCl^ and Cl.^ which takes
place in the li(|idds is nol niodilied to any extent by coolin*;' below
0" and i-emains totally unchanged at those low temperatures at
which these mixtures may de])osit solid substances. This gives rise,
during the solidification, to very peculiar phenomena which, up to
the preseid, have not been noticed with (jflier systems but which
may be explained by the views of the phase doctrine.

On the other hand nothing noteworthy occurs with mixtures con-
taining 50 — 100 atomic per cent of S. These behave entirely like
mixtures S.,C1., -j- S. The nielting point of S,(J1., ( — 80') is lowered
by sulphur to F; the melting poijit of sidphur is also lowered by
S,C1, from B (120") to F.
At a low temperature the solid)ility of S in H,,C\^ is very small.
The solid)ility or melting point line of S consists of two curved lines
