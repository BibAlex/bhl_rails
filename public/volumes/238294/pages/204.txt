mixtures of carbon dioxide and livdrogen to use the kui p, loq v
diagrams, as I found tiiat not onlj the logarithmical diagrams of
the pure substances but also tliose of the four mixtures investigated
could be made to coincide with the logarithmical diagram of carbon
dioxide hy shifting them parallel to each other.
Unfortunately Quint made only few observations in the neigh-
bourhood of the critical point, a circumstance which rendered this
investigation rather diflicult. For it is by means of those very parts
situated in the neighbourhood of the point of inflection that the
superimposing of the diagrams may be obtained in the most accurate
way, while in the area of the larger volumes a shifting within rather
wide limits does not cause a perceptible deviatio]) of the superim-
posed diagrams. Especially the want of observations in the neigh-
bourhood of the critical point in the case of hydrochloric acid is to
l)e regretted because the ditFerence between the critical point given
by Quint and that found by shifting is much larger than we should
expect, the diagrams covering each other in a satisfactory way. The
more so because, when for ethane and carbon dioxide the diagrams
are made covering each other in the observed area the critical poiiits
too coincide.
Here follow the values found, for the different mixtures, as ele-
ments of the critical point of the homogeneous mixture:

In order to make a comparison I have written in this table the
plaitpoint elements of the mixtures as observed by Quint, and in
NT'
the last line the values of the expression C\ = ~ which here

are about the same for all the mixtures, especially in the neigh-
bourhood of the special mixture. By means of Quint's data we find
however, for HCl, the much larger number C^ = 3,71 ; this deviation
evidently must be brought in connection with the other one I mentioned
before.
