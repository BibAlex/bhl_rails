The enne C lias in /^ llireo sucressivo |)<>iiils in common with
the phme V. The cni-ve 6' is sitnated on llie sni-hice O, so tlie tln'ee
common points mnst lie on the section of () with V. This section
consists of the curve d and of the common tangent / in P of C
and (/, counting doul)le. In the following w-ay can be proxed that
of the three common points only two lie on d.
Let us first take instead of a general curve a twisted cubic 6'j.
Let F be the origin ; the property being projective the plane at
infinity can be chosen in such a way, that the curve is i-epresented
by the equations
,,; = t\ y =z t\ z ^t.
If now i]i point t = the curxes C, Jind (I„ had three common
points then in the origin also the radii of curvature of the two
curves Avould be the same. Let R be the radii of curvature of
Cj iu P and /• the radius of curvature of d^ in P, we then easily
find :
E = = --^— — — .
1
So for ^ =: we find 7^ = -.
The surface 0^ is enveloped by the plane
,r — 3tjt-\-3z f' — t' = 0.
So the curve (/., is enveloped by the line
— 3^ + 3^^ — ^1=0
Consequently the equation of d^ is
3
2
so the radius of curvature r = -. The curves C3 and d.^ have in
o
the origin not the same radius of curvature, so they have not three
or more points in common.
Let j? be the orthogonal projection of C^ on V (,/; = 0), then C\
has with jj three successive points in common in /\ for all jioints
which ('3 has in common with T"^ must lie on the section p of V
with the projecting cylinder of C\. The projection p has for e(piation
and so also the radius of curvature in the origin P = -, showing
again that the curves p and C\ have in the origin three points in
common.
