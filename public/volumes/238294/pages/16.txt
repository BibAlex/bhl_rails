Obviously tlic last values cannot be vcrv cei-tain.
After (lins having formed (he total corrections to be ap|)lie(l to
the mean lonu'iliide, Ihey have been I'ednced (o corrections of tlu^
I'iglil ascensions. Kor this I'cdiiction I could use ihe \alues F and

7. The A (I corrected in this way were now used to derive from
them the corrections of the true longitude, which depend on the
sine and cosine of the, mean anomaly. In his JuvesfU/ation p. 16
Newcomb has showen that for this purj)ose we may use instead of
the residuals of true longitude those of right ascension and although
the error of the longitude of the iiode which is assumed to be
small lias increased since 18G8, his conclusion still holds.
For each year the A a were arranged in 18 groups according to
the values of the mean anomaly, the first group containing those
between ƒ/ = 0^ and 2(V, the second those between </ = 20" and
4(r etc. Then the sums and the means for each grouj) were formed
and Avere regarded as corresponding to 7 =: 10'^, 7 = 3Cr etc. just
as had been done by Newcomb.
If we represent the corrections wiiich are to be applied to the
true longitude of Hansen by
d7 = — Ii sin (J — k cos g
we obtain for each year 18 equations of the form
c -|- h sin g -\- k cos ^ = ?'
where c is the outstanding mean error of longitude, whilst for h
and l the signs are in accordance Avitli Newcomb.
The equations were solved for each year by least squares with
due regard to the weights of r, which were assumed to be pro-
portional to the number of observations used.
So I obtained the following values of h and k -.
h k
1895.5 + 0"29 + 0"44
1896.5 +O.GG +1.16
1897.5 -fO.57 +1.77
1898.5 +0.51 +2.10
1899.5 —0.98 +2.83
1900.5 —1.66 +1.12
1901.5 —1.46 +0.52
1902.5 —1.18 +0.01
It is obvious that these coefficients cannot result from errors in the
