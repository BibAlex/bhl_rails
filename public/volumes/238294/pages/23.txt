logue are greater by + 0."6, -{- 0."1 and -f 0."5 respectively than
those of the transit observations at Greenwich ^).
As to the occultations, it is proved by H. G. v. d. Sandf. Bak-
HUYZEN '^) that vahies for tlie moon's longitude derived from them will
generally be too small and therefore it is probable that the moon's
longitude according to the observations at Greenwich is still in iieed
of a positive correction.
III. Investigation of the errors of tile latitude.
10. My investigation of the errors of the moon's latitude was
based on that of the errors in declination.
First 1 tried to determine the constant errors in the obser\ations of the
moon's declination and to this end I utilized the observations from
1895 to 1899. From the diiferences A <ƒ =: Comp.— Obs. I derived
mean values for each of the two limbs for each month of the year
and from them annual means were derived by taking the mean of
the monthly means without regard to their weights.
In this way I obtained the results given in the following tal)]e.
The 2"^^ and 3"^ columns contain the annual means for the north
limb and the south limb, the 4*^'^ the means of the two, the 5'^'i their
differences i.e. the errors of the moon's diameter, while the G^'u-on-
tains this same error derived oidy fi-om siiiiidtaneous obser\ations
of the two limbs near full mooji.

last difference, instead of + 0."5, becomes +0."3 {Added 1903 Dec.)
