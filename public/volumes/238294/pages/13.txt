seen from an examinination of Newcomb's elaborate investigation,
laid down in his "Astronomical constants" p. 148 — 151.
Therefore I thonght it best to leave ont an independent determination
of the coefficient of the parallactic ineqnality. For in the first place
the investigations of the last yeai-s have yielded a value of the solar
parallax that must be pretty accurate and. in the second place the
direct determinations of the parallactic inequality that are entirely
or partly free from the disadxantage mentioned, namely those of
Battermann ^) from occultations observed at Berlin and those of
Franz') from transit observations of the crater Mosting ^1 made at
Königsberg, give results which agree satisfactorily with the most
probable value of the solar parallax.
Whilst as this most probable value we may consider ct = 8". 796,
the investigations of Battermann and Franz yield:
Battermann 1884—85 rr = 8".794
„ 1894—96 8. 775
Franz 1892 8. 770')
On the other hand NEWco:\rB derived from the transit observations
of the limbs by eliminating as far as possible the systematic errors:
Neavcomb 1862—94 rr = 8."802.
I have adopted jz = 8". 796, hence as the correction of the value
used ultimately by Hansen in the Tables de la Lune: drr = — 0".120,
whence as correction of the coefficient of the principal term of
the parallactic inequality in the mean longitude:
cfP=— 14.10 X rf'T^ = + i"-69
and P= — 124".01
The correction of the value adopted by Newcomb becomes:
5. I now proceeded as follows. The residuals A « for each year
were arranged according to the observed limb and the true age
of the moon expressed in days. In this way each year yielded
25 groups of residuals and for each of them the mean value was
derived.
