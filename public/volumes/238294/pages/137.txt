The af2;reenient of the pressures is salisfactor\ , that of the \ (ilumes
of the liquid leax'es to be desii-ed. Althoiiuh thi-> is partly explained
by the circumstance that the xolume of the li(pnd cannot be read
so accurately because the form of the meniscus is not so sharply
determined as is the case with mercury, and parallax coidd not
so easily be avoided as with the mercury menisci, it yet ap[)eai"s
that, if we desire to iii\ estimate this subject more fidly. more care shoidd
be taken to procui-e e(juilibriuni by stirring aJid waiting.

manometer was surrounded by a Jacivct with llowing watei' kept at
constant tem|)ei'ature by a thernatstal. as described by S( iiai.kw i.ik
(Comm. N". 70, Proc. May '01) with the modilication in the thermo-
regulator described in Conini. X". 78 (Proc. April 1902 |). 7H2).
In the same way the experimental tul)e was kept at constant
temperatui-e by means of a second theiinostat. This dilfered from
the former in the following respects:
The connection l>etween the heating bath and the mixing bath,
the mixing bath and the connection between the mixhig bath and
the observatioji bath ha\e been insulated more carefully by means
of wool, paj)er and felt; this was necessary because greater differences
of temperature with the sini-ounding atmos[)here occur here.
To the glass portion of the thernun-egnlator a side-tube with a
cock is sealed ou, which facilitates the adnussiou of a «piaulily of

rubbei' tube is comiected with that side-tid)e, into the tliermorenidalor
