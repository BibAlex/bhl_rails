The (lata about 7',^/ could be represented very accnratelv by a
quadratic function.
We may expect that for values of ,v outside the range of obser-
vation these formulae will show important deviations from the
experiment, because errors in the observations for .v = 0.1 and
,v = 0.2 pass over increased into the values for the other range. This
holds especially for T^k, pxk and z^t, which are exposed to so much
more sources of errors than the other quantities.
§ 8. From the formulae given above we find :
« = — 0.6563 , ,i = — 1.0871,
y— __ _^M ^ = 0.5422%
Vic V dx Jx^O
while u — ^ = 0.4308. That this value does not agree better with
the value of y found directly, while in ^ 6 we found that for the
two mixtures the relation was properly satisfied, is due to
Txk
the representation by the above-mentioned fiuictions, which may be
expected to show just at the limits the largest deviations with regard
to the difïerential quotients.

(as according to Comm. No. 81, Pi'oc. Oct. 1902, p. 350 the sanu'
formulae hold for these quantities) have been combined with the

first column indicates from which point the data have been derived.
