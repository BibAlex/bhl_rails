is equiangular to the right, then to the equiangular double rotation
to the right of S^, indicated by OPj. coi-responds the rotation of S,-
about OPr equal to the length of OPr in the direction of OQr -^ OSr.
Let OP'r be another indicating vector and let us determine in an
analogous way OQr and OS'r, then the orthogonal systems of vectors
OWPrQrSr and
OWF.QrS'r
are congruent, can thus be made to coincide by a rotation of S^,
with OW, thus Sr too, remaining in its place, so that the indicating
vector OPr by a motion of Sr in itself can be made to coincide
with the indicating vector OP'r in such a way, that at the same
time the directions of rotation of Sr belonging to it coincide in the
normal planes. But then an indicating vector in Sr represents that
velocity of rotation entirely in the way usual in space of three
dimensions, as also by its length it indicates the size of the velocity
of rotation of Sr belonging to it; if namely we endeavour to regard
the definition of that usual mode of representation entirely apart
from the notion ''motion with or against the hands" which is lacking
in /S4 ; and say simply after having taken in that space a system
of coordinates OXYZ: the vector of rotation will be erected to
that side of the plane of rotation, that for the plane of rotation
being by motion inside the space made to coincide with the plane
of XY in such a way, that the direction of rotation runs from OX
to OY, the vector of rotation is directed along the positive axis of -.^.
Yov us that system of coordinates in Sr'- OXr, OYr, OZr has
been chosen in such a way that with OW \i forms a system of
coordinates in S^, for wdiich
OYr, 0Z,\ /OZr, OXr\ /OXr, OYr'
PXr, OW/ yOYr, OW/ \OZr, OW ^
are equiangular to the right.
A vector along OXr then indicates a rotation of Sr in the sense
of OYr -^ OZr.
Entirely analogous reasonings hold good for S[. It being however
more profitable to be able to say also for Si: a vector along OXi
represents a velocity of rotation of S[ in the sense of Yi -Â» OZi,
we must modify the preceding either by choosing the system
OXi Yi Zi W in such a way that
