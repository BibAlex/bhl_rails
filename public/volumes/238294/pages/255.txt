After a preliminary experiment had proved that tlie toxic limit
of Cu SO4 for potato lay below a concentration of 0,005 granmiol.
per litre, four fragments of potato were dried with filtering-papei",
weighed, and placed in solutions of Cu SO4 containing:
a 0,001 ; h 0,002 ; c 0,003 and d 0,004 gr. mol.
The bits of potato weighed respectively :
a 3,775 ; h 3,225 ; c 2,860 and d 3,195 gr. ;
After having stayed in the solutions for 24 hours, they were
dried and weighed again, the results being :
a 4,620; h 3,310; c 2,895 and d 3,260 gr.
So they all had absorbed water; the toxic effect of the cupric
sulphate penetrating at the same time would now soon become
apparent, however. The bits were washed and placed in water from
the supply (water from the dunes); after 24 hours they weighed:
a. 4,670; h. 3,350; c. 2,825 and d. 3,150 gr.
This time c. and d. had lost weight and this loss increased steadily
during the following day, whereas a and b went on absorbing water.
The toxic limit of Cu SO4 for bits of potato weighing 3 — 5 grammes
consequently lies, after 24 hours, between 0,002 and 0,003 grammol.
per litre, i.e. between 0,03 and 0,05 per cent (molecular weight of
Cu SO, = 159).
Henceforth a piece of tissue was considered undamaged if, after
having stayed in the poisonous solution for 24 hours and then for
another 48 hours in water (once or twice renewed), it had, at all
events, not lost weight, if it had not gained. It is obvious that in
these experiments only such organs can be used as will remain alive
for a fairly long time, when immersed in water. I can state concerning
potatoes, that normal fragments, placed in water which was daily
renewed, even after 18 — 20 days did not lose weight but absorbed
small quantities of water. It made no difference, at least within this
period of time, whether water from the supply or distilled water
was used. In all similar experiments the results obtained by weighing
are confirmed in a striking manner by the circumstance that bits of
potato, when they die oft', turn dark-grej^ (conversion of tyrosine
into homogentisinic acid by enzyme-action). Also various other parts
of plants show some similar phenomenon which may serve as a
check, in the first place the diffusion of colouring matter, as with
red beetroot. Begonia and others.
In the manner described above, also the harmful limit of con-
centration may be determined of neutral mineral salts which in a
certain dilution are innocuous for a long time, but in more concen-
