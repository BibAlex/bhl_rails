tr;msil (»\'er llic middle tliivad should lake place nxm'v near ihc middle,
tlie transits over the otliei' threads were ohserxed on either side of'
it. it niav he easily slio\\ n. however, that in the present ease no
appreciable errors can arise from this.
in th(^ lii'st place we sludl show that e\'eii the (M-rors in tjie ahso-
Inte zcjiith distances g-enerally will he small. l»y the symmeti-ical
arranti'einenl of the ol)ser\ati()ns, the inHnence of" an inclination of the
I'eticnle as a \\ hole will he eliminated from the mean resnlt and
the intlnence of the cnr\atni-e of the parallel of altitude ^vill always
he small for my observations. A\ a horizontal distance c from the
middle of the tield the influence of the cnr\atui'e of the parallel on
the zenith distance is :

A r = — <•'■' c<>f(i. : xiii 1"

Now the pro[»ortio]i of the hoi'izontal to the vertical motion, putting
for the parallactic angle ^>, is cotj/. [j, and for a transit over a thread
at a distance / fVom the middle thread the cori-ection of the zenith
distance will be
A^ = — /'" rof(r p cotq z sin 1"

while the extreme threads ai-e at distances of alx>nt IT"* or 250" from
the middle thread. In one observation, tiiat of 1901 Febi-. 25, \vhich
owing to the inifavonrable i-elative ])ositions of the moon and the
star ])erhaps had best l)e excluded, the value of <"('///. /> was 0.(58,
while for the rest its greatest value amoiiuted to 0.34 and it was
generally nuich smaller. In the uiost nnfavourable case, therefore, we
have for the extreme threads <■ = 170" and A: = 0".08. Tn all the
other observati<nis we have always A: <^ 0".02.
The inlluence on the dillereuce between the zenith distances of
the moon and the stai', however, is nnich smaller still, as the moon
and the stai' always differed little in declination and hence at the
nn)meins of the ol)servalions wci-e at about the same ]»arallactic
angle. The dilference between the juirallactic angles was, excluding
the obsei'xatiou of 1901 Fein-. 25. foi' which p — y/=:7^ in maxinio
l)°. So the inlluence of the cur\ature of the pai'allel is almost entirely
eliminated iji the results of the observations. The same is the case
with the inlbuMice of the inclination of the indixidual threads.
That 1 did uoi follow the star in azimuth has therefore had no
injurious consecpiences and uo coi-rec(ions are reipiired. ()n the other
hand the consequence may ha^•e been that the stability of the instrument
during each transit was greater.
