The diJfereiicc is hiruer than can he aHcribed to the errors in tlie
ohsci-vation. The deviation is in the same sense as foUows from
Ama(tAt's experiments. The fohowing- might serve as an exphmation

Aceordinji' to a remai'k of I'rof. I\A.MKRLiNr.n ( )nnks from whom a
new paper on the cause of the (h^xiations near the ci-itical point may
l)e expected (eom[i. ("omni. X". 74, Arcli. Xcerl. série II, t. A I, [>. <S<S7)
the appearance of tlie mist in the nci,ulil)onrhood of fjie critical
point seems to indii-ate that a [)ai-t of the snbslancc condenses round
numci-ons centra e([uallv distriltuted o\ cr the \N"iiolc s[)ace. That oidv
in this area this appears so distinctlv, niijiht lie ascribed to the cir-
cnmstance that here small forces are snlKicient to cause great variations
of dcnsitv. These con(h'Usation-> niiiiht ha\e a perceptible influence
for instance on the satni-alion \-olume although the \ariation of the
j)rcssure would not become perceptible in conse(pience of it.
In a comparison of mixtures with pure sul)stances accordiiig to
the \a\y of correspoiKbug stales we must disregard those conden-
sations, as ihe\ do no! occur at corrcs[»onding points (in mixtures
near the piaitpoiut . Hence our jmrpose will ])robabl\- be served best
if \\(' adopt foi- the critical xobiuie; ().()044o, as tliis \alue according
