\\\o ()]»(Miiiig' ill the boKom A\j ol' Ihe lul)e X/j^^^ by means of a
screw in A^^,,, al)ove tlio side inlet lnl)e N,.. for metiiyleliloride. The
Inbe with cock Xb rests loosel}' in the sjiecial tube /A;,. The joint
is closed by caontchonc J)e., on the enlaruenieni A\,., and allowance
is made in tliis manner for the relati\e slliftin<i- of the tubes owing'
to change of temj)eratiire.
This arrangement is nsed when metiiyleliloride at the ordinary
temperature is admitted to the ajjparatns. 'I'lie cock AMnsnlated from
the tube Dc is l<e])t at the ordinary tempei'atiire by the thick iron
ring iSc i^Jid the caoutchouc at the njiper end thus remains soft
while otherwise having become i»rittle by cooling it would break
owing to the uneciiial displacement of X and JX. It is always neces-
sarv to introduce the metiiyleliloride ai (he oi'dinary temi)erature
A\ Ikmi it is not (piite pure and i\v\ \ otherwise the cock will be
frozen fast. A cock of the model A' is \-ery appr()])riated for the
admission of niethylchlorido at tlu^ ordinaiy tem|)eratin-e.
A good nuMliod for pni-ifying the necessary (piantily of metiiyleliloride
consists in draw iiig (ill' iIk' iiiethy Ichloridc in the boiling vessel by means
of the cock A' and causing it to evaporate by condensing ethylene in
the spiral. If the cock freezes, Ihe pressure is made ecjual to that of
the atmos|)liere by shutting /. oil', or if Jiecessary bringing the ajipai-atiis
in coiiii(>elioii with the sacks .0 (1*1. 11.) ihroiigh A. A' can then be
taken oiil of /),. IJefore using the llask after a process of purilication
il is lirsl dried by the aid of the tube and c(tck 7',.
If the inethylchloride is lirsl cooled by contact with a cold gas,
as is shown a! ^' on PI. II next to the principal drawing, the inlet
tube passes ihroiigh an ordinary cock A';.
'J'lie cock 7'/, serves to introduce the ethylene to be condensed, the
cock 7',., which is placed on wood and jiacked in wool, to draw it oft'.
The cock 7', is inserted in th(^ lube J/,, which runs to Ihe bottom
of the cylindrical s|»ace (' ami is used for cleaning and drying.
The |»osilion of the li(piid metiiyleliloride can be seen from the
float J\. which moves u|) and down in the central tulie C ',., , itself
i]i connecliou with the space round the sjiiral through the lube
( \i . \\\ iiKMus of an aluniinium wire, a silk vovd and a plalinum
wire, /\. is joined to a silk cord /-*,, which passes oxer Ihe [udley
Qi, into Ihe glass tube (l,, where il is attached to a weight /^,
which runs along a scale fixed to the lube (I,.
