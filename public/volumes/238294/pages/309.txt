therefore undoubtedly right. But it follows by no means from this
that also the mean path is smaller in the first case. For it is t-lear,

that among the molecules of the group in question which in the
period T reach S, there are some which have their last point of
collision close to S, e.g. in D. These molecnles with their verv short
path do not count for the group which reach B. On Ihe otliei' hand
there will be others whose last point of collision lies so far from !>,
e.g. in E, that they can reach B, but not *S' in the interval of time
T under consideration ; they must therefore be taken into account
for B, but not for S. That the mean path remains unchanged a\ hen
we take these circumstances into consideration is l)est seen by thinking
the space, in which the last points of collision lie, divided by planes
parallel to ]> or S. It is clear that all molecules which have their
last point of collision in pai'ts marked by the same number, (Fig. 2)
hax'e the same |ialh ; also clear that those points of collision are
reu-ulai'lv dis(rilmte<l o\ei- the whole xoliinu^ and that the volume
of the parts with the same numbers is the same, bO that also the
mean patli must be the same. So
if the reason of correction given by

then the formula (3) would strictly
apply unmodiiied ; this is, howe\er,
not the case, as there is anothei"
reason for correction, which we have
not taken iido account as yet, as this
