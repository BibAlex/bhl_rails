beeonie disinte.UTatcd, so that, on aceouiU of similar cases, there
could be no doubt that the casl-oj'l" cells were the means of
multiplication and had consequently lo be considered as conidia.
These conidia, from which new infections may be expected, arc^
mostly 5 — B ft hi^li and 5 ft broad, have a li,L>ht-brown coloui- and
are perfectly smooth. \W far the «ireater pai't of them are nndixided;
oidy a few show [)erpendicnlar or incbned |)artilions.
If we now ask Avhat harm is done to Lariü deck/iitf. by \hc a\n)y(}
described fungus, the answer can onl}^ be that the stomata are blocked
up and rendered useless by it ; that the function of the leaves is
interfered \vith, and that Ihe chlorophyll is changed in such a manner,
that its assimilative power is reduced, and that evaporation is in no
small measure prevented. This is proved by the brownish colour of
the leaves i-eplacing the green one. In one and the same spiral of
needles, such as are found with Larix, the moi-bid pi-ocess i)rocee(ls
from the outside to the interior, so that for a considerable [)eriod
needles of two colours are observed on the rosettes.
As the needles fall oif [)retty soon, and lodge no mycelium threads
which might lune gone on to the twigs, it follo\\s that, in order to
pl•e^'ent future damage to the trees, the fallen needles should be
removed and bund. Spraying might perhaps save attacked trees
from further decay. For trees that are visited by the fungns, begin
to languish, their growth is impede<l, their i-esistance diminishes, and
so they soon fall a victim lo all sorts of Dematiaceae ^^■hich give
them a dirty bla(d<ish appearance.
The next (pu^stion is: \\]\a\ place in the system the fungus ought
to occupy, and what name lias to be assigned to it.
To begin witii, il und(jubtedly belongs lo the "Fungi imperfecti",
lately entitled "Deulei-omycetae" by Saccaudo (Syll. XIV, p. 4).
Secondly we nmst exclude Hie Sp/turrops/dctn', which ])0ssess a perilhe-
cium, as \n ell as Ihe ,l/t'A/y/rf////Vr^', the coiudia of which, without being
occluded in a peritheciiim, d('\'elop within pai'ts of plants and I'est
on a stroina. Our fungus rather belongs to the thii'd and last, at the
same time the largest class of the Deuteromycetae, which have no
])erithecium and the conidia of which, produced on thi"<\ids oi- hyphae,
li\-e citlici- inih'pcndciit of each other, which is the general ca^-^e, (u*
are gathered in Imndles. forming a so called "Ooreniiuui".
