bria, not in principle different from those given by van der Waals*
theory. And very clear and special evidence must be brought forw^ard

substance whicli exists in
the liquid and solid states,
call cd and e f the portions
of the connodal of the liquid
and solid ridges, gh and ik
portions of isotherms on the
liquid and solid ridges. It is
clear that i and h may be
joined by a continuous line.
For the formation of two
ridges it is clearly only neces-
sary, that two isotherms g'h', i'k', should incline to the t'-axis very
strongly, but still not differ much from the two preceding isotherms
gh, ik, and also that h'i', hi should not differ much. With such
small variations resulting from the above mentioned controlled changes
of the isotherms with the temperature on the Gibbs' surface, we are very
familiar since the a and b of van der Waals are taken as temperature
functions. The difference between ik and the isotherm ^A is analogous
to the difference between the true empirical isotherm gh and the simplest
form of isotherm given by van der Waals who has long shown
that h must necessarily be a volume function. The portion hi alone
appears to have received a somewhat greater change which we may
ascribe to a further change of b ^) with the volume.
With this explanation of the cause for the displacement of the
isotherm on the Gibbs' surface we do not come into collision with
the assumptions of van der Waals, who assumes that b undergoes
a change in the fluid state owing to the compression of the molecule.
We thus only specify the possibility of a yet further change of the
same sort, which finally produces a new equilibrium between ri
and V in the solid state. Beforehand there can be no question of
explaining the solid state by referring it to the same processes as
those which exist in the liquid state. This can only be done when
the relation of the elasticity for instantaneous changes of^olumeand
the time of relaxation for the liquid and solid states are worked out
1) We use the a and h of van der Waals in the most general manner given
by this physicist.
