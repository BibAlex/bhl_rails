of characteristic, nearly rectangular dark and light (ields to he ohserved
in the colonies when ohlicjuely illnniijied, which lields can interchange
of tint and originate by the retlexion of Hglit on groups of mutually
parallel bacteria; of the ditFerent gi'oups the longitudinal axes meet
at nearly right angles.
As to the bacterium itself, its description by Winogradsky^) is
in good accordance with our results. It is a rather long species,
producing spores at a terminal swelling (a little beneath the end) of
the very long and very thin Clostridia, resembUng common staves,
which then look like frog-spawn (Plate Fig. 4). The rodlets are 10
to 15 n long by 0.8 [i wide but eventually much longer. The older
ones become thicker and swell at the end, to 3 (i in widtli ; the o\ al
spore, formed in this swelling, measures 1.8 ft by 1.2 (i.
In dilute malt-extract, with exclusion of air, a ^'igorous fermentation
takes rise, Avithout formation of butyric acid.
With starch''^), innlin, mannite, erythrite, glycerin, fermentation
could not be produced under any circumstances.
With peptone and witli dilute broth, or albumine as sources of
nitrogen, our bacterium causes fermentation in glucose, laevulose,
galactose, milksugar, and maltose, with a slight production of butyric
acid. Proteids and gelatin are peptonised.
With ammonium salts as source of nitrogen, fermentation caimot be
produced with any of these sugars. Nitrates are not assimilated and
not changed at all.

indicate granulose.
