If r, = V, 1\, then (8c) yields:

Further we have the following values for q^ for increasing \aliies

Already at q^=zl51\ the limiting direction q.^ = — 47', (here
= — 2jf\) has been all but reached.
IV. So we have seen, that the four limiting curves (see fig.3),
which divide the gj,^/.3-space into different fields, radiate from the
origin (q^ = q,^ = 0) in the space. All of them touch in the origin
the straight line q^^=q^, the former two on the right, the latter two
on the left. Only I is intersected by II ; IV tails for the grealer part
outside the positive region ; I and IV show maxima.
Below I and on llie right of 11 lies the h'ehl A of tiio coiixex
sliaped meltingpoiut-curves.
Between I and II on the left of the point of intersectioJi S^ lies
a small region B^, Avhere the end of T = /{.i;) has become concave ;
on its right is the region B.„ where the /)e</ünui/</ of 7' = /(.6') has
become conca^'e.
Between 11 and 111 (on the left of N,, belween 1 and lllj lies
the field C, where T = /{j') is concave throughoul ils course, T — f{x')
convex.
Between III and the «/,-axis (below ;S', l)etween III and IV) lies
the field D, where only the end of T = f [x') is still convex.
Finally there is still a very small region between IV and the
q^-i\.\.\^, where the meltingpoiid curve — both 7':= ƒ(,/') and T=:/{.i;') —
is concave throughout its course.
