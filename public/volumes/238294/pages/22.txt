Tini8 we tijid ;i verv good agi-eeineiit for 1896.0, hut Hie results

interesting to investigate also the meridian observations of tlie vears
about 1885.
The annual variation found for iV agrees in absolute value almost
exaeth with that of the longitude of the node and ^ve mi<>'hl |)ul
for the argument of the ineqnalit}' : y — ^-{-'2U)°. It is probable,
however, that we have only to do here with a casual agrecmeid.
The theoretical value of the "Jovian Evection" is according to
the most accurate calculation by Hill :
rf / = -f- 0".90 sin [</ + 238' + 20^65 {t — 1876.0)].
For 1856 the theoretical argument and that of the empirical term
are in good agreement, but in the following years they are more
and more discordant.
9. It only remains now to put together the tinal results for the
mean corrections of the longitude, as they were derived from the
solution of the equations for each year.
In the following table the column headed (H. contains the residual
corrections found after the corrections derived from my curxe had
been applied, while the column headed flA^v contains tiie total cor-
rections to be applied to the longitude of HANSf:N-NKWCo:\rii.

The nieaji value of the ÖX amounts to — 0."()7, which might be
applied as a constant correction to the i-esults according to my curve.
These results of the transit observations, ^vhich contain the unknown
personal errors in observing the moon's limbs may be compared with
those of BattepxMann and also with those derived by Franz from the
observations of the crater Most ing A. We then iind that the results
