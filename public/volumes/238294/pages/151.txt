becomes clear, small luihhles or drops are seen to move from l)elow
aiui from al)o^'e towards a certain ])oint in the tube. At last a
meniscus appears there. This i-emains at that ])lace. The temperature
at Avhich these phenomena were observed was adopted as the plaitjjoint-
temperature of the mixture considered, the volume and the pressure
as plaiti)oiiit volume and pressure.
If the tem])erature is a lilllc hi,uiier, the meniscus appears lower
in the tul.»e. The exact jxiijU where it appears cannot be observed
with certainty : drops are seen to move from above to below, and
bubbles from below to above more and more regularly towards one
place; at this place the meniscus will appear, but this place is rising
already before the meuisc-us has ])ro|»erly formed itself. AVhen it is
formed, it generally still rises. If the temperature is still higher the
meniscus is distinctly seen to rise from the bottom of the lube. At
the lowei' end a (piantily of liquid is gathered by the drops which
fall from the top to the meniscus. The same holds, nuUatis mutandis,
for temperatures below the plait|)oint temperature.
