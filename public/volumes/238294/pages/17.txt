excentricity and the longitude of the i)erigee ojdy, and tlieir periodic
cliaracter fully confirms the existence of the inequality discovered
l)y Xkwc'O.mh.
At a closer inspection, however, it aj)pears that Xewcomb's forniula
does not re|»resent satisfactorily my // and /•, and this need not
astonish us if \\e consider the great extrapolation involved in the
apjdication of Newcomb's formnla to my results.
8. To correct Nkwcomb's formnla by successive approximations
I have proceeded in the following way :
By comparing the // and /• now obtained with those in the table in
JnveMlgatlon p. 28, it may be easily seen that the |)eriod of the argu-
ment ^V, on which 1l and /• (lei)end through the formulae Ji = It,, — asinX
and l=:k^-]-acosX, niusi l)e greater than IGVs years — the period
assuuied i)y Kewcomb — and cannot differ much from 18 years.
This corresponds to an annual \ariation of 20" and it will be con-
venient to adopt this value as a first approximation.
The special aim of my first operation was to find reliable values for
the constant ]»arts of the coefficients, //,. and /v. 1 tried to attain this-
by calculating values of h and /■ for each year of the 18 year-cycle
l)y means of the results of Xewcomb's two series and of those foujid
for 1895—1902.
Assuming the argument for 1862.0 =t // X ^^ b) be 0, I derived
normal values for the arguments 0.5, 1.5 etc. to 17.5, assigning
the weights 1, 3 and 2 to the results of the 3 series. I had no
value for the argument 14.5 and therefore had to form it by
interpolation.
In this wav I found :
