of which one, lying within the Joop is closed. Within the loop
therefore, the surface shows an elevation of which the top almost
agrees with .v = 0.40, v = 0.06, j) = 63.9. For higher horizontal
surfaces the section consists of one branch only. For horizontal
surfaces corresponding to j^ <C 63.8 atm., the sections also consist in
one branch which surrounds the critical loop.
From X = the bordercur^'e occurs on the front of the jh v, x-
surface, but reaches the border almost at the volume 0.008, then
occurs on the back where it remains until the point C, and returns
to the front. At the point C the osculation plane to the border
curve, at the same time the tangent plane to the surface, is horizontal;
the projection on the x, Â«;-plane shows the border curve more and
more in its true shape the more we approach tlie point C; whereas
in the upper pi-qjection that border curve is seen more and more in
an oblique direction and linally in a tangent one, so that it nuist
appear flattened, which accounts for the higher order of the border
curve in that projection.
