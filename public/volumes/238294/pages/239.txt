The first of these belong to the triple-point gas-liquid-solid,
c.) The points of the liquid state belonging to 6 and 7 are ealcii-

vaporisation. We have found

In the same way taking into account the heat of fusion at the
triple point we find for a point belonging to the solid state.

According to Tammann two solid modifications of COg exist so that
we must add two solid ridges (see PI. II fig. 2) in addition to the
liquid ridge. We have assumed that Tammann's 2"^ modification lies
between the fluid state and the first modification, and we call Tammann's
2"^^ modification A and his first B. The reason wh}^ we have assumed
this arrangement between the two solid modifications is the following :
Tammann ') has determined the fusion line for the modification .4 as
well as for B, and also the transition line for the second modification.
He found (see PI. I fig. 1) that the values of y- are greatest for the points
on the equilibrium line c, smallest for the fusion line a of the modi-
fication A and found between the two another locus for the fusion
line of the modification B. The same is also to be obtained from our
