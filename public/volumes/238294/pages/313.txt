then VAN DEH Waai.s ■') has pro\ed — as van Laak "') had done
before — that with the aid of these corrections the critical coefficient

between theory and experiment seems to be removed. And this last
result makes it again clear, ho^v great from a i)hysical point of
view, the difference is between an equation of form (1) and (2),
though from a mathematical point of view they may be identical by
first, second aiid further approximation. Already a long time ago

the critical coefficient can reach at the utmost the value 3 with the
theoretical values of the coefficients, and that th-s form can therefore
never I'epresent the exi)ei-iniental data. It seems therefore iiot devoid
of interest to me, to examine the different derivations of the equation
of state, in order to find which form must be taken as the correct
one. This investigation will at the same time enable ns to form an
opinion about the difference between Boltzmann and van dek Waals.
§ 2. As is well-known, the proof which van der Waals originally
ga^■e for his equation of state, rests on \\\() theorems, the first of
which is ex[dicitly stated, the other is a.ssumed without argument
as self-evident. The first theorem states, that the number of collisions
in a gas with s})herical molecules is represented by the before-
mentioned fornuda P= — ^— . Now I have alreadv pointed ont
