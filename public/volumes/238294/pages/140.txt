meter had for a long' time heen heated at 4(S° (\, amonnled to
(i. licdnrtion of the o/tsrrrafions. In eases where, in contrast
to the deterniiiialion of the plailpoint and the [)oint of cojitact of
the mixtnres and the critical point of carbon dioxide, the greatest
possil)le constancy of the temperatnre was not absolntely necessary,
tlie temperatnre dnring the determination of an isothermal which
histed on an a>erage from o to 4 honrs was allowed to \ary a few
hnnth-edths of a degree. For the rednction to one temperatnre,
temperature coelïicients for the different volumes were derived from
the observations.
In the two series, one at an always increasing, the other at an
always decreasing pressure, pressures ^vere measured, corresponding
to different volumes, which in the two series diifered but little.
Pressures were derived from them for the same volume and then
the mean was found. When it appeared that these pressures agreed
sutïiciently (comp. § 4) we have afterwards simjily taken for two
corresponding points the mean of the Nolunie and the pressure.

isothermals of carbon dioxide have been extensively investigated by
Amagat, I iiaxe yet determined a number of isothermals together
with its critical point. I was led to it by the following considerations:
['^. it was desiral)le that 1 should be able to judge of the purity
of the caibon dioxide which 1 used for the [)reparation of the mix-
tures, and it seems thai this judgment may best be derived from the
