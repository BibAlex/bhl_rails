the tact Ihal tho acid a/,i(h's of (Virrns are coin-oi-fcMl with elimina-
tion of niti'ogen into I ho same isocyanatos which occur as inter-

to attempt to o\|)hxin tlieso reactions from a same point of view.
He believes that in tho thi'oo above transformations there must be
formed intermediate molecnle-residnes containing' unixalent nitrogen;
with the azides for instance CH^dO.N.N., -^ (ül.CH) . N + N.,; with
the bromoamides for instance, CH.CONHBr-^CIl.CO.N -f HBr. These
molecnle-residnes are then snp})osod to be converted straight into
the isocyanate: (!Il, — (!() . N ^ (!()N(!I[.,. In ordoi' to arrive, in tho
transformation of oxinies into amides, at such mok^'ules with univalent
N-atoms, StikctUtz assumes that first of all \\V\ is attached to the
oxime owing for instance to tlio action of PC!,. il.,C = N()H+HCl
-^ RjCCl — NHOIl; this additive comj)ouii(i under the intluence of
POlj then loses one mol., of water and gi\es RjCCl — N which
molecnle-residne is thou supposed to bo comei'ted into RCXM^NR,
which on treatmeul \vilii water yiehls llio amide.
Now, first of all if is difficult lo soc whoiv tho HCl, which gets
attached to tho o.ximo, is lo como from; it is of course known that
some oxiinos yield with IH'l. couipouiids such as Iv./ICIN with
formation of IKM, bul lliis is uol llie foruialiou which vStikgt.itz had
in mind. We also fail lo see how sul[»liuric acid, acling as d(diydra-

Stikolitz himself admils of his own theory Ihal "it does not agree
so well with the more obscure relations of the theory of stereo-
isomerism of ketoximes and their influence on the rearrangement
of these isomers. It is hoped that future work will remove this
difliculty". (x\m. Ch. J. 7, 29, (37). The difficulty is this, that Stikolitz
theory utterly ignores a fact of fundamental importance, namely the
formation of two different amides from the stereoisomerie ketoximes;
these according to Stikcjlitz ought to lead to the same intermediate
product from which I he same amide only conld be formetl. And
finally the transformalioiis of an oxime into the isomeric amide
without any reagent whatever, as observed by Wekeer and his
