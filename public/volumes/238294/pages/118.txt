the simplifications in (he considerations and calcidations — tliat tliese
cases may l)e adopted as the normal ones, from vvhicli all the other
cases are to he considered as devialions in greater or smaller degree.
In our case the consideration of the limiting- case « = 0, «' ^
otfers another advantage, viz. that much of what will be deduced
in ^^•llal follows, may he transferretl with some restrictions to the
hoilingpohit-Une.s for ideal liquid and gaseous phases. For the thermo-
dynamic relations of equilibrium agree perfectly, when the distinguish-
ing feature between Ihe two kinds of equilibrium, viz. the degree of
the mutual influence of the two components in each of the phases has
vanished. The difference consists only in this, that for the processes
of melting the pure latent heat of melting may be assumed to be inde-
pendent of the tempei-ature, whereas for the processes of boiling the
latent heat of evaporation will decrease with increasing temperature.
Only in those cases, therefore, in Avhich the boiling points of the two
components do not differ much, the following considerations may be
transferred to boilingpoint-curves of liquids, where « may be put
= 0. When the difference betweeii the boiling points is larger, this
cannot be done any more.
