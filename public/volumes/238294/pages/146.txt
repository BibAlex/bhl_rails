We see that no reuidar variation in the values of i\ and i\^ can
be remarked, so that this justifies witli regard to these experiments
our assumption of the dependenee of i\ and /•., on the temperature
only.
In the ealciilation of the mean values of i\ and r., in table XXI
we have accorded the same weight to the \abie bori'owed directly
from obsei-vatioii as to tlie mean of the values deri\ed from the
other observations.
§ 5. For the determination of the eritieal point the following may
serve: The thermostat was adjusted at a few hundredths of a degree
below the eritieal tem[>eratiire (the temperature abov(> wliieh no
statiimary meniseus is observed). Ijy letting a small (|uantity of water
of higher temperature into the mi.xing bath, the e.\|»erimental tube
was brought to a few hundredths of a degree above the eritieal
teni|»erature, and the substanee was well stirred. Tlu'ii Ihe tempe-
laliire falls \oi-y slowly. If the volume \\o^ between certain limits,
the following phenomena may be seen: A blue mist is formed which
