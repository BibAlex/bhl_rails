Tlie mimbers of pairs oï lines caji 1m> (Icleriiiiiied in the tbllowing
wav. Let P, P' , P" l)e tln-ee poijils ol' tlie same uroiij» of tlie /* :
we make P to correspond to eacii of llie points N which the right
line P'P" determines on C'- ; as to P Itelong \{s — 'J)(.v- — 2) pairs
P',P" each point P in the correspondence [P, S) is conjngate to
(.9— l)^.{ii — 2) points S. The pencil of rays having S as vertex
determines on C" an /"—i liaving {n — 2)(.y — J) i)airs l*',P" in com-
mon with h : so to each point Ncorresjiond {n — 2)(.y— 1)(a' — 2) points P.
When now two conjugate points /^. <S' coincide, three points y^ /^', /*"
lie in the same right line and each of those j)oints is to be regarded
as a coincidence of the corres])ondence {P,S). So the nundjer of these
collinear triplets is {ii — 2)(.v — I)». The hearer of sucii a triplet forms
with the connecting line of two points belonging to the same gronp
a pair of lines of [C']; conseqnentlv
Ö == (,,_2)(.-l),(.-3), = (3 (//- :!)(. -1),.
From this ensues again
f/ = 2 (»— 2)(.s— 1), and r = 4 (;/— 2)(.y— 1),.
2. On each conic of tiie system [C^] li\e points /^ are lying and
{2n — 5) points X more. Eacli point of C'^ can be regarded as a
•point P and as a point A. Of the (i conies through that point tiiere
are (.s- — !)_,, connecting J* with four points J' l»elonging to the same
group; the remaining (2/^ — b](s — 1), contain l)esides A' a quintuple
of points of the P and (2^^ — 6) points A' more, which we shall adjoin
to A'. The j)oints A', A' evidently form a symmetric correspondence
with tiie characterizing numl)er (2/^ — 6)(2« — 5)(.s- — 1)^. Each coincideiice
of (A, A') furnishes a conic of [C"], touchijig C".
Besides these 2(2« — 6)(2??, — 5)(.y— 1)^ conies there is a group of
touching conies each of which connects a coincidence of /" with
three points behmging to the same gronp of /"; tlieir number amounts
to 2(.v-1)(.v-2)3^8(.s— J),.
Bui there is still a third grou[) of tangential conies. When a point
P coincides with one of the points A', the conic touching C" in
PzEA' represents two cur^'es; so in that point O' touches likewise
the envelope of [6'^]. Xow to each poiiit /-* belong {2n — 5)(.v — 1)^
points A', Avhilst eacli point A' is conjugate to 5(2/^ — 5)(.v — 1)^ points
P. Therefore tlie third group contains ()['2n — 5)(.y — 1)^ conies. By
counting these donble we arrive at
\2{2u-i5){2n-b) + 8 + 12 (2«-5)](..-l), or ^n-2){2n-lp-l)^
conies touching C". This number can be easily controlled ; for, a
curve C' of class /.', is touched by (/■ jx + /m-) curves of a system
