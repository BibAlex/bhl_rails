published by Kalfmann ') in 1002. From each series lie has deduced
two quantities ri and g, the "reduced" electric and magnetic dellexions,
w
which are related as follows to the ratio f^ = - :
â‚¬
Here if' (|i) is such a function, that the transverse mass is given by
3 e'
whereas l\ ank k.^ are constant in each series.
It appears from the second of the formulae (30) that my theory
leads likewise to an equation of the form (35) ; oidy Abraham's
function /// (|J) must be replaced by
3 8 ^ ^ '
Hence, my theory requires that, if we substitute this value for
If' (^) in (34), these equations shall still hold. Of course, in seeking
to obtain a good agreement, we shall be justitied in giving to /(^ and /'.^
other values than those of Kaufmann, and in taking for every measure-
ment a proper value of the velocity h', or of the ratio /?. Writing
3
^>'/' -~ k' .^ and ^' for the new values, w^e may put (34) in the form

g
^' = sk,- (3G)

(i-n"''=^ > (37)
Kaufmann has tested his equations by choosing for l\ such a value
that, calculating ji and /., by means of (34), he got values for this
latter number that remained constant in each series as w^ell as might
be. This constancy was the proof of a sufticient agreement.
I have followed a similar method, ushig however some of the
numbers calculated by Kaufmann. I have computed for each measure-
ment the value of the expression
r, = (1 - p'VX.^) ^V (38)
that may be got from (37) combined with the second of the equations
(34). The values of tf' ii^) 'i-nd k.^ ha\e been taken from Kaufmann's
tables and for ,?' I haxe substituted the value he has found for ^,
multiplied by .y, the latter coefficient being chosen with a view to
