The annual variation of .V arcordiiiu- lo llio now loi-ninla is
|)ra('(ically e(|ual lo the \alue found befoi'e. 'i'lie "values of O — (
\\ hirh are joined to those of A' in the tai)le alxtve show, however,
that the svsteniatic discordances are still ^'reat and the outstandiiifi:
errors of the three noi'uial values are even somewhat greater than
before.
In the second place T have detei-niined anew the coefiicieni of
the inequality. 1 have n(tt done this l)y dei-iving directly values for
each year from the corrected h and /• and then taking the mean
of the separate values, as by doing so 1 should have obtained a too
large coeflicient. Hut I ha\e represented the corrected h and k by the
formulae :
h' ^ — c( sin N
k' = -j- « cos N
assuming for .V the computed values.
In this ^vay I derived
from the //' a =z -^ J ".23
from the /' = + 1 -34
from the two cond)ined « =: -|- J .28.
Hence the fornndae for //' and /' become
h' = — 1".28 sin [307" + 19°.4 {t — 1876.0)]
/•' = 4- 1".28 ros [307° + 19^4 (t - 187(3.0)1
while from the theoretical term II, the -lovian Evection, there would
follow :
hjj — — 0".88 sin [329' -f 20°. 68 (t — 1876.0)j
ku — 4- 0".88 cos [329" + 20°.68 {t — 1876.0)].
There still remains a considerable diffeience bet^veen the empirical
and the theoretical values; for 1902 the difference between the
arguments amounts to as much as 57^. Therefore we cannot but
conclude that still other inequalities join their intluence to that of
the Jovian Evection.
17. The expressions obtained for k and /• according to the two
I)receding sections are therefore :
h =: h,; + h' -f liiii
k == ^v -f h' -f km -f- k[y
