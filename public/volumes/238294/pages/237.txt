oiu' plan is easily compared with the latter for the small volume
part. To find how our vapour plait will be connected with this
portion, it is only necessary to use pi. Ill fig. 2. Tlie chief difference
is seen in the different forms of the spinodal line. Ours is given
by the dot-dash line of fig. 6 and Maxwell's in fig. 7. Ours consists
of two portions which remain apart to the lowest temperature

(T=0), while Maxwell's shows only a secondary loop. Quite
improbable are Maxwell's isotherms. They show in the vapour plait
a point of inflection in the isotherms. Thereby they differ entirely
from the equation of state of van der Waals, which is certainly
qualitatively correct for vapour and liquid.

{The general model).
This model was constructed by the help of the empirical equation
of state given in Comms. Nos. 71 and 74 with the assistance of the
thermodynamical formulae obtained in No. 66.
