By this dispersion lioweAcr new isoljilcd double points aiidisolated
bitangcnts are formed, but the higlicr nuinifoid singularities disappear,
so tiiat the equation (5) is applicable, provided among ö" and r" the
newly generated isolated double points and bitangents are counted.
These however can be formed oidy as points of intersection and
common tangents of two conjugate imaginary branches.
Here are three cases to be distinguished with res})ect to the reality
of the two points and tangents of the manifold singularity consisting
of two conjugate imaginary branches. The case already discussed, that
the points and the tangents are both imaginary, does not give rise
to a manifold singularity, so it does not come into consideration now.
Points of contact real, tangents imaginary. From both branches
being r(»)ju(/ak' imaginary ensues that the points of contact coincide,
l)ut that the tangents ditfei-. If the order of each of the singularities
is t, then both branches intersect each other in /'^ coinciding points,
which after the dispersion of the singular points cause t'^ double points
to be generated. If that dispersion takes place, as w^e keep assuming,
in such a way that the equation of the curve remains real, then the
singular points become conjugate imaginary, wiiilst the singular
tangents remain imaginary. So after the dispersion we get singula-
rities which have no influence on the equation of Klein. However
we have got another P double points of which t (t — 1) are imaginary
and t are isolated. The latter is easy to understand by causing the
t coinciding tangents of each of the singularities to diverge a little
before the dispersion, by which each of the two singularities changes
into a common /-fold point with separated hut slightly differing imagi-
nary tangents. The t tangents originating from the one singularity
are conjugate to those of the other. With the dispersion the t pair
of conjugate imaginary tangents give t isolated points, whilst the
remaiiiing double points l)econie imaginary.
After the dispersion of the singular points by which the number
of isolated points has become cf" + t and the number of isolated
bitangents has remained in\ariai)le, we find by applying the equation (5)
n + ii' -\- 2t" + :£' V, == /• + x' + 2{ö" + + ^' t,.
For this again we may write :
n + iï + 2r" + ^' c, = /,- + x' + 2Ö" + ^' ^ , • • (5)
if we but extend 2't^ to those higher singularities of which the point
is real but the tangent imaginary.
Points of contact imaginary, tangents real. This case is quite
correlative to the preceding. Now the points of contact are different,
whilst the tangents coincide. Out of this common tangent is formed
