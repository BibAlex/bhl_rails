curve, were (f and if? possess but real coefficients. For that curve J
has of course the same vahie as for tlie curve <f — i if' =r 0, e. g.
(he vahie J^.
For the curve ^- -j- ip^ = 0, consisting of the two tirst-nientioued
curves, ./ has thus the value '2J^, as J consists only of terms, which
are formed additively for a degenerated curve out of the corresponding
terms of the partial curves. The equation of that curve is however
real, so that the relation (2) is applicable to it. Fr«nn this ensues
J=1J,^0, so J,=0.
This proves, that J has the value zero for the curve </ -|- / if ? = ( )
too, and that for this the equation (2) also holds good.
For this deduction we have tacitly made the supposition that q)
and If? have no common divisor, as otherwise ihe curve y^-["^^ = ^
would possess a part counting double and thus an infinite number
of singularities. If (p and if? have such a common divisor, that is if
the curve degenerates into a curve with real equation and into one
with an imaginary one, the relation (2) still holds good. For, as we
have seen, this is the case for the two partial curves, from which
ensues b}^ addition the corresponding equation for the total curve.
Klein (1. c, p. 207) linds by applying his e(|uation to the curve

This equation can be immediately deduced from (2).
Farthei-more ensues from (2) :
The equation (8) of Klein for imagiiKiri/ curee.'^ holds rjood aUo
if that carve possesses real singular points or real singular tangents
if only they count for as many real points or tangents as is indicated

§ 5. (Jther forms for the equation (2).
The equation (2) can be reduced to still other forms. The Plücker-
equation o {k — n) i:^ ,■? — y. becomes namely for a cui've wqth higher

to the higher singularities, the real ones as well as the imaginary
ones. By including the PLüCKER-singularities, and if one likes also
the ordinary points of the curve, under the JS'-sigu the equation
becomes
