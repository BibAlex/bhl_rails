The reaction proved to l)e one of the tirst order, tlio velofity constant
did not change with the concentration; so it is a nionomolecnUir
one. At 65°, for instance /• = 0.0019 for a sohition of 2.5 grams of
the oxinie in 50 as well as in 100 cc. of 93. 67n sulphuric acid (time
in minutes; transformation of \'._, of the oxime after 160 minutes).
The transformation velocity increases with the concentration of the
acid as shown from the following table:

At 65°, a 86.57n sulphuric acid gave a constant of 0.0006 (time
ofVa transformation ^501 minutes). When nsing 99.2"/„ acid at 6(P,
practically all the oxime had been converted after 15 minutes.
The influence of the temperature is ap[)arent from the following

The temjierature-coefficient for 10^ is lliei-efoi-e about 3.
A solution of SO, in chloroform did nol uppeai- lo cause any trans-
formation of the oxime.
The results of this research therefore contirm the view that in the
BECKMANN-transformation we are dealing with a real intramolecular
rearrangement. E\oii if (he application of sulphuric acid should cause
the formalion of an ijitermediate compound (which has not yet l)een
positi\ely proved, but \\hich is very probal)le ') ) our experiments
show that this formation (or the conversion 1 into II) lakes place
with immeasurably great \elocily. The \ ery ])erceptible development
of heat which occurs on luixiug the oxime willi Ihe coiiceuti'aled
sulj)lnu'ic acids also poiiUs to this fact.
Addcnduiii. Of late years, Stikglitz and his coworkers (Amer.
Chem. J. 1896—1903) have been engaged in tiie study of the
BECKMANiN-rearrangemeut. In my opinion Stik(;ijtz's ideas caimot be
accej)ted in theii- entirety. Recently this chemist has given a sunnnary
of his conclusions in a separate article "on the l>K(;KMANN-i'eai'range-
