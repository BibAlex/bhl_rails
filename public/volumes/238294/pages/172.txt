Mixtures of O- 50 aloinic "/„ siilplim- mav on coolin,!»', <iive as
solid phases Cl,, S,C1, and SCI,.
Tlie manner in which they are successively deposited nuiy he
best explained by tirst obsei'vin,i>- in what manner the soliditication
of a mixture of these three sul)stances would lake place when the
SCI, couhl be considered as an independent third component.
This would be the case if this compound did not dissociate in the
lirpiid condition and also was not formed from liquid S,(J1., and CI,.
The system would then behave as a ternary system, the solidification
phenomena of which could oidy be c()m|>letely represented by a
spacial figure.
We may also, however, disregard the constitution of the liquid
and express its gross composition only in CI, and S,^,^ whicli is
all the more justifiable as there is no means of determining the
amount of S(U., in the presence of CI, and S,C1,.
We then obtain a repi-esentation in a plane (see fig. 2) which is
the projection of the spacial figure ^).
In this figure EH and HA
are the solidification lines of
the binary mixtures SCl^ and
Cl„ EK and KD those of SCI,
and S/.I,, AG and DG those
of CI, and SjCl,.
The ternary mixtures whose
conqiositions lie within the
region IHAG first deposit solid
chlorine, those in HvDG solid
S,CL and those in HEKI solid
SCI4. For each gross composi-
tion there exists a greater or
smaller series of molecular
arrangements which cannot be
represented in the plane, but on
which the temperature at w liich
the one or other solid phase
commences to be deposited depends. (Some mixtures may even sepa-
rate more than one phase according to their molecular composition).
