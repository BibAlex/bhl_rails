IV. The Gibbs' surface for H^O for great densities.
{Model for the equilibrium of Tammann's ice varieties and water).
The Gibbs' surface 'suffers a deformation from association in the
case of water, and the general character of the change has been
already given in § 3 according to our \iews. Having once arrived
at a given idea about the general form, we can more exactly deter-
mine the form to be ascribed to the ridges according to this idea
by the help of the experimental numbers. The model that we have
obtained by our method is shown on PI. II fig. 4. As Tammann has
already indicated, t^vo other ice varieties (ice II and ice III) are
found, in addition to ordinary ice (ice I). The general position of
the ridges belonging to these values follows from Tammann's measu-
rements concerning the volume change and heat of transformation
for the transition of one ice variety into another or into water. If
we give the value to the last and 1, 2 and 3 to the three ice
varieties, Tammann finds at T =: 251 (triplepoint w\ater — ice I — ice III)
Lv,, = — 0.05
A?'3, = + 0.193
r„j = — 73 cal.
?'o3 = — 70 ,/
Also Tammann finds that Av^^ is very nearly equal to Ai\^. We
have assumed that Ar,^ is somewhat greater than Av\^. We then
find the general arrangement given in PI. IV fig. 1 for the water
and three ice varieties. The dashed line gives the isotherm through
the triple point w^ater — ice I — ice III, the dotted line the isopiestic.
We have not taken these from pi. II, fig. 4, where no isotherms
or isopiestics are drawn, because this figure is not sufficiently worked
out for this purpose. We have drawn on PI. IV. schematic figures
in order that they may be used in continual comparison with the
surface, whenever we wish to further explain the properties of the
surface. From these we can show easily that they agree with the
model of PI. II, fig. 4.
We now further specify our ideas for the modification and 1.
