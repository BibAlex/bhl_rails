We have

Vsf.
Vsf denotes the decrease of volunic pei- moleenhir quantity, when
an inlijiitely sniall (luantity of the solid |(liasc passes into the co-
existing phase at constant pressure and constant temperature.
By substitution we get :

Van uer Waals has hitely demonstrated that Vsf- can twice
become zero when Cs. is smaller than ly-, in consequence of which

Further ^— ^ can also twice become zero, but this does not give

If ?\ is largei' than Vf, which may also occur, then only one vertical

For the better understanding of fig. 3 I shall add a few words
about each of the ditferent regions.
