that also
OXr, OYr\ ^^ /OXi, OYi
are equiangular to the right).
The systems OXr Yr Zy and OXi Yi Zi execute the motions of
aSV and S[ which are to be considered.
Let us farther call ^Wj , ^tOj , ^co^ , jcu^ , ^w^ , jtu,, the components of
the velocities of rotation according to the system OX^ X^ X^ X^ ;
and f/ 1 , f/s , ^3 the components of the velocities of rotation of Sr
according to OXy, OY,, OZ,, likewise t|^i , if.% , tf^j the components
of the velocities of rotation of Si according to OXi, OYj, OZi. Then
we know the components of velocity of rotation to the right

The Euler equations of motion "in the solid" (giving the opposite
of the apparent motion of the surrounding space) follow more simply
than according to Frahm out of the vector formula
fluxion of moment of motion = moment of force — rota-
tion X moment of motion
which is easy to understand for a three dimensional space as well
as for a four dimensional one,
(and where the sign X indicates the vector product)
F'or, ^'in the space" the fluxion of the moment of motion = moment
of force; but of this for the position in solid has ali-eady been
marked the fluxion wanted to keep the position constant in the solid,
i. e. the fluxion which corresponds to the rotation of the moment-
\'ector about the rotationvector and this is =: rotation X moment
of motion.
Let us call the squares of inertia ^m.v^^ etc. Pj etc. and let us put
