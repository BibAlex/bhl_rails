but this conclusion would be unjustifiable. For it is possible, nay
even probable, that the coefficients of numerator and denominator in
(6) decrease rapidly ; it is therefore possible, that the true form is
accurately represented by a quotient of two forms, which have each
only three or four terms; from this folloAvs by no means, that also
in the form (7) we should get a close approximation with three or
four terms, for the coefticients of the higher powers in (7) do not
depend only on the coefficients of the li'ujlier powers in numerator
and denominator of (6), l)ut they are also fimctions of the coefficients
of the lower powers 1; '\/g; 2; ^''l^^; and in such a way that they
do not become zero, when the coefficients of the higher powers in
(6) do so. Now the difference between (6) and (7) vanishes, of course,
for such large values of v, that the series (7) converges strongly,
but for the critical volume and even more so for licpiid volumes the
difference is very pronounced. This appears already from the simple
fact, that a form as (6) can easily yield a minimum volume ; but
(7) only when an infinite number of tei'uis is taken into account.
And also the before mentioned difference l)etween the resuhs of
