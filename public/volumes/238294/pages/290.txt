Influence of a rkat. singularity. Suppose when dissolving a
real higher sinciularitv with a reduction of class r/^, we arrive nt ^\
real inflexions and t'\ isolated bitangents. The class then becomes
/■_!_(/ so that ensues from the equation of Klein, if for simplicity's
sake Ave think the cu)-ve to possess but one higher singularity:
M + ^' + 2t" 4- ^\ + -^r", = k + '/, + h' + 20".
What the value is of ,^\ and of t'\ separately, depends upon the
manner of dissolution. If however Ave a[)ply the above equation to
curves formed in different manners of dissolution, we find that
,:?\-f 2r'\ has always the same value, called by me the reduction of
reaUtij of the singularity. In my dissertation I shall deduce out of a
definite manner of dissolution for that reduction of reality the
value d^-\-i\ — t-^, which causes the latter equation to become
n + .i' + 2t" + V, = k + k' + 2d" -f- ^ ^) . . . . (3)

Singularitiiten ebener algebraischer Curven und eine neue Curvenspecies. Math.
Ann., Bd. 16 (1880), p. 848, spec. p. 391) based upon the decomposition of the
higher singularity in PLÜcKER-singularilies. A. Cayley (On the Higher Singularities
of a Plane Curve. Quart. Jouni. of Math., Vol.! (1866), p. ^2\% CoUected Math,
papers, Vol. 5, p. 520) has namely shown, although in a not entirely satisfactory
way, that the PLÜCKER-equations as well as the equation of deficiency keep holding
good for curves with higher singularities, if we regard such a singularity as equi-
valent to X* cusps, |3* inflexions, 5* double points and t* bitangents. For k* and ^*
Cayley gives
^* = t-[ , ^* = v-l , (4)
and he indicates how 5* and t* can be deduced from the PuiSEUx-developments
in point and line coordinates.
Later on fuller proofs for the results of Cay'ley have been furnished, among wliicli
that of Stephen Smith excels for its simplicity and rigorousness (1. c, p. 153— 16:2),
based upon the line of thoughts of Cayley. For the CAYLEY-numbers of equivalence
Smith introduces (1. c , p. 161) the names cuspidal index, uiflexional i)id(\c,)iodal
index and Ijitangetitial index and among them he finds a simple relation (1. c, p. 166).
Brill has shown that this CAYLEY-equivalence does not only completely satisfy the
PLÜCKER-equations and the equation of deficiency, but tliat if is possible to deform
the curve retaining order, class and deficiency in such a way that the higher singu-
larities are decomposed into the equivalent ones of Plücker. Brill calls tliis opera-
tion a deformation of tiie singularity (I.e. p. 361). Already Cavlev (On the Cusp
of the second kind or Nodecnsp. Qnart. .Journ. of Math., Vol. 6 (1864), p. 74,
Collected Math, papers, Vol. 5, p. -265) gives for the case of a ramphoid cusp an example
of a such like deformation although he does not emphatically draw the attention
to the fact tliat class and deficiency remain unaltered.
