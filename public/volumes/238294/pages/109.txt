1. If the points of a rational curve of order five, ('\ with six
double points JJk (/• = 1. 2. 3, 4. 5, (>j. are arranged in the pairs P',
P" of an involntion /-'. the line P' P" enveUipes a directing curve
of class four. For, the indicated involntion has four |>airs in coninion
with the central involution of order live, which is deteiiuined by the
rays of a pencil. If a paii' of the /' is formed by the jioints D\
and }y\ lying in I), on Ihe two branches of the C\ the directing
curve breaks up into a curve of (dass three and the pencil of i-ays
having its vertex in ]),,. If a second paii' consists of the points //^
and //',, the real directing curve will be a conic. Then we evidently
gel an /' given with P'' : we shall therefore call it -a /nnddiiiciital
involution. It is determined by the pencil of conies with the base-p(Mnts
/A, a, 7J„ />,.
