1. It is well known that tlie esterification of alcohols by means
of' acetic anhydride is accelerated in a high degree bv the presence
of catalyzers and this of conrse also applies to the sugars. But it
is a rcmarkal)le fact that in the case of these polyhydric alcohols
we arrive at Aarious isomeric pentacelates according to the natui-e
of the catalyzer. The investigations of Franchimont ') and of Hkrzfkld ')
liave shown that, when dry sodiumacetate is used as catalyzer, we
obtain a product melting at 134" (,i), whilst according to Erwig and
KöNiGS ■') treatment with ZnCl^ yields a product melting at 112" («)•
After Franchimoxt had proved (hat these two compounds were in
reality isomeric*) [the first was formerly thought to be a diglucose-
octacetate] this chemist supported the view that they may be best
represented as derived from the so-called oxide-form of glucose ").
The two pentacetates will then be stereoisomers as the oxide-form
of glucose, which contains one asymmetric carbon atom more than
the aldehyde-form, must give rise to two isomers.
As in the case of the tAvo niethylglucosidcs ") we arrive, on apj)lying
Tollens' glucose fornnda, at the following constitution of the
pentacetates :
AcO — CH ^ CHOAc — CHO Ac — CH — CHOAc — CH.OAc ')

The existence of two isomers is explained by the fact that the
terminal C-atom on the left appears as a new asymmetric atom.

1) A few yeais ago, Tanret described a Uiiiil isomeric glucosepentacelate
m.p. 8(3' (Bull. 13. 2G1 (1895). My investigation has led mo to tlie conclusion
that this isomer does not exist but is a mixture of the other two.
