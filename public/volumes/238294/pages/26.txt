saturation ciu'\'es separate, tlie tw o li(|iiid [)hases approach each other
and finally coincide in the critical point : what becomes of the
minimum {.i\ == a\) during this change, if we suppose such a point
to lie inside the three-j)ha8c triangle? The simplest supposition which
we can make is that up to the last moment the minimum remains
between the two maxima and thus a fortiori between the coexiiSting
liquids; on that supposition the various points would all coincide
in the critical point and unile into one maximum ; in llie critical
point we should then iiave the condition d\ = ,r.^, i. e. the li(piid in
the critical point would have the same composition as llie vapour
with which it is in equilibrium. This assumption was made as ahnost

consideration it now appears to me to l)e incorrect; VxVxN der Lee')

relations for binaiy mixtures, but we shall show that the proof was
not valid.
The equation to be used is the following :
introducing into this the condition ^ — ^ = 0, which defines the spino-
dal curve and thus holds a fortiori in the critical point, we obtain

Calculating the value of —^ from — we find :
but in the point of contact of the two curves we have not only
