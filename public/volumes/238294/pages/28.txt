points ai some distaiicc from tlie critical tempcrahirc, appear outside
in the realisable part of the diagram before the critical point is
reached? The answer to this (piestion is the following: the minimum
{,i\ = ,(■„) approaches one ol the maxima (( -— ., 1 = 0) and at a
dp
given temperature coincides with it; from the expressions for —— and
d' T>
— -, or bv geometry, it follows that both coefficients vanisli in tliis
d.r^-'
point ajid that the p — .i\ curve has a point of inflexion witii a tangent
parallel to the .I'-axis. Immediately afterwards the iwo points in
question have passed each other and have exchanged tiieir charactei-,
/ /- H \
i. e. the point, where ( — —\ = 0, is now a minimum') and the
\d.i\y
other point, where ,i\ = .v.^, is a maximum : the latter point lies
at first in the metastable })art of the diagram between the minimum
and one of the liquids of the three-phase equilibrinm ; a further
change of temperature makes it coincide with this liquid and ultimatel}-
brings it outside into tlie stable part of the ligure. The maximum
and minimum in the non-stable part approach each other and Unall}'
coincide, as explained before.
For the sake of clearness we will once more go through die
^•arious changes as deduced above in the op[)Osite order, i. e. while
the temperature falls towards and passes through the critical point.
Above the critical mixing-i)oint there is a separate two-liquid curve
turning its critical point towards the ^'apour-li(plid curve: in the
latter ^ve assume a well defined maximum {a\=^x^). When the
temperature falls the two curves approach and at a given moment
come into contact; this contact takes place in the critical point of
the liquid curve, but in general at a smaller or larger distance
from the maximum on the vapour-licpud curve : doubtless the distance
may in some cases be small, but that does not affect the general
argument; on further hjwering of the tem|)erature the maximum
is in many cases taken up inside the three-phase equilibrium and
so disappears from tlie realisable portion of the diagram; it passes
successively the connochil and the spinodal curves and lies then
ultimately in the non-stable region, ^^ here it is found at low temperatures.
It was mentioned in the beginning tiiat similar changes occur in
other cases, e.g. wiien the two-liquid curve lies inside the vapour-
