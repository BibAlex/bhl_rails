called to two as j-et quite mdviiown
t3'pes of melting point lines which
may occur (Figs. 4 and 5).
In the first figure we have the
remarkable fact that the compound
forms with the component a a
eutectie point C as well as a
transition point D. In the second
figure, the melting point line of
Fig. 3. the compound occurs as a closed
curve widi two vertical lines in points where the heat of solution
is zero, and two melting points.
