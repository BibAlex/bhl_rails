4. These mathematical (l(Mluctions aJid llie details of the. other
results obtained by me will be published fully elsewhere. 1 nuiv
oidy remark fuiihei', that my results show thai, stai'liiig with a N/^
saccharosesolution (171 grams per litre) we arrive at a final con-
dition where fully i gram of sacchai'ose still i-emains pi-esent. The
inversion therefore proceeds to an auiount greater than 99 "/„. This
seems also the case in the resolution <»f salicin.
My experiments further show :
l^*^ . that the two fei'meuts invertase and emulsiji retain their
quantitative activity for some weeks in properly stei'ilised solutions.
2"'i. that the average factor for the change of the velocity of the
saccharose decomposition with the temperature equals 2 for 10°
between 0° and 25°.
3'^^. that by a change of tem[»erature from 0^ to 25° the equili-
brium is displaced very little or not at all, which (piite agrees with
theory as the caloric eifect of the reaction is very small.
4"^'^ . that at a definite temperature the change in concentration of
the enzymes has no influence on the equilibrium but only on the
velocity ; the latter, as in other catalytic actioiis, is directly proi)or-
tional to the enzyme concentration.
5''' . that as already observed by Henri, the intensity of the
invertase is smaller in proportion as the quantity of imertsugar,
})resent with the same amount of saccharose, is greater.
(3'''. that the intensity not only depends on the (piantity of invert-
sugar but also on the quantity of saccharose [)resent in the solution ;
it is smaller when this (piamity is greater.
This last conclusion does iu)t agree with that of Hfari (Theses,
p. 72) where he states that the addition of saccharose at the
commencement of a reaction has lU) iidlnence on the \elocily of the
inversion, but accelerates it when the addition takes place in the
middle of a reaction.
7^'^ that, as dnl}^ recpiired by theory, the reversal of the reactions
between glucose and fructose and between glucose and saligenin
})roceeds \ery slowly and requires se\cral weeks.
The results of Hknri's experiments are in accordance with the
intensity formuki, which I have deduced.
