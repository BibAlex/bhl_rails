of pure ethane (31°. 88), the connodal line consists of another part,
Avhich I have not drawn, howeA'er, in order not to make the figure
uselessly intricate. This second piece should have its apex, the critical
point of contact, at about .rj^. = 0.92, and Vf/, = 006S, and would
intersect the axis a' = 1 at 27 = 0.00472 and v = 0.01031.
To this second piece of the connodal a second border curve cor-
responds which would begin at a height /; = 46.1 (maximum tension
of ethane at 29°.0 C.) and terminate at the plaitpoint 2)Tpi = 51.2,
V2'jjI = 0.0063. But this border curve too I have omitted like the
isothermal of pure ethane.
At the lower part of the figure it maj be seen that the isobars
in the neighbourhood of the critical point C, indeed to the first
approximation, are hyperbolae of which one of the asj'mptotes, which
agree with the critical pressure, is parallel to the ?;-axis, the other
cuts this axis at a given angle. To the second approximation the
first asymptote is a parabola which coincides with the projection of
the connodal line.
It were useless to investigate whether indeed the border curve is
of the fourth degree and the connodol of the second degree ; for this
the data are not numerous enough and the drawing not sufficiently
accurate. But it is obvious why the bordei- curve should be of a
higher order than the connodal. The j;, v, ^I'-surface, of which the
projections on the surfaces p, v and x, v are shown in the fig., is in
the neighbourhood of the critical point a saddle-shaped surface, which
at the upper part of the figure is seen parallel to the tangent surface
at the point C The isothermals of the mixtures ,v, ^ 0, x ^0.14
and x = 0.40 are situated on the slope turned towards us ; the latter
over a fairly extensive range (of large volumes to about ,?• = 0.006)
forms nearly the border of the surface; the critical isothermal lies
just beyond that border, but becomes visible at Tand remains visible
foi- small volumes. The isothermals ,r =: 0.62, ,/' = 0.71 and .r = 1
occur on the back of the p, v, ,i'-surface, yet for small volumes they
become visible. The parabola :
1 Wjj"
p - pTk = - -, (t' - vtl)\
which envelops the isothermals in the neighbourhood of the point C
(1. c. p. 344 and fig. 16) is the api)arent outline of the surface in
that neighbourhood.
The lower part of the figure re^jresent the surface seen from above ;
the isobars are there level-curves. The critical isobar forms a loop
which agrees with the described shape of the surface. A section of
a horizontal surface situated a little higher consists of two pieces,
