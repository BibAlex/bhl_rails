To this eiid we shall treat in §1, 2 and 3 the relation (2) for
curyes with real equation, taking that of Ki-ein as our starting
point. In § 4 \ye shall indicate it for curyes with imaginary equation
too, and in § 5 we shall transform it to other forms.

For the present we shall take a one-sided point of yie\y where a
cnrye is regarded as a locus of points.
If the curye has higher nnifold singularities we dissolve them.

that the higher singularities disa[)pear without Pi,ü(KKK-point-singn-

intlexions and bitangents). After this dissolution, where we assumed
the Pluck r-R-singularities already present to be remaining, we apply
the equation of Klein.
To this end Aye must consider how many isolated bitangents and
how many I'eal intlexions appear in the dissolution of a higher
singularity. In two ways isolated l)itangents can be formed, iiatnely
