by means of a steel tube and of a steel T-piece with each other and
with a thii'd pressure cylinder. This was tilled partly with mercury
partly with glycci'ine. To ol)tain pressni-e, glycerine was forced into

the advantage thai the tubes tilled \Nilh gas do nol come into contact
with the glycerine, and the mercury which is forced into the tnbes
