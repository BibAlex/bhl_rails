insensible zone, after having made a caudal outward curve at the spina
scapulae (3 cm. from the acromion) to the mid-dorsal line between the
8^^ and 9^^ vertebra.
The caudal insensible zone is interrupted. The dorsal part forms a triangle,
whose basis begins between the 9^'^ and lO''» vertebra and ends above the
13th, (see fig. II, 1).
To the left are found two insensible spots. One of these, elliptic, opposite
the sensible area at the mid-ventral line (see fig. II, 2 and 4). The other,
likewise elliptic, having its longitudinal axis perpendicular to the mid-

On December 5'^ 1902, by a similar operation as before, on a strong grey
foxdog, designed as dog IX, to the right the 5'^^ gth^ 7111^ g'^, iO'i\ nth and
12fh pail' of roots are cut through. To the left the 9"» is cut through. Autopsy
on Dec 9fh confirms this having been performed. On September ö^h -[902
on a strong brown female dog, designed as dog I, to the right the S^h and
9'h root, to the left the 9'h root are cut through. Autopsy again confirms this.
