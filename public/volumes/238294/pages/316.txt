and at the same time a way ■^ APr cos f dt is saved by the collisions,
those moleeules seem to move Avith a xeloeitv Pr cos¥d({\ -{- 4iA),
and so the number of collisions has increased in the same ratio.
KoKTKWEG, however, continues: "In order to obtain therefore the
same number of collisions with llie plane AB, the molecules will
only Iiave fo pass over a way Pecos f dt, ijistead of over a wav
Pvcosi{i — 'iA)dt, in other words, the number of collisions of this
system increases in the I'atio (1 — 4.1): A." Now between the two
results there is onlv diflference of order — aiid iji so far as we wish
A''
to neglect the (piantities of this ordei', Koktk\vk<;'s i-esult may cer-
taiidy be accepted. If, however, we wish to solve the proldem
rigorously, the fu'st result alone can be accepted.
For KoRTEWEG makes it appear, as if — taking into account the part
of the way being saved — an ecpially long way is described in the
time (1 — 4:A)dt, as in the time dt without doing so. Now in the
last case the molecules pass over a way Pv cos 8 dt iji the time dt,
so PvcosBdt{\ — 4J) iji the time (1 — ^A)dt. hi the time dt there
is saved -i APi: cos t dt. in the time (i — ^A)dt therefore (1 — 4.1)
4: APr cos 8 dt : so the <listauce, passed over in the time (1 — 4.1)(/^
by saxijig way and really moving together is somewhat slighter
(viz. 1() A' l*r cos 8 dt) than that passed o\ er by the i-eal motion alone
in the time dt ^).
^) Perhaps Kokteweg was led when drawing up the formula nieutiuned in the
text by the solution of the problem in one dimension wliich be has given in
Nature (loc. eit.) later on. He linds there — i)erfectly accurately — Ibr Ibe time

This formula reminds us more of Korteweg's result than of ours, really however
it agrees with the latter, not with the former. For, if we determine the ratio of
the number of collisions with and without saving wav, it is Q = . Now L is the
total distance over which the molecules can move, so the path described by their
own motion + the path saved; nX is the path saved. So L corresponds with
(1 4- 4 ^i) P f cos fc dt, nx with 4 A P v C08 i dt ; so the ratio of the collisions is here
agaiji (1+4 .4) : 1. To Kohteweg's result 1 : (1—4 A) would the formula Q = ~ ' ^
L-~2 «A
correspond, which agrees with the first as to the terms of llie ordei' , but which
is certainly not strictly accurate.
It is true that with the formula for one dimension, with regard to its physical
meaning, an equation of state agrees, in which a quantity is subtracted from tlie
volume whirb is a function of 6 and r, not a formula of form (1); but we shall
see that our formula derived in the text, leads also to such a linal form.
