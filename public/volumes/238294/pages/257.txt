'OYi, ozr

is no more equiangular to the right, but to the left, or if we suppose
'OF/, OZ;
OX/, OW,
to be also equiangular to the right, we must take as indicating vector
in Si that vector in the direction of which W would move together
with S^, not the one moving together with ^4 in the direction of TF.
We shall do the latter. The advantage of this choice will be evident
from what follow^s.'
We have still to remark, that if only the position of Sj. and Si is
determined, the position of S^ ensues from it not in one, but in
two ways; for, a position of /S^ gives no other positions of S,- and
Si as its "opposite position" for which all vectors are reversed ; that
opposite position can be obtained by an arbitrary equiangular double
rotation over an angle jr; Sr and Si then rotate 2 n and are again
in their former position.
But a continuous motion of S^ out of a given initial position is
unequivocally determined by the given continuous movements of
Sr and >S/ out of the corresponding initial positions. So we shall
have completely answered the question how a solid S^ moves under
the action of determined forces if we can point out how Sr and Si
move under those actions; in other words if we can point out "the
cones of rotation in the solid and in space".
APPLICATION. The Euler motion in S,.
The equations of motion for this have been given for the first
time by Frahm in the "Mathematische Annalen" Band 8, 1874 p. 35.
The system of- coordinates OX^ X^ X^ X^ in the solid we shall
choose in such a way that the products of inertia disappear. We
shall suppose
'OX,, OX,
OX,, OX,^
to be equiangular to the right.
And we choose OXr ïr Zr and OXi Yi Zi in such a way that
OX,, OX,, 0X3, OX,
OXr, OYr, OZr, OW
is equiangular to the right and
0X„ 0X„ 0X3, OX,
OXi, OYi, OZi, OW^
