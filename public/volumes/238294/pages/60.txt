I also follow e<l his advice not to reduce the transits to the middle
tliread. l»iit simply to take the mean of i\\o observed times of transit.
A sliuht disadxaida^e of the coiii-se followed l)\- me is that, when
either for the moon or for the star the transit o\er a thi'ead has
not been obsei-xed, we mns( also exclude the corres[)ondin,u- ti-ansil
of the other object. This was only the case with the two observa-
tions of 11)01 May 21 -).
Having found in this n\ ay the times of the [)assage over the mean
of the threads we had now lirst lo determine the differences s l>etween
the observed differences in zenith distance of the moon and the star
as siiown by the level-i-eadings and the \alues computed for them
with adopted rediiclion elements, among w hicii an assumed longitude
of the station. Secondly the ecpiations of condition were formed, by
means of which the values of C are connected with the variatiojis of
the adopted elements. These (Mpiations were transformed so as to
express AA, the \ariatioJi of the ado[ited longitude, as a function
of ?, and of the \ariatioJis of the a<lopled latitude, of the adopted
cori-ection of the chronometer, of the times of transit of the moon
and the star, of the adopted right ascejision and deidination of the
two objects and of tiie ado[)le(l values for the parallax and the
semidiameter of the moon.
On the one hand this course enabled me to correct the results
founil provisionally as soon as corrected xalues of the reduction
elements had been derixed: (ui the othei- hand the e([uations showed
the influence of residual errors in the obser\(Ml (piantities and in the
reduction elements.
In the first place 1 shall consider the Naliies a<lo|>ted tinally for
the elements of i>'(liiction. 1 accepted as the latitude of the station
