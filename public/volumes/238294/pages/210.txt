of n acid corresponding with 0.82 millimols of meta if we apply tlie correc-
tion of 2.6»^ foi' the meta compound attacked. 0.82 millimols = 10.5%
of the meta compound.
h. 1.1250 grams = 7.98 millimols. of the said mixture were treated in
an analogous manner with the equivalent quantity (16.9 cc.) of njo-u
sodium methoxide. The liquid was then titrated back with 0.85 cc. of fi acid,
corresponding, after applying the correction, with 0.87 millimols. of the meta
compound, or 10.9 %. Taking the mean of these two experiments we find
10.7 "/„ of the meta-compound.

sponding' anisol l»y the action of sodium methoxide. This circum-
stance miglit he taken advantage of for the quantitative deterniMiation
of tiiis dinitro compound in the presence of benzene yMiitrotluori(ic
if the latter should suffer no change. This Avas, indeed, the case :
1.0035 grams of the para compound were treated at 15" for 5 minutes
with 9.58 cc. of /^Vgi = ^ ^^- '^ sodium methoxide. After being poured into
water the liquid was titrated back with 5 cc of n acid.
A mixture of tJie two gave the following result:
1.1680 grams of a mixture containing 10.9% of the dinilro compound were
digested at 15" for 5 minutes with 17.6 cc. of n/.^.i.^ Na OCH^. The liquid
was then titrated back with 7.6 cc. of n acid; there was, therefore, present
17.6
a quantity of dinitro compound of — ^- — 7.6 = 0.7 millimols , or 0.1302 gram
corresponding with 11.1 % of the dinitro compound.
The above observations rendered it possible to quantitatively deter-
mine any I)enzene di- or metanitrotluoride eventually present in a
nitration product of benzene fluoride. In order to determine the
benzene orthonitrofluoride contained therein, I converted this into the
dinitrocompound by renewed treatment of the nitration product willi
concentrated nitric a(!id. Dr. Beekman had found that a further nitra-
tion took place (as shown by the increased sp. gr.) AvJien the said
product was treated for half an hour at 0° with five times its weight
of nitric acid of 1.52 sp. gr., but that e\en after this treatment,
traces of benzene ortlionitrofluoiide may still be detected by boiling
the compound with aqueous sodium hydroxide which yields o-nitro-
plienol. On the other hand Dr. Hkkkman showed that pure benzene
/)- and ///-nitroMuoride are t(uite unaffected by this renewed treatment.
