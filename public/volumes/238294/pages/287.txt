absorbent snbstanee. The apparent displaeenienl of tlie bajid near
the limit of absor[)lion must tlieji immediately a[)pear.
For my measurements with [)otassium ferrieyanide I iiave made
use of rotations of IP and higher. A quartz j)late 0.4 m.ni. thick,
out at right angles to the optical axis was now nsed and with it a
similar rotation is obtained near the limit of absorption. This plate
preceded and followed by a nicol was placed between the collimator
and the experimental tubes, \vhich moreover were monnted in precisely
the same way as they were for measurements of the rotation in
potassium ferrieyanide. A large nnmher of adjustments have been
made l\v rotating one of the nicols, one set where the experimental
tube was fdled witii a V/., "/„ solution of potassium ferrieyanide, and
one with water instead of the salt-sobition. The calibration of the
spectrum was made as before with a mercury arc lamp. The following
values have thus been obtaijied, as means of pairs of adjustments:
