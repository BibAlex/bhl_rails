y^-iiitrofliioride is unaffGctcd lliercbv. Tliis did not seem to be quite
the case, so a small coiTectioii has to be applied:
(/. 2.95 grams of pure i>N0o.C,;.H4.Fl were treated at 0° with iive times
the weight of faming nitric acid of 1.52 sp. gr. The compound rapidly dis-
solved without elevation of temperature. After one hour the liquid was
poured into ice water and the fluorine derivative was instantly precipitated
in a solid condition. When the liquid had become clear it was carefully
filtered and the mass was repeatedly triturated in ice water until the
acid reaction had completely disappeared. It was then treated with 9.65 cc.
of )/ Vo:; Na OCHs for 5 mmutes at lb''. The liquid was then titrated
back with 4,77 cc. of n acid. This gives -^^ - 4.77 = 0.23 cc. of n alkali
consumed, corresponding with 0.428 gram of dinitro compouud, or 1.4 "/o.
b. 1.732 grams of the para compound were treated in the same manner.
But after the acid had been removed by washing, the residue was melted
to a clear liquid by applying a gentle heat. It w^as then cooled in ice water
and again triturated and washed in ice water until the last traces of acid
had disappeared: it was then treated as in a. 10.48 cc. of «,1.93 NaOCHs
were used and the liquid was titrated back with 5.3 cc. x acid; 0.1 cc. of
n alkali had therefore been absorbed corresponding v^'ith 0.186 gram of
dinitro compound or 1.0° 'q. The mean of the two determinations is there-
fore 1.2%.
Beiiiji' in possession of these data, 1 ha\e now subjected the nitra-
tion product of l)enzene thioride to the same test. Dr. Beekman had
previously found that the nitration at with a mixture of 25 cc.
of nitric acid of 1.48 sp.p,T., 5 cc. acid of 1.51 sp. gr. and 10 grams
of benzene tluoride yields a compound consisting solely of mononitro
compound (to judge from its percentage of nitrogen; found 1;).95
calculated 9.93). I, therefore, nitrated in the same manner and puritied
the product, which in ice water is senii--solid, by first wasliing it
in ice water, being careful not to lose any oily globules, and thoi
with water at 20'', which caused the whole mass to melt to a homo-
genous liquid. After all acid reaction had disappeared the bulk of
the water was i-emoved by means of a separatory funnel, the clear
l)ale yellow oil was b-eed b-oni a few (b-ops of adhering water by
means of a strip of tilterpaper and the]i finally heated in a testtube
at 90° — 100' until it no longer became hazy on cooling. We may
assume that all the moisture has then been removed, likewise small
<(uaiitities of any niicliangcMlhenzeue fiuoride. The product so obtained
solidified after inoculation at 1<S^.7 ; a second preparation at 18'. (5.
It docs m)t coutaiu Ueuzcue dinitrotluoride :
1.4115 grams were treated for 5 minutes with 9.45 cc. of w Vi-gs «odium
meLhoxide. The liquid was titrated back with 4.9 cc. « acid, or 9.46 « 1.9s acid.
