Fi'om the \(M'v first, tlic l.-ittci- is pertectlv sharp and Hat, it remains
at the sani(^ ph-ice also after stirrinp,'. The tein])ei'atni'(' was ohsei'X'ed
iinnicMliatelv after tlie appearance of the striae, then the pressni-e and
the volnmc ixwd then the tcinperatnre was detei'iniiie<l auain. So we
ohtain th(> pressni'e for one or a i'vw hnndredths of a degree below
the critical 1('in])eratiir(\ Kor this a eori'eclion has Ixmmi applied.
If A\(' allow the leinpcratnrc to rise, we slill see a nieniscns
dnrinu' a considerable lenuth of time after the tcmpcratnre in the
bath has risen to a few hnndredths of a deui-ee altox-e the ci'ilical
tcmperalnre. It disa|)pears immediatelv, howexcr. when we s|ii'.
Hence this is no phenomenon of eqnilibriiim.
So ^^<' coidd dei-i\-e the lemperatiii'e and the |)i-essnre <lirectlv
from obserx jitioji. Kor the xolnme this \\ as not possible, as owing
to the ellect of graxitation the phenomena described above occnr
at different xobimes. so for instance in mv observations with a
volnme : ().()()ol>24 (slii-i-er below), where the meinscns appeared
in the immediate neighbonrhood of the top of the Inbe, and with a

above the niercnrv.
The method genei-ally nseil foi' the determination of the critical
volnme consists in determining some li(pnd and vaponi- densities
at teni])eratnres below the ci-itical. and then nsing the rnle of the
rectilinear diameter of ('aii.i.ktkt and Mathias. To this end we
have drawn on a diagi-am the densities i-esnlting from \\ic data of
§ 4. table XXI and § 2. r, a- a t'nnction of the lemperatni-e, and
the diameter has been draxxji on it. A <le^■ialion from tlie rectiiinearity
conld not be stated w illi certainty. Kor the critical density, exjti'essed
in terms of the theoretical noi-mal deirsiiy we <leri\e from this diagram
2:39, hence for th(> ci-itical volnme 0. 00418.
Another method is this: At the critical pond ,^„ =: .^,-,
