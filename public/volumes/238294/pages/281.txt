water is also foiiiid in the south-east corner of tlie Beenrister polder,
opposite Pnrmerend.
On the whole west of the Haarleninienneer poldei', in wells not
great!}" exceeding»- 30 ^I. in depth, tlie underground water is equally
fresh as dnne-water, also at Heemstede and at Hillegoni and in some
of the shallow polders near Haarlem. At great depth, tiiere is in
those parts a considerahle increase in the quantity of chlorine. Near
the railwaystation of Vogelenzang, between the Leidsche \'aart and the
rail-road, at 1600 M. from the Haarlemmermeer polder, at a depth of
88M.~A.P., it amounted to 184.6 m.G. a Liter, it being only 35.5 m.G.
a Liter at 25 M. .' A. P. Near the villa Bennebroek, 650 M. from the
Haarlemmermeer i)older, 47 M. ^ A. P. deep, it contained 99.4 m.G.,
and at a depth of 89 M., 245 m.G. chlorine a Liter; on Bosbeek,
in the parish of Heemstede, being only 440 lAI. from that poldei-, at
about 30 M. -^ A. P., 58 m.G. a L. Numerous instances may be
brought forward of the quantity of salt in the underground water
growing with its greater depth, and at a higher level, as one draws
nearer to the deep polders. A well-know]i tact is, that in consequence
of the flowing do\vn of the underground water from off the dunes,
the water of the neighbouring low-lands, up to quite a few kilo-
meters' distance, may be fresh. More considerable and noticeal)le at
greater distance however, is that down-flow deep in the ground.
Close to the steam-mill for the (b'aining of the land, in the Meer-
weiden near Velsen, at full \/.j K.M. from the dunes, the under-
ground water, 28 M. below A. P., contained 30.5 m.G. chlorine and
at 44 M. below A. P., ()5.4 m.G.; and even 1 K.M. more east,
within the precincts of the fort, in the western corner of the Zuid-
wijkermcer polder (S.L. -^ 2.40 M.), at 34 M. -f A.P., only 60 m.G. ; at
45 M. -T- A. P., on the other hand, 603 m.G. chlorine a Liter. In
the midst of the dunes themsehes the ground-w^ater seems to get
brackish only at about 150 M. below A. P.
Of special significance is the fact, already stated above, that the
underground w^ater in the deep polders is growing Salter at a much
higher level. So at Eert-den-Koning, only 300 M. within the Haarlem-
mermeer polder, at 26 M.^ A. P., the underground water had 367m G.
chlorine a Liter. Similar conditions are generally prevailing tliere. That,
generally speaking, the higher percentage of salt cannot be attributed to
water from the canals ( "boezem w^ater"), so cannot have got in from the
surface, may in the first place, be proxed from the fact, that the
water in silallo^^■ [)olders, in many places, dowqi to considerable
depths is as })erfeclly sweet as that in the dunes, although one can
prove that there is \\o communictvtion with the dunes; in the second
