It is therefore not a inattei' of doiihl tliat a third isomer does

in fact been done in the said article of Behkknd and Roth.
H. The mutual trausformation of the methylglucosides and pent-
acetates throws a new light on the phenomenon of the mnltirotation
of sugars. We may accept as the most probable explanation of this
phenomenon a mutual direct transformation of the two stereoisomerie
modilications which must exist according to Tollens' glncose formula.
The recently published ijivestigations of Fhankland Akmsthong^) and
of Behrend and Roth ') have furnished strong arguments in taxour
of this view.
But it must be remembered that Tollens' formula does not express
the aldehydic properties of glucose; one is therefore inclined to
assume that in a glucose solution there must occur als(j molecules
in the aldehyde-form, or molecules which contain I more H, O with
the group H C (OH).^. One may then also come to the conclusion
that this hydrated aldehyde-form does not act as an intermediate
product in the transformation between the two stereoisomerie oxide
modifications "), but that we have here a complete analogy of what
takes place with the glucosides, namely that, although a direct trans-
formation takes place between the stereoisomers, there also occurs
a (piantitatively insignificant, secondary reaction involving addition
and eliminatioji of the solvent. These reactions will then all be in
equilibrium with each other. This point, I will also try to elucidate
experimentally ").
