lengths, from 10 to 26 feet. These pieces are resawed by hand with
a whipsaw to the desired size for sash, doors, flooring, moldings, and
other finishing material. This class of lumber varies in price according
to quality and size, the larger pieces being preferred. It is sold by the
piece, but the price in square feet measure is from $16 to $19 per 1,000*
feet. The boards used for siding, partitions, and other purposes are
pine, both yellow and white, and are sawed about three- eights and
three-fourths of an inch thick by 10 to 12 inches wide, and from 10 to
16 feet long. When comparatively clear of knots they sell at $23.75
to $26 per 1,000 feet, according to length and thickness, but when
full of knots and of short lengths sell as low as $ 11 per 1,000 feet.
Frame material is generally sold in beams from 4J to 12 inches square,
of various lengths, up to 37 feet. The oak beams, best quality, sell at
$24 to $27 per 1,000 feet. The pine frame lumber is sold in similar
sizes and is resawed by hand for rafters, studding, etc., and sells for
from $22 up to $28 for best quality and long pieces. Pine flooring
dressed on one side sells at $28 to $32 per 1,000 feet. The best grade
is not entirely clear of knots and the cheapest contains some black
knots.

The duty on foreign lumber imported into Turkey is uniformly 8 per
cent ad valorem. The Turkish Government charges a tax of 20 per
cent ad valorem for cutting timber in the forests of Turkey, and 12 per
cent ad valorem duty on lumber when shipped from one province to
another. These charges have greatly injured the production of home
lumber and the owners of forests are making an effort to get relief, but
with no apparent prospects of success.
CLIMATE AND GENERAL BUILDING.
This part of Turkey has usually a very temperate climate, but, at long
intervals, the winters are quite severe.
Owing to numerous disastrous conflagrations, the authorities of Con-
stantinople have prohibited the construction of wooden buildings, but
in other parts of the Empire no such prohibition exists, and wooden
