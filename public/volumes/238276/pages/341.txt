SUMMARY
Average prices reported by manufacturers in the western part of the country for January 7
February and March, 1911, apparently indicate better conditions in the lumber industry." Douglas
fir items reported upon show prices closely approaching those given in the record for the last three
months of 1910. Red cedar, hemlock, western yellow pine and Sitka spruce prices advanced slightly
over those for the preceding quarter, while minor reductions are shown in western white pine and
redwood values.
Yellow pine prices reported by the Mississippi Valley and Atlantic Coast mills are considerably
higher for the first three months of 1911 in comparison with those printed in the record for the last
quarter of 1910. White pine prices in the Lake States also advanced. Hemlock figures from eastern
and West Virginia mills are a trifle lower, though the Lake States figures remain about the same as
for the preceding quarter. Spruce prices reported from West Virginia mills are slightly higher in
comparison, though small declines are apparent in the prices given for the eastern and Adirondack
mills. North Carolina pine values show little change. Cypress prices are not of the high level of
the preceding quarter.
Small changes are to be noted in hardwood prices for the first quarter of the year when compared
with the record for the last quarter of 1910. Among the woods showing a tendency to advance in
price are bass wood, birch, chestnut, cottonwood, hard and soft maple and tupelo. Slight declines
are shown generally in the prices reported on beech, rock elm, soft elm, plain oak, and red and white
quartered oak, while ash, gum and hickory prices are practically unchanged.
