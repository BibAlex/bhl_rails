DUTY AND PRICES.
The import duty is 3 per cent on declared invoice value of all goods.
Pitch pine is sold at $30 to $35, and white pine from $35 to $40 per
1,000 feet. Spruce and oak are imported by ship carpenters solely for
their own use in repairing ships, etc., and are not for sale.
CLIMATE.
The climate of the Danish West Indies is in general healthful, the
islands being situated in latitude 17 to 18 north and nearly in the
strength of the northeast trade winds, which blow nearly the entire
year, the thermometer in the winter months ranging from 70 to 80,
and in summer, 80 to 90 F.
GENERAL BUILDING.
All the large houses here are built of brick and stone, with wood
floors, windows, doors, etc. Small houses are built entirely of wood,
with stone foundation about 10 feet high. Small fishing boats and row
boats are built of the native woods. No large vessels are built here.
There are no railroads within my consular district.
EXTENSION OF LUMBER TRADE.
As will be seen from the statement of imports, the United States
leads all other countries.
I can offer no suggestions, as I see no means of further extending
the trade of American lumber in these islands.

Consul.
