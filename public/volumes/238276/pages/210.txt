AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
tens; its forests of goodwood having been exhausted, it now draws
large supplies from Sweden to keep its mills going.
Sweden sends large quantities of red and white deals and battens,
and also baulk timber from 6 to 12 inches square. The Swedish wood
can be had of very fine quality, and it is graded in quality from 1 to
6, the first four qualities being supposed to be entirely free from rot.
The sizes usually sent from there run from 4 by 1 to 12 by 4, and the
Swedish shippers pay more particular attention to the wants of their
customers than do any other shippers.
Germany sends red timber, in large quantities, which is rather coarse,
but of a healthy nature and strong fiber. Germany, also, ships large
quantities of fir for railroad sleepers, which are cut to size before being
shipped.
Woods from the United States are now largely superseding some of
the former, notably beams and wood for churches, halls, etc., and sawn
pitch pine logs which are of very fine quality and cut to dimensions
required. American oak, for wagons is also largely imported, as well
as all sorts of woods used in the manufacture of hubs, spokes, and
felloes. Canary, or American white wood, is growing in favor, and if
it could be got in longer lengths say from 24 to 34 feet or upwards
it would doubtless be used more extensively, as it would then be suita-
ble for ship decks, etc., the short lengths in which it is now being
received rendering it unsuitable for these purposes.
It would be hard to say which kinds of lumber are preferred, the use
of the various kinds being solely dependent upon the quality and price ?
keeping in mind the particular purpose for which it is to be used.
