AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.

as ail experiment and to try the market. I do not think, however, fche
result of the ventures was at all successful.
Speaking in general in regard the business of exporting lumber and
hard woods from the Argentine Kepublic, it may be said that it has not
been profitable in the past, and it has to be managed on a different
basis to reach to any great proportions in the future. The great draw-
back to a successful prosecution of the industry results from the fact,
in the first place, that even the most accessible forests are so remote
from tide water that the cost of freight is out of proportion to that
for which the hard woods of Central America and portions of Brazil can
be sent to market. It is true that, at certain seasons of high water
ocean-going vessels can be loaded far up the Parana, and even Para-
guay, and thus convey their cargoes, without breaking bulk, to their
trans- Atlantic destination. But in many cases, the lumber has to be
brought down in small craft, or latas, and reshipped, thus making
another handling necessary. And in the second place the appliances
for handling logs and heavy timber on the upper rivers are so primi-
tive and the laborers so inefficient that the getting out of it is very
expensive.
IMPORTS OF LUMBER.
As long as the people of this part of the Argentine Republic, for
ordinary carpentry and building purposes, are able to procure the pines
and spruces from North American ports with as little trouble and
expense as they have been doing in the past, it is not probable that
there will be very great attention paid to the heavy hard woods of this
country. Of course the shipments of North American soft woods vary
according to the demands of the trade. When everything is " boom-
ing " the requirements of the country are greater than when there is
general stagnation in business. The crisis, which has been so severe
for several years past, has been especially felt in house building, house
furnishing, estancia fencing, and general construction ; and the receipts
of lumber from abroad, which reached their highest figures in 1889, have
since then shown a great contraction.
The following table, which I have in great part compiled from the
official returns, shows the value of the importations of lumber into the
Argentine Republic since the year 1870, inclusive:
