in Ohio and Indiana. The prices for both plain and quartered oak were characterized
by decided gains. The average increase of all the grades probably amounted to over
$1.50. Poplar prices were exceptionally staple. In Louisiana tupelo made an
advance in all grades, while hard maple generally, except in Pennsylvania, showed
uniformly slight improvement.
A comparison of prices for the third quarter of 1911 with the corresponding quarter
of 1910 shows western softwoods generally lower except western hemlock and western
white pine; in these there are slight indications of improvement. Eastern softwoods
as a whole showed a fairly uniform increase. Nearly all grades of yellow pine, par-
ticularly in the Mississippi Valley, made advances. In Georgia, Florida, and South
Carolina the conditions only slightly improved, while in North Carolina prices re-
mained uniformly staple. Hemlock in the Lake States changed for the better, but
held constant in West Virginia and Pennsylvania. White pine, eastern spruce, and
West Virginia spruce showed improvement.
Hardwoods, more than either the western softwoods or the eastern softwoods, showed
generally larger and more decided gains over the same period in 1910. The most
notable improvements were in the general prices of oak, ash, and chestnut.
