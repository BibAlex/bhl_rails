AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
181
great exportation of same for foreign paper mills has also lately
sprung up.
Fir is a harder and more expensive wood than pine, and is commonly
used in ship and house building and for furniture. The shipyards,
which have fewer wooden vessels on the docks year after year, still
import some foreign woods, such as pitch pine, oak, and teak, chiefly
from Eussia, the German provinces on the Baltic, and also from the
United States.

DUTY AND PRICES.
There is no import duty on lumber in this country, nor has any
export duty been levied since July 1, 1893.
The prices quoted in this market for the different kinds of lum-
ber exported can not easily be given, but those quoted in the offi-
cial statistics published for 1892 are, as I understand, correct, being
based on reliable statements made at the principal exporting places,
and prices have not on an average undergone any noteworthy change
since then.
