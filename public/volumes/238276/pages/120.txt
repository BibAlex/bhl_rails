100 AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
CLIMATE.
The climate of Siam, while tropical, varies, for its territory extends
from about 2 to 19 latitude north. The temperature in any part,
however, rarely gets below 60 F., and generally averages between
90 and 100 F.
GENERAL BUILDING.
The building in Siam is limited, and is generally confined to this
city. The upper classes among the natives build upon European plans,
while the lower classes live in small bungalows, built of bamboo.
Shipbuilding is not carried on to any extent. The largest ships con-
structed are lighters of probably 100 tons displacement. The most of
this kind of work is limited to building steam launches and rowboats.
EXTENSION OF THE LUMBER TRADE.
I believe it hardly possible to open up a market for American lumber
in Siam, except, possibly, in some of the cheap varieties, which would
necessarily have to be brought here at a low rate of freight, and it
should be impervious to white ants, which are very destructive in this
country.

NATIVE WOODS.
Palestine, within historic times, has never been a wooded country.
At present there are practically no native woods suitable for building
purposes. The celebrated oak and terebinth, which once covered the
highlands with considerable forests, are now represented by a few
dwarfed specimens of their kind. The olive still lines the hillsides and
\ alleys, but does not furnish any building material, being used solely
in the manufacture of olivewood ornaments and trinkets.
KINDS OF LUMBER USED.
There is very little wood used in the construction of buildings of any
kiud. Stone, which is so abundant, is used for every part of the struc-
