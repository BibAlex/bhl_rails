SUMMARY.
The advance in wholesale lumber prices during April, May, and June, 1912,
continued during the months of July, August, and September. The Pacific
coast species which continued to rise were red cedar, Douglas fir, western hem-
lock, and redwood. Western yellow pine and Sitka spruce failed to follow the
advance, but western larch, which showed no change during the second quarter,
sold at better prices. In eastern softwoods yellow pine made decided ad-
vances ; North Carolina pine and hemlock advanced somewhat, while the prices
of white pine and spruce made no general change. Among the hardwoods
prices were generally higher in the Southern and Central States, except on gum,
while in the Northern States ash, basswood, beech, and birch were somewhat
lower and maple somewhat higher.
In Washington western red cedar beveled siding No. 1 rose $2,- shop No. 2
over $3, and the grades of shingles 25 cents to 50 cents. Douglas fir flooring
No. 1 V. G. advanced $2.80 in Oregon and Washington, while timbers 12 inches
by 12 inches, average 32 feet, rose about $1 in both States. The following ad-
vances occurred in western hemlock sales in Washington : Flooring Nos. 1 and

boards No. 2 over $2, and dimension No. 1, common, $4. In Idaho western
white pine finish C select advanced $2 and finish D select declined $4. Western

but declined 80 cents in Idaho, while common boards No. 2 rose $1 in California
but declined in both Washington and Idaho. In California redwood sales
