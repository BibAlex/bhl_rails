AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
EXPORTS OF NATIVE WOODS.
In regard to exports of lumber from the country, there is as yet very
little to be said. As we have seen, while the upper territories and
provinces are an unbroken forest of primeval proportions, in which are
to be found hundreds of varieties of hard woods, susceptible of the
very finest polish and presenting the most exquisite colorings, yet the
country is almost devoid of the soft woods of commerce. There are
pines in the territory of* Misiones and along the eastern slopes of the
Cordilleras of Patagonia, but they are quite inaccessible to market.
Years hence, with the development of the country, they may come to
the front. At present the only woods which are shipped abroad are
the hard woods of the upper Parana. Owing to their specific gravity,
it is impossible to float the logs, and so they are brought down in chutes
or are loaded from the banks directly in sailing vessels bound for
Europe. The first movement towards the export of Argentine woods
was made in 1875. Since then the annual shipments to foreign markets
have been:

It is evident from these custom-house returns that the greater por-
tion of the lumber and precious woods of the country are made use of
here at home. The value of the forest exports for 1891 amounted to
about 8 per cent of the total exports. In 1892 it amounted to about 4
per cent of the total exports. The exports of these years embraced the
following items:

All these shipments went to European ports, except a small portion
of the cedar and of the quebracho, which was sent to the United States
