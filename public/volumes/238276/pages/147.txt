AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.

LUMBER MOST USED.
For uses requiring long and strong timbers, say for scaffolding, joists,
rafters, and the like, especially where uniform strength is needed with-
out too great weight, " Oregon pine," or what is known in the Pacific
States as " fir," is most highly prized and most extensively used. It
comes chiefly from Washington and Oregon, and in the rough state.
Eedwood is a favorite timber for inside work, as it works so much
more easily than the native woods and finishes as finely. It is imported
in the rough and dressed at the local mills.
As a rule the native woods of Australia are very hard and heavy.
While many of them take a very fine polish and can be richly finished,
they are hard to work and to handle. Ironbark stands first on Lloyd's
estimate as a shipbuilding timber.
For flooring the Kauri pine of New Zealand, of which there are con-
siderable forests, is regarded as very good, and is much in use, though it
is inferior to the fir of the Pacific States when the latter is sawed with
proper regard to the grain. The Kauri pine has little strength, as
there seems to be a lack of continuity of fiber, and it is certainly less
durable than fir.
There are complaints that the Oregon pine (fir) flooring, when worn
sometime, splinters or scales up, but that comes from its being sawed
without proper regard to grain. The Australians want the best of
everything, and I feel confident that the long, clear flooring of the
Pacific Northwest fir, sawed properly and dressed to, say 4 inches
in width, would take the market when there is one.
For cabinetwork, carriages, carts, vehicles, and most machinery
the strong and heavy native woods are chiefly used, while for cooperage
the timbers of New Zealand and Tasmania are preferred.

Of rough or undressed lumber (all of what we in the United States
call "lumber " is here called " timber," and it is reckoned by the hundred
superficial feet instead of by the thousand) there was imported in the
