AUSTRALIAN WOODS FOR STREET-PAVING.
At the present time, when this country is recovering from the recent
financial cyclone, and when the business outlook is daily growing more
promising, it is not inappropriate to consider by what means the com-
merce between the United States and the Australian colonies can be
increased to mutual advantage.
It has occurred to me that a large and profitable business can be done
between the two countries by the shipping to the United States of
wood blocks for street-paving. The advantages to be derived are
manifold.
Wood pavements are admittedly the best in the world, and of late
years they have only been abandoned in the United States owing to the
fact that no wood of native growth could bo found that would stand
the wear and tear of the heavy traffic in our large cities.
In this country one is compelled to notice and give the palm to the
street pavements made from blocks of red and blue gum, a wood grown
in this country, which have proved to be equal to all requirements.
I have noticed, in this city and in Sydney, where strips of the wooden
pavements have been joined to a stone pavement and where both have
been subjected to the heaviest wear, that the wooden pavement has
worn even better than the stone, and, where the two pavements join,
the edges of the wood blocks are not even chipped or worn.
It is a pity that our country, which is so far ahead of other lands in
many respects, should be so far behind in this matter of street-paving.
Can we not adopt the Australian wood blocks to advantage ? If a fair
trial could be given by some of our cities, I am sure that it would result
in the adoption of Australian timber for street-paving in the United
States and thus open up a new industry between the two countries.
