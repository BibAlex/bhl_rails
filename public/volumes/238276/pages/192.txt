There were also imported in 1892 17,944 tons of boxwood, of which
9,760 tons came from the West Indies, 3,099 tons from the United
States, and the remainder principally from the East Indies and Africa.
In the foregoing statistics the difference between classes 1 and 2, i. e.,
"timber, round or rough hewn," and "squared logs," is this: The first
class includes beams, piles, and ship timber imported in the general
form in which it is to be used, while class 2 includes the blocks and
logs which have been squared to save freight and duty on waste mate,
rial, and which are imported for the special purpose of being sawn
into veneers or other forms of fine lumber for cabinetwork or building
purposes. The reason for this latter method of importation will be
apparent when the classification and rates of duty in each class are
explained.
PRICES.
The prices of lumber in Germany are based upon classifications and
methods of measurement, which are somewhat difficult to clearly explain.
The American unit of measure per "thousand feet," is not used in this
country. Timber is sold by the cubic meter, equal to 35.3 cubic feet ; and
sawed lumber is sold at retail by the piece and at wholesale by the hun-
dred pieces. This latter system will be illustrated by the following tabu-
lar price list, showing the wholesale rates at which pine and fir building
lumber are now offered for delivery at Frankfort by lumbermen who
have sawmills in the forests of Bavaria, Wurtemberg, and Baden.
These are therefore the prices with which American building lumber
would have to compete, exclusive of duty, if introduced into this mar-
ket.
The subjoined list shows the four standard grades or qualities, which
are designated, respectively, in German: "Eein," "ausschuss-rein,"
"gute,"and "ausschuss," which may be translated in their order as
"clear," "half clear," "good," and "culls." Under this grading or
classification of qualities, the wholesale price per 100 boards or pieces,
