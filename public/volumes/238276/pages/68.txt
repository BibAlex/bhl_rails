48 AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
Eailway construction is quite at a standstill. Last year only 639
kilometers of track were laid, the total number of kilometers in the
whole country now being 12,920 (8,028 miles), representing a total capi-
tal of $429,582,917.
Shipbuilding never has amounted to much in the Kiver Plate, and
the few river craft are of no great significance. Still there are several
shipyards where extensive repairing, refitting, and refurnishing are
done, and these always seem to have " plenty to do."
Housebuilding, especially here in Buenos Ayres, during the years
from 1886 to 1890, had a great development along with the great activ-
ity in real estate. The number of transfers of real estate in 1890 in
this city was 9,340, embracing 9,700,971 square meters, for the aggre-
gate sum of $80,862,716 paper currency, equal to about $25,000,000
gold. For some unexplained reason the annual municipal statistics do
not state the number of building permits or buildings erected each
year, and hence I am not able to give any figures on the subject ; but
a very large proportion of the transfers each year are made with a
view to the erection of buildings upon the lots. There has been no
census of Buenos Ayres since 1887, and at that time the following were
the building statistics of this city :
Brick houses 24,065
Wooden houses 2,084
Mixed houses 7,613
Public edifices 193
Houses in course of construction 489
Total in 1887 34,444
Assuming that 500 is the average number of houses annually erected,
it would appear that the present number of distinct habitations in
Buenos Ayres is about 37,500; and as it is claimed that the number of
dwellers to a house in this city, including conventillos or constructions
for the poor, is 15, it follows that the present population of Buenos
Ayres is 562,500. The number claimed by the municipality is 582,000.
House- build ing, however, as we have seen, is not the only use to
which North American and native lumber and woods is applied. A
large quantity is consumed in paling and picket fencing ; in the manu-
facture of chairs and other furniture, now made here in the styles of
France, England, and the United States, but which, owing to the
increased duties recently placed upon foreign furniture, it is no longer
possible to import without a loss; in the manufacture of dry goods and
packing boxes; in the manufacture of barrels, hogsheads, and other
coopers' work, though there is still a very large trade in American
"shooks;" manufacture of shoe lasts; of all sorts of turners 7 work;
of carriages, carts, and wagons; of boats and naval construction and
repairs; and for a thousand other objects, for which with the growth
of manufactures in this city the multiplied necessities of life call into
requisition the different varieties of wood and lumber.
