SAWMILL STATISTICS.
A compilation of the reports received from over 10,000 sawmills
in the United States upon their operations in 1905 gives the accom-
panying table, in which are shown the proportion of lumber kiln-
dried and the proportion surfaced, the amount of slab wood sold, and
the proportion of logs cut on lands belonging to the sawmill opera-
tors. No figures along these lines are available for New York, and
nftne are given for several of the States in which the cut was very
small.
The States in which the largest proportion of lumber is kiln-dried
by manufacturers are South Carolina, with 51.3 per cent; North
Carolina, with 36.5 per cent; Florida, with 35.9 per cent; Alabama,
with 34.8 per cent; and Georgia, with 30.6 per cent. In other States
the amount is less than 30 per cent. Altogether, 1,642 mills reported
the use of dry kilns.
A large amount? of the pine cut in the South is kiln-dried in order
to reduce its shipping weight, and this is especially true of loblolly
or North Carolina pine. Kiln-drying is practiced to a less extent in
the Rocky Mountain and Pacific coast States, and very little lumber
is kiln-dried by the sawmill operators in the hardwood region or
where the cut is principally by portable mills. For the country as
a whole, about 15 per cent of the lumber cut is kiln-dried at the mill.
A much larger proportion of the cut is surfaced at the mills than
is kiln-dried. Of the mills reporting, more than 3,900 surfaced a
portion of their cut. For the country as a whole, at least 35 per cent
is surfaced before it is shipped. In this respect Iowa leads, with 77.2
per cent surfaced ; but this is because most of the lumber cut in that
State is in a few big mills along the Mississippi which operate
exclusively on northern pine. Aside from Iowa, the States in which
the larger proportion of the cut is surfaced at the sawmill are Texas,
with 71.7 per cent; Louisiana, with 60.3 per cent; Idaho, 59.4 per
cent; Montana, 55.2 per cent; and Arkansas, with 50.6 per cent. In
all the other States less than half the cut is surfaced by the sawmill
operators, and, as in kiln-drying, a relatively small proportion of the
total cut is surfaced in the hardwood regions.
Some 4,000 mills reported sales of slab wood totaling 3,503,287
cords. Washington leads in this respect, with 559,231 cords, followed
by Michigan, with 523,518 cords ; Wisconsin, with 368,478 cords ; and
Virginia, with 213,522 cords. It is probably safe to assume that this
