MADEIRA.
NATIVE WOODS.
Of native trees the til is the largest and handsomest. It has shin-
ing, deep green leaves. The wood is brown, marked with dark veins,
and is susceptible of high polish. It is in much demand for furniture,
boxes, walking sticks, and souvenirs generally. Newly cut, til has a
disagreeable odor and can be used only when well seasoned.
The vinhatico is a fine tree. The wood is red and much used for
furniture. It is often called Madeira mahogany.
The aderno grows to the height of 60 feet and is used for cask staves.
The wood is white.
Azevinho and perado are closely allied trees, and are common species
of holly. The wood is white and is used for inlaid work. They attain
a height of 15 to 20 feet.
None of the foregoing trees are found elsewhere, except in the Cana-
ries. The pao branco is a handsome tree, attaining a height of 50
feet. It has a hard white wood, and is in much demand for keels of
boats. It grows readily from the seed. It is not found elsewhere except
in the Canaries 'and Azores.
The folhado is a fine tree, attaining a height of 60 feet. In summer
it is full of white, sweet scented flowers. Its wood is tough and of
light weight. It is of great interest to botanists, belonging to a genus
of which all the species, except this, are American.
These are about all the native woods that are used for manufactur-
ing.
