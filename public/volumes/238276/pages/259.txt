The circular says :
We note with regret a continued decrease in the business of the port. The grow-
ing scarcity of some descriptions of timber and the advanced cost of others have
reduced the supply on the one hand and limited the export by diminishing the con-
sumption on the other.
The concession of the use of steam in taking on board timber/ obtained by the
shipping merchants from the ship laborers, in connection with steamers, has resulted
in the transfer of an increased proportion of the export carrying trade from sail to
steam, and has to some considerable extent checked the tendency to send timber
from Montreal by steamer in preference to shipping from Quebec.
The market this season for South American lumber has been fairly active, both
direct from the Province of Quebec and via Portland, Boston, and other North
American ports. From the ports of the maritime provinces the spruce trade to the
Argentine Republic has been unusually active, and from Montreal heavy shipments
of pine to same destination were made near close of season. Prices range as follows :
Spruce, $11 to $13.50 per 1,000 feet, B. M., according to specification; pine, $17. 50 per
1,000 feet, B. M., for common to $50 for clear.
Owing to the depression in the United States, the lumber market there has not
been as good as expected, still all good lots of spruce suitable for that market have
realized about the same price as in 1893, and manufacturers expect an increase of at
least $1 per M. for the 1895 cut.
Freights opened at about 16s. Clyde and 18s. Liverpool for sail from Quebec, and
at 40s. for deals by steam from Montreal. Timber rates remained without any
change till advanced insurance toward end of season prevented timber shipments
except by steam, for which the rates ruled from 62s. to 70s. per Petersburg standard
intake, according to port of discharge. Steam freights from Montreal were greatly
depressed during the greater part of the season, and for some time rates previously
unheard of, such as 30s. for Glasgow, Avonmouth, and Liverpool, with 35s. for Lon-
don, were current, closing at some advance, especially for Liverpool.
