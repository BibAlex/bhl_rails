AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS. 73
GENERAL BUILDINGK
At present there is very little house building going on, on account
of the depressed state of affairs in general, and there is not now, nor
has there ever been, apy shipbuilding here.
The Panama Kailroad Company has 47 miles of laid track between
Panama and this city, but there is no railroad being built within this
consular district.
