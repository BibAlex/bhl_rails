SUMMARY.
Lumber prices for the last three months of 1911 were generally lower than for any
of the preceding quarters. In some cases, however, the period .showed important
advances.
The prices obtained for Douglas fir, following an almost constant decline during
the year, were lowest during the fourth quarter. Flooring and finish in Washington
and Oregon dropped $1 to $4 under prices of the spring and summer. The lower
grades do not show much change during the latter half of the year, and timbers and
crossties in particular remained nearly stationary. Western hemlock prices reached
bottom for the year in the fourth quarter. Flooring Nos. 1 and 2 was $4.50 lower than
in the third quarter, and the other grades fell about $1 during the same period. Sugar
pine sold at prices lower by $2 for shop No. 1 and by $5 for Nos. 1 and 2 clear than in
the third quarter. Idaho pine prices for the last quarter were the lowest for the year.
The decline from the third quarter prices amounted to from $3 to $5 in finish, C and D
select, and from $2 to $3 in beveled siding, B and C. Common boards, however, show
a rise of nearly one-half dollar. Western pine prices were generally lower for the fourth
quarter, but while some items sold for from $1 to $3 less, other items suffered no
decline. Redwood clears were lower by about $2, but common boards and crossties
sold at better prices during October, November, and December than during the
first six months of the year. Sitka spruce prices show little change during the latter
half of the year.
Except in Mississippi, yellow pine sold generally in the Mississippi Valley States
for the lowest prices of the year. In Texas and Arkansas the fall amounted to from
$1 to $2 in flooring, finish, etc., and in Louisiana to somewhat less. In Mississippi
the general average for the fourth quarter about equaled that for the third. Alabama
prices suffered a decline of from $0.50 to $2. In Florida and Georgia yellow pine prices
improved during the last few months of the year, and the grades of flooring show an
advance for the fourth quarter of from $2 to $6 over the third; common boards of
from $1 to $2; plank and dimension stock, $0.50 to $4. North Carolina pine prices
also improved in the last few months of 1911, the advance averaging somewhat less
than $1 in South Carolina and North Carolina. In West Virginia spruce, merchant-
able frames and boards sold at from $1 to $2 in advance of the prices for the preceding,
months of the year. Adirondack and New England spruce and hemlock generally
brought the lowest prices for the year during the fourth quarter. Hemlock in Wis-
consin was lower by from 25 to 50 cents; in Michigan higher by about the same amounts.
White pine prices were the lowest for the entire year, the decline being more marked
in Minnesota than in Wisconsin or Michigan, the latter holding up the best. It is
noticeable that prices obtained for No. 4 boards in the Lake States were higher for
the last quarter of the year.
Prices of ash fell off by amounts up to $5 and $6 under third quarter prices, but in
very many cases sales were made at prices equal to those obtained during the lii.^i
three months of the year. In basswood most items were lower by a few cents to $3,
but in West Virginia, firsts and seconds sold at $3 and No. 1 common at $0.67 over
third quarter prices, while in Michigan and Wisconsin firsts and seconds fell off about
$1; No. 1 common, from $0.25 to $1.50; while No. 2 common rose $2 in Michigan and
