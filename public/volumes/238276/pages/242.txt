222 AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
AMERICAN LUMBER IN FRANCE.
Consul Germain, of Zurich, writes September 25, 1895: I have the
honor to inform you that my report on u Swiss Market for American
Woods," printed in Consular Reports Fo. 175 (April, 1895), pages
509-515, has been copied and published by several French and German
trade journals, and thus circulated among interested European parties
in that line. I am in receipt this day of a letter, which I inclose, and,
translated, reads about as follows :
MAUBEUGE, NORD, FRANCE, September 23, 1895.
Mr. EUGENE GERMAIN,
United States Consul, Zurich, Switzerland:
We know that you have made a special and very complete study of the question
of American woods. Would it please you to cause useful information to be given us
to facilitate our wood importations ? As the first important point, we can inform you
that our firm can, if need be, furnish a guaranty of 1,000,000 francs ($200,000). This
is said to indicate to exporters that they can be at full ease as regards our solvency
or responsibility.
Thanking you in advance, etc., we remain,
LEGRAND & JEANNESSON.
This letter, if given publicity, would, I believe, result in business to
some of our wood exporters.
AMERICAN LUMBER IN SWITZERLAND.
In looking over the Swiss custom-house statistics I find that, although
most of the cantons of this mountainous country have extensive and
fine forests, they are not sufficient to supply Switzerland with the neces-
sary timber and lumber. In fact this country imported last year (1893)
18,200,099 francs ($3,502,619) of wood and manufactures of wood, while
the exports of the same amounted only to about 4,000,000 francs
($772,000). showing a surplus of imports over exports of over 14,000,000
francs ($2,762,000), in which amount the United States participated
only with 189,679 francs ($36,608).
It is evident that the United States could secure a greater share of
this Swiss trade, and in order to find out how the Swiss market could
be extended to our products in this line I addressed communications to
some of the interested parties, viz, dealers and importers in wood and
manufacturers of boats, carriages, furniture, etc., housebuilders, etc.,
asking their opinion. I now beg to submit, for the benefit of our peo-
ple in that line of trade, what parties here say regarding the kinds of
wood required, prices, etc. I also add a tabulated statement showing
the total Swiss imports during 1893 of the different kinds of lumber,
timber, etc., compared with the imports from the United States during
the same period, the principal sources of supply, and customs duties.
