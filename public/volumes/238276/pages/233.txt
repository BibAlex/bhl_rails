GENERAL BTJILDINGK
This consular district is one of the most important shipbuilding dis-
tricts in the United Kingdom, but the material used is exclusively iron.
No important structures of wood are ever erected in England.
EXTENSION OF LUMBER TRADE.
The trade here is a very old-established one, and the dealers are well
aware of all the world's sources of supply. The cost to deliver here is
the principal question to consider, and in this the sea freight cuts the
chief figure. For the class of lumber here mentioned the long Atlantic
voyage can not be expected to successfully compete with the shorter
one from the adjacent ports of the Baltic.
