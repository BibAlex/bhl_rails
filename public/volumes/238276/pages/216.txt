AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
As far as this part of Scotland is concerned, our chief competitor is
British North America. The supply from Canada and the British
possesions consists of yellow and red pine, oak, elm, ash, and birch. It
is shipped in the log, and also in deals, battens, and boards.
I find from the published statements of some of the principal lum-
ber-dealers that the import of lumber into the Clyde from British North
America for the following years was as follows:

This table includes all the lumber shipped from Canadian ports, and
therefore all lumber produced in the United States, but shipped at
Canadian ports. How much, if any, there is of such lumber can not
be ascertained here.
There has been a great falling off in Quebec staves. The importa-
tion from the United States was 999,348 pieces in 1892, and 817,785
pieces in 1893.
Staves from the United States have practically taken the place of the
Quebec article. Large quantites of staves are, however, brought into
the Clyde coastwise of which no account is kept.
The imports into the Clyde in 1893, as compared with 1892, show the
folio wing percentage decrease: Wanyand square yellow pine logs, 50; oak
logs, 50, although the imports from the United States show an increase;
elm and birch, 15 each; sawn pitch pine, 25; ash, which comes mostly
from the United States, shows a slight decrease; canary white wood
and poplar, 1,059 logs in 1893, a decrease of 118 logs.
Walnut, which comes entirely from the United States, shows an increase
of 33 per cent over 1892, but the wood was of an inferior quality.
Maple, which was almost entirely from the United States, shows 330
logs for 1893, an increase of 26 logs.
The imports of pitch pine for the last three years were as follows :

It has been impossible to get any figures as to the quantity of lumber
imported from the United States into the Clyde, except in the few
instances which I have given, but no doubt the import in 1893 was
