KINDS OF LUMBER USED.
The principal woods used here are pitch pine, white pine, and spruce,
the first being preferred for housebuilding, because ants, which destroy
the spruce in a few years and the white pine in time, do not touch hard
pine. White pine is used for house trimmings. Spruce is used but lit-
tle, if at all. Southern pine and oak, in small quantities, are used for the
repair of ships which touch here in distress. Nearly all these woods
are imported from the United States.
The native woods are generally of small growth, fit for building
boats, wharves, and small vessels. Furniture is also made of native
woods.
