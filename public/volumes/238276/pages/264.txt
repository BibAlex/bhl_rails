AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
TIMBER INDUSTRY OF THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC.
In my former reports I have made frequent reference to the wonder-
ful timber resources of the Argentine Republic. They consist entirely
of hard woods, susceptible of the finest polish, and specially adapted
to cabinet and other fine work. For years they have found a consid-
erable market in Europe, though the expense of developing them as
they are found only in the far interior provinces and in the Chaco
regions of the Parana and Paraguay rivers prevents them from com-
ing into more general use. In the last few years, also, there has been
much inquiry for red quebracho chips and extract, for tanning purposes,
and it is believed that a large business could be done by enterprising
capitalists in meeting this demand. The timber industry, however,
during the past year has shown no increase in activity, though ship-
ments to Europe have been quite steady, while the home consumption
of these magnificent woods by the wood manufacturers now located
here is beginning to assume considerable importance. In the following
table I give the value of annual exports of Argentine hard woods from
1875 to 1895:

The exports of the extract of "quebracho Colorado" for the first nine
months of 1895 the first time its export has appeared in the custom-
house returns amount to the sum of $238,042. The exports of red
quebracho chips or chunks (rollizos) in 1893 amounted to 63,297 tons,
valued at $632,970; in 1894, 74,358 tons, valued at $743,582; for the
first nine months of 1895, 127,330 tons, valued at $1,273,298, thus show-
ing the increasing demand for this timber for tanning purposes. Nearly
all these shipments were destined for Great Britain.
Besides this foreign demand for the red quebracho, the demand
for it at home continues to increase. In addition to the use of it for
cabinetwork, furniture, doors, sills, window frames, etc., the immense
timbers are employed. for sleepers, beams, joists, bridges, and other
like purposes. And now the streets of Buenos Ayres are being paved
with red quebracho parallel-opipedons with most satisfactory results.
Several years ago a movement was made to send the red cedar of tin*
Misiones to the United States, and several cargoes were shipped, but
