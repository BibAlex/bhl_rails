NATIVE WOODS.
The native woods of Scotland cut but little figure, as they do not
come in competition with any of our timber and lumber.' The native
woods are Scotch pine, larch, fir, and beech. They are used only in
limited quantities for cheap articles; the timber is short, small, and
knotty.
KINDS OF LUMBER USED.
In shipbuilding, part of the masts are of pitch pine, which is also used
for flooring of decks, and for ceiling and sheathing. Elm is sometimes
used for ceiling and sheathing. The deck houses are generally built
of white pine and teak and the cabins are lined with various woods?
teak, principally, in my observation. As nearly, if not all, the ships
built on the Clyde are now made of iron, the consumption of lumber
and timber in shipbuilding has materially decreased, compared with
the time of wood shipbuilding. Oak is used extensively in the build-
ing of railway carriages; 80 per cent of the oak imported is used for
this purpose.
White birch is preferred for spool wood by the thread manufacturers.
This comes mostly from Maine, and since I have been in charge of this
consulate every American vessel reporting to me has been loaded with
this wood. The American birch seems to be considered of the best
quality and the most marketable. The birch from Sweden, Norway,
and Nova Scotia is inferior to ours. Large birch spools, or bobbins,
manufactured in Sweden and Norway are used here. These might be
displaced by the same size of manufactured spools from our birch. The
thread-makers generally prefer to buy their spools ready-made and
direct from the manufacturers. Some sycamore, or plane, and ash are
also used in the manufacture of spools.
