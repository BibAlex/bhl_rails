AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS. 19
PRICES.
The prices of lumber in Vera Cruz are: Pine, rough, wholesale, $36,
retail $45 per 1,000; dressed, tongued and grooved, wholesale, $37,
retail, $50 per 1,000. It is generally $5 to $10 per 1,000, higher at
other ports in this district. These prices are in Mexican money. The
Mexican dollar at present is worth only 55 cents American.
CLIMATE.
The climate adjacent to Yera Cruz ismoistand hot, and,forabout seven
months of the year, unhealthy. There is a difference of opinion as to
the climate north and south of this port, but I would say moist and
warm, but more healthy. Forty to 50 miles inland from the coast
the climate is mild and all that could be desired; about 80 miles
inland Mount Orizaba is seen covered with snow at all times of the year.
Thus it will be observed that in this consular district we have, within a
less distance than 100 miles, land level with the sea and the highest
peak in North America, with climate corresponding to the different
altitudes.
GENERAL BUILDING.
House building, on a small scale, consumes considerable of the pine
lumber brought from the United States. The ship building carried on
here consists of the making of sailboats and rowboats only, the largest
not exceeding 60 tons burden. The construction of the Tehuantepec
Eailway is now under way, there being something like 125 miles com-
pleted on the Atlantic side, with, perhaps, an equal number of miles
on the Pacific side.
EXTENSION OF LUMBER TRADE.
I can make no suggestions that would help to extend the lumber trade
tween the United States and this country; for I notice that all the
umber imported comes from the United States, and unless the natives
an be induced to build better houses and more of them, or Americans
come, take land, and settle here, the trade in American or any other
kind of lumber will not improve.
