AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS. 41
fences, corrals, and the ordinary furniture and carpentry work of the
people are entirely constructed from timber of the native fon ,N
While the cost of transportation, except it be along the great rivers
precludes the exportation of the native woods, the same rea.o,, ,,.!
vents the use in the far interior of the soft woods of other oonntriei
Buenos Ayres is, however, advantageously situated in this respect]
since it is enabled not only to receive the valuable cabinet woods of
the Chaco and Misiones by means of chatas and other river craft, but
also, at moderate freights, the pines and spruces of North America
The quantity of hard woods which find a market here in Buenos A \ i , s
is increasing every year, as the industries of the place find additional
use for them. The receipts for 1892, according to the custom-house
returns, were as follows :

INDUSTRIAL ESTABLISHMENTS IN BUENOS AYRES.
These figures are for a year in which there was unusual depression
in the industrial establishments of this city, and I am sure, with the
return of the normal condition of business, the figures would double
the value. But of course it is not merely the native woods which are
worked in this city. The immense shipments of the soft woods from
North America contribute materially to the total quantity used by the
workers in wood in this vicinity. The latest statistics (1887) in regard
to the number of such establishments in Bueuos Ayres are:
