AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.

iron and steel. Few new railways are in construction, and the princi-
pal demand for ties is for repairs to the lines already in operation.
Building lumber, viz, rafters, sheathing for slate and tiled roofs,
doors, and window frames, painted wainscoting, and the underlaying of
parquetry floors, is uniformly of pine and fir. Frame houses, shingled
roofs, weatherboarded walls, board or picket fences, and wooden side-
walks are all practically unknown in German cities and villages, and
as iron joists and girders and fireproof stairways are now exclusively
used in all good buildings the use of lumber or timber of any kind in
building is reduced to a minimum. The trusses and framework of
roofs, rafters, and beams of sizes larger than 6 inches square are gen-
erally made by hewing with broadax, the straight, slender young
pines which grow so profusely in the Government forests.
Oaken split staves are used for wine and beer barrels and kegs and
for the large casks used in breweries and wine cellars. The smaller
staves, up to a length of 4 or 5 feet, are obtained in Germany or
imported from Austria- Hungary and Kussia. But large oak trees are
becoming scarce and costly in most parts of Europe, and the larger
class of oaken staves, those from 5 to 10 feet in length, are now imported
in considerable and steadily increasing quantities from Missouri, Arkan-
sas, and Tennessee. The best American oak staves are exceedingly
tough in fiber, clear and even in grain, and so far as can be ascertained
are uniformly preferred by all German coopers who have used them to
the large staves of European origin. There are but few large oak trees
left in Germany that are available for cutting, and their value may be
inferred from the fact that a single tree which was cut some months
ago in the Spessart, a forest region near Frankfort, was sold for 1,200
marks ($285).
