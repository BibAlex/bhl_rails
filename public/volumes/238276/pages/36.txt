AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
CLIMATE.
The climate of this district is salubrious, the thermometer ranging
from 60 to 90 Fahrenheit.
GENERAL BUILDING.
House and ship building are not carried on very extensively here.
Mining and other industries consume the principal portion of the lum-
ber imported.
EXTENSION OF LUMBER TRADE.
The lumber trade could be extended considerably if parties interested
would establish a branch house in this city. The business people here
do not take enough interest in the lumber trade, and during half of the
year the market is without proper assortments.

KINDS OF LUMBER USED.
The only lumber used here is that imported from the United States.
The reason American lumber is used exclusively is that all native
woods close to the coast are very hard, while the sawing is done by
hand, with very poor tools. The pine ranges, which abound in lumber,
are inaccessible on account of the want of easy communicatation.
