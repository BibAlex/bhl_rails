PREFATORY NOTE.
The Forest Service has two main purposes in collecting and compiling this record
of f. o. b. mill prices: First, to have a continuous statistical record of such prices of the
various commercial woods; and, second, to show, in contrast to market prices which
include the important items of freight charges and selling costs just what the manu-
facturers of lumber receive for their product at the mill. The prices given are whole-
sale, based on actual sales f. o. b. mill, for delivery outside of local territory. Only
a few representative grades and the mill run are included. By mill run is meant the
average of all grades of lumber produced. The record is compiled by States, and is
made up from reports received from approximately 3,000 of the largest manufacturers
scattered throughout the country. It is published quarterly.
The Forest Service wishes to acknowledge the courtesy of the manufacturers for
their prompt and efficient cooperation. Their assistance has been of great value in
making the record complete, accurate, and promptly available for distribution.
NOTE. For this issue of the record a departure has been made from the usual form
of compilation. In addition to the average prices for the last quarter of the calendar
year 1911 there are also reproduced the average prices of the three preceding quarters.
This has been done to permit of a comparison for the four periods of the year.
Figures in bold-faced type indicate an average for the last two quarters.
