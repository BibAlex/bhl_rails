220 AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
One of the largest lumber dealers at Shanghai furnishes the following
statement of sales of pine lumber made by the principal lumber firms
for the years 1893-1896:
Square feet.
1893 6,000,000
1894 6,000,000
1895 12,000,000
1896 14,000,000
The customs returns for 1896 are not yet published, but it is estimated
that between 20,000,000 and 30,000,000 square feet of timber were im-
ported during the year just closed and that there were about 11,000,000
square feet on hand. As stated, the greater quantity of the lumber
comes from the United States, and the quantity imported amounted in
1896 to 14,000,000 square feet and in 1895 to 9,149,789 square feet. In
this connection, these important facts may be noticed : The mills for
whose construction the greater quantity of the lumber was imported
are now completed, no extensive building operations are planned for
1897, and the figures given above show the market fairly supplied for
ordinary demands. Dealers express the opinion that on this account
the imports for 1897 will be small, but nevertheless the lumber market
of China will rule favorable for American lumber, and with the more
extensive introduction of western machinery and the consequent need
for proper buildings the demand will steadily increase. The opening
of China by railroads and the spread of western civilization will make
more substantial and comfortable houses a desideratum, and the con-
struction of such will require the use of foreign timber. Houses of
foreign style have already become so popular with the natives at Shang-
hai that Europeans who are called here in the discharge of their duties
find it difficult to secure houses for their families, and rents have, since
1894, advanced about 20 per cent. Much building is now being done
to meet this need, and if the demand for the current year should not
be so large as formerly, I should advise a careful study of the lumber
market.

AMERICAN LUMBER IN DENMARK.
The conditions in Denmark seem so favorable to American lumber-
men that I deem it best to say a few words on the subject. In the first
place, the local supply is wholly inadequate to the demand, and Den-
mark depends on outside sources for her timber. In fact, it is the effort
both of the Government and landed proprietors to cultivate and not
cut down the forests.
