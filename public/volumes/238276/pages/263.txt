under survey. All the railroad companies have their own car shops
and build their own cars. Iron sleepers are largely used in place of
wood. Locomotives are imported from England.
There is no shipbuilding of any consequence; only small steam and
sailing craft of not over 200 tons burden are built.
Buildings (with but few exceptions) are of stone, and the majority of
the large public buildings, and many business and private houses, show
fine architectural skill. As a rule, they are large and airy.
CLIMATE.
The climate here is tropical. The seasons are divided as follows:
December to March (121 days) is the cold season; April and May (61
days) are hot and dry ; June to September (122 days) is the rainy season,
and October and November (61 days) are hot and damp. The tempera-
ture ranges from 70 F. to 98 F., rarely above 92 F. Humidity ranges
from 69 per cent in the cold season to 88 per cent in the rainy season.
During June, July, August, and September (the rainy season), which
is called the "monsoon" period, clothing, leather, and ironwork are
damaged or destroyed by the action of the elements, unless the greatest
care is taken.
