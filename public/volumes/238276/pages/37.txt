AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS. 17
IMPORTS, PRICES, AND DUTY.
Bed and white pine are the only kinds of lumber imported, and these
sell well. The price of lumber at present is from $70 to $76 per 1,000
feet, the duty being only $1 per 1,000 feet. The high price is due to
exchange.
More lumber would be consumed, and its price would be less if ship-
building and railroad-building were going on, but the only consump-
tion is for small carpenter work.
CLIMATE.
Nature has done for this district all that could be desired in regard
to climate. It is truly delightful, being one of the most equable that
can be found on the continent, its atmosphere being unsurpassed for
purity.
The dry season, which lasts from November to June, is the coolest
part of the year, the barometer maintaining an average of 78 F.j the
rainy season is somewhat warmer than the dry season, but is so tem-
pered by the clouds and rain that a wonderful uniformity is maintained
throughout the year, the thermometer rarely reaching 92 F., and then
only for a short time.
