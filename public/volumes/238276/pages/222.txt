AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
imported on the west coast principally because of the great industries,
such as the cotton and woolen industries, which require packing cases,
etc. On the east coast the country is mainly agricultural and the
consumption of timber is chiefly for building purposes, for which the
Baltic woods are preferred. The latter are cheaper and said to be
more suitable. The Baltic woods come in longer lengths, and for build-
ing purposes are considered to be more durable than either pine or
spruce. The oak most used is from Sweden and Odessa.
Formerly a quantity of lathwood used to be imported from Quebec
and St. John's into Hull, Liverpool, and Bristol, but of late years little
or none has come. The only reason given for this is that the Eiga
and St. Petersburg lathwood is considered to be better.
According to one authority there is very little hard wood used in
Hull. In yellow-pine deals the trade is likely to decrease in the local
market for the reason that the prices are being considerably advanced
on account of the increased consumption in the United States, hence
there is a demand for pine deals from Sweden. Pitch pine finds an
increasing consumption and is likely to further increase, according to
the authority just alluded to, because it is so cheap.
The Hull Chamber of Commerce gives the total imports of timber
during the last ten years, as follows:

*A load equals 50 cubic feet of square timber; 40 cubic feet of unhewn timber; 600 superficial feet of
wide planking.
The imports of deals and timber have shown a marked and steady
increase except in the year 1893, when, from several unfavorable con-
ditions, the trade received a severe check. No sooner had the Baltic
trade opened than the dockers, timber men, and deal carriers struck work
at the instance of the Dockers' Union. This strike (a report upon
which I transmitted to the Department of State*) lasted some seven
weeks, during which time a large proportion of the seamen refused to
sign on. The dockers' strike was followed by an extensive strike
among the coal miners, which paralyzed once more the whole trade of
the Humber ports. The timber trade suffered in common with all the
other trades of the port with the result that there was, during the year,
a total reduction of 66,000 loads of hewn timber as compared with 1892,
and sawed timber deals, etc., fell very considerably from the same
causes. There is, notwithstanding, every reason to believe that the
import trade will completely recover in 1894.
