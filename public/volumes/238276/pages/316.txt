PREFATORY NOTE
The Forest Service has two main purposes in collecting and compiling this record of f. o. b. mill
rices: first, to have a continuous statistical record of such prices of the various commercial woods; and,
scond, to show, in contrast to market prices which include the important items of freight charges and
lling costs just what the manufacturers of lumber receive for their product at the mill. The prices
ven are wholesale, based on actual sales f. o. b. mill, for delivery outside of local territory. Only a few
jpresentative grades and the mill run are included. By mill run is meant the average of aJl grades of
unber produced. The record is compiled by states, and is made up from reports received from approxi-
Ately three thousand of the largest manufacturers scattered throughout the country. It is pub-
jhed quarterly.
The Forest Service wishes to acknowledge the courtesy of the manufacturers for their prompt and
ficient codperation. Their assistance has been of great value in making the record complete, accurate,
id promptly available for distribution.
Note For this issue ofjihe record a departure has been made from the usual form of compilation^
i addition to the average prices for the last quarter of the calendar year 1910 there are also reproduced
ic average prices of the three preceding quarters. This has been done to permit of a comparison for the
>ur periods of the year.
