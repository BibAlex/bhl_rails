Markets.
AMERICAN LUMBER IN CHINA.
Consul-General Jernigan, of Shanghai, under date of December 9,
1896, says an important article of import at Shanghai is American
lumber. To date, this has principally consisted of pine lumber from
the States of Oregon and Washington, though considerable redwood
from California also finds an appreciative market, as does timber from
British Columbia. The eastern part of China is almost denuded of
trees, causing the native supply of lumber to be very limited. The
regions back of Fuchau furnish considerable, not suitable for building
purposes, in a foreign sense, but affording the means of a large traffic
between the natives. It is from the Fuchau regions that the wood for
making coffins is mostly obtained, the superstition of the Chinese per-
mitting only certain kinds to be used for this purpose. From Hunan
and other parts of western China large quantities of pine are cut and
rafted down the Yangtze River, but as a rule it is of a very inferior
quality. Some wood finds its way from the interior to Canton. Teak
and other varieties of hard wood are imported from the East Indies,
Siam, and Burrnah, and some pine timber comes from Japan. Recently
a lot of railroad ties were brought from Japan to Tien-Tsin. The rapid
)wth of Shanghai, and more especially the building of large cotton
lills and silk filatures here and in other cities, have largely increased
le import of pine timber during the past two years. This will appear
