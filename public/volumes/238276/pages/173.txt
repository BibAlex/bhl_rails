in Europe.

BOHEMIA.
NATIVE WOODS.
Bohemia is well supplied with forests of heavy trees, the Boehmer-
wald region being specially noted for same. The woods in Bohemia
can be divided into three classes : (1) Pine forests; (2) leaved, or hard
forests; (3) mixed forests. The prevailing species of the coniferous
trees are the spruce, fir, the pine, and the larch. Among these the
spruce predominates.
Of the deciduous trees the prevailing species are beech, oak, and
birch, the beech predominating. Among the mixed species are found
poplar, alder, elm, basswood, chestnut, aspen, and maple.
In Bohemia between 1,300 to 1,400 sawmills are operated, which are
driven either by steam or water power, the majority by water power.
Only few of the larger steam mills can be favorably compared with
American mills; the rest are small affairs, many of them having one
circular or one upright saw. The whole annual production of the
Bohemian forest is estimated at 6,250,000 cubic meters, consumed as
follows :

The balance is made up of firewood.
The leading kinds of lumber used are spruce and pine. The prefer-
ence is given to spruce. It is used for all kinds of building purposes,
furniture, etc. The pine is used for railroad ties. The principal lum-

of the country, on the river Moldau, and convenient to all the lumber
