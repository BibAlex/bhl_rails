184 AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
KINDS USED AND IMPORTED.
Northern or white pine and Southern pine are the principal timbers
used. The imports amount to about 200,000 feet yearly at Fayal, and
probably not more than 500,000 feet to all the Azores all from the.
United States.
DUTY AND PRICES.
An import duty of about $11 per 1,000 feet, varying a little with the
dimensions of the lumber, is imposed.
The lumber is retailed at about $42 per 1,000.
CLIMATE.
The climate is temperate and equable and similar to that of the Ber-
mudas, but with cooler summers. The atmosphere is humid. The range
of the thermometer (Fahrenheit) during the summer is generally from
70 to 76 or 78 rarely rising above 80 or falling below 68. During
the winter its range is generally from 60 to 64 or 66, but during the
north winds, which are not prevalent, it frequently falls below this,
but rarely as low as 50, although during the tempestuous weather
of the afternoon of the 10th instant, during a slight fall of hail, the
thermometer fell for a short time to 45, but such an occurrence I am
told is rare.
GENERAL BUILDING.
Building operations are very limited. A few boats for fishing and
for communication with the adjacent island of Pico, are built here, but
rarely any larger boats.
There are no railroads unless the two might be so called that are in
use in the construction of the breakwaters that are being built at
Fayal and at St. Michaels, which are only a little longer than the
length of the breakwater upon which they are used.
The few buildings being constructed are of stone with the smallest
possible amount of wood finishings.
