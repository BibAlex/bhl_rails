These increases were offset by a falling off in exports of wheat,
$12,000,000; fresh beef, $3,000,000, and lard, $1,000,000.
Shipments of farm products to Germany in 1911 were valued at
$207,000,000, an increase of $29,000,000 over the preceding year and
$35,000,000 more than in 1909. The principal commodities showing
increases as compared with 1910 were: Cotton, $25,000,000; lard,
$5,000,000; corn, $1,000,000. An increase of $45,000,000 is shown
in cotton as compared with 1909.
Exports of domestic forest products (Table 5) were consigned to
77 different countries in 1911 and were valued at $103,000,000, as
compared with $85,000,000 for 1910 and $72,000,000 for 1909. The
greatest increase shown in the exports to any one country was hi the
case of Canada, which shows an increase of $5,000,000 compared
with 1910 and $8,000,000 more than in 1909. This increase is mostly
due to increased shipments of lumber to that country. Other im-
portant increases were $3,000,000 for United Kindgom as compared
with 1910 and $5,000,000 compared with 1909. Germany shows an
increase of $2,700,000 as compared with 1910 and $3,000,000 com-
pared with 1909. As shown in this table, the six leading countries
that held the same relative position for each of the three years under
discussion received 67 per cent of forest products exported in 1911,
66 per cent in 1910, and 65 in 1909.
Shipments of farm and forest products from the United States to
its noncontiguous possessions in 1911 were valued at $28,300,000, as
compared with $27,900,000 in 1910 and $25,300,000 in 1909. As a
destination of farm products Porto Rico held first place for each of
the three years under consideration, but as a destination of forest
products Porto Rico rose from third place in 1909 to second place
in 1910, and to first place in 1911. The farm products sent to the
noncontiguous possessions consisted principally of prepared foods,
such as cured meats, grain and grain products, and rice, rice meal, etc.
Exports of foreign farm products in 191 1 were valued at $15,000,000,
as compared with a like amount for 1910 and $10,000,000 in 1909.
Foreign forest products exported in 1911 were worth $8,000,000,
compared with $10,000,000 for 1910 and $5,000,000 for 1909. The
decrease shown hi 1911 as compared with the preceding year is
due to a falling off hi shipments of india rubber of $2,000,000, while
the increase of $3,000,000 as compared with 1909 is due to an increase
in consignments of iiidia rubber of that amount. (Tables 7 to 16.)
