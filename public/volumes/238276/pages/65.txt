It will be seen from this tariff that while the Canada white pine or
spruce unworked pays a duty of only 5 per cent on a valuation of 41
cents per square meter, the hard pine of the United States is required
to pay a duty of 25 per cent on a valuation of 45 cents per square meter,
a discrimination which on its face appears very unjust to the shippers
of lumber from the United States, and which has already created no
little comment down here.
In the case of pine lumber there is allowed 6 per cent for breakage
and rot; for other kinds of lumber in boards, 3 per cent, and for veneer-
ing, 5 per cent for breakage.
For unworked lumber, valued by the square meter, 25 millimeters are
allowed, and for worked lumber 22 millimeters. In the case of veneer-
ing no allowance is made. For lumber which comes as u deck load,"
no allowance is made for its wet or damaged condition.
PRICES.
The prices in this market for imported lumber depend, of course, a
good deal on the supply and demand at any given time. A large num-
ber of arrivals together or in quick succession very perceptibly influ-
ences the figures for which cargoes can be sold. The scale of prices at
present, as given to me by Messrs. C. S. Eoberts & Co., are as follows:
White Pine. Deck load, $30; No. 8, $41 to $42; good shippers, $51
to $52; selects, $68 to $69 gold per 100 square meters dispatched; six
months' credit.
Spruce Pine. $26 to $27 gold per 100 square meters dispatched; six
months' credit.
Hard Pine. $41 gold per 100 square meters dispatched; six months'
credit.
Oregon Pine. $28 to $30 gold per 100 square meters dispatched; six
months' credit.
