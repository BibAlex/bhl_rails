Upon careful inquiry I find that a great portion of the timber for
which South Australia has the credit, in the tables of importations, is
really from Oregon and Washington, and taken to the Broken Hill
mines in New South Wales through South Australia, entered at Ade-
laide or Fort Price.
DUTY.
There is an import duty of 3s. per 100 superficial feet, or about $7.20
per 1,000 on dressed lumber, and $3.60 per 1,000 on rough lumber.
This duty does not apply to ash, hickory, oak, sycamore, or sandal
wood, when undressed. On palings the duty is Is. per 100; laths, 9rf.
per 1,000; shingles, Is. per 1,000; pickets, Is. per 100 feet, superficially
dressed; doors, sashes, and shutters, 2s. each.
PRICES.
At present (March, 1894) times are dull, consumption is very light,
the stocks on hand are large, and prices are low. u Oregon pine,"
which means the Puget Sound, or Oregon, fir. is worth but 8s. per 100,
or say $20 per 1,000 in the local market, by cargo. Freights are now
very low, but 27s. 6d., or $6.87 per 1,000, and with a duty of $3.60 per
1,000, it leaves but $9.53 per 1,000 for the purchase of the lumber, and
the profit, insurance, commission, etc. This is a poor outlook for our
Pacific slope lumber trade in Australia.
Eedwood is worth about 12s. per 100, or about $30 per 1,000, rough,
and the demand is light.
lied wood shingles are worth from 65 to 75 cents per 100, with small
and rather decreasing demand.
The native hard woods are worth from $24 to $36 per 1,000, accord-
ing to kind and quality. This is about the price of imported hard
woods also, though good hickory is higher in small quantities.
It may be well here to remark that the prices above given for " Ore-
gon pine," $20 per 1,000, is low, but it is the price (given me by a custom
house officer and an American shipmaster) received for a cargo just
from Port Blakely, on Puget Sound. I incline to think this price
