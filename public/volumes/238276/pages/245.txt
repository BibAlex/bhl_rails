AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS, 225
This has reference to hickory woods required in the manufacture of wheels, as
hubs, spokes, and fellies. The hubs are imported either in a rough state or finished;
the spokes are imported ready for use, and so are the fellies (finished, bent, and
assorted in sizes to meet requirements).
For the other parts of our carriage manufactures, we also use walnut, acajou, and
white wood, in boards of 10 millimeters (0.3937 inch) thickness.
As to prices, we have to pay the following figures, delivered : Hubs, in the rough,
made of American rock elm (sets of four), 9.40 francs ($1.81). Prime hickory spokes,
1| inches, 40 francs ($7.72) per hundred; H inches, 42.50 francs ($8.20) per hundred;
1-g- inches, 45 francs ($8.69) per hundred; If inches, 47.50 francs ($9.17) per hundred.
Prime hickory fellies, bent, 38 to 50 millimeters (1.5 to 1.97 inches) thick and 90 to
95 centimeters (35.43 to 37.4 inches) high (set of four), 13 to 15 francs ($2.51 to $2.90) ;
38 to 50 millimeters thick and 110 to 140 centimeters (43.31 to 55.12 inches) high (set
of four), 15.65 to 19.40 francs ($3.02 to $3.74). Walnut planks, 3.60 to 4.80 francs (69
to 93 cents) per square meter (10.7642 square feet) ; acajou planks, 6 to 10 francs
($1.16 to $1.93) per square meter; white wood, about 2.25 francs (43 cents) all
delivered free 011 board at Zurich and duty paid.
Mr. Geissberger is ready to import direct from America, if prices and
terms are made satisfactory.
WOOD MATERIALS FOR FLOURING MILLS.
Mr. A. Millot, Zurich, writes that his requirements demand almost
exclusively pine and beech woods, and these he uses in considerable
quantities, other kinds of woods not being used to a large extent. Pine
boards cost here 55 to 60 francs ($10.61 to $11.58) per cubic meter, and
beech boards 75 francs ($14.48) per cubic meter.
LUMBER DEALERS.
Messrs. II. Gintzburger & Co., liomaushoru, write:
We have imported Florida pitch pine in an indirect way; we are, however, ready
to make direct imports if prices are satisfactory. We can handle a shipload at any
one time. The woods mostly required are red and white pine of first quality in
boards of 5 to 6 inches in width by 1 inch thick ; also in larger dimensions. We
are also buyers of other A r arieties of wood.
Mr. Gottfried Baumann, Zurich, writes:
As far as I know, the consumption of American woods here is restricted to walnut,
mahogany, palissander, and pitch pine. The latter has been brought in direct of
late in the shape of lumber. I hardly think that American wood could be imported
with profit for building purposes, because native timber, sawed with angular edges,
is sold at Zurich at about 37 to 40 francs ($7.14 to $7.72) per cubic meter (35.316 cubic
feet). Something might be done in American oak, but only in thick planks of first
quality, at about 75 to 80 francs ($14.48 to $15.44), delivered at Zurich. Large quan-
tities of this article are being imported from Hungary.
Special attention is called to the communication of Messrs. Gebrueder
Masera, at Winterthur, a large lumber firm making direct imports of
American pitch pine, etc. They write as follows :
It is our opinion that American wood exporters could largely increase their sales in
Switzerland, especially if they would oft'er such varieties of wood as can be brought
into competition with the native woods. As long as American exporters seek a mar-
ket for expensive woods only, no satisfactory results are obtainable, even if the
