28 AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
GUATEMALA.
NATIVE WOODS.
The principal woods of this country are red cedar, mahogany, cypress,
and a pine used for framing purposes, somewhat similar to the Oregon
pine, but vastly inferior.
KINDS OF LUMBER USED.
The principal woods imported are California redwood, for finishing
purposes, and Oregon pine, for framing and flooring.
IMPORTS OF LUMBER.
There is no lumber imported from any other country except the
United States, the amount of lumber from there being over 2,500,000
feet per annum.
DUTIES AND PRICES.
There is no import duty on lumber.
The prices of lumber vary from $90 to $120 (Guatemala silver*) per
1,000 feet at the present time, according to the rates of freight, which
fluctuate more or less on account of competition.
CLIMATE.
The climate of Guatemala is as a rule salubrious. It is very warm
upon the coast, but becomes much cooler in proportion to the altitude,
and on the table lands of the city of Guatemala the climate may be
described as being very even.
GENERAL BUILDING.
As regards shipbuilding, there is none. There is some railroad build-
ing going on in the Republic, a line being in course of construction
from Puerto Barrios, on the gulf side, to the city of Guatemala.
EXTENSION OF LUMBER TRADE.
Referring to the methods to be pursued to extend the lumber trade
of the United States with this Republic, I desire to state that the very
high rate of exchange, high freights, exorbitant port charges in the
shape of landing and pier charges, customs duties, etc., are very much
against any increase of this trade.
