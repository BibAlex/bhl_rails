234 AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
because the freight is considerably higher than from Cracow or the
Tatra. Eegnlar direct purchases in Upper Silesia are not possible, for
the reason that there are no large compact stocks of trees, and the
various individual forests only produce a few carloads each, which are
too dear when account is taken of the personal attendance requisite to
purchase. The cubic meter (35.316 cubic feet) of aspen wood, delivered
iree at railway station, costs from 17 to 26 marks ($4.05 to $6.19),
according to quality aspen of 25 to 50 centimeters diameter, 26 marks
($6.19) ; of smaller diameter, 20, 21, and 24 marks ($4.76, $5, and $5.71).
The wood from Poland, Galicia, and Hungary is not essentially dearer
than the wood from Upper Silesia. Where grown it costs 10 to 14
marks ($2.38 to $3.33), and, although the customs duty has to be
added to this, the higher price is compensated for by the superior
quality of the wood. The freight rates are various. Ten thousand
kilograms (22,146 pounds) contain about 12 to 14 cubic meters (424 to
615 cubic feet), the freight for which from Upper Silesia would be about
50 to 60 marks ($11.90 to $14. l .'8), and from Poland and Galicia, about
120 marks ($28.56).
For the factories in Pomerania the principal sources of supply are
Eiga, Kovno, Libau, Windau, and St. Petersburg, where dealers do a
lively trade. The wood is felled in the forests, brought down to the
sea, and shipped when water communication is open. It is sold in the
form of logs from 3 to 7 meters (16.4 to 23 feet) in length, with both
ends cut smooth. The ports through which aspen wood is imported
are Konigsberg, Danzig, Kolberg, Eiigenwalde, Flensburg, Liibeck,
Amsterdam, Antwerp, Stettin, and Bremen. The prices for Eussian
wood vary according as the wood comes rafted or unrafted to the
market. Unrafted wood costs delivered in Bremen, including the
customs duty of 1.20 marks, 25 marks ($5.95) ; rafted wood, 21 marks
($5). Such prices, however, are only good for contracts for the whole
year; in other cases they are about 10 per cent higher. The freight
rates by direct steamer from Eiga are 16 to 18 pfennigs (3.8 to 4.3 cents)
per cubic foot, and from Kovno, via Lappieneu-Konigsberg, by lighter,
about 10 pfennigs (2.4 cents) per cubic foot delivered in Danzig. The
prices are advancing from year to year.
The factories in Anhalt use native wood partly, from the neighboring
forests, and partly Eussian wood, via Stettin. The price is 28 to 30
marks ($6.66 to $7.14).
For Westphalia the wood is shipped in steamers from Eiga to
Amsterdam and thence by rail. The cubic foot delivered in Amster-
dam costs from 71 to 86 pfennigs (17 to 20 cents), according to quality.
In Alsace Lorraine the wood is taken from native forests, but it is
no longer very thick and can not be flaked, but must be planed. The
stocks have been freely felled in the last ten or fifteen years, and no
care has been taken to replace them. In consequence of the enormous
expense the wood of East Prussia is out of the question for the Alsa-
