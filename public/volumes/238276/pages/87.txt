white pine, 205 reis * per foot; Swedish pine, 60 to 70 milreis per dozen
planks, 14 feet by 9 by 3 inches. These prices are subject to 6 per cent

reported dull, with weak demand and the prices low. The stock oi

CLIMATE.
Brazil extends to the north beyond the equator and to the south still
more beyond Capricorn, and its climate is naturally varied. Hot
weather predominates, but is modified according to the different lati-
tudes in which it makes itself felt, and is influenced by the position,
but principally by the elevation, of the land. It is intense under tlie
equator (on the Amazonas), much less severe in the states of the center,
mitigated on the coast by regular breezes, and progressively reduced
to a mild temperature in the most southern states, but specially in Rio
Grande do Sul. There are two seasons in all that part of the country
)m Amazonas southward, inclusive of the state of Sao Paulo, the
dry and the rainy, while in the states of Parana, Santa Catharina,
and Kio Grande do Sul, four seasons are distinguished, but not so
strongly characterized as in the United States. In Miuas-Geraes,
[atto-Grosso, and Goyaz, the climate differs according to the elevation
ind the latitude of the various parts of these immense states.
