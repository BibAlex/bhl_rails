10 AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT.
D. Isaacs & Co., of Cape Town, have kindly supplied me with prices,
etc. They employ about 200 men in the manufacture of furniture, and
import directly from the United States.

ZANZIBAR.
NATIVE WOODS.
The native woods used in building are mangrove and cocoanut.
Besides these, there are the mango and a small fir.
IMPORTS, DUTY, AND PRICES.
Very little lumber is imported, and that little comes from England
and India.
There is no import duty on lumber. The price varies greatly, and
depends on the supply and exchange.
CLIMATE.
The climate is tropical, Zanzibar being 6 south of the equator.
There is a long and a short rainy season, and a hot and cool season.
During the latter, the thermometer averages about 80.
GENERAL BUILDING.
There is no ship or railroad building, except that at Tanga, 75 miles
north of here. A railroad is now being commenced 5 all materials for
its construction come from Germany.
All houses, except native swahili huts, are built of coral rock and
lime. For ceilings and roofs, mangrove poles are laid across and coral
rock and native cement filled in. Doors between rooms are unusual.
Outside doors are mostly made of teak, brought from Bombay. Native
huts are made of a framework of mangrove poles tied together the
spaces between poles being filled in with mud; the roofs are of cocoa-
nut leaves.
There is not a single wooden house in Zanzibar or vicinity. It would
be impossible to live in them on account of the heat.
EXTENSION OF LUMBER TRADE.
The quantity of lumber used is so limited that it would not be
profitable to export from the United States to this place.

Acting Consul.
