PREFATORY NOTE
The Forest Service has two main purposes in collecting and compiling this record of f. o'. b. mill
prices: first, to have a continuous statistical record of such prices of the various commercial woods; and,
second, to show, in contrast to market prices which include the important items of freight charges and i
selling costs just what the manufacturers of lumber receive for their product at the mill. The prices *
given are wholesale, based on actual sales f. o. b. mill, for delivery outside of local territory. Only a few ' i:
representative grades and the mill run are included. By mill run is meant the average of all grades of
lumber produced. The record is compiled by states, and is made up from reports received from approxi-
mately five thousand of the largest manufacturers scattered throughout the country. It is published .'
quarterly.
The Forest Service wishes to acknowledge the courtesy of the manufacturers for their prompt and
efficient cooperation. Their assistance has been of great value in making the record complete, accurate,
and promptly available for distribution.
