White pine has long been the preferred box material, and
still is, where obtainable. The white pine listed in Table 2 is
made up of 96 per cent eastern white pine, 2 per cent Norway
pine, and 1 per cent each of Jack pine and western white pine.
In order of the quantity consumed, white pine is used to the
greatest extent in Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire,
Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin
and New Jersey.
The sources of white pine supplies are the Lake States,
Canada and New England. The largest amounts of Norway pine
are used in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin and New Hampshire,
and the largest amounts of Jack pine in Wisconsin and Michigan.
Norway pine is lumbered principally in the Lake States and New
England and Jack pine in the Lake States only. Western white
pine is used to a small extent by box factories in Washington,
Oregon, Idaho and Montana, and the supply comes from these
States.
The several kinds of southern yellow pine furnish almost as
much box material as does white p : ne. However, the single
species, eastern white pine, furnishes over a billion feet annually,
while no one kind of yellow pine furnishes over a half-billion. It
is not possible to tell accurately just how much of each kind of
yellow pine is used for boxes, but an approximate estimate is
loblolly 46 per cent, shoftleaf 35^ per cent, longleaf S l / 2 per cent,
scrub 6 per cent, and smaller proportions of Cuban, pitch and the
minor yellow pines. Over two-thirds of all the yellow pine manu-
