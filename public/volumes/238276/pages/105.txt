AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS. 85
IMPORTATIONS.
It is very difficult to obtain figures as to the importation of lumber.
So much comes into port in the form of dunnage, ballast, loans, ana
spare pieces none of which are recorded by the customs that n6
accurate estimate can be made. Thus, the Amoy customs reports of
1802 give the imports of hard-wood plank at 4,507, valued at $2,375:
imports under " sundries " of lumber are not specified. In the market
we have camphor wood in trunks and planks from Formosa, poles and
planks from the interior and from Foochow, hard woods from the
Philippines, Borneo, the Straits Settlements, and South China. Upon
the whole the importation of lumber can not be very large.

CLIMATE.
The climate of Amoy is tropical and unhealthy. The city is a nest
of smallpox in winter and of cholera in summer. The weather is
never cold. Snow has fallen once in fifty years. In summer the ther-
mometer is at about 85 F. for five months. In winter it averages
about 60 F. The hygrometric conditions are peculiar. Sometimes
the air is so dry as to be unpleasant, while at others it is saturated with
moisture. In the latter state sugar and salt, if exposed to the atmos-
phere, become liquid, woolens become wet and moldy, leather is
devoured by fungoid growth, and floors, walls, and ceilings are covered
with water.
Wood shrinks considerably in the dry season, and expands rapidly
and powerfully in the wet season. For this rea on doors and windows
either rattle in their casings or are opened with great difficulty.

Although the housebuilder of China, especially Southern China, uses
brick, tile, stone, and cement in every possible manner, even going
