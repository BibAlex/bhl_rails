68 AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
As will be observed by the statistical figures of the imports of Rio
de Janeiro for the three years from January 1, 1890, to December 31,
1892, American lumber is taking the lead over all other foreign lumber;
the only means to increase the lumber trade of the United States with
this country would, therefore, be to equalize, as much as possible, ocean
freight rates with the rates from European ports.

CHILE.
NATIVE WOODS.
The native woods of Chile are rauli, roble, cypress, luma, lingue,
laurel, alamo, and alerce.
The two most important and mostused of these are rauli and roble; the
first, resembling our cedar, is used mostly in the manufacture of furni-
ture and also extensively in interior finish for buildings, it being sus-
ceptible to a high degree of polish, pliable, and easily worked by
machinery.
The roble is the most plentiful of all the woods here, and corresponds
to our oak, being, however, much finer grained, harder, and conse-
quently offers more resistance to machinery. The specific gravity of
this wood precludes the possibility of its being rafted, which necessi-
tates handling by rail; this in a measure will always prevent its com-
peting to any great extent with lumber imported from the United States,
as the forest section is very mountainous and, consequently, it is difti
cult to get the logs to the mills and the lumber from the sawmills. This
wood is better adapted to framework than any other purpose.
The one other wood worthy of mention is the cypress, which is well
adapted to the manufacture of railway ties, and is principally used for
that purpose, the supply, however, is small.
KINDS OF LUMBER MOST USED.
The kinds of lumber most used are Oregon pine and the native rauli
and roble, the Orv^on pine being most generally preferred.
