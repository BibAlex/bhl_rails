AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS. 205
GENERAL BUILDING.
There is only the ordinary building usual in an English city, all of
orick or stoiie. Wood is used only for interiors ; hence much less lumber
is required than in countries where wooden or frame houses are com-
mon. In general building Baltic wood is mostly used and a great deal
of the very cheapest of it in the poorer houses. There is no railroad-
ouildiug going on in this district, and, as this is an interior point, of
sourse no shipbuilding, though there are a few canal boats built here.
EXTENSION OP LUMBER TRADE.
I should say the best way to increase trade with the United States
should be for the mill owners and lumber dealers to send a full line of
samples with the lowest prices to the lumber merchants of this coun-
try. There is an impression here that the American oaks are not of
first-class quality, and very little is known of the long-leaf or yellow
pine of the southern part of the United States, the Norway pitch pine
being in common use and near at hand to the ports on the east coast
of England and Scotland, through which ports it is distributed to all
interior points.

NATIVE WOODS.
The native woods used in this district are very numerous, but very
few come into competition with woods from other countries. The chief
native woods are oak, ash, sycamore, elm, birch, hickory, and fir.
KINDS OF LUMBER USED.
The most extensively used are oak and fir, and they are also the
most valuable woods; the former are used for railway carriages, build-
ing, etc.
IMPORTS OF LUMBER.
The following table, calculated at the end of the import seasons of
1891, 1892, and 1893, shows the quantities and descriptions of lumber
imported at this port during the years named, and the countries from
which imported, but do not include furniture woods:
