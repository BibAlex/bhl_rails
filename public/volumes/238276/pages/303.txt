PREFATORY NOTE

mill prices: first, to have a continuous statistical record of such prices of the various commercial
woods; and, second, to show, in contrast to market prices which include the important items
of freight charges and selling costs just what the manufacturers of lumber receive for their pro-
duct at the mill. The prices given are wholesale, based on actual sales f. o. b. mill, for delivery
outside of local territory. Only a few representative grades and the mill run are included.'^By
mill run is meant the average of all grades of lumber produced. The" record is compiled by states,
and is made up from reports receivedjrom approximately 2,000 of the largest manufacturers scattered
throughout the country. It will be published quarterly.
The Forest Service wishes" to acknowledge the courtesy of the manufacturers for their prompt
and efficient cooperation. Their assistance has been of great value in making the record complete
accurate, and promptly available for distribution.
