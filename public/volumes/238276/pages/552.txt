ers in their own region, but have been able to ship the best grades
of shooks to the meat packing- centers of Chicago and Omaha.
With the opening of the Panama Canal, Pacific Coast shooks are
likely to enter eastern markets.
Woods Used.
In general the requirements for box material are that it shall
be cheap, plentiful, light in weight, and capable of holding nails
without splitting. Other qualities are demanded for particular
k'nds of boxes. Those which are meant to hold certain food stuffs
are made from woods that are odorless, tasteless and stainless.
Further, some .kinds of boxes must be sufficiently light in color
to show stenciling and printing. Some strength is required in all
boxes, but a great degree of strength is demanded only for export
boxes or for boxes in which heavy merchandise is shipped. For
this reason, box makers do not demand one kind of wood greatly
in excess of other k'nds. The species most used differs in different
regions, usually according to the local supply.
The quantity of each kind of wood used annually in the
United States for the manufacture of boxes is shown in Table 2.
This table has been compiled, not by botanical species, but by
groups of closely related species which are often classed together
in the lumber trade.
