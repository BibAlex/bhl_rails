AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
ECUADOR.
NATIVE WOODS.
The following table exhibits a great variety of valuable woods found
in Ecuador, in the province of Guayas alone, and particularly about
Chougan, Balzar, Fama, and Puna.*
The table shows the local names, the color, length of log which may
be cut from a tree, and the number of years each is calculated to endure.
Several of these woods are unique cabinet woods. I have indicated
the general uses for which they may be severally employed, and in
another place some further particulars about some of them.
As far as I can find out, there is no timber here like our pine which
can be used to make the light planks in general use in house building,
etc. Consequently, pine lumber is imported here from Mississippi,
shipped from the port of Biloxi.
