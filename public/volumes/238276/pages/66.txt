CLIMATE.
In so vast an extent of territory, with the varying levels of its sur-
face, there is necessarily considerable variation in the climate. While
the extreme portions of Patagonia reach to the Antarctic regions, with
a corresponding depression of the temperature, in the northern parts
of the Kepublic a perpetual summer reigns, without, however, the
intense heat of the tropics. The climate of the central portion corre-
sponds very nearly to that of southern Europe. The name of the capi-
tal is an eloquent testimony in favor of the climate in this part of the
country. The pure, invigorating atmosphere produced such an impres-
sion on the first colonists or conquerors, under Mendoza, that in addition
to the indispensible saint's name they affixed that of "Good Airs"
(Santa Maria de Buenos Aires), a designation which all the pampa prov-
inces fully deserve. This part of the Argentine Eepublic, however, is
not a perpetual spring, much less a perpetual summer. The seasons
here are quite clearly denned, and if the mercury seldom reaches even
to the freezing point, it is none the less a fact that the bleak winds and
.cold rains of the winter months not only make heavy clothing and
warm fires exceedingly desirable, but not unfrequently kill the fruit
blooms of the peach and other fruit trees.
According to the meteorological reports of Dr. Tome, the distiguished
American scientist in charge of the National Observatory at Cordova,
the following is the mean monthly temperature of Buenos Ay res, the
thermometer used being the centigrade, the readings of which can be
reduced to those of the Fahrenheit by the usual formula, F=f C.+32.
I also add the mean monthly readings of the early barometer in milli-
meters.
