AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS. 145
alone. For this purpose it is exceedingly durable. It is used univer-
sally for frame houses, joists and beams, piles, and decking for bridges,
wharfs, etc. The Huon pine is a very valuable and durable wood, but
it is comparatively scarce and dear; for this cause it does not supplant
the imported timber. The light wood is used mainly for furniture and
interior fittings.
KINDS OF LUMBER USED.
The lumber used, and which is preferred, is principally Swedish,
imported in the form of " deals," and tongued and grooved linings.
American redwood and shelving and Oregon pine are used to a limited
extent, and the Kauri pine of New Zealand more largely.
IMPORTS OF LUMBER.
In 1891 the total imports of timber were 5,335,000 superficial feet, but
with the prevailing depression and consequent suspension of building,
it is expected that the quantity will be materially diminished this year.
As much of the timber comes through the colonies of Victoria and
New South Wales, the original source of supply can not be given with
accuracy. Probably about 850,000 superficial feet came from the United
States, 3,235,000 superficial feet from Sweden, and 1,250,000 superficial
feet from New Zealand, in 1891.
DUTY AND PRICES.
There is no duty on timber 3 inches thick or over; under that pays
60 cents and $1.21 per 100 .superficial feet.
At the present time the values of all kinds of timber are abnormally
low : American red wood, $4.01 ; Oregon, $2.67, duty paid (60 cents) in
both cases; American shelving, $6.08 duty paid ($1.21); all per 100
superficial feet. The native gum flooring boards, tongued and grooved,
are sold at $3.04 per 100 superficial feet.
CLIMATE.
The climate of the island varies, owing to its mountainous character,
but it is temperate and equable throughout, the mean yearly average
range probably not exceeding 68 F.
GENERAL BUILDING.
General building has been fairly active until now. It does not seem
probable that much recovery will take place for some time.
Eailroad building is also suspended and is not likely to be resumed,
except in a small way; in any case, very limited quantities of imported
timber would be used in construction.
