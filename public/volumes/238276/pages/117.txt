CLIMATE.
The highest maximum of temperature at Hiogo for the past seventeen
years was 96 F., but that was exceptional, as the mercury seldom
reaches 94. The lowest maximum temperature during the same
period was 23; this was also exceptional, as the mercury seldom falls
below 26. The average yearly rainfall is 47.41 inches.

NATIVE WOODS.
The principal woods of Java are teak, iron wood, red wood, rasa-
mala, and cocoa.
Teak wood is of the same species as that of India, is of a dark yel-
owish color, with fine grain, and is the common wood used for all
kind of buildings.
Iron wood is very much the same as ebony; hard as iron, from which
it takes its name, and very heavy, sinking in water. It is proof against
all insects.
Bed wood is red in color, and also very hard, with fine grain. It is
not used much in Java for building purposes, as it is not a durable
wood.
Easa-mala is very much like red wood in color, but much more valu-
able, and is used for pilings for buildings where a solid foundation is
required, as it is proof against all insects, such as white ants, etc.,
which destroy most woods.
Cocoa wood is almost black, with yellow stripes. When old it is used
by the natives, but is of little value for building, as it soon decays
when exposed or when in the ground.
There are many other kinds of woods, but little is known about them,
as they are not used.
KINDS OF LUMBER USED.
There are two kinds of lumber used, teak and Singapore planks, the
former being preferred for its durability; the latter are used by theChi-
nesefor building, but they soon decay and are also destroyed by the white
ants.
