NATIVE WOODS.
Kiyaki, the hardest wood of Japan, resembling oak in fiber and capa-
ble of high polish, is used chiefly for fine work and for frames of ships.
It is becoming very scarce, the price within the past few years having
doubled. Hinoki, the finest kind of pine, is used in better class house
building, furniture, for lacquerware, and for building Shinto temples.
Sugi, fine cedar, principally used in house and shipbuilding. Aka
matsu and kuro inatsu, ordinary pines, decay rapidly under exposure
to the atmosphere; used in common work. Kashi no ki, a species of oak,
very scarce and small ; used only for finest work. Kuso no ki, camphor
wood; used for frames of ships, boxes, etc. Taki (bamboo), exists in
considerable quantities, and, as elsewhere, is considered the most use-
ful of woods.
