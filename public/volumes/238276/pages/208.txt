and other fancy articles. Walnut is largely used for drawing and
dining-room furniture of the better class. The lumber of the fir tree is
called deal, and is used largely for flooring, doors, windows, frames,
and in ordinary building no other wood is used for this purpose. Box-
wood is used for engraving upon, and the turner finds it most useful
for mathematical instruments, pegs, screws, tops, chessmen, etc., being
very hard and readily taking polish.
IMPORTS OF LUMBER.
The chief sources of supply are the north of Europe, especially the
countries on the Baltic, Norway, Sweden, Eussia, Germany, and the
British North American Colonies and the United States. Considerable
supplies are also drawn from Belgium, Spain, and the West Indies.
Mulhall gives the value of the timber consumed yearly in Europe as
190,250,000, and in the United States, 77,400,000. The consumption
per head in Europe is 41 cubic feet; in the United States, 58 cubic feet.
Timber and gold are, according to the same authority, almost the only
articles which have not declined in value in the last decade.
The lumber imported into the United Kingdom from 1889 to 1892 is

PRICES.
Lumber and timber is sold by the load, the cubic foot, the square
foot, the foot run, the ton, the pound or the number of pieces, so that it
is difficult to fix a basis, owing to its lack of uniformity.
CLIMATE.
The climate is temperate and is noted for its sudden changes. There
is a good deal of rain and moisture in the atmosphere. The average
temperature in winter is about 40, and in a hot summer as high as
90 and 92, and in an ordinary summer about 75.

There is no shipbuilding in this district, but there are extensive
wagon works such as the Midland Wagon Company, the Birmingham
