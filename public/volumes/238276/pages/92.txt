72 AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
GENERAL BUILDING AND PRICES.
There is neither shipbuilding nor railroad construction in this dis-
trict. To-day rough lumber may be quoted at 18 cents per superficial
foot; dressed lumber at 20 cents, Colombian paper.
The outlook is not favorable to an increased trade in foreign lumber.

NATIVE WOODS.
There are no native woods here for building purposes, the villagers
being the only ones who employ rough native sticks in the erection of
their huts.
KINDS OF LUMBER USED.
The kinds of lumber used are yellow-pine scantlings and timbers
and white pine boards, planed or rough, in almost equal proportions.
A small quantity of California red pine is imported by the Panama
Bailroad Company, and used exclusively in the reconstruction of their
cars.
IMPORTS OF LUMBER.
All the lumber used here is imported from the United States.
DUTT AND PRICES.
There is no import duty on lumber entered at this port.
The prices of lumber vary very much on account of the constant fluc-
tuation of exchange. It is, however, safe to quote the following rates
for the present in Colombian silver per 1,000 feet,* viz :
Yellow pine, $70 to $75 for average sizes; for heavy timbers special
prices in proportion. White pine, $70 to $80.
CLIMATE.
The climate of this district from the middle of December to the mid
die of March is dry with prevailing north winds; the rest of the yeai 1 it
is rainy and damp.
"The Colombian silver peso = 46.5 centa on April 1, 1894.
