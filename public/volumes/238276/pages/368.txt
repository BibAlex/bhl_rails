PREFATORY NOTE.
The Forest Service has two main purposes in collecting and compiling this record
of f. o. b. mill prices: First, to have a continuous statistical record of such prices of the
various commercial woods; and, second, to show, in contrast to market prices which
include the important items of freight charges and selling costs just what the manu-
facturers of lumber receive for their product at the mill. The prices given are whole-
sale, based on actual sales f. o. b. mill, for delivery outside of local territory. Only
a few representative grades and the mill run are included. By "mill run" is meant
the average of all grades of lumber produced. The record is compiled by States, and
is made up from reports received from approximately 3,000 of the largest manufac-
turers scattered throughout the country. It is published quarterly.
The Forest Service wishes to acknowledge the courtesy of the manufacturers for
their prompt and efficient cooperation. Their assistance has been of great value in
making the record complete, accurate, and promptly available for distribution.
