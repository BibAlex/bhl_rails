AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS.
115
the mail steamers, which make four weekly trips between San Francisco,
Honolulu, Samoa, Auckland, and Sydney. It is possible a general
agency for American lumber might be profitably established in this
colony, thereby avoiding the middleman's percentage in Sydney and
Melbourne, which materially increases the cost to the consumer here, a
result which naturally tends to discourage the use and importation of
American timber.
IMPORTS AND DUTY.
There is very little lumber imported from abroad to this colony.
Last year 45,540 superficial feet were imported from the United King-
dom, valued at $1,710. The duty on lumber is 48 cents per 100 super-
ficial feet.
PRICES.
The following price list which I obtained from the Kauri Timber
Company, of Auckland, will show the prevailing prices here. This
company owns the largest sawmill in the colony, and has practically
a monopoly of kauri timber.
Retail prices current.
