built vessels in 1892 was 105 vessels (78 sailing vessels and 27 steamers),
with a tonnage of 25,969 tons.

In 1892, 14 steamers of 9,792 tons, and 110 sailing vessels of 58,352
tons were bought of foreign countries, at an estimated value of $663,568
and $1,120,508, respectively.
The Norwegian railroads, the greater part of which lie within this dis-
trict, had, up to June 30, 1893, a total length of 1,562 kilometers, of
which 950 kilometers were of narrow gauge (1.067 meters) and 592 kilo-
meters of wide gauge (1.435 meters). Their aggregate cost was about
$35,000,000. Eailroad-building is now going on in several districts of
southern Norway, and only a few days ago the Storthing voted about
$13,500,000 for the construction of new lines in different sections of the
country.

THE AZORES.
NATIVE WOODS.
Owing to the very limited quantity of lumber imported or consumed
there is little to report of interest upon this matter within the Azores.
The native woods are scarcely worthy of mention with the exception
of the "Faia," a small tree, from which the name of the island " Fayal "
is said to be derived. It is this tree which furnishes the firewood of
this island. Its grain and its natural color, somewhat resemble the
wood of the butternut. As this tree never grows to be much more
than a large shrub it is seldom used except for firewood. Some pine
is also grown here, but so small in amount and so poor in quality as
to be unworthy of consideration.
