AMERICAN LUMBER IN FOREIGN MARKETS. 167
BAVARIA.
NATIVE WOODS.
The principal native woods of the Kingdom of Bavaria are pine, fir,
oak, red and white beech. Stone pine, white pine, larch, alder, ash,
maple, birch, nut, aspen, elm, and linden are also produced, but in less
quantities.
KINDS OF LUMBER USED.
Pine, fir, oak, and beech are principally used for lumber, the first
two being preferred.
IMPORTS OF LUMBER.
No statistics exist in reference to the importation of lumber into
Bavaria, but of pine and fir only very little is imported.
American pitch pine, walnut, and teak are largely imported into
Bavaria, especially for railroad wagons and furniture, and cedar in
considerable quantities for lead pencils.
Oak staves and oak boards, the latter for parquetry, are mainly
imported into Bavaria from Austria-Hungary, and nutwood from. Italy
and Switzerland.

GENERAL BUILDING.
General building was carried on on a large scale until two years ago.
Since that time it has decreased enormously. Shipbuilding in Bavaria
is of no importance, but much lumber is used for railroad building.
The largest railroad WBgon factory of Bavaria, " Maschinenbau Actien-
gesellschaft Number g," is in this city (Nuremberg), and I am informed
that this company consumes about 5,000 to 6,000 cubic meters of lum-
ber a year, one-half of which is native, the other half foreign, mostly
American, bought through Hamburg, Amsterdam, and Antwerp houses.
