Hole (1) was 25 paces from the boulder, and (12) 100 paces from the other
shore; holes (1) to (9) were 25 paces apart and (9) to (12) 100 paces apart.
It will thus be seen, that the maximum depth of the lake is less than three feet;
and 'by walking along the middle of it for its whole length and being able to see
the bottom through the ice all the way I definitely proved this. In spite of this
there were more open water and recently frozen over lanes in the middle of the
lake and near its north shore 1 on this date than in the two other large lakes men-
tioned below. This is probably because there is a certain amount of circulation
in the large, shallow lake, until the deep part of its outlet, right at the lake,
freezes to the bottom, while the two other lakes have no flowing water in their
outlets in the fall. No trouts were observed in it, but sticklebacks (Pygosteus
pungitius), snails (Aplexa, Lymnaea, Valvata), aquatic insects, etc., were common
in this large, shallow lake.
The east end of the second big lake is also partly shown on the detail map
of Bernard harbour. It lies about 65 feet above sea level, in close proximity
to the large, shallow lake (at only half that elevation) mentioned above and
only separated from it by a gravel ridge about 125 feet high, and in the spring
emptying some of its overflow into it, through the creek mentioned before.
Towards the east there is an old, forked creek bed, which in the spring carries
melting water from the slopes to the sea, passing through the small brackish
pond at the mouth of the large creek already described. This large lake is
l3ounded on its west and north sides by the steep slopes of the gravel ridge
just referred to, and on its south and east sides by lower tundra slopes which
form a sandy beach with or without aquatic vegetation (Carex, Juncus, etc.)
here and there (see Plate III, fig. 1). While the two other large lakes at Bernard
harbour are more or less rounded-oval in outline, this one is bottle-shaped, having
a long, almost cylindrical, eastern part connected with the wide, rounded, western
part by a narrow sound, about 175 paces wide, about midway down the lake.
On September 23, 1915, I took a line of soundings from the ice across this
narrow place with the following result (maximum depth in italics) :
(1) 45 inches water Bottom stones and sand.
(2) 76 inches water Bottom sandy mud.
(3) 80 " " Bottom as (2).
(4) 41 " Bottom as (1).
The ice was 7 to 9 inches thick. Hole (1) was 25 paces from the south shore
hole (4) 45 paces from north shore; soundings 25 paces apart. The next day
I took another line of soundings across the eastern part of the same lake, about
half way between the soundings of the preceding day and the shore at the east
end of the lake. The result follows (maximum depth in italics) :
(1) 63 inches water Bottom brown sandy mud
