Canadian Arctic Expedition, 1918-1918
Hole (1) was 25 paces from south shore; hole (9) the same distance from
north shore; holes (1) to (3) 25 paces apart; holes (3) to (7) were 12 \ paces apart,
and (7) to (9) were 25 paces apart. The distance from this line of soundings to
the east shore of the lake was 475 paces. The ice was 7 to 8 inches thick, bu1
only 3 to 4 inches near the north shore.
Two days later I took a third line of soundings across the wide western part
referred to above, so far as I could judge, at the place where the lake was widesl
hereabout, about halfway between the soundings of September 23, 1915, and
the west end of the lake. I found the following depths (maximum depth in
italics). The ice was 6| to 8J inches thick, at certain places only 4 inches.
(1) 44 inches water Bottom stones and sand.
(2) 58
(3) 68 " " and mud.

Soundings 25 paces apart; hole (1) 25 paces from south shore; hole (23)
20 paces from north shore.
It will be seen from these three lines of soundings, that the 10 feet deep
western part of the lake is separated from the (15 feet) deepest eastern part by
a shoal (until 6J feet deep) at the narrows. Some microscopic entomostraca
(cladocera, copepoda, and ostracoda), etc., were obtained by vertical hauls
with a plankton net in this lake on September 26, 1915. The usual life of
aquatic insects, sticklebacks, etc., was of course also found. No trout were
observed or secured in this lake, though fishnets were set under the ice in the
fall of 1915.
We now come to the third of the big lakes at Bernard harbour. It is situated
at 16 feet elevation about 700 feet south of the bay in which the large creek,
formerly referred to, comes out. Its somewhat oval shape is well shown on
the detail map, and it is about \ mile long with a maximum width of less than
half of that. A view of it is reproduced on p. 6, in Vol. VII, Part H, of these
reports, from which it will be seen, that it lies in an extensive valley-plain
surrounded by swamps or low tundra elevations. Only at the time of maxi-
mum snow melting does it have an outlet to the sea to the north of it; this
outlet is not nearly so well defined as that from the other two large lakes men-
tioned, and has more the character of depressions in the swamp between the middle
of the north shore of the lake and the sea, than of a creek bed. From July on
it is practically dried up.
