rear, the Venetian Sumac, Cercis Siliquastrum, and Cercis
Canadensis, Double White and Ked Flowering Thorns,
American Mountain Ash, etc., etc., but no larger trees.
In the second row there might be planted (alternately)
the Purple Hazel (or Filbert), the Halesia tetraptera,
some Philadelphus, Euonymus, and Rose of Sliaron.
In the third row, still smaller sorts, closing down to the
edging, such as the Purple Barberry, Hypericum Kalmia-
num, Daphne Mezereum, Cotoneasters, Prunus Sinensis,
and Prunus triloba. Herbaceous Plants, like Peonies,
Iris, Phloxes, etc., etc., may be added, too, to great ad-
