CONSTBUCTION OF HOT-BEDS. 53
then operations may be begun with safety. But for what-
ever purpose a hot-bed is used, in all such latitudes as
New York, the bed should never be made before the first
week in March ; great risk is run if it is made much sooner
with but little advantage in earliness. Greater caution is
necessary in airing than with the cold frame, for with
the hot-bed the heat from the manure, together with the
sun's rays, will often run the temperature in an hour so
high as to destroy its whole contents, if airing at the
proper time has been neglected. Many a merchant doing
business in the city has gone home in the evening to his
country residence to find that his hot-bed, that had been
his pride in the morning, had become a scorched brown
mass at night for want of attention to the safety-valve
of " airing." In such cases, when no competent person
is in charge, the safest way is to tilt the sashes a few
inches, even before the necessity arises, rather than run the
risk of the sun coming out strong and destroying the
whole. In a southern exposure, in a sheltered place, there
is rarely danger in admitting air in most days in March
or April from 9 to 4 o'clock. But, of course, judgment
must be used in extreme cases. The greater heat in the
hot-bed necessitates watering freely whenever the surface
of the soil appears dry, which, in dry weather, if the heat
is strong, will usually be every other day.

GREEN-HOUSE STRUCTURES.
I have a peculiar pleasure in beginning to describe our
present modes of constructing green-houses, well knowing
til at hundreds of my readers will turn with interest to
this page, in the hope that they may be enlightened on a
subject on which doubtless many of them have seriously
