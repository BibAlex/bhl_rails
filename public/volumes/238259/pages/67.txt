PRACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
below a joint, as in figure 24, it is worthless, as the tubers
and crown formed without an eye possess no latent or
dormant buds; hence tlie importance of always making
Daldia cuttings by cutting innnediately be'.ow ;m eye, if
the roots are 'wanted for future nse.
In cases where it is desired to make the most of new
plants, we sometimes \
split the cuttings, as
shown in figure 25.
This method, however,
is not generally desir-
able, and we question
if, except in cases of
Calceolarias, and a few
other plants of like
character, it is ever
worthy of ])ractice.
If a plant is perpet-
uated by cuttings with
difiiculty, we usually
find it is freely increas-
ed in some other way ;

plied by seeds. Again, the Bouvardias, x4nemone Jnponi-
ca, Pyrus Japonica, Calycanthus, etc., are slowly increased
by cuttings or shoots, while hy cuttings of the roots they
are propagated with the greatest ease and rapidity.
The roots of such plants are thickly studded with latent,
or, as they are termed, adventitious buds. These are cut
into pieces of half an inch or so in length, as in figure 26,
strewn thickly on the propagating bench, and covered
over with an eighth of an inch of sand, mixed with some
