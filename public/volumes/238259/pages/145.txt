212 PRACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
Tlie Red Spider is rather a more insidious enemy than
the green fly, and far more tenacious of life, and often
does much mischief before its presence has become known.
The experienced gardener, of course, should not only be
able to detect its Dresence, but also to discover the at-
mosphere favorable to its production. A dry and hot at-
mosphere, so dry that few plants can long continue in
health in it, is such an one as this pest delights to revel
in. Such an atmosphere in hot-house or green-house
is thus doubly hurtful to plant life, and therefore should
never be allowed. The remedies are simple; if there is
not time for syi'inging, let water be thrown copiously on
the paths, under and on the benches, place pans filled
with water on the flue or pipes, or use any other means that
may suggest itself, to counteract the aridity of the air,
due to heavy firing in winter, or hot, dry days in spring
or summer. Therefore, as in the case of the green fly, if
proper preventives are used, the red spider need never be
seen in the green-house.
The red spider is an exceedingly minute insect, so
small that it is a mere sj^eck when seen by the naked eye,
but when closely examined, may be seen moving with
great rapidity. Though minute in themselves the presence
of these insects may be quickly detected, by the upper
side of the leaves becoming browned, though, as a general
thing, their ravages are confined to the under side of the
leaf. Parlor plants are often subject to this insect, as it
is not convenient to give the necessary moisture, and
the only remedy in such cases, if tlie collection is not too
numerous, is sponging the leaves.
We often have woeful complaints fit)m our lady friends,
that their plants all get brown and look sickly, and it re-
quires but little thinking to divine what enemy is making
ihe attack.
The aphis, from its size, is quickly seen, and means
may be used at once to destroy it, but this minute red
