228 PRACTICAL FLOEICULTURE.

long enough established to have made the business a suc-
cess, for the best index of ability in any business is suc-
cess. I have said, if it can be aiforded, as for the first
two years, unless a youth prove himself unusually smart,
he will not likely receive more than enough to pay his
board, for he is simply an apprentice under instructions,
who has come with the design of leaving when he has
acquired a knowledge of the trade, and just at the time
that he begins to be of use to his employe^-.
But to those to whom it would be inconvenient to place

particularly if actual practice were followed conjointly

patrons (about one tenth of whom are ladies), located in

is nearly correct — and there is no reason to doubt it — I
