CULTURE OF THE TUBEROSE.
147
Cultivating the Bulbs,— Our mode is very simple.
After the ground has been well manured and spaded, or
plowed, lines are struck out one foot apart; the small
bulbs or " sets " (see fig 37,) are then planted six inches
apart, and at least/b^^r inches below the surface ; this we
consider of great importance, as it tends to solidify the
neck of the bulb, and thereby prevent
the disposition to decay. Our time of
l^lanting here is about the 1st of June,
but as they do not begin to grow for
nearly four weeks after planting, it is
necessary to hoe and rake the ground
once or twice before they come up, to
prevent the growth of weeds, which
would otherwise quickly choke them in
their feeble state. The bulbs are matured
by the end of October ; the tops are then
cut off (but not too close,) and the roots
at once placed in a warm and dry ]3lace.
Producing^ Flowers. — To secure a conv
tinuous bloom of the Tuberose, the first
roots should be started in January, fii-st
removing all side shoots or offsets, in
a temperature not less than 65°, and
if kept regularly not below that tem-
perature, they will flower in May. Those
which are wanted to flower outdoors, and which are of most
interest to general readers, should be started in a green-
house, hot-bed, or warm room, not sooner than the 1st of
May, and planted out in the flower borders three or four
weeks after ; thus treated, they will begin to bloom in Au-
gust, and continue to bloom for two months. In warmer sec-
tions of the country there is no necessity for this forward-
ing treatment, as there the dry bulb planted out in May
will flower freely during the autumn months. For a later
succession of flowers, say for the months of November,
