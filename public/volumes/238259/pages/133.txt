CHAPTER XXVIII.
HANGING BASKETS.
It is only of late years that the taste for hanging bask-
ets has become so universal, possibly induced by the
beautiful specimens of this kind exhibited in such variety
and profusion at the Crystal Palace, of London, a dozen
years ago. The taste has extended to every town and
hamlet throughout the land. The baskets are made either
of wire -work, earthenware, or of rough and gnarled roots
or liinbs, to form " rustic " work. The wire and rustic
baskets are the kinds in most general use.
Only certain kinds of plants are suitable for hanging
baskets ; such as are of low, compact growth, to cover the
surface, and such as are of drooping or trailing habit, to
hano; over the sides. For a basket of one foot in diameter
we name the following as suitable :
Coleus Verschaffeltii, a well-known bronze-foliaged plant.
Centaurea Candida, a plant with white, downy leaves,
of compact growth.
Geranium, Tom Thumb, scarlet, dwarf and compact,
blooming all summer.
Sedum Sieboldii, a plant with light glaucous leaves and
graceful habit, which is not only desirable on account of
its foliage alone, but for its purplish rose colored flowers.
These are suitable for the upper surface of the basket.
Those proper to plant near the edge of the basket are:
Lobelia Erinus Paxtoni, blue, drooping 18 inches.
Tropaeolum, Ball of Fire, dazzling scarlet, 18 inches.
Lysimachia nummularia, bright yellow, 18 inches.
Linaria Cymbalaria, small flowers, graceful foliage.
For a basket of two feet in diameter the under-named
make a fine display. For the center:
Geranium, Mrs. Pollock, foliage, crimson, yellow, and
green ; flowers, bright scarlet.
