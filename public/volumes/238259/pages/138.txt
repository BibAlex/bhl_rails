WINDOW-GAKDENING IN LONDON COTTAGE GARDENS.
One of the most refreshing sights to an American ar-
riving in London during the summer months is the won-
derful diversity and beauty of the flowers cultivated in
the Avindows and balconies of the houses. In some of the
best streets hardly a house can be seen that is not so
