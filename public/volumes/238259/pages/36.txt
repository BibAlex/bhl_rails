the healthy growtli of plants than the proper application
of temperature and moisture. In cities having paved
streets, we find the sweepings to be a most valual^le in-

fuse hops, nianure, or leaf-mould.
CHAPTER VI.
TEMPERATUKE AND MOISTURE.
Many young gardeners and amateurs flounder befogged,
attributing failure of crops in the garden, or want of
health of plants in the green-house, to bad seeds, uncon-
genial soil or fertilizers, when it is much oftener the case
that the cause is of a totally different nature, and entirely
within their control. A temperature at wliich seeds are
sown and plants grown must be congenial to the nature
of the variety, else success can not follow. In a tempera-
ture at which a Portulaca will vigorously germinate, a
Pansy seed would lie dormant, or at least show a sickly
existence, and vice versa. Nearly half of the Lima beans
sown annually perish by being sown from two to three
weeks too early, by the impatience of our embryo horticul-
turists. On the other Imnd, the colder-blooded Carrot or
Turnip seed all but refuse to germinate in the sultry days
of July. Seeds of Calceolarias, Cinerarias, Chinese Prim-
roses, and Pansies, will germinate more freely and make
better plants by delaying the sowing until the middle of
September than if sown earlier. Many failures are attrib-
utable to want of knowledge of this fact, and, without
question, laid to the charge of the seedsman.
