PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.
It is five years since I wrote the first edition of Prac-
tical Floriculture. The business is a progressive one, and
I find that to keep pace with the advancement in many
pomts another edition is necessary. If the success of this
edition proves equal to that of the first, I shall be abun-
dantly satisfied. It gives me great satisfaction to know
that my first work has been the means not only of helping
thousands of those liaving a taste for floriculture to a bet-
ter understanding of the subject, but that it has also
helped hundreds of men, and some women, to drift into
the pleasant and profitable occupation of Commercial
Florists, and I have been the recipient of scores of letters
from these giving the credit of their success entirely to
" Practical Floriculture."
In this edition is added a short treatise on the Culture
of Foreign Grape-vines under Glass, written by Hugh
Wilson, of Salem, Mass., who is well known in that sec-
tion as a most successful Grape Grower.
