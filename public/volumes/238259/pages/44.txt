THE POTTING OF PLANTS. 45
This washing the soil from the roots, instead of shaking
it off, has the advantage of leaving all the fibres or work-
ing roots intact, while by shaking the soil off the ball, the
most valuable parts of the root are injured. Plants thus
grown are particularly valuable for distant shipment, as a
strong-rooted and vigorous plant is obtained without the
necessity of shipping a heavy weight of soil.
The same practice is resorted to in another way, to
effect a saving of freight in shipments. For many years
we have sent to our patrons in tlie trade thousands of
plants annually, every particle of soil being first washed
from the roots ; the plants, in all cases, arriving in as fine
order as if they had been sent with the ball of soil around
them, and saving at least nine-tenths of the freight.
This practice, however, is not proper, unless the season
is early enough for the plants to have time to become
established in the pots, and it is not prudent to do so later
than March. If the weather is hot, more care is neces'
sary in shading the plants until they have begun to root
in the new soil.
I have never yet seen any writer on floriculture but who,
in his instructions on the potting of plants, reiterates the
cry of his predecessors about the imperative necessity of
draining pots, in the operation of shifting or potting
plants. This draining process is performed in various
ways, according to the school in which the operator has
been trained, or whose book authority he has taken as his
guide ; one simply places a piece of potsherd, or crock,
over the hole in the bottom of the pot ; another goes at it
more elaborately, placing large pieces below, and grading
off with finer ones, to the height of 2 or 3 inches ; another
finds great virtue in charcoal, as a drainage, used in the
same way ; another knows that oyster-shells, for that pur-
pose, cannot be excelled, and practices accordingly.
Now fifteen years' extensive practice in the growing of
plants, without the use of crocks, charcoal, or any other
