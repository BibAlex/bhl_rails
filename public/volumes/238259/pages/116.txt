HYACINTHS IN GLASSES.
Dark-colored glasses are best, the roots being impatient
of light. The bulb should be placed so as to barely touch
the water. The glasses should be put in the dark until
the roots reach the bottom, when they may be exposed to
the light. The water should be changed once a week ;
care also must be taken that they are not exposed to frost,
else the glasses might be broken and the roots to some
extent injured. Single Hyacinths are better adapted for
glasses than double ones.
The varieties of Hyacinth are as numerous as those of
the Gladiolus, and it would be no help to the reader to
specify them by their name ; the colors embrace many
shades of red, blue, yellow, and white, in both the single
and double sorts.
â– TULIPS.
These, like the Hyacinth, have single and double varieties,
but the single sorts are more extensively grown, being much
handsomer than the double varieties. They are divided
into three classes : Bizzares, having a yellow ground
splashed with crimson or purple ; Hose, variegated with
crimson, pink, or scarlet ; and Bi/Momen, marked with
black, lilac, or purple. These classes are again divided in-
to "flamed " and " feathered;" the flamed having a dark
pointed spot, something like the flame of a candle, the
feathered, a dark-colored edge round its petals, becom-
ing lighter near the margin. The double varieties are
Due Van 7 hoi, red and yellow ; Gold and Scarlet Foeony^
Tournesol, scarlet and yellow, Purple Crown, etc.
