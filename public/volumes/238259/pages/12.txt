INTRODUCTION.
The very flattering reception given my recent work on
Vegetables — " Gardening for Profit " — ^has induced me to
again enter the field of horticultural literature and ofier
to the public what knowledge twenty years of varied and
extensive experience has given me in floriculture.
The subjects embraced by floriculture are now so vari-
ous and comprehensive, that the difiiculty presenting itself
throughout has been to compress the work into moderate
limits, without omitting matters which it is requisite those
looking for information should know. But in endeavoring
to do so, it has been necessary to treat many subjects
much more briefly than their importance deserved.
It has been my aim to make this book meet the require-
ments of the amateur and inexperienced florist, nnd in
this I trust I have partially succeeded. To do so, I have
had to give instructions on some subjects more in detail
than will seem necessary to the experienced gardener ; but
he should know that it is not for such as he that a book
like this is written. It is for the amateur who takes
pleasure in the work of, or superintendence of, his own
garden or green-house ; or the unskilled florist in our
country towns, who has no one to consult with or to copy
from. With such I flatter myself that this book will be
welcome, as filling a want that no work before written in
this country has attempted to supply ; for all previous
works have been written for the amateur, or amateur's
gardener; commercial floriculture in all has been entirely
ignored.
