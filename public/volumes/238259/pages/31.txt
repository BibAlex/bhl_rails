28 PRACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
tunity offers along the course of a walk. In figure 6, the
walk divides and passes each side of a bed of choice shrub-
bery, while the o^jposite sides of the walk are planted with
some of the select shrubs already named, or others. By
the judicious use of flowering shrubs, and the low-grow-
ing evergreens, very fine effects may be produced. In
figure 7, is a similar but more elaborate plan, which allows
of the introduction of flowers in masses ; such an arrange-
ment would be very appropriate for a rose-garden. In fig.
8, we have a design for ornamenting the point at which
two walks unite at right angles. The planting may be of
Ivy, Trailing Juniper, and other low-growing Evergreens,
upon a ground-work of well-kept grass, or flowers may be
introduced. In figure 9, we have a bit of ornamental
flower garden at the terminus of a walk. What has been
said of the selection of shrubs, etc., in describing the larger
designs, will be a sufficient guide in carrying out these
Bmaller plans.
CHAPTER IV.
PLANTING OF FLOWER-BEDS.
Much difference prevails in the modes of planting
flower-beds, some holding to the promiscuous intersper-
sion of the different plants, others to the ribbon or carpet
style of planting, now so general in Europe. If the pro-
miscuous system is adopted, care should be taken to dis-
pose the plants in the beds so that the tallest plants will
be at the back of the bed, if the border is against a wall
or background of shrubbery, the others gradating to the
front, according to height. In open beds, on the lawn,
the tallest should be at the centre, the others grading
