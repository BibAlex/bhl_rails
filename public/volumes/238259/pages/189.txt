first ice, and very tender plants outside are soraewliat in-

and will always do better left out undisturbed all winter
where they grew ; though if the situation is very cold or
exposed, a covering up with a few inches of sawdust,
leaves, or manure, will benefit. In planting out the Lily
bulblets in open ground, see Chapter on Propagation of
Lilies. 48°— 61°.
