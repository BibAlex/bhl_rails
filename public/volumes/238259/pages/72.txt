PEOPAGATION OF PLATSTTS BY CUTTIlSIGfJ, ]0l
enough to touch each other ; the sand is then watered un-
til it becomes in the condition of mud, and placed on tlie
shelf of the green-house, or in the window-sill of the sit-
ting-room or jDarlor, fully exposed to the sun, and never
shaded. But one condition is essential to success, â€” until
the cuttings become rooted the sand must be kept con-
tinually saturated^ and kept in the condition of mud j if
once allowed to dry up, exposed to the sun as they are,
the cuttings will quickly wilt, and the whole operation
will be defeated. The rules previously laid down for
the proper condition of the cuttings are the same in this
case, and those for the temperature nearly so ; although, by
the saucer system, a higher temperature can be maintained
without injury, as the cuttings are in reality placed in
water and will not droop at the same temperature as if
the sand was kept in the regular condition of moisture
maintained in the propagating bench. Still the detached
slip, until rooted, will not endure a continuation of exces-
sive heat, so that we advise, as we do in the regular meth-
od of jjropagating, that the attempt should not be made
to root cuttings in this way, in this latitude, in the months
of June, July, or August, unless with plants of a tropical
nature. When the cuttings are rooted, they should be
potted in small pots, and treated carefully by shading and
watering for a few days, as previously directed.
In many of the operations in floriculture as in vegeta-
ble gardening, success or failure depends upon their being
done at the j^roper time, and though it may seem like a
needless repetition, I can not too strongly enforce upon
the novice the importance of observing the dates that the
experience of our best cultivators has shown to be best
under our peculiar climate. Whoever in this matter fol-
lows the directions of an English work upon horticulture
will be sure to fall into difliculties, although its teach-
ings may be exactly suited to the English climate. I
wonld here refer to the evils arising from the too common
