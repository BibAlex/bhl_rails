PROPAGATION OF PLANTS BY CUTTINGS. \U
the nearer the heat of the sand can be kept to 65°, and
that of the rest of the house to 50°, the more perfect the
success will be.
From the time the cuttings are inserted in the sand un-
til they are rooted, they should never be allowed to get
dry ; in fact, our practice is to keep the sand soaked with
water, the cutting bench
being watered copiously
every morning, and often,
when the atmosphere is
dry, again in the evening.
Kept thus saturated, there
is less chance of the cutting
getting wilted, either by
heat from the sun's rays,
or from fire heat ; for be it
remembered that if a cut-
ting once gets wilted, its
juices are expended, and
it becomes in the condition
of a hard cutting, in the
condition in Avhich, when
bent, it will not snap nor
breakjwhich we have shown
to be the proper state at

wilting or flagging of the cutting, every means that will
suggest itself to the propagator is to be used. Our prac-
tice is to shade and give air in the propagating house just
as soon in the forenoon as the action of the sun's rays on the
glass raises the temperature of the house to 65° or 70°.
This practice of giving air in a propagating house is, I
am aware, not in very common use; many contending
that the house should at all times be kept close. We
have tried both methods long enough and extensively
enough to satisfy us beyond all question, that ventilating
