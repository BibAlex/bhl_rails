CULTTYATION OF THE VEKBENA. 143
na houses we fumigate, on an average, two or three times
each week ; we do not wait to see the aphis or green fly,
but apply the antidote solely as a preventive. No omis-
sion is so inexcusable as that of permitting plants to be
injured by this insect.
Althougli I have elsewhere stated (see chapter on In-
sects) that the very minute one which produces th'j
troublesome " black rust " on the Verbena seems invul-
nerable to the fumes of tobacco smoke, yet I have a be-
lief that our unremitting practice of fumigating may be,
after all, the true reason of our exemption from its attack ;
for although this insect may have the faculty of imbedding
itself in the leaf on the approach of danger, its eggs, being
stationary and exposed, may be destroyed by the action
of the smoke ; at all events, we have repeatedly brought
varieties of Verbena severely affected by the rust into our
collection, which in a few weeks appear entirely free
from the disease, showing that our treatment in some way
or other destroyed the enemy.
There is no question that this insect, so fatal to the
health of the Verbena, is most active and destructive in a
high temperature ; hence we find that whenever Verbenas
are kept in a mixed green-house collection, where Fuch-
sias, Pelargoniums, Heliotropes, etc., are grown (usually in
night temperature of 55" or 60Â°), the Verbena becomes af-
fected by black rust ; showing that its minute enemy is at
work sapping its life-current.
Verbenas, whether grown for sale or for private use, if we
would have plants in fine healtli and vigor in May, should
not be propagated sooner than January. To be sure, the
" stock " plants, to produce the cuttings, must be raised
previous, in October or November, but such plants become
exhausted by spring and are infeiior to later propagations.
In our own practice the necessities of our business re-
quire us to put in an uniform number of cuttings every two
weeks from November to April ; the last lot, which we put
