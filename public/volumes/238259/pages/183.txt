258 • PRACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
TRAINING THE VINE.
In this short treatise I will confine myself to the " spur
system," which is that easiest to comprehend by those
beginning the culture of the vine. It is done in this way :
presuming that the vine has reached its " third season,"
and has been cut back to say 10 feet from the foot of the
rafter, the cane is allowed to branch or spur at each
joint or eye, a shoot from the upper part of the cane is
allowed to run to the top of the house, which completes
the length of the cane. The side shoots, or bearing wood,
is cut back or spurred to one eye. The vine is now com-
plete. The upper part will bear its first crop on its next
season's growth ; the bearing wood when next pruned will
be cut back as before to one eye, and so on annually the
side branches or bearing wood to be cut back to one eye,
the bunches of fruit being borne on the spurs annually.
IN FORCING VINERIES
the temperature to start with should be from 50° to
55° at night, with a day temperature of 10° or 15° higher,
increasing 10° when the buds are fairly broken, which will
be in about a month from time of starting; in six or
seven weeks more the fruit will be set and the tempera-
ture may be raised 10° more, and so continued. Next in
importance to temperature is
MOISTURE.
The vine luxuriates in what gardeners call a " tropical
atmosphere," and during the whole period of its growth,
particularly in our arid climate, the grapery should be
copiously syringed twice a day witli water of the tem-
perature of the house, until the first young leaves are
formed. Besides this, evaporating pans placed on the
pipes should at all times be kept full of water. In cold
