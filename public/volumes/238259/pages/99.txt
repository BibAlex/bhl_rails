134 PRACTICAL FLORICULTURE. .
First cost of stock, if it liad to be bought, 5,000 roses at 10 cts.. $500
Interest on $6,000, at 13 per cent 720
Labor of one man for the year 500
80 tons coal, at $6 480
Receipts for the year 3,600
Profit $1,400
The second year, of course, the expense of buying
stock would not come in, as the plants would be in better
order the second and even the third year than the first ;
besides, if young plants are wanted for sale, they might
be propagated in any quantity from the flowering
plants.
We built in spring of 1872 two houses, each 20 feet
widi by 100 in length, for the winter flowering of Roses,
that have answered the purpose so well, and besides the
construction is such that it may be adapted to almost any
kind of a plant house or for a grapery, that we give the
plan here, believing it Avill be found well suited for many
purposes. Figure 45 sbows the elevation of a portion of
one of these houses, and figure 46 the ground plan. As
we use it, the centre bed is prepared exactly as if for a
grapery border, the bottom of the bed is level with
the walk, plastered over with an inch or two of cement
(to keep the roots from going down to the cold sub-
soil), sloping to eacli side so as to give rapid drain-
age through openings that are left in the bottom of the
8-inch wall which forms tlie bed. The height of this
wall is 20 inches, making the bed or border of that depth.
The materials that we formed the border of were 3 parts
decomposed sod, 2 parts scraping from a paved street and
1 part well rotted cow manure. The street scrapings are
not specially necessary, and may be dispensed with when
not procurable, using all sod instead. . The Roses, which
are the usual winter flowering sorts, have done excellently.
