264 PRACTICAL PiORICULTURE.
Cineraria, to produce young shoots to be taken for cut-
tings, a month or so later. 69° — 74°.
19th.— The same. 72°— 75°.
20th. — Budded Roses and potted off in 2-inch pots the
Verbena cuttings that were put in on the 10th and 12th
inst. Result excellent. No fire heat has as yet been used
in propagating. 68° — 70°.
22c?. — Planted those Bouvardias that were potted on the
9th inst., on the benches of the green-house. They are
taken from the pots and planted in 6 inches of soil, at a
distance of from 8 to 12 inches apart, or near enough for
the plants to touch. The distance apart is regulated by
the size of the plants. Began to propagate second and
largest lot of Verbenas, being rather safer at this date
than the previous ones of the 10th and 12th, on account
of a general lower temperature. Gathered Verbenas,
Salvias, and other flower seeds, that are in better state
now than they were two weeks ago. 52° — 52°,
2Sd. — The same as yesterday. 42°— 51°.
24:th. — Put in main crop of Verbena cuttings from open
ground at this date. Fumigated green-houses for the
first time this season ; will continue to do so at least,
twice every week until the green-houses are again empt/jr
of plants, the order being that aphis or green fly muist
never be seen. 43° — 55°.
26th. — Lifted Carnations with balls of earth from the
open ground, and planted them in 5 or 6 inches of soil on
the benches of the green-houses for winter flowering. We
are enabled to lift them in this way from the peculiarity of
our soil, which is stiff and clayey ; on most soils this prac*
tice would not be practicable ; if the soil did not adhere
to the roots it would be necessary to first pot them, as in
the case of Bouvardias. Put in cuttings of Variegated
and Zonale Geraniums for main crop. 58° — 60°.
2Qth. — Continued putting in Verbena and other cut-
