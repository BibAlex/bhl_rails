pest may be sapping the life of a plant for weeks before it
is discovered. Amateur cultivators generally expect to
see something more tangible in a spider, if they have
heard of the red dragon at all, and are often hard to
convince, that this minute insect is the cause of so much
disaster.
I will relate a rather ludicrous incident, to show that
some even of larger experience may become possessed of
that notion.
Some twelve years ago, I had in my employment an
active young Irishman, who, by showing more than ordi-
nary energy, quickly passed through the diiferent grades,
until he was duly installed as foreman ; at that time we
had been firing a Camellia house, and by neglect of keep-
ing a properly moist atmosphere, the red spider had
made sad inroads. John was duly instructed to syringe
the plants, night and morning, to destroy it, which he
did; no doubt 'witli a double object in view, as the sequel
will show. John was on all occasions rather demon-
strative, but one morning he came rushing towards me,
his face radiant with triumph, with his hat off, but
clasped in his hands, in a careful manner, evidently
havino; somethingj of no common value within it. Before
I had time to inquire what was the cause of his excite-
ment, he yelled out "I've got him! bedad ! I've got
him at last !" " What have you got ?" I enquired, expect-
ing to see something in the way of a rat or mouse.
" Arrah, the big divil himself, the blaggard that has been
doin' us all the mischief, the Reed Sphider!" and oj)ening
his hat, a villainous Tarantula-looking fellow ran out,
bigger than a thousand red spiders, which was quickly des-
patched by John's brogan. From that time John learn-
ed to know what the red spider was, but was never anx-
ious to allude to it afterwards.
