DESIGNS FOR ORNAMENTAL GROUNDS. 21
The depth here is not as much regulated by the .juality
of the soil as by the width of the drive or roads. The
more convexity given the bottom, the better for the
absorption of the water by the drain, which ought to be
at least 12 inches deeper than the extremity of the curve,
whilst the top of the curve must remain at least 6 inches
below the top of the road or drive.
Frequent raking, to remove the larger gravel or pebbles,
and more frequent rolling during damp weather, are neces-
sary for new walks.
If good clay is at hand, a thin coat of it may be put
between the coarse and the fine gravel on top.
Gutters made of flagstone, or simply paved, will be
needed only where there is a great descent and a large
accumulation of water above, or sometimes even where
the ground is very light and sandy, although the surface
may slope but very little.
In uneven grounds, drives and walks are to be made in
the same manner, but their finish and beauty will nevei
depend upon themselves, nor upon the way in which they
are laid down. An additional, correct grading of the
grounds, right and left, so as to bring the sod every-
where at equal height over the gravel, and then a careful
grading of the grounds 3, 4, to 6 feet off the mai'gin,
where the soil rises or falls, is indispensable in such cases
to make a finished drive.
The staking out of such uneven walks, and the regular
distribution of their grading, to avoid unsightly ups and
downs, is a matter of taste and practice, ruled by the
shape of the land and the direction of the walks.
DESIGN FOR A FLOWER-GARDEN.
We give in figure 4 (next page) a design for a regular
flower-garden, intended for the ornamenting of the foot
of a terrace, built in front of a large villa.
