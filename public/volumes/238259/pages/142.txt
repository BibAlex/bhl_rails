Artificial rock-works are often formed. The shape and
dimensions of the work being determined on, the clinkers

the ground-work of white. — Scarlet or other high-colored
Yei'benas, Coleus, Gazanias, Scarlet Geraniums, Blue
Lobelias, Lysimachia, or Golden Moneywort, may be
used with excellent effect. By the use of hydraulic cement
instead of lime, the rock-work can be made of a pleasing
drab color. A rockery so formed and planted, without
having any pretensions to being " natural," is always
an interesting and attractive object on a well-kept lawn.

ravages, particularly on plants grown out of doors. Un-
