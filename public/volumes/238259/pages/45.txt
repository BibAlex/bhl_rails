46 PEACTICAL FLOEICULTTTRE.
substitute, has led me to believe that the system is utterly
wrong in theory and perfectly useless in practice.
It is wrong in theory, for I contend that the escape of
moisture or draining from the flower-pots takes place, in
a very slight degree, from the bottom, but almost entirely
from the porous sides of the flower-pot. Every gardener
knows how quickly the soil gets sour in a glazed, a dirty,
or a hard-burned pot, let him drain or crock it as he will,
and that yellow leaves and a sickly growth quickly fol-
low. If the patient is not too far gone, removal from the
glazed pot to one of proper texture will quickly recusci-
tate, even if the draining or crocking is dispensed with.
Whenever we wish to recuscitate an unhealthy plant, we
wash the soil from the roots and pot in a 72eio pot, where
the drainage is perfect from its porous sides. What better
evidence can be given than this universally known fact
that the theory of the operation is wrong? Whether
this sufficiently proves the theory of the operation to be
wrong, may be questioned by some, but that the system
is useless, utterly useless, in our practice, cannot very well
be questioned. It is upwards of fifteen years since I
utterly dispensed with the use of the so-called draining
of pots ; in that time some millio7is of plants have been
grown by us, and few will say, from the apj^earance of
the plants, that they suffered by the deviation from the
orthodox system.
In our annual importations of English novelties, at prices
often double their weight in gold, the pots always come
filled one-third up with the inevitable potsherd. Little
reverence is had for this labor of poor John Bull ; the
smallest boy in our establishment learns to sneer at him
when he sees the drainage dispensed with, and the pam-
pered llO.OOnovelty growing vigorously under our radical
regime.
"Ah ! but " exclaims some dyed-in-the-wool old fogy, " it's
all very well on your Roses and soft-wooded plants ; dis-
