156 PRACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
CHAPTER XXIY.
CAPE BULBS— VARIETIES • AND CULTURE.
GLADIOLUS.
Foremost among all " Cape Bulbs " (so called from be-
ing natives of the Cape of Good Hope), stands the Glad-
iolus. Perhaps no plant that we have in cultivation has
made such an advance under the hands of the hybridizer
within the past dozen years as this. We can well remem-
ber the time when the species and varieties were confined
to (r. cardmalis^ G. communis, G. hlandus, G. rmnosus,
and Natdlenis, {oy psittacinus^) and also the advent of the
then new hybrid Gandavensis, which may be said to be
the forerunner of all the beautiful varieties we now possess.
These varieties are now almost numberless, varying in ev-
ery shade of their beautiful markings, which range through
all degrees of scarlet, crimson, purple, carmine, rose, yel-
low, and violet, down to white. It is useless to indicate
varieties by name, as the annual improvements being made
will possibly cause those which rank as the best of to-day
to appear of inferior merit in two years hence.
Gladioluses are of the easiest culture ; in this district,
planted out the first week in May, they will be in bloom in
July, and by making successive plantings every two weeks
to the middle of July they can be had in perfection until
the first of November. Although they are not at all par-
ticular about soil, yet, if choice can be had, a sandy loam,
peat, or a soil of decomposed leaves is better suited than
a stiff clayey soil. In any soil the flowers will be larger
and richer in color if the bed be well enriched with ma-
nure. All bulbs of the Gladiolus will flower if over three-
quarters of an inch in diameter ; but of course the larger
will be likely to produce larger spikes of flowers.
