DESIGNS FOE ORNAMENT Ali GROUNDS. 17
a play-ground for children, surrounded by seven deciduous
shade trees, which might be, in preference, the Silver-
leaved Maple {Acer dasycarpum,) a healthy, strong-grow-
ing, and clean tree. At 15, for variety of foliage, a Weep-
ing-Willow. 16, a hedge-row of Siberian Arbor- vitje.
17 is a flower-bed, with an outside border made of the
small-leaved, trailing Juniper, or Juniperus procumhens.
This magnificent plant, which, in small beds, forms the
densest glaucous-green carpet, may be easily trained for a
border by planting small young plants at 8 to 10 inches
apart, and then guiding the main leader with small wooden
pins in the direction of the border. It offers something
entirely new in color and shape, and it is to be regretted
that it is so little in use.
A second border, immediately around the flower-bed,
affording a greater contrast in color, would be the small
Tom Thumb Arbor-vitse â€” a very precious novelty, too,
on account of its very dark foliage.
At 18, on the north-west side of the house, there would be
a very favorable location for a group of Rhododendrons
and other so-called North American evergreen shrubs.
At 19, may be placed two single bushes of Calycanthus
florid us, or, still better, two large vases or other pieces
of statuary.
At 21, a circle, to be decorated with a purple Beech, or
a good specimen of the Kilmarnock Willow.
At 22, all along the eastern boundary, a row of Norway
Spruces, Balsam Firs, and American Arbor-vitae, in the
rear, planted at suflicient distance from each other to per-
mit a second row in front of them (alternating), about 4
or 5 feet from the side of the walk.
In this front line ought to be employed Siberian Arbor-
vitae, Irish and Swedish Junipers, Golden Arbor-vitae, Up-
right Yews, Retinispora ericoides, and Podocarpus.
At 22 a^ in the rear of the play-ground, there ought to
be the following shrubs, in three rows ; for instance, in the
