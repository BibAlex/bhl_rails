PRACTICAL FLOEICULTURE.
we find this shed indispensable as a potting and packing
shed. It will be understood that these green-houses have
their ends north and south ; consequently one side is ex-
posed to the east in the morning, the other to the west
in the afternoon, while at noonday the rays of the sun
strike directly upon the apex of the roof There is nothing
arbitrary in having the green-houses end north and south ;
a point to the east or west would not make any material
difference, but, if circumstances will admit, we prefer them
to end direct north and south.
At present prices, built in a plain, substantial manner,
with the outer walls of brick or stone, and heated with
hot water, they will cost about $10 per running foot, or
$3,000 for the three connected ; if put up singly, the cost
would be at least 10 per cent more.
The smoke flues, as shown in figure 13, can be put up
at much less cost â€” perhaps $6 per running foot, in most
places ; but when the heating is done by smoke-flues, the
houses should not be, on an average, longer than 50 feet,
varying, of course, with the locality ; where the ther-
mometer falls 10 or 15 degrees below zero, not more than
40 feet should be risked; while where the thermometer
marks its lowest point at the same figures above zero, the
houses may be extended to 70 feet.
It will be seen by this sketch that two fires only are used
for the three green-houses ; the flues from each, passing
under the benches on the outside houses, are carried along
the end and returned through the middle house.
This equalizes the temperature in all three, for, although
the outside houses get only one run of flues each, these be-
ing nearest to the furnace give out just about the same
amount of heat to the outside houses as the two returning
flues give out in the middle one, as these, being at a greater
distance from the fire, contain much less heat. This style
of ridge and furrow building of green-houses is especially
adapted for florists; hundreds of establishments have
