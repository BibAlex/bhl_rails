did we swallow a sufficient quantity to keep the stomach
at the temperature of ice-water for any length of time,
fatal results would follow.
A point indispensable in our hot and arid climate is,
that all plants in the green-house should stand on close
benches, overlaid with sand or ashes, or some such mate-
rial. This keeps moist and prevents the plants from suf
fering, if any omission occur in watering. We know that
the practice in many places is entirely different from this,
the plants being stood on benches of open slat-work.
No plant can be kept healthy in such a place, unless with
at least double the labor of watering necessary with those
standing on sand. This, like many other of our mistakes,
is copied from the mode pursued in England, where a
colder, moister, and less sunny climate may make it a
necessary practice.
For this reason also, we prefer to use benches, or tables,
instead of the stair-like green-house stage, which is now
almost discarded.
CHAPTER VII.
THE POTTING OF PLANTS.
The first operation of potting is when the rooted cutting
is transferred from the cutting-bed to the pot. Almost
without exception, plants of every variety, at this stage,
should be placed in a 2-inch pot ; occasionally some of the
coarser-growing Geraniums may require the 3-inch size,
from the fact of the roots being too large for the 2-inch ;
but there are few exceptions of this kind. The great
mass of plants, when in the condition of rooted cuttings,
