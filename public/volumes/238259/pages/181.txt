256 PRACTICAL FLORICULTUKE.
them in spring, but not too early â€” say May in this latitude,
or just when their buds are beginning to start if kept, as
they should have been, in a cool place. It is best to shake
the soil from the ball of the young vines that have been
grown in pots, although the disentanglement or spreading
of the roots, to which so much importance is by some at-
tached, is of no consequence. In planting it has ever
been my practice to set the roots outside, drawing the
tops through the apertures formed in the wall, a little
higher than the border inside the house (if there is one).
The distance apart at which the vines should be planted
is 3 feet. Strong galvanized wire should be run horizon-
tally 15 inches apart across the rafters, and 15 inches from
the glass on which to train the vines.
I may here state to such as may object to outside
planting for hot house or forcing graperies, that I have
grown vines so planted for twenty years in succession, and
never failed to have a satisfactory crop.
Firing was begun each year about the first of February.
Of course the border was covered up sufficiently with
leaves or litter to prevent its being frozen. But for
earlier forcing, say that beginning in December or Janu-
ary, it is necessary to heat such a border by the use of hot
manure or leaves, which must be in sufficient depth to fer-
ment ; and it must be covered with boards in winter so as
to throw off rain. The treatment of

is very simple, presuming they have been planted in
May and were cut back to two or three buds inside the
front wall. Select the strongest growth from one of these
buds, tying it to the wires as it grows, and pinching off to
one leaf the laterals or side shoots which it will throw out
above the first joint, until it reaches the top of the house,
after which let it revel at will.
