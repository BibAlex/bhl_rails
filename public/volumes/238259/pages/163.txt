214 PRACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
are borne in great profusion. About the finest of this
section is known as Golden Model.
Geraniums, Ivy-leaved. — Of these there are now many
beautiful varieties. They are all climbing or trailing plants,
some of which, Peltatum elegans, for example, have glossy
green, wax-like leaves, with a black zone ; others, like the
Holly Wreath, have leaves margin'ed with white, as in the
silver margined zonales. The flowers are borne in large
trusses of white, carmine, or lilac. All the class are well
adapted for baskets or for trellis work.
GerajStiums, Scented-leaved. — These embrace plants of
widely different appearance, such as " Apple," " Lemon,"
"Citron," "Rose," "Peppermint," and " JSTutmeg-
scented," with many others. The rose and lemon-scented
arc extensively used for mixing with flowers in making
bouquets, &c.
Hollyhock. — ^For extensive grounds this is an exceed-
ingly showy flower. The flower spike attains a height of
six or eight feet, covered with flowers to the extent of
two feet. The varieties embrace a great range of color — •
white, scarlet, yellow, orange, crimson, rose, maroon, &c. —
many having these colors cuiiously blended. The Holly-
hock seeds freely from double flowers, the colors in almost
every case comifig true from seeds. Seeds are to be sown
when ripe in September, and the plants, if slightly pro-
tected by covering with hay or leaves, will bloom profuse-
ly the next season.
Heliotropes. — These comprise but little range of color,
being mostly shades of lilac and blue, some of the newer'
sorts, however, being nearly white. What they want
in gaudiness of color, they well compensate for in
their delicacy of fragrance. The varieties are numerous,
but many of them are not very distinct. Those forming
the greatest contrast are Boule de Neige (blush white),
and Purpurine, (dark violet.)
