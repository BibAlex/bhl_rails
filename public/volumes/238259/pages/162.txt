all the colors ; but there is little doubt that a short time
will give us double sorts of all the shades we have in the
single. A striped variety of L' Incomparable was pro-
duced in 1867. Figure 52.
Geraniums, Variegated-leaved. — These are divided in.
to five classes, namely, " Golden margined," " Silver mar-
gined," " Golden tricolor," '• Silver tricolor," and
" Bronzed."
Golden Margined. — This class, of which the variety
called " Golden Belt " is the type, has the margin of the
leaf golden yellow to one-third its depth, with occasional-
ly a dark zone, the part of the leaf toward the footstalk
being green. The flowers of this class are usually scarlet
or crimson ; they are good bedders in cool soils.
Silver Margined. — These are generally of strong
growth, equal to the Zonale. One of the finest of this sec-
tion is the Mountain of Snow, a variety liaving half of
the leaf nearly white, with large trusses of bright scarlet
flowers.
Geraniums, Golden Tricolors. — These are grown al-
most exclusively for their leaves, which in their wonderful
beauty are triumphs of horticultural art. The bands of
yellow, crimson, orange, and carmine, on a ground-work of
green, rival, while they somewhat resemble, the tints of the
rainbow. A well-known and beautiful type of this class is
the variety Mrs. Pollock, fig. 53, which with us has grown
vigorously in the open border for the past two seasons.
Geraniums, Silver Tricolors. — These are belted with
white, carmine, and crimson, on a green ground, forming
a beautiful contrast to the preceding. A well-known typo
of this class is " Moonbeam."
Geraniums, Bronze-leaved. — An unique class, having
the ground color of the leaves yellow, with a dark red or
brown zone. The flowers of most of these are scarlet, and
