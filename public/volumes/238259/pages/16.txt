LAYING OUT THE LAWN AND FLOWER GARDEN.
The Lawn* â€” The preparation of the Lawn is usually
preliminary to the laying out of flower-beds in grounds
having pretensions to what is called Landscape Garden-
ing. The preparation for the lawn is too often hastily
and imperfectly made ; it is the foundation of all subse-
quent operations, and if imperfectly done at first, the fault
can never be remedied afterward. The first point is to
get the grounds shaped to the desired grade, taking care
in grading, that when hills are removed, sufficient subsoil
is also removed, to be replaced with top soil; so that
at leiast 6 inclies of good soil will overlay the whole in all
places. Wlien the grading is finished, drains should be
laid wherever necessary, then the whole should be thor-
oughly plowed, a subsoil following in the wake of the
common plow, until it is completely pulverized. A
heavy harrow should then be applied until the surface is
thoroughly fined down ; all stones, roots, etc., should be
removed, so that a smooth surface may be obtained. The
lawn is now ready to be sown; when the seed is sown, a
light harrow should again be applied, and after that a
thorough rolling given, so that the surface is made as
smooth as possible. In the latitude of New York, the
seed may be sown any time during the months of April
and May, and will form a good lawn by August, if the
preparation has been good; if sown in the hot months of
June or July, a sprinkling of oats should be sown at the
same time, so that the shade given by the oats will pro-
tect tlie young grass from the sun. Lawns are also some-
times sown during the early fall months with excellent
results. For small plots, of course, digging, trenching,
and raking must be done instead of plowing, subsoiling,
