224 PRACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
eacli plant, leaving the fibres of the roots uninjured. A
layer of dry moss half an inch thick is then spread on two or
three thicknesses of thick brown paper ; tlie plants are then
laid on the moss, a similar layer of moss is laid over the
the roots, and the paper, moss, and plants, are tightly rolled
up. The dry moss absorbs the water from the dripping
roots, so that thus tightly enclosed, sufiicient moisture is
enveloped in the packages to keep the plants safe for a
week, provided that the package has been firmly wrapped
up. Either additional paper, sufiicient to keep in the
moisture, or oiled silk, should be used for the outer cover-
ing. This process is so simple that any lady may transmit
to another some favorite plant or cutting, a distance of 2,000
miles, if necessary, at little cost. Where moss is not pro-
curable, raw cotton will answer the same purpose ; the
only danger to be avoided is in rolling up the package too
loosely, in which case the dry air will penetrate and will
be likely to shrivel up the plants. No injury will result
to the plants by tight wrapping, provided cotton or moss has
been placed above and below the roots in sufficient quantity.

THE PROFITS OF FLORICULTURE.
It is much easier to estimate the profits of the product
of the soil, be it in fruits or vegetables, than to define
by any certain rule what the profits of our green-house
floriculture are. In fact, we can only approximate to it, be-
cause the conditions in which the operations are carried
on at different places, or the different articles grown, make
anything like a general average for the whole country im*
