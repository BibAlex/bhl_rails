in partial shade in a close, moist atmosphere. Hence it
is useless to attempt the cultivation of such unless they
are inclosed in cases in the dry atmosphere of an ordinary
sitting-room. The florist can easily adapt his green-house
to the proper conditions when required, but the amateur
must secure these by means of a closed case of some

glass shade with a proper base of metal or earthenware
is frequently used, and is very ornamental. Ferneries of
this kind are sold at the principal horticultural and seed
stores.
CHAPTER XXXI.
FORMATION OF ROCK-WORK.
This feature of pleasure ground decoration is generally
necessitated by circumstances; if the ground which has to
be chosen for that purpose is naturally stony, it often be-
comes the cheapest way to get rid of the stones, grouping
them so that they become ornamental. They may often
thus be used to advantage in forming breaks or screens, to
hide the fl.ower garden from the vegetable or fruit garden ;

stices filled with soil and covered with hardy perennial
plants. Locations where rocks exist in their natural con-
dition can often be made highly interesting and ornament-
al by setting out plants of a drooping or trailing habit
(o overhang among them. Among those suitable for such
purpose are :
Acbilleas, of creeping growth, Linnsea borealis,
Campanulas, of creeping growth, Lychnis grandiflora,
Crucianellastylosa, Lyaimachia nummularia,
Ccrastium tomeutosum, Orobus vernus,
