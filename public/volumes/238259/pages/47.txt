48 PRACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
utterly useless practice in this case. Throwiug a liandful
of potsherds into the bottom of a pot will certainly not
injure the growth of a plant, neither would a gold dollar,
but neither would do any good ; the dollar would have
bought something, and so would the labor thrown away
in this useless operation.
An old farmer, in planting a peach orchard, in one of
the inland counties of this State, was informed by some
obliging neighbor that it would greatly improve their
growth if he would place a shovelfull of small stones

shovelfull of stones under a peach tree than it is to throw
a handfuU of potsherds into the bottom of a flower-pot
before potting the plant.
The amateur, in potting his plants, will find it neces-

the pot, not for the purpose of drainage, but to prevent
the soil from shaking out. The hole may be covered
