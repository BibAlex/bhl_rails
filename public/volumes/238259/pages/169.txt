CHAPTER XL.
WHAT FLOWERS WILL GROW IN THE SHADE ?
The question " What flowers will grow in the shade ? "
is put to me every spring by scores of city people, whose
little patch which they wish to devote to flowers is so
walled up by neighboring houses, that the direct rays of
the sun never touch it. But few plants will develop their
flowers there, and none will do it so well as if it were
lighted up by sunsliine a part of the day. Fuchsias, Pan-
sies. Forget-me-nots, Violets, Lobelias, Lily of the Valley,
Phloxes, and other herbaceous plants whose native habitat
is a shady wood, will do best, but even these languish if
denied all direct sunlight. The best eflect in such situa-
tions is produced by ornamental-leaved plants, the beauty
of which is not dependent upon their flowers. Among
these may be ranked the Gold and Silver Variegated-
leaved Geraniums, Achyranthes, Alternantheras, Begonias,
Caladiums, Centaureas, Coleuses, etc., which, if planted
so as to bring the various shades in contrast, produce a
pleasing effect, which continues during the entire summer
months, and is not surpassed by any display of flowers.
The cultivator of flowers in rooms should understand
the necessity of sunlight to jolants that are to flower, and
endeavor to get these as close as possible to a window
having an eastern or southern aspect. The higher the
temperature the more plants sufier for want of light.
Many plants might remain in a temperature of 40°, in a
cellar for example, away from direct light, for months
without material injury, while if the cellar contained a
furnace keeping a temperature of 70°, they would all die;
