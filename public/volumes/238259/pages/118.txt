CAPE BULBS VARIETIES AND CtTLTURE. 157
They should be taken up ns soon Jis the stems begin to
wither in fall ; but should the stalk of the late plantings
be yet green, the bulbs should be left adhering to the
Btalk until dried, which will tend to ripen off the bulbs.
They may be kept in winter under the stage of the green-
house in a frost-proof cellar or closet, or, in short, in any
place where potatoes can be kept with safety.
AMARYLLIS.
"Next to Gladiolus under this head may be named the
Amaryllis. The bulbs may be planted in July, August,
or September, (if in pots not less than eiglit inches in di-
ameter), in rich, light soil. The flower spike will be de-
veloped in October or ISTovember. They are best grown in
pots in this latitude, as they are liable to be injured by
fall frosts if left to flower in the open border. The plants
should be kept growing for some mouths after flowering,
so as to develop the bulb for future flowering ; but they
should be dried off for some months previous to the time of
planting. The species are :
A. Belladonna. (Belladonna Lily), pale pink.
A. aulica. — -Flowers large, green and scarlet.
A. blanda. — Flowers immensely large ; whitish.
A. purpurea* — (Yallota), dwarf, bright scarlet.
A. Tlttata. — Striped, rose and white.
A. formosissima* — (Jacobean Lily), rich crimson.

treatment similar to the Amaryllis, and well worthy of
general cultivation :
