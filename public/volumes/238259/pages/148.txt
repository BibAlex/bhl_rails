INSECTS. 215
found on thousands of other varieties of the vegetable
kingdom, whenever a lessened vitality takes place. Cor-
roborative of this view, I had a lot of about 500 plants
of Heliotrope growing in 2-inch pots in one of our green-
houses last fall, one-half of which were, in September,
shifted into 3-inch pots, to be reserved for stock plants.
They were kept side by side and treated in all respects the
same. Those shifted, of course, with increased food,
grew vigorously and strong, while the unshifted remained
comparatively stunted, and to-day, December 1st, the
"black rust" shows itself on nearly every plant, and the
microscope shows on every affected leaf hundreds of
these insects, feeding like sheep on a pasture field, while
on the shifted plants none whatever can be found. This
is only one of hundreds of cases which yearly come un-
der our observation, to prove that, from whatever cause the
vital action of a plant is impaired, it is placed in the con-
dition which in a greater or less degree invites the attack
of parasitic fungi (mildew) or insects.
Mealy Bu^, as it is familiarly termed, is a white, mealy,
or downy-looking insect, often very troublesome in the
hot-house ; it is quickly destroyed by a solution of 1 lb.
of whale oil soap to five gallons of water ; but, as it often
attacks plants of the most tender kinds, that are liable to
be injured even by this weak mixture, it is not safe for
inexperienced hands to use it before experimenting on its
strength, and perhaps the safest method is simply to
brush off the insects with a soft brush, made for the
purpose.
Brown and White Scale Insects. â€” These are less in-
jurious and less common to plants than any of the pre-
ceding, and are generally found in dark or ill-ventilated
green-houses, adhering to the stems and under part of the
leaves of hard-wooded plants. The best remedy is wash-
ing, or brushing them off by hand ; fumigating, and the
