then filled with sawdust, rounding above, damped and cov-
ered with wet moss ; a border of arbor-vitaa, bouquet, or
other greens is set around, to support the overhanging flow-
ers. The flowers, stemmed on pieces of match stick, (fig.
45,) or twigs, are now inserted according to the taste of the
worker, with moss packed between them as the work-
proceeds. Baskets thus filled and sprinkled with water
keep well, but the more common method is to insert bou-
quet green (Lycopodium) over the
whole surface, and arrange the
flowers therein without any moss
packing. Wreaths are commonly
made on a stout wire, which has
a straw of matting wound to it, to
enable the thread to hold ; a back-
ing of green is laid for the flowers
as the work proceeds. Both green
and flowers must be wound on with
points projecting to each side, the
stems crossing like the letter X.
If laid straight along, the flowers
are huddled together, and the ar-
rangement seems thick backed
and clumsy. When the desired
length is attained the ends are
firmly tied, and flowers and green together are pressed
round on the wire, and by this means turned to face as
required; a bow of white silk bonnet string finishes the
wreath. Crosses are made on two pieces of thin wood ;
the three upper points being made, the cross-stick is then
tacked and tied in its place, the centre filled, and so
■wx>»nd to the bottom. Like wreaths, these may be finish-
ed wifh or without a bow of ribbon. Wire frames have
to a great extent superseded these old methods of
winding flowers to sticks and wires. These are made
from half to three quarters of an inch in depth — that is,
Tig. 57.
