TEMPERATURE AN^D MOISTURE. 37
enced what these varieties and conditions are; but my
object is to impress upon young or inexperienced readers
what I have long believed to be an important truth â€” that
the supplying the proper conditions of temperature to
plants under glass, according to their different natures
and conditions, has as much, or more, to do with their
welfare than any other cause ; and that often when ascrib-
ing the unhealthy state of a plant to uncongenial soil or
defective drainage, or the "damping off" of some favorite
cutting to the way it was cut or the sand it was put in,
the true and sole cause of failure was nothing more than
condemning them to an atmosphere uncongenial to their
nature.
Thus far, we mainly allude to temperature. Serious
injury is often done to plants from a want of, or excess of,
moisture. The old gardener with whom my first essay in
gardening was made used to define the difference in dryness
in plants as " dry " and " killing dry ;" " dry " was the
proper condition that the plant should be in, when water
was applied, the surface indicating dryness by becoming
lighter, but no flagging or wilting ; but woe betide the
unfortunate that allowed a plant in charge to become in the
condition of " killing dry ;" this in his eye was an unpar-
donable offence. " Killing dry" was, to some extent, really
killing in such a collection as we grew, which consisted
largely of Cape Heaths, Epacris, and other hard-wooded
plants, which are easily killed outright by allowing their
tender, thread-like rootlets to become dry; unlike soft-
wooded plants, such as Geraniums, or Fuchsias, they have
less recuperative powers, so that a " dry" that would kill
a Heath would have only the effect to stagnate the growth
of a Geranium, and bring the tell-tale yellow leaves that
are certain to folloAV whenever such plants have suffered for
a lack or excess of moisture. Althous^h the effect of drv-
ing is, for the time being perhaps, less marked in a hard-
wooded plant than in a soft-wooded one, yet the ultimate
