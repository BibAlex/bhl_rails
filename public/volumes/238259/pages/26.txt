DESIGNS FOR ORNAMENTAL GROUNDS. 23
This design has been expressly made with the view of
keeping in order cheaply.
The lawn, or what is to be kept in sod, is as much as
possible in regular straight lines, easily mowed with some
of the patent lawn-mowers.
The walks are wide, as, starting from the bottom of
the terrace, they will be overlooked the whole length
from the top, and would appear scanty if not of liberal
dimensions.
The place is intended to be kept as private as possible, —
a sort of open-air saloon, — by a belt of selected shrubbery,
and shade trees in its rear.
At 1, there are seats indicated in several recesses cut
into the shrubs, the seats to be of heavy timber, as stone
would be rather too cool, and iron or rustic work not
looking architectural enough.
At 2, there are pedestals for pieces of statuary, or vases
or large specimen plants in painted boxes.
At 3, 4, and 6, groups of Roses, bedding-out plants of
broad, showy foliage, or flowering shrubs, such as Hydran-
geas, which continue long in bloom.
At 5, the centre piece, there is a large flower-bed for
Scarlet Geraniums, Feverfew, etc., surrounded by a border
of Irish Ivy, kept in line, so as not to exceed 12 to 18
inches in width.
Such borders of Ivy, if employed in the right place,
and well kept in order, are a magnificent ornament to a
garden, and, according to their location, may be kept 3 and
4 feet wide. A very little covering in winter will keep
the foliage, of the right sort, in very good order.
In the large squares, plainly sodded, that are in the
gardens of the Louvre and the Tuileries, at Paris, there
is no other ornament but such borders of broad-leaved
Ivy, established at 3 to 4 feet from the walks, and left
running about 2 to 3 feet wide ; and they make, with the
dark green or the lighter turf, a most striking show.
