PACKING PLANTS.
As commercial floriculture is now becomins: a mattei
of importance, it will be interesting to many of oui
readers to know the modes of packing for shipment.
Durmg February, March, April, and May last, (1873)
it is estimated that ten tons daily were received at the
different express offices in New York, of the products of
the green-house only. These were to be distributed through-
out the length and breadth of the land, shipments being
successfully made to the most extreme points in every di-
rection. The system o^ packing adopted for even the
most distant orders is of the simplest kind, differing en-
tirely from that in use by the English or French, and is a
result, like many other of our operations, of the necessi-
ties forced upon us by the want of labor. By our system
of packing, we ship plants almost every day from January
15th to June 15th, throughout the coldest weather in winter
and the sultry days of summer, with hardly a case of injury,
either from freezing or by heat. For the cold season we
use close boxes, placing a layer of 4 inches of soft, dry hay
on the bottom ends, sides, and top of the box. Whenever
the ball of roots is sufficiently firm, the plant is taken
from the pot, and each plant wrapped in paper, or rather
the ball or root of the plant is wrapped, leaving most of
the top uncovered. This wrapping in paper not only
serves to keep the ball from breaking, but it also, to some
extent, prevents the pressure of the plants upon each other.
In packing the plants in the box, they are placed com-
})actly in layers, alternated with an inch or two of soft hay
until the box is full. The utmost care is necessary to
pack the box entirely full, so that no movement can
take place ir the plants should the boxes be roughly hand-
led. The soil should be always rather dry than other-
wise, as packed in this close manner the plants will not suffer
