WARDIAN CASES AND FERNERIES. 205
in many places liberal prizes are given by the horticul-
tural societies to those that are best cultivated.
Prizes are also offered for the best window-grown plants,
and in Hull and some other towns, plants are distributed
and printed instructions given for culture to encourage
the taste.

WARDIAN CASES, FERNERIES, &c.
The Wardian Case is usually made with black walnut
base lined with zinc, in depth about 6 inches, and about 2
feet square on the sides ; but it is made of various sizes.
The covering is a glass case, made usually 18 inches
high ; the top or lid, also of glass, is made movable, so
that ventilation is provided, and undue moisture allowed to
escape. The plants grown in Wardian Cases are such
as are peculiar for beauty of foliage rather than flower —
plants whose natural habitat is shady woods; such as
Ferns, Lycopodiums, Caladiums, Marantas, &c., &c. The
soil used in such a case may be light peat or leaf-
mould ; nothing of a stiff or heavy nature of a soil should
be used. The case may be kept in any ordinary sitting-
room, near the Avindow, but not exposed to the direct
sunlight. There is no trouble whatever in management ;
one moderate watering when the case is filled will keep it
without further attention for six weeks, except an oc-
casional ventilation when moisture lies heavy on the glass.
In winter the temperature of the room may run from 50°
to 65° at night. The culture of Ferns or Lycopods re-
quires somewhat similar conditions as are found in the
Wardian Case ; they can not be successfully grown unless
