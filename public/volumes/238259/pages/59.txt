front wall 9 feet apart. Tlie proper position of these
sliding shutters is of importance. It has long been a
common practice to ventilate by front sashes, both in
graperies and plant houses which opened directly on the
plants. The consequence is, that in cold days, while the
sun is shining, the house gets heated up, but the lower
sashes cannot be opened, for the outside air is often so
cold that it would be likely to chill or freeze the plants.
But by placing the sliding ventilators on the front or
south wall, at such a height that they will be below the
front bench, but above the flue or pipes, the air thus ad-
mitted to cool down the house is modified in its passage
across the pipes or flue, so that the temperature of the
house is lowered without chilling the plants.
The sliding ventilators run upon rollers, and by at-
taching a continuous rod to each, 25 or 30 of them can be
moved from one end by a slight
pull, thus obviating the necessity
of getting under the benches to
open each one separately. The

bricks placed flat, with an air space of 2 inches, " tied in "
by headers of cast-iron, like that shown in figure 18, placed
at intervals of 2 feet apart, both in the height and in the
length of the wall. A 10-inch hollow wall built in this
way costs about the same as a 12-inch solid wall, but is
greatly better in all respects. The air space, of course,
acting as a non-conductor, keeps the house much warmer
than a solid wall would ; and besides, a wall like this is
much more durable for such a purpose. The experience
of most of us who have built solid 8-inch brick walls for
green-houses is, that on the north or west side they stand
