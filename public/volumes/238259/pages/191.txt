268 PRACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
pruning should always be done before the j)lant is potted,
as it takes less than half the time, and the plant being di-
vested of its superfluous shoots is much more quickly and
easily handled in potting. The plants after jDotting are
freely watered once^ to consolidate the soil, and if the sun'
is bright and warm they are shaded by latticed shutters.
The plants are placed in a cold green-house or cold frame,
care being taken to keep them as cool as possible, and on
no consideration to use fire heat unless to keep the soil in
the pots from freezing. If possible, Roses should never be
kept at a higher temperature than 40° by fire heat, until
the young or " working roots " are formed. See Chapter
on the Rose for more comprehensive details. 41° — 53°.
2d. — Continued potting Roses, and put in Antirrhinum,
Pentstemon, and other cuttings of half hardy plants from
the open ground. 45° — 53°.
4:th. — Cut down and placed under the benches the
Dahlias that have been grown during summer in pots.
47°_48°.
^th. — The Bouvardias, Carnations, Stevias, etc., are now
blooming profusely. 33° — 40°.
Qfh. — The cold weather warns us that everything must
soon be secured, so to-day we take up, divide, and pot
for spring sales, herbaceous plants of all kinds. 31° — 40°.
1th. — Last night's frost finally destroyed the Dahlias,
so we lifted them up and secured them to-day, by drying
on the empty benches of the green-house. Those to be
started for cuttings in March are now placed at once in
soil and kept there without water until they start ; in this
way every root can be saved. 30° — 42°.
dith. — Planted in the open ground the Strawberry run-
ners that were layered in pots, and covered them close
up to the neck of the plants with rough manure. Put in
Carnation, Begonia, Petunia, Verbena, and other cuttings,
for the first time, from plants that have been growing m
the green- house. 41 ° — 52°.
