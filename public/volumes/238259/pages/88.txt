CULTURE OP THE ROSE.

until they begin to root in spring. Cuttings planted m
this manner in October or November, and kept merely
from freezing during winter, will be rooted in March, pre-
senting the appearance shown in figure 29.
The success much depends on the varieties and fit con-
dition of the cuttino;s, ^^
for we find that in a icl^
collection of 50 sorts, MiiMxt^^^
every cutting of some
varieties will root, while
in others we fail to get
more than 5 per cent.
But if properly treated
it may be safe to ex-
pect 50 j3er cent of
rooted cuttings as an
average. As soon as, or
even before, they show
the extent of root in-
dicated in the engrav-
ing, they should be pot-
ted in two-inch pots,
shaded and watered for
a few days and gradu-
ally hardened ofi*by ex- Fig. 39.â€” cutting of old wood.
posing tliem to the air, when they will be sufficiently
rooted to plant in the open ground in April or May. Some
propagators plant them at once from the cutting bed to
the open ground, but this is attended with risk, for unless
the weather is continuously favorable for two or three
days one-half of them may be lost. We have always
found that placing them in pots and keeping them under
the protection of sashes for a few vv^eeks well repaid the
extra labor. Nearly all deciduous shrubs may be propa-
gated in this manner, most of them even more successfully
than the Rose.
