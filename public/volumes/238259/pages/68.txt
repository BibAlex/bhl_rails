PROPAGATION OF PLANTS BY CUTTINGS.

light material, such as finely sifted rotten refuse hops or
leaf mould. These are treated exactly in the way of cut-
tings of tlie slioots, except that there is no necessity ever
to shade root cuttings ; water should be sparingly given
until they have freely started through their covering.
One of the most important plants to propagate by root
cuttings is the Bouvar-
dia, and it requires to
be placed in a high
temperature. It is bet-
ter not to put the roots
in to start before the
season is sufficiently
advanced to keep the
temperatui'e steadily
high, say about the
loth of March, or 1st of
April. The Bouvardia
is also increased by
cuttmgs of the young
shoots, but it requires
more care, the plants
so made are not so fine,
and the ease and cer-
tainty with which they Fig. 28.-dahlia cutting.
make good plants by cutting up the roots render any
other mode useless.
I have said that if the simple conditions that we lay
down for our guidance in the propagation of plants are
strictly followed, failure is an impossibility. These con-
ditions, together with the state of the cutting, are tempera-
ture and moisture. It is very easy to give a rule for these,
yet it requires unremitting attention to keep to that rule
through all the deviations of the seasons, and it is hardly
possible to follow it, whenever the outside temperature
exceeds the limit given. Hence we find that the propa-
