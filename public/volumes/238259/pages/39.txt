effect is mucli more fatal. To the unpractised eye, a Heath
that has been injured by drouth may appear all right,
Avhile it is gone beyond recovery. The old gardener
before alluded to used to make his dead Heaths do excel-
lent service in assisting him in some severe jokes played
on his less experienced brethren. Specimen plants of
Heaths were scarce, and in some sorts, very valuable, and
if he succeeded in making a present of one of these dead
plants to one of his less posted friends, it used to keep
him m good humor for a week.
No i)lant should ever be allowed to flag or wilt for
want of moisture, neither should it be watered until the
necessity for water is shown by the whitening of the
surface of the soil,
particularly if in
dull weather, or if
the green-house is
kept at a low tem-
perature. As a
rule, with green-
house plants kept
in a night temperature of 45°, Avith a day temperature of
6^^, watering twice a week from December to March will
generally be sufficient ; on the approach of clear weather,
with higher temperature in April and May, they will re-
quire daily attention.
Our practice is to water during Avinter with the common
rose watering-pots, of the pattern shown in fig. 10, giving
the plants water sparinglj^, or otherwise, as required.
But as spring opens, we go at the operation more expe-
ditiously, using a West's Force Pump (fig. 11), and 2-ineh
rubber hose. To the end of the hose is attached a heavy
sprinkler, similar to that show' n in the common watering-pot
(fig. 10). In all districts where there is no hydrant-water,
this means of w^atering will be found to be most thorouo-h
and effective. In my work, " Gardening for Profit," I
