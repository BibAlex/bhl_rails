VI rRACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
The radical views advanced on some subjects will be
scouted by many gardeners who have been trained, as I
was, in the conservative schools. For some years T
jDractised according to my early teachings, until in-
creasing business and the dire necessity of more labor
brought common sense to the rescue and enabled me to
cut loose from prescribed rules to such an extent as now
to produce better results, with half the labor, than was
done a score of years ago. Had our practices in such
matters been limited in tlieir extent, or in the length of
time they have been in use, we could not have advocated
their adoption with such confidence. Such modes, differ-
ing from those of the " orthodox school,'" as we have
described, have been in use by all successful florists of
extensive practice in the vicinity of New York for the
past twelve or fifteen years, and as " a tree is known by
its fruits," so we say come and see the results produced
by these methods, and judge whether or not they are
worthy of imitation.
My own knowledge and experience being defective on
a few of the subjects treated of in this work, I have had
the pleasure to receive the assistance of friends who have
attained special eminence in the departments on which
they treat. The plans for laying out gardens, together
with the descriptions, are by the late Eugene A. Baumann,
Landscape Gardener, of Rahway, N. J. ; that on the " Con-
struction of Bouquets, etc.," is written by James H. Park,
of Brooklyn, L. I. ; the chapter on " Orchids," is by
James Fleming, Bergen City, N. J.; and that on " Yiolet
Forcing," by Norton Bros., of Dorchester, Mass.
