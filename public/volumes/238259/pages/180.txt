getting through into the cold subsoil is to cement the bot-
tom of this excavation. One inch in thickness of cement
is enough. When this is done the border material may be
thrown in, filling it up five or six inches higher than the
general level to allow for settling. Be careful never to
handle the materials for the border in wet weather.
OF THE CONSTRUCTIOlSr OF THE VINERY
little may be here said, as there are now architects in
every large city, fully competent to give plans. I will
simply say tliat for early forcing, or perhaps in all
graperies where artificial heat is used, the lean-to or one-
sided structure is preferable ; while for cold graperies, or
those not heated artificially, the curvilinear or span-
roofed is the best. The " lean-to " may be 18 or 20 feet
wide, and of any desired length, giving a length of rafter
from 20 to 24 feet. When the curvilinear span for cold
vineries is used, the base width may be 25 feet, which will
give about 15 feet of rafter on each side. A house built
after the design given for a rose-house on pages 135 and
136, will answer admirably for a cold grapery.
PLANTING THE VINE.
Amateurs planting graperies, commonly desire to pro-
cure vines that are two or three years old, but such as have
had much experience with stocking new graperies know
that a one-year-old vine that is well ripened, better
answers the purpose than those of greater age ; in fact it
is a question whether a vine started from an eye in Feb-
ruary or March, and planted in June, will not by Sep-
tember make as fine a cane as one of any greater age.
As such vines are not very easily transportable or even
procurable at all by beginners, the best thing they can do
is to procure well-grown one-year-old vines and plant
