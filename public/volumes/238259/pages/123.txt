164 PIIACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
pots are laid on their sides, to prevent the soil from getting
excessively wet.
The stocks on which the Camellia is inarched or graft-
ed are raised from cuttings of the single or strong-grow-
ing double varieties. Many of the double sorts make as
good plants raised from cuttings as by being grafted.
This is not the case with tlie double white, which is the
most valuable of all for winter flowers. The cuttings are
made from the ripened young wood, and are treated in
the usual w^ay, (See chapter on Propagation.)
The Camellia is not at all particular as regards soil, and,
may be seen luxuriating in those of very different charac.
ters. The great points are a luimid atmosphere, a temper-
ature in winter not exceeding 50Â°, in summer w^eather
keeping them out of doors or in the green-house, and partial
protection from the full rays of the sun.
Large numbers are now being planted out in green-
houses specially erected for the purpose ; in this way they
grow with great luxuriance, and the flowers are usually
finer than when grown in pots. Caution must be used
to not stimulate a second growth in summer by undue
watering, else they may make another growth to the des-
truction of tlie flower buds. The Camellia cannot safely
be " forced " to produce early flowers by applying heat in
fall or winter, but to have flowers early the forcing must
be done in spring, while the plants are making their growth ;
at this time they will stand a temperature of 60 or 65 de-
grees at night with safety. Kept warm at this season,
the buds set early, and produce early flowers in fall and
winter. By thus forcing in spring for two seasons, the
greater part of the croj^ of Camellia flowers will be ob-
tained by the holidays, at wdiich season they are most
valued.
Of the varieties used for cut flowers the whites are those
prized most ; of these we have Double White and Fim-
briata as the early sorts, and Candidissima as the late.
