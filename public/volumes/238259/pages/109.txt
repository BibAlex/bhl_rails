146 PRACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
The large bulb only is that which produces the flower,
and if that has rotted in the centre sufficient to destroy
'the flower germ, it will not bloom. Figure 35 shows a
perfect bulb cut longitudinally; Figure 36, one in which
the centre has decayed.
Now, in lifting the bulbs in fall, every bulb is then per-
fect, that is, large enough to flower ; those figured are about
the medium natural size. I am satisfied beyond all doubt
that the cause of decay and consequent failure to flower
in the Tuberose is its being kept in too low a temperature
during winter. It is supposed, generally, that it is enough
to keep it dry and free from frost, as we keep potatoes
in a cellar. But unfortunate experience has demonstrated
to me, by a loss of some thousands of dollars, that this is
not enough ; the bulbs must be kept both dry and warm,
from October until May. If they are allowed to remain for
any length of time in a temperature less than 50Â°, the centre
or flower germ will be destroyed, though the outward ap-
pearance of the bulb to the uninitiated would be the same.
For those who have green-houses, the best place to keep
them is alongside the flue or hot water pipes ; for those
who have not, the shelves in a closet of any well-warmed
room will suffice. The Tuberose is now a plant of rising
importance for market purposes. I have no doubt that 5
million roots are grown annually in the vicinity of New
York. The greater part of these are grown by the florists
to supply the bouquet makers with this most important
item in the construction of their baskets of flowers, bouquets,
vases, etc., etc. Tuberose flowers are now produced
nearly all the year round, and sell at wholesale from |1 to
$10 per 100 florets, according to the season, the price
being the highest during the holidays. Each spike aver-
acres 20 florets or sin Me flowers, so that at some seasons
the flowers of a single root of this common bulb produce
12 at wholesale.
