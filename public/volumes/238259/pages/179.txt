a character as would serve the purpose, and hence in nearly
every case it is necessary to prepare the materials for the
"border." The usual rule laid down is to take of the top
spit (or spade's depth), from an old pasture, as the main
material of the border — say three parts; lime rubbish,
charcoal, scrapings from a paved street, or oyster shells
broken up one part ; rotted stable manure one part, with
perhaps one ton of crushed bones added to every twenty
tons of this border compost. Something depends upon
the soil of the pasture from which the top spit is taken ;
if it is a heavy adhesive loam more in proportion of the
lime rubbish or street scrapings should be added, as it is
all important that when the organic substances of the
manure or fibre of the sod are rotted away, that the
material forming the border should not become sodden or
solid, so that it would be retentive of water and im-
pervious to air. For this reason, when choice can be
made, the pasture from which this turfy top spit is taken
should be of a shaly or calcareous character. If the whole
material for the border can be prepared a year before
using so much the better ; let it be repeatedly turned so
as to mix the different ingredients thoroughly. This is
not indispensable, however, as we have often used them
fresh with nearly as good results.
THE EXCAVATION FOR THE BORDER
should be made from 20 to 24 inches deep, and of the
width of the grapery itself; and if the house is a " lean-
to," 15 or 20 feet outside. For a span roof make it the
same distance on each side outside. Above everything it is
indispensable that this excavation be thoroughly drained
— it should be formed so that the bottom slopes about 1
foot in 20 to the outside of the border, and there a drain
should be placed of sufficient capacity as to quickly carry
off all surplus from the rains that may fall on the border.
