CHAPTER XLIII.
CULTURE OF GRAPE VINES UNDER GLASS.
It is many years since I have had personal experience in
the growing of grapes under glass, and this was so lim-
ited that I feel incompetent to do justice to the subject,
even in the short treatise that my restricted space here
will permit. For this reason I have called in the assist-
ance of my life-long friend, Mr. Hugh Wilson, of Salem,
Mass., whose knowledge of the subject is, perhaps, equal
to that of any one in this country ; but, unfortunately, the
limited space at my command gives Mr. Wilson but a mea-
gre chance for giving us the full benefit of his experience.
THE LOCATION OF THE VINERY.
As with all glass structures, the vinery should, when-
ever practicable, be in a situation sheltered from the north
and west, and if the ground is gently sloping towards the
south-east so much the better.
THE BORDER
or soil in which the vines are to be planted is an all im-
portant matter. It is rarely that the natural soil is of such
