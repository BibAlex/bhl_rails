2'i8 PRACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
SalyiaSj (Scarlet and Blue Sage). — No plant that is used
for the flower border holds a higher reputation amongst
amateurs than these, particularly the former. Its bright
scarlet, feather-like plumes are unrivalled from July to
October, and in warmer latitudes continue for months
later. It is best raised from seeds sown in the green-house
or hot-bed in March and planted out in May. The blue
sage (S. pateiis) seeds very sparingly, and is generally
raised from cuttings. Its shade of blue is unsurpassed by
any flower of the garden, but the flowers drop quickly
and it never shows the density of spike of the scarlet
sorts. A fine white variety was introduced last spring.
Tuberose. — See special chapter.
Tropceolum* Hybrids. (Nasturtiums.) — The dwarf sorts
of these are very desirable, blooming without intermission
from June to October. The scarlet varieties, in particular,
are exceedingly showy ; when grown on poor, dry soil or
among rocks they show to much better advantage, as rich
soil causes them to produce leaves so abundantly as to hide
the flowers. They are for this reason Avell adapted for
vases, as they stand heat and drought well. There are
some beautiful yellow varieties marked with crimson ; also
some of a dark maroon, almost black, but, as we have be-
fore said, the bright scarlet sorts are most desirable.
Violets. — See special chapter.
Verbenas. — See special chapter.
Zinnias^ Double. — Although these are now common
enough as annual plants, their great value as ornaments ior
the flower garden deserves brief notice. To have them de-
velop in perfection they should be sown under glass in
March or April and j^lanted out in May. The first flowers
usually do not come double, but towards the end of sum-
mer, if the seed be of a good "strain," flowers will be
produced rivalling the Dahlia in symmetry, and of varied
and novel shades of coloring.
