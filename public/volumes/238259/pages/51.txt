54 PRACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
blundered. I have no reason to complain of success in
business, but I feci well assured that for the first ten
years of my time many thousands of dollars were sacri-
ficed in the blunders made in my endeavor to get on the
right track.
There was no fixed system ; all was confusion, hardly
two of us building alike, and, in my humble opinion, most
of us building wrong.
The style of green-house to be built must be governed
by the purpose for which it is wanted. If for the growing
of a general assortment of green-house or bedding plants,
four years' working of those on the ridge and furrow
system, on the extensive scale in use by us, makes us con-
fident m the belief that that system is all we have previ-
ously claimed for it, as being the most economical of
space, most econom,ical of heat, and most economical in

Figure 12 represents the end section and ground plan
of the style of house referred to, which may be used
for the purpose of growing flowers for winter â€” Roses,

one of Hitching's Combination Boilers (C), heating about
1200 feet of 4-inch pipe (D). The glass roof (E) is
formed of portable sashes, each 6 feet by 3 feet ; each
alternate sash is screwed down, the others being movable,

The movable sash is elevated by an iron bar 15 inches
long, attached to the sash by a staple ; in this bar three
holes are punched, at distances of 3 inches ; by means of
these holes the bar can be hooked upon an iron pin placed
in the ridge pole, and thus hold the sash more or less
open, to graduate the admission of air. When the sash
