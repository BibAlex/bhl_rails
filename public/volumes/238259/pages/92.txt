sods, placed grassy side up-

There is one very important condition to success, which
is, the time at loMch it is done. Few of our rose ama-
teurs have any idea of the amount of freezing that the
most tender Tea Rose even, will sustain Avithout injury,
and would, in consequence,
be apt to hurry to put their
plants under their winter
covering on the appearance
of the first sliglit frost in '!*i"-.$
October. This would most
certainly prove fatal, by
causing them to rot during the still warm autumn
weather. We usually liave frost in this part of the coun-
try in October to injure most green-house plants tliat are
exposed. Yet I have never seen it severe enough to in-
