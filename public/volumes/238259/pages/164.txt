SOFT-AVOODED Oil BEDDIN'G PLANTS. 235
Lemon Verbena {Aloysia citriodora) is largely grown for
the fragrance of the leaves, which are indispensable as a
"green" in summer bouquets. The plant is deciduous,
(losing its leaves in winter), and may be kept under the
stage of the green-house, or in the cellar during winter.
The Lemon Verbena makes a highly ornamental plant
when grown like a standard Rose, that is, by allowing
only one shoot to grow to a height of five or six feet, then
permitting it to branch out at the top.
Lantanas. â€” These require more heat, to keep them in
good condition during the winter, than do most bedding
plants, and for this reason are not so common as many
others less worthy of cultivation. The colors are
orange, yellow, pink, scarlet, crimson, and white, blend-
ing and changing to a remarkable degree. Often
different flowers growing on the same plant will be
entirely unlike. Plants from cuttings set out in May or
June attain a diameter of four or five feet by fall, bloom-
ing profusely throughout the entire summer and fall
months.
Lobelia gracilis, and its varieties, are all low-growing
j^lants, mostly with blue and white flowers, though some of
the varieties of later date are lilac or rose color. They
are admirably adapted for the front lines of "ribbon bord-
ers," and for hanging baskets or vases; they bloom pro-
fusely from June to November, and may be easily kept
as parlor plants, if desired.
Mimuius luteus (or Monkey Flower) comprises numer-
ous varieties, with white, sulphur, and yellow grounds,
beautifully spotted with crimson, scarlet, pink, &c. They
luxuriate in damp, shady situations, and bloom profusely
during the early summer months. A double variety, call-
ed Hose-upon-hose, is a very remarkable sort.
illimulus moscliatus (Musk Plant), is grown for itg
odor of musk, which the leaves have in a marked degree.
Flowers vol low.
