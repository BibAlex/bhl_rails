ORCHID CULTURE. 151
perature, I will briefly state the mode of treatment where-
by I have had the most success.
When a tyro m the culture of EjDiphytal Orchids, I
commenced by fastening the plants, as imported, upon
blocks of wood and pieces of cork. While some did tolera-
bly well, the greater part did not grow to my satisfiction.
In our hot, dry weather it was almost impossible to keep
up the proper degree of moisture and a free circulation of
air. So I soon found that by placing them in perforated
pots or baskets, I was enabled to keep the roots moist and
give plenty of air ; by this treatment the plants began to
improve daily.
The best material I ever found for potting was a very
fibrous kind of turf, found in a dry part of a fresh water
swamp. It could be torn up in thin sheets or broken into
blocks of any size. This, mixed with sphagnum, broken
jiots, and charcoal in lumps, is the best mixture I ever
tried. The plant should be well raised above the level of
the pot or basket, so that no water may lodge around its
neck, and the mixture built so as to hold it firmly in its
place ; and to give a neat, fresh-like appearance, chop some
green sphagnum up fine, and put a layer over the whole.
Baskets and pots of various sizes and patterns may be used,
square, octagonal, etc., as the fancy of the owner may dic-
tate. The best material for the baskets is locust or red
cedar, as they last long and are not apt to be attacked by
insects.
In potting Terrestrial Orchids, place them a little below
the level of the pot (the same as any ordinary plant, and
not raised as for the Epiphytal ones,) in a compost of rough,
turfy loam, leaf mould, sand, and broken pots, and subject
them to the same temperature as the Epiphytal species.
Water and syringe early in the morning, so that the
snn may soon dry the foliage.
When the growing season is over,gradually lower the tem-
perature, and decrease the Quantity of water ; during the pe-
