CULTURE OF THE EOSE. 127
think that they can be lifted from the ground in fall anrl
potted so that tliey will bloom during winter ; perhaps by
such treatment as can be given in a cool green-house or
frame, they may be got to bloom by February or March,
but they should never be forced into bloom earlier, unless
they have been grown in pots during the summer pre-
vious.
The above is described as applied to a single plant, but
a whole bed may be covered in the same manner.
EOSES IN POTS.
As millions of Roses are now sold in pots in spring, we
will briefly state tlie method we have most successfully
adopted in growing large numbers annually for the past
dozen years. The plants used are those struck from cut-
tings in March and April, and planted out in the open
ground in May ; these make plants averaging 18 inches
in height, with proportionate breadth, by the first of No-
vember. Although, as before stated, we make no special
preparation of soil for any particular class of plants, we
are always more careful that the soil used for Roses be
fresh. While our regular mixture of decomposed sods
and manure suits very well for plants generally when it is
two or three years old, we prefer that for Roses to be but
a few months cut from the field before it is used. In
lifting up the plants from the ground, all possible care is
taken to save the fibres from injury, and they are, on no
consideration, ever allowed to be exposed to drying winds
or to wilt in any way, being sprinkled at intervals while
laying in the heaps in the potting shed. We prefer to
prune (which we do with scissors) before potting ; it is not
only done twice as quickly, but it also relieves the plant at
once from surplus shoots, and being, when pruned, more
compact to handle, it can be potted in half the time. The
pots used are from 4 to 8 inches in diameter, in propor-
