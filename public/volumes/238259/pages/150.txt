INSECTS. 217
infested by this insect, all remedies to dislodge it
seem futile. We have lost thousands of plants in a
season by its attacks. It seems, however, to infest light
or sandy soil more than heavy loam or clay, and seems,
also, to be intermittent in its attacks, often not being seen
for three or four years in succession, and again returning
and destroying all in its path. In our light, sandy soil
at Jersey City we suffered severely from it, but for
five years, in our heavy, clayey soil in Bergen, it has rarely
been seen.
CHAPTER XXXIII.
ARE PLANTS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH ?
If physicians are asked if plants are injurious to health,
three out of six will reply that they are.
They will generally follow up the reply by a learned
disquisition on horticultural chemistry ; will tell you that
at night plants give out carbonic acid, which is poisonous
to animal life, and consequently if we sleep in a room
where plants are kept, we of necessity inhale this gas,
and sickness will follow. These worthies generally suc-
ceed in their specious reasoning, and the poor plants, that
have bloomed gaily all summer, are often consigned to
the coal cellar, for their winter's quarters, if given quar-
ters at all. No theory can be more destitute of truth ;
that plants give out carbonic acid may be, but that it is
given out in quantities sufficient to affect our health in the
slightest degree is utter nonsense.
No healthier class of men can be found than green-
house operators, which makes me sometimes think that
plants have a health-giving effect rather than otherwise.
But doctors may tell us that our workmen are only at work
in the day-time, and that it is at night that the carbonic acid
