SOFT-WOODED OR BEDDING PLANTS. 231
these can nearly all be used as continued summer-bloom-
ing bedding plants, if the seed is sown in a hot-bed or
grcen-liouse in February, and the plants put out in the
open border in May. Their great value consists in their
rare shades of blue, a color always scarce in flowers.
Well-known varieties are D. hicolor grandiflorum, figure
50, and D. forrnGsum^ of deep mazarine blue ground,
with distinct spot in the centre of each floret. All thp
perennial species and varieties ai-e hardy. Figure 50
shows reduced spikes and a single flower of the natural size.
Dahlias* — The climate of the Eastern and North-west-
ern States is better adapted to the early development of
the flowers of the Dahlia than warmer latitudes, and
thus we find that though the frosts occur here earlier in
fall, yet the season of flowering is of longer duration than
in districts where the fall frosts are later in coming ; hence
the climate of Boston or New York is better for Dahlias
than that of Baltimore or Washington. The perfection
that is attained, both in form and color of the Dahlia,
is now wonderful. They are divided into four classes,
namely :
Bedding. — Dwarf, profuse-flowering sorts, that are pruned
down so that they do not exceed a foot in height.
Bouquet or Pompone. — The flowers of many of these
do not exceed 1^ inches in diameter, and are perfect
models in form.
Exhibition or Snow. — The large-:&owered, self-colored, or
tii)ped varieties.
Fancy. — The striped or speckled kinds.
Dahlias are propagated by division of the tuber, or (as
done by florists) by cuttings. Plant out when all danger
of frost is over, in rich soil 3 or 4 feet apart, thin out
Eupeifluous shoots, and tie to strong stakes; lift in fall
when cut down by frost, and keep in a dry, warm cellar, or
under the stage of a green-house, only in such a position
