214 PRACTICAL FT.ORICITLTUR"E.
gonium, and various other plants, is so small that it
cannot be seen by the naked eye ; but it produces what
is known as " black rust," a disease that in many parts
of the country has made the cultivation of these plants,
particularly the Verbena, almost impossible.
Viewed by a powerful microscope, this insect, mag-
nified 400 times, appears of the size given
in fig. 68 ; it moves with great rapidity,
and can only be examined as it stops to
feed. When this little pest has once got
a foothold, all direct remedies to dislodge
him seem to be powerless; the fumes of
tobacco, so destructive to the aphis, or of
^^' ^' suljjhur, which is death to the spider, fall
harmlessly on this microscopic insect.
There is hardly a doubt but that the fumes of sulphur
or tobacco would destroy it, if it had not the pov/er of
imbedding itself in the leaf. This is evidently the case,
as on subjecting affected plants to a severe fumigation
with tobacco for 30 minutes no insects could be discerned
on the leaves; but after a short time they again appeared
on the field of the microscope, apparently unscathed.
Now, although we have no direct remedy against this in-
sect, which produces the black rust, we have, I think, a
preventive, by keeping the plants in that healthy condi-
tion which seems to be repellant to its attack. For the
means used to get that healthy condition, see article
on the culture of the Verbena, which is, with slight modi-
fications, equally applicable to all other plants affected
by this insect.
The microscope reveals that this particular species,
which is so destructive to our Verbena, Heliotrope, Petu-
nia, and scores of other plants cultivated in the green-
house or garden, is the same or closely resembles that
which gives the roughness to particular parts of the bark
of cherry, plum, and peach trees, and no doubt is to be
