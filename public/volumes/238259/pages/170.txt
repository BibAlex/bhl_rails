WHAT FLOWERS WILL GKOW IN THE SHADE ? 243
such would particularly be the case with plants of a half-
hardy nature, such as monthly Roses, Carnations, Fuch-
sias, etc.
In our green-house culture of flowers, direct sunlight is
an all important consideration; and a spell of sunless
weatlier in midwinter is often a loss to us of hundreds of
dollars by preventing the development of flowers. Hence,
we use every means at command to dispose the plants to
secure the greatest amount of light.
The debilitating efiects of want of direct light on
plants are well illustrated by taking a vigorous plant in
full foliage and flower, that has been growing in the direct
light of our green-house benches, and placing it under the
bench. If the temperature is higli — say 70° in 48 hours,
the sickly signs, showing want of light, will be apparent
to an experienced eye ; in a week its condition would be
such as to indicate sickness to the most common observer,
and in a month it would most likely be dead.
In this respect there is some analogy between plant and
animal life, and it teaches us the importance of light for
our own healthy development. Certain it is that our
green-house and garden operatives will compare favorably
with any other class of workmen, as far as health is con-
cerned. In the past twenty years I have had an average
of thirty w^orkmen daily. During that time but one has
died, and two only have been seriously sick, and some
three or four veterans who are growing gray in th-e ser-
vice, have never lost an hour by sickness. I doubt if it
would be easy to find the same number of workmen em-
ployed out of the sunlight^ who could show such health
as these sunbrowned boys of ours.
