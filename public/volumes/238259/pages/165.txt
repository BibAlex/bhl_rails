236 PRACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
Pentstcmons, (Hybrids). — ^Plants yet comparatively lit-
tle known. The plant in general appearance somewhat
resembles the Antirrhinum (or Snap Dragon) but as-
sumes an entirely different range of color, the flowers
being carmine, violet, crimson, vermilion, and other shades
of red, with a distinctly marked white throat in most of
the varieties. They bloom throughout the summer
months, and may be kept with half hardy plants in a cold
frame in winter.
Petunias^ (double and single) are now so well known
that a description is hardly necessary. The single varie-
ties, when wanted for bedding, make finer plants if raised
from seed sown in January and February than from cut-
tings. The double varieties, of course, are mainly raised
from cuttings, but are more used by the florists as pot
plants than for bedding purposes, as they flower less pro-
fusely and are generally less showy than the single sorts.
The most valued of the single sorts are those with white
grounds, marked witli crimson blotches or stripes ; those
of the double, with crimson ground with white-edged pet-
als. There are numerous varieties kept to name, but the
majority of them are of only local interest.
Pinks, Florist's. — Hardy, evergreen, herbaceous plants,
blooming in June. The prevailing colors are maroon, crim-
son, rose, and white. They are much used in their season
for summer bouquets, the flowers keeping well, besides
being all of a rich clove-scented fragrance.
Pinks, Mnle. — Similar in general character to the preced-
ing, but having smaller flowers, entirely distinct in form
and color. The varieties are few, and are known as the
crimson, rose, white, and striped sorts.
Pyrethrum Golden Feather. — A new plant, a " sport "
from the well-known Pyrethrum Parthenium^ or Fever-
few, having leaves, as the name indicates, of a golden
shade. For baskets during winter or spring, or for a ribbon
