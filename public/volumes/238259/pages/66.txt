PROPAGATION OP PLANTS BY CUTTINGS. 93
that made from one in the proper state. In propagating
■woody plants, such as Roses, Azaleas, Daphnes, etc., this
test of breaking or snapping does not apply, althoug.h all
these will root, if taken in the same way ; yet we find it
enfeebles their growth more than if the cutting is allowed
to get harder. What this degree of hardness is, it is
difficult to describe ; in Roses it assumes the proper de-
gree of hardness Avhen the shoot develops tlie flower-bud.
But, although we do not take Rose cuttings in the same
succulent condition as we would a Fuchsia or a Verbena,
it must not be imagined
that it is necessary to
make the cutting at a
joint. The doing away
with this custom in
propagating Roses en-
ables us to increase the
product of a plant at
least twice as much as
if we practised ^ under
this dogma, for tiie cut-
ting will root just as
well, and become quite
as good a plant, if made
with a single eye, (figure

^ 2lisi) as II cut at a joint
having two or three eyes, (figure 2^). Although we have
said that cuttings can be as easily rooted without being cut
at a joint as otherwise, yet there are, in some plants, other
considerations that necessitate that they should never be
cut except at a joint ; for example, a Dahlia cutting will
root quite as freely, make as fine a flowering plant
in fall, and the tuberous root increase to its full size ;
but it will not be able to start again in spring, because
the Dahlia pushes only from the crown of the root, and if
the crown has not been formed from a cutting cut close
