OUI-TITRE OF T[TF. CARNATION. 165
Of the other white sorts, none flower abundantly enough
to make them profitable, except Lady Hume, which, how-
ever, is tinged with blusli. It is somewhat singular that
though the Camellia has been extensively cultivated for
thirty years, we have no white varieties originating
in all that time that have equalled these four sorts in
their peculiar qualities. Of colored sorts we have some
hundreds ; prominent among them and of difierent styles
of marking and color, are Imbricata, crimson and white,
Landrethii, bright rose; Benneyii, crimson striped white;
Wilderii, scarlet crimson; Sacco Nora, pink marbled
rose ; Downing, deep carmine blotched white ; Duchess
of Orleans, striped pink and white; Conspersa, carmine
striped; Reine des Fleurs, dark crimson.
In market the value of the flowers and even plants of
the white sorts is double that of the colored. The average
wholesale price of White Camellia flowers in New York
from December to April may be $15 per 100; colored
sorts do not bring half that price, and are in little demand.
CARNATIONS.
In the first edition we named the Carnation as next in
value to the Camellia as a winter-flowering jolant, but
since then the Rose has become the leading flower, even
surpassing the Camellia in popularity. The Carnation is
still grown by us in very large quantities.
The cultivation of the Carnation is very simple. It is
rooted from cuttings at any time from October to A[)ril,
and as the plant is almost hardy, it may be planted out
with safety in the open ground in early spring as soon as
cabbage, lettuce, or any other plant of that nature. Many,
for want of this knowledge, keep Carnations in the green-
house or pits until such time as tender plants are set out
in May, thereby not only having the useless trouble of
taking care of them, but depriving them of six weeks of a
season well adapted to their growth.
