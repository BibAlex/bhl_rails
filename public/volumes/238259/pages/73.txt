102 PRACTICAL FLOEICULTURE.
l)ractice of many of our agricultural and horticultural
journals, of selecting from English papers articles that
ofLcii seriously mislead. For example, a Boston maga-
zine a year or two ago copied a long article from the
English Journal of Horticulture^ telling us in a very
patronizing way how to propagate the golden tricolor-
leaved geraniums. The writer laid great stress on having
a sharp knife and cutting the slip in a particular manner,
then to insert it in silver sand, and a lot of other non-
sense that any boy of six months' practice here would
have known was absurd ; but, above all, the operation
was to be performed in July ! He might have got the
sharpest knife that was ever made, and the purest silver
sand that ever lay on the seashore, bub he would have ut-
terly failed in our climate, if he attempted the work in
July. This is only one of scores of such absurd selec-
tions as we see yearly in some of our horticultural jour-
nals. If the conductors of such have not original matter
to fill up with, better far that they leave their pages blank
than to show their utter ignorance of what is suitable to
our climate.

HOW PLANTS AND FLOWERS ARE GROWN.
Many of my readers live so remote from our great
cities and towns, that "Flower manufacturing," as it may
be termed, is something by them unseen and even un-
heard of. To such the accompanying sketches, taken in
the middle of the month of December, from our establish-
ment in Jersey City, ^. J., may be interesting as well as
instructive.
Figure 31 represents an inside section of a propagating
house. This has a propagating bench or table on each
side, having a ledge to it, and is covered with about three
