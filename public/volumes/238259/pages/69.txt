PIIACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
gation of most plants in this section of the country is at-
tended with great difficulty, and with but little success in
the months of June, July and August, and for this reason
some of the best European propagators fail, when attempt-
ing the operation here in
July, with the thermom-
eter in the' shade at
90°, while in London
success may attend these
elTorts at the same date ;
but then the thermome-
ter there only marks
70°. This twenty de-
grees just makes tlie
difference. I have dwelt
thus long on the subject
of temperature, to fix in
the mind of the reader
what I believe to be of
great importance, and to
prepare liim to under-
stand, if failure occurs,
where to place the cause,
for without much doubt
every case of failure is
traceable either to the
unsuitable condition of
the cutting, irregular-
ity of moisture, or tem-
perature.
Tile most proper condition of temperature, to root cut-
tings of the great majority of green-house and bedding
plants, is 65 degrees of bottom heat, indicated by a ther-
mometer plunged in the sand of the bench, and an atmos-
pheric temperature of 15 degrees less. A range of 10 de-
grees may be allowed, that is, 5° lower, or 5° higher, but
