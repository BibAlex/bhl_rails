One authority gives a table of not less than 19 sorts !
Whether these authorities practice as they preach is very
questionable ; some of them I know do not, but why they
should thus write to mystify those they attempt to teach,
can only be ascribed to a desire to impress their readers
with the profundity of their knowledge on such subjects.
Now, what is the eflTect of such instructions ? Our ama-
