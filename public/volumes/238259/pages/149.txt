216 PRACTICAL FLORICTTLTTTRE.

lessly on these.
Thrips is an active insect,varying in size from that hard
ly perceptible by the naked eye, to the size of the green
fly, and varying in color from whitish-yellow to dark
brown ; it is a jumping insect, very active in its move-
ments, and when it once gets a foothold is very destruct-
ive. It succumbs to tobacco smoke, but not so quickly
as does the green fly. It luxuriates in shaded situations, and
is generally found where plants are standing too thickly to-
gether,or where the ventilation or light of the green-house
has been deficient. I think it may be safe to assert that
in any well-regulated green-house or hot-house no injury
from insects will ever become serious, if proper attention
to syringing and fumigating has been given. Syring-
ing, or other means of keeping a moist atmosphere,
must never be neglected for a day, and fumigating by
tobacco smoke should be done, at the least, once each
week. This has been our own practice for nearly twenty
years, and we rarely ever see an insect in our green-
houses.
The "farnation Twitter." â€” 'This is an insect but little
known, and called in this district only by its local ^lame
of " Carnation Twitter," given from its rapid and nervous
motion. As seen by the naked eye it is about the twen-
tieth part of an inch in length, and of a thickness not
more than that of a cambric needle. It is of various
shades of color, from green to black ; it is never very
numerous on the plants, but most destructive and evidently
poisonous in its attacks on all varieties of the Carnation
and Pinks.
Its effects on the Carnation somewhat resemble those
of .the red spider, except that when attacked by the
" Twitter," the leaves have a cankered and twisted ap-
pearance, easily distinguishable from the browning
effects of the spider. When Carnations or Pinks get
