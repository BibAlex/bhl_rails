SOFT- WOODED OR BEDDING PLANTS. 237
line plant, to contrast with Coleus or Achyrantlies during
the spring or fall months it is valuable. It, however, loses
its rich shade of yellow during the hot weather, which
rather mars its utility for bedding purposes.
Pelargoniums. â€” If I was confined to grow but a single
genus of plants for conservatory decoration, the Pelargo-
nium would be chosen. Nothing can exceed the richness
of coloring of the flowers ; an attempt to describe it would
be a failure. They are classed as " show " and " fancy "
varieties. The " show " are the strong-growing and large-
flowered section ; the " fancy " are those with smaller
leaves, dwarfer growth, and flowers of smaller size, but
having the property of flowering later in the season than
the others. The colors of the Pelargonium are carmine,
vermilion, orange-crimson, blackish-maroon, and white,
so disposed in many varieties as to resemble the work of
the painter, rather than the work of nature. To be grown
in perfection they should be shifted into larger pots as soon
as the roots begin to mat the outside of the balls, the
shoots pinched back until they begin to set their flower
buds in March or April, when they must be placed close to
the light, and never allowed to wilt for want of water.
Plants struck from cuttings in January may be grown to
a diameter of 2 feet by May, but for specimens of extra
size, plants a year old are necessary. They should be kept
in pots and under glass during summer, as they are very
liable to injury from continued rains.
Stocks, Intermediate f crimson and white. Seed of these
sown in September, and potted in October, shifting as nec-
essary through the winter, will make fine plants, to bloom
in May. These may be planted out in the open border,
and will continue in bloom until July. Ten Week's Stocks
are also eflective as border plants, and may be sown in the
hot- bed in March and planted out in May. The variety
of ihese is now very large.
