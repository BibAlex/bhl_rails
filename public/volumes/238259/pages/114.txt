HOLLAND BULBS.
The Holland Bulbs, comprising the Hyacinth, Tulip,
Crocus, Snowdrop, Jonquil, N^arcissus, Iris, and Frittil-
laria, are all hardy in this section of the country, although
it is always advantageous to cover them with three or
four inches of short manure, refuse hops, or sawdust, as a
protection from being too severely frozen, as this, in cold
and heavy soils, may sometimes injure their flowering.
All Holland Bulbs prefer a rich sandy soil, in preference
to one of heavy clay. They are usually imported annual-
ly, although, with the exception of the Hyacinth, they
can all be grown and increased to advantage in our own
climate.
The bulbs are usually planted in the open ground in
October, Hyacinths at distances of 9 inches apart. Tulips,
Narcissuses, and Jonquils at 6 inches. Crocuses and Snow-
drops, to produce a good efiect, at 3 inches. They are
best grouped in beds of each sort by itself to show to ad-
vantage. As soon as their flowering is over in spring,
Verbenas or other bedding plants should be placed in the
beds, as the bulbs are not sufficiently ripened to lift before
June or July. When the leaves by becoming withered
indicate the ripening of the bulbs, they should be lifted,
