The method best suited to the amateur or to those who
have no propagating structures, is by Layering.
This is done as shown in figure 30. It will be observed
that the cut is made on the upper part of the shoot ; the
advantage of this is, that when the layer is detaclied from
the parent plant, the tongue of the layer, or the part from
which the roots are emitted, is less likely to be broken off
than if the cut is made under or on the side. Layers of
Roses may be made at any time from the middle of June to
the middle of September, always using shoots of the young

growth — that is, a growth of 3 or 4 weeks old, or such as
are not so much ripened as to drop tlie leaves ; or, in other
words, the cut should always be made at that ]jart of the
shoot where there are as green and healthy leaves below
as above the cut. This condition of the shoot is very im-
portant, in order to produce a well-rooted layer. By cut-
ting lower down in the harder-ripened wood, roots will be
produced, but the layers will be very inferior to those cut
at about the point named. The same rule applies to the
layering of shrubs of all kinds.
Another mode of layering not in general use is, to j^lace
the layer where the incision is made, in a 3 or 4-inch pot,
sinking the pot in the ground to the level of the rim ; all
the roots being confined in the pot, when the layer is lifted
no check is given, as there is no injury done to the small
fibers. Layers so made may be planted out in the fall,
and if a little mulching is given around the roots, not one
plant in a hundred will fail ; while if the layering is done
