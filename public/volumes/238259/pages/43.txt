44 PRACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
apart, according to their size or development of foliage,
to allow the air free circulation about the outside of the
pots. The effect of this is most marked in the green-
house, and teaches us a lesson as to the great necessity of
the admission of air to the roots in all our operations,
whether under glass or in the open field. If we pot off a
lot of Fuchsias, Geraniums, or other large-leaved plants,
with the pots touching each other, and place them in a
temperature of 60Â°, in eight or ten days they will have
grown so as to cover the whole space over, so that the pots
can hardly be seen. Examine those in the centre of the
lot, and it will be found that the roots that have reached
to the side of the pot are few and feeble ; but move a por-
tion of the pots so that a space of an inch or two is made
between each, to give the air a free circulation around
the pots, and in six days after it will be found that strong
and healthy roots will have been emitted by those that
have been given the additional space, while the others left
standing close have made little or no progress in root
formation, and but a slender and weakly upward growth.
The roots in the open field, could we see them in their
unbroken state, as we can in turning out a plant from a
pot, would show the same differences in vitality under cor-
responding circumstances.
It has often been a matter of surprise to many amateurs,
and even professional gardeners, how it is that such extraor-
dinary vigor and health are obtained in the plants grown by
many New York florists, in pots that seem to be entirely
inadequate in size for the support of such vigor. This is
done by a practice not very generally known outside of
this vicinity. When a plant shows by the condition of its
roots that it requires a supply of fresh soil for its support,
instead of shifting it into a large pot, it is taken out and
the soil washed clean from the roots, and either placed
back again in the same pot, in fresh soil, or in one of 7i
single size larger.
