GKAPE VINES UNDER GLASS. 257
THE SECOND SEASON
after planting, this single shoot or cane should be cut
down to the foot of the rafter, from which a shoot will be
allowed to grow as on the previous season. Vines are not
allowed to fruit in their first year's growth. When the
vines, however, are strong and well ripened, instead of
cutting them down as above stated, I have adopted the
following plan of fruiting the shoot, with good success :
On well-grown vines the shoot or cane will be well
ripened, 7 or 8 feet from bottom of the rafter ; this shoot
is "layered" by being twisted once round (in order to
check the flow of sap), in a 12-inch pot, which is filled up
with vine border compost ; roots will be emitted from this
"layer" sufficient to sustain and mature the fruit, and
as good a shoot will grow from below the layer as if it
had been cut down, as is usually done ; and if the young
cane has been well matured the previous season, a good
crop will be secured with no injury to the part of the
vine relied on for permanent use. The layer after fruit-
ing may be thrown away or cut off and used as a plant.
THE THIRD SEASON.
At the pruning of the ripe wood, instead of cutting the
vine down to a third of its length, or five feet on a fifteen
foot rafter, I think it preferable to leave two-thirds, and
if the vine is strong and well matured it will break freely,
but allow it to bear only a light crop. By doing this, I
have found the strength of the vine better equalized, as
a strong vine when shortened to five feet is apt to make a
stronger growth on the following season, leaving the
lower part comparatively weak.
THE FOURTH SEASON
a full crop maybe taken, which should be about 18 or
20 lb. to each rafter of 15 feet in length.
