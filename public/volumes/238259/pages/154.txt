Our postal laws admit plants, seeds, and bulbs, to be

package does not exceed four pounds in weight. This ar-
rangement has been the means of sending seeds and plants
into regions where they would not for many years have

projector of the idea deserves the gratitude of the nation
for it. A number of different contrivances have been
invented for packing plants to go by mail, including
boxes of various styles and dimensions ; the main difficulty
with all that we have seen is the weight. Of late years
we have dispensed with boxes of all kinds, and pack in the

such as are small but well rooted, the soil is washed from
