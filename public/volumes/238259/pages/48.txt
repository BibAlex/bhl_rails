Plants to be kept over in frames should be potted at
least a month previous to the setting in of cold weather ;
all had better be well established in the pots before the
middle of ISTovember, and until that time the plants should
be fully exposed to the light and air, by the entire removal
of the sashes, unless on unusually harsh and cold days.
From the middle of November to the middle of March but
little watering will be required. In cases of severe snow-
storms, the pit may remain covered up, if the weather is
cold, for a week at a time, without exposing the plants to
the light, and Roses, Camellias, or Azaleas, in a dormant
state, may remain even a month ; but, as before said,
whenever practicable, admit light and air. For out-door
protection of Roses, see chapter devoted to them.
To amateurs we would say that many plants may be
saved in a dry, cool cellar much better than they can be
kept in most sitting-rooms. The plants that can be best
kept during winter in the cellar are Carnations, Fuchsias,
Geraniums, Roses, Lemon Verbenas, and Dahlia roots.
If the plants are to be lifted from the ground, cut away
all strong-growing shoots ; in the case of Geraniums or
Fuchsias, cut them well in, and plant them in shallow
(9-inch deep) boxes of soil, keeping them exposed to the
open au- as late as the weather will permit. This can best
be done by taking them into some shelter at night and
exposing them to light and air through the day ; this will
harden them to endure their winter quarters in the cellar.
