most cases the gardener in charge of green-honses often
has to be up the greater part of the night in winter, and

NATURE'S LAW OF COLORS.
It has long been a belief among students in vegetable
physiology, that, in certain families of plants, particular
colors prevail, and that in no single instance can we ever
expect to see blue, yelloio, and scarlet colors in varieties
of the same species ; yet, undeviating as this law seems
