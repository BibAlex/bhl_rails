CULTURE OF THE VIOLET, 167
VIOLETS.
The demand for Violet flowers during the winter
months in all our large cities is yearly increasing in a
wonderful degree. For the New York market alone it ia
estiiuated that two acres, or nearly 100,000 square feet, of
glass is now used for growing Violets alone ; some grow-
ers make it an exclusive business and grow nothing

distances of about one foot each way. Nothing is done
to them until the first week in September, except to keep
them well hoed and clear of weeds. They are then
thinned out to six or eight crowns, selecting such as are
the strongest and taking oif all the runners and weak
shoots, the principle being exactly the same as in preparing
good stools of strawbeiTies for fruit. About the last week
in September the plants are dug up with balls and planted
on the shelves of the green-house in six or eight inches of
well-enriched, fresh loam.
Shading and watering are necessary if the weather is
clear and dry, and, until the end of October, air should be
given freely. The temperature at night should average
not more than 50 degrees. As the plants begin to
grow, all yellow leaves, weeds, and runners, should be
carefully removed, so as to admit air and liglit to the
flowers. From a green-house 75 feet long with a table or
