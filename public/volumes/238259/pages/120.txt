CHAPTER XXV.
CULTURE OF WINTER FLOWERING PLANTS.
The demand for flowers in winter has steadily kept pace
with the supply, even in the city of New York, where per-
haps half a million of dollars bns been invested in stock
and in green-houses for that special purpose within the past
live years. Perhaps no place surpasses, if it equals this, in
the extent of its flower business or in the systematic man-
ner in which it is carried on. The variety of plants used
for this purpose is not so extensive as might be supposed ;
the following, comprising the leading sorts, are named in
the order of their value and importance for cut flowers.
1st. Camellias, Carnations, Violets ; 2nd. Roses, Tube-
roses, Double Primroses; Srd. Bouvardias, Stevias, Eu-
patoriums; 4th. Heliotropes, Poinsettia pulcberrima, Eu-
phorbia jacquiniflora ; 5th. Stock Gillies, Begonia Sander-
sonii and others, Fuchsia speciosa; 6th. Jessamines, Bal-
sams, Bignonias of all sorts ; 7th. Hyacinths, Mignonette,
Sweet Alyssum ; 8th. Azaleas, Heaths and Ageratum.
We will give descriptions of the manner of growing the
plants above enumerated, which will be more or less ex-
tended as the importance of the variety seems to require.
CAMELLIAS.
Camellias are the most important of all flowers used in
the construction of baskets or bouquets, and hence are
placed first on the list. They are now grown to an
extent truly surprising for that purpose in all our large
cities and their surrounding neighborhoods. Philadel-
phia, until recently, was the great Camellia mart,
but of late years two or three establishments in the
vicinity of 'New York are making such rapid strides
that the Philadelphia florists cannot long compete with
those of New York.
