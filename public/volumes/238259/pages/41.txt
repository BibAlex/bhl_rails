4:2 PRACTICAL FLORICULTUKE.
do much better in the smaller size, for the reason that the
smaller mass of soil in the 2-inch pot allows the moisture
to pass off quicker, and thereby prevents the soil from
becoming sour, or sodden, which would be the case, more
or less, if the cutting had been overpotted in a 3 or 4-inch
pot. The operation of potting cuttings is very simple,
and, in florists' establishments, is performed with great
rapidity, average workmen doing 200 plants per hour.
The pot is filled to the level with soil, a space made with
the finger, in the centre of the soil, of sufiicient size to
admit the root, which is placed in the opening thus
made ; the soil is closed in again by pressing with the
thumbs, close to the neck of the cutting, which firms the
soil around the root ; a smart rap is struck the side of
pot with the hand, which levels the surface of the soil, and
the operation is done. For nearly all the commoner kinds
of bedding plants, such as Verbenas, Heliotropes, etc.,
cuttings in these 2-inch pots, if stood on tables, which are
covered with an inch of sand, and occasionally moved, to
keep the roots from pushing too far through into the sand,
will grow in a healthy condition from three to four
months, at least, at the cool season of the year, from
January to May. But when plants are required to be
grown as specimens, or of larger size for sale in spring,
they must be repotted at intervals, as the condition of
their growth demands ; for example, to grow a Fuclisia
of a height of 6 feet and 3 feet in diameter, a pot of at
.east 12 inches across at top, and 12 inches in depth, would
be necessary, but it would not do to jump from the 2-inch
cutting pot to this size at once ; three or four different
shifts are necessary to attain this end ; these shifts should
be made, as a general thing, not greater than fi'om a 2-
inch size to a 4-inch, and so on. I know that, a few years
ago, considerable agitation was made in favor of what w^as
termed the "one shift system," and fine specimens were
exhibited by its advocates, to show its advantages. There
