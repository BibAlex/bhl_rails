They are usually covered up about the middle of Decem-
ber, and are not uncovered or otherwise disturbed until

it is not practicable to cover with sand or soil, the vines

VARIETIES.
The varieties that I consider to be best suited for a cold

for their weight, the surplus is thus thrown upon the
market, bringing down the price below what is a paying
rate to the regular grower.
I regret the necessity of being compelled to compress
