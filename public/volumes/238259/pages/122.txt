attended to in the graft ; hence we place them in a position
where they will be safe from a high temperature and a dry-
atmosphere, which would be as quickly fatal to the graft
as to the cutting. The best place, then, for Camellias in
process of grafting is in a shaded frame or green-house,
where the lowest temperature j^ossible at that season can

be kept without allowing a current of air to play directly on
the plants. Where the operation is done extensively, a
frame is made inside tlie green-house in which the plants
are placed for the purpose of avoiding currents of air.
It is quite a nice point to regulate the due proportion of
water ; as the stock is partially cut down, with but few
leaves left to elaborate the sap, it follows that only as
much water should be given as will keep the plants from
becoming too dry ; for this reason, if there is danger to be
apprehended from rain or other sources of moisture, the
