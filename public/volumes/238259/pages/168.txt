layer or cutting is detached. The cutting or "layer" is
in condition to be cut off in five or six days from the time
it has been tongued, and will be found not only to be
healed up, and in such a condition that it will quickly emit
roots, but the whole cutting presents a well-ripened,
firm condition, not easily described, but readily detected
by the practical propagator. When detached, they should
be treated in all respects as ordinary cuttings, duly
watered, and shaded for a few days until they strike out
roots, w^hen they are potted off in small pots in the usual
manner. During the unprecedently wet summer that we
had in 1867, we found that many of the plants of the va-
riegated Pelargoniums and variegated Rose Geranium
*' Lady Plymouth," operated on in this manner, produced
roots half an inch in length, as they hung in the air; but
this was of no special advantage, as we found that those
that merely healed up and callused made just as fine plants
as those that had formed roots before being cut off.
Plants thus formed make much finer plants than regular
layers, as they are to all intents and purpose cuttings, and
consequently, unlike layers, are not long dependent on the
parent plant for support, being indebted little or nothing
to the old plant during their development. By this sys-
tem of propagation we have had the satisfaction this sea-
son of doubling our stock of many rare and valuable plants,
which it would have been perfectly impracticable to do in
the usual manner during the hot months.
