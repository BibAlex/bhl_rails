THE PROFITS OF FLORICULTURE. 227
is, that although our plants on an average are sold lowei
than tbey are in England, and our new plants at less than
one-fourth of the prices obtained there, the business is

these English establishments, that the profits did not ex-
ceed 10 per cent of the sales. I am afraid that the small-
est operator of us all here would soon quit the work if it
gave no better results.
