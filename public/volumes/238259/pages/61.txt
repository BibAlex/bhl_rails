66 PKACTICAL FLORICULTURE.
measuring about 7,000 square feet of glass, are copiously
drenched with water in one hour. If watered in the usual
way by watering-pots, the same number of hands would
not do the work as well in six hours.
Of all labor-saving apparatuses yet introduced into oar
gardens, this force pump is the most valued.
As a green-house of this description is built for the pur-
pose of growing winter flowers, ample provision is made
for heating ; eight 4-inch pipes run its entire length, which
is about one square foot of heating surface to three square
feet of glass, or, in other words, one foot of 4-inch pipe to
three square feet of glass. This is the necessary quantity
when a night temperatare of 60 degrees is required in sec-
tions where the thermometer runs down to 10° or 15° be-
low zero. When a temperature of 40° or 45° only is
necessary at night, one foot of heating surface to four feet
of glass is the rule. But, of course, much depends on ex-
posure, style of green-house, etc., so that no infallible
rule can be applied.
CHAPTER XI.
GREEN-HOUSES ATTACHED TO DWELLINGS.
Every now and then the inquiry is made : " How can I
best attach a green-house to my dwelling?" Nothing is
more simple, as far as the mere shell of the green-house is
concerned, but the difficulty is to heat it. Many may not
know that a green-house, even without any artificial
means of heating, can be made very useful in the early
spring months in this latitude, and in those Southern
States where the thermometer does not fall lower than 20°
or 25°. It may be used all through the winter.
