one continued sheet of snowy whiteness from November
to May. It is perhaps the most profitable of all winter
flowering plants grown by tlie florist.
Figure 36 is a section of Carnations (or Pinks, as they
are sometimes called) growing, planted out on one of the
green-house benches. Of late years this has become one
of our most popular winter flowers, and perhaps more
space is devoted to it thati to any other flower. Its cul-
tivation is easy and simple, and for that reason it is less
profitable here perhaps than anything else grown. The
cuttings are treated exactly as the Verbenas, already
described. As the plant is quite hardy, it is plant-
ed out from the green-houses early in spring, (at the sea-
son w^e plant cabbages), in the open ground, at about one
foot each way. The flowers are not allowed to develop
during the summer, but the buds are cut off" as they appear
â€” the flowering I'esources being husbanded for winter.
In October they are lifted and planted on the benches.
Many of these plants produce over a hundred flowers.
The sorts grown are very few, mainly carmine and pure
white. The Carnation, however, comprises many hun-
dred varieties ; but we find comparatively few flower sufii-
ciently freely in winter to warrant their growth ; though
for private collections a score of sorts might be grown to
represent the different colors and markings.

The increasing interest taken in the Japan and other
Lilies renders their rapid increase a matter of much inter-

cultivatorj who may wish to increase his stock of some
