14 PRACTICAL FLORICTJLTITRE.
with the water-table, or first floor, raised above the
ground some five feet, and the earth from the foundations
and cellars employed for a terrace, rising about two and
a half feet above the ordinary level, which is understood
to be some two feet above that of the public road.
This plan is entirely in the geometric style, or with
straight walks exclusively, as we think that, considering
everything, this arrangement is the most suitable for small
lots.
What, indeed, is the best use to which to put so little
room ? Fruit trees, vegetables, and large pieces of lawn
are not what are here required ; fruit and vegetables the
proprietor may procure at the market cheaper than he
could raise them ; lawns or grass plots would not be ac-
cessible for any amusement or exercise in damp or rainy
weather. Therefore I consider well-made walks, that may
be dry in the afternoon of a rainy day, much more needed
for the promenade of persons, who, having been busy all
day, require some exercise and fresh air in the evening.
Fine shrubbery, flower-beds, and shade are also required.
In a planting of the right sort, it requires not much
depth to form good belts to protect the place against the
cold winds, or sometimes against cool neighbors.
A large display of flowers does not require a very large
space of ground, and if plenty of flowers should be
wanted, as is generally the case, their quantity may be in-
creased by a judicious selection of flowering shrubbery.
For a more sheltered, shady walk, I should, in such a
place, suggest a well-built arbor too, covered on top with
ont-door grape vines, and on the side towards the house
with fine flowering climbers, or those that have good and
durable foliage, such as Climbing Roses and Honeysuckles,
the Clematis, Akebia, Virginia Creeper, Bittersweet (or
Celastrus scandens), Wistaria Sinensis, etc., as perma-
nent plants, which may be trained so as to cover the whole
front; and then, for variety, of a dwarfer habit and cover-
