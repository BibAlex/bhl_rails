have become unusually dry.
CHAPTER IX.
CONSTRUCTION OF HOT-BEDS.
The most economical way of making hot-beds is to
place the manure in pits made in the way described for
Cold Frames, except that they may be made a foot or so
deeper, so as to admit at least 18 inches of manure.
The heating material for hot-beds is usually horse-manure,
but refuse hops, leaves from the woods, or tan bark, will
answer nearly as well when one is more readily attainable
than another.
Whatever material is employed, it should be thrown into
a heap of sufficient size to generate heat, and repeatedly
turned until the rank heat has been expelled, which will
usually be done by turning twice. The mass will be in the
proper condition to be put into the pit in eight or ten
days from the time of starting with the raw material. In
spreading it in the pit it should be firmly trodden down
to the depth of 18 inches, so that the heat may be longer
retained. If the hot-bed is to be used to receive plants
in pots, a covering of 4 to 6 inches of sawdust, in which
to place or plunge the pots, should be put over the
heatino; material. If the bed is to be used for the sowiusc
of annual or other seeds, a covering of 6 inches of light
soil should be put over the manure. Before placing plants
or sowing seeds in the hot-bed, plunge a thermometer
in the bed, and when the heat begins to decline from 100 '
