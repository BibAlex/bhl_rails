ROOTS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS 83
ground, and especially the leaves, are contin-
ually losing water through the stomata, and
the water in the xylem conducting cells and
vessels is being as continually drawn upon.
Thus the whole water system is in a peculiar
condition of considerable tensile stress.
This condition may be compared to a wire
which is subjected to a powerful pull. This
comparison may appear at first sight to be
far fetched, but it really does illustrate fairly
well what is going on, especially in the water
conduits of tall trees. For when water is
enclosed in suitable tubes (and the conducting
tissues of the water conduits are suitable in
this respect) the force required to break such
a column of water is very great, many times
that of the pressure of one atmosphere. As
everybody knows, in an ordinary tube water
can only be maintained at a height of about
32 feet by means of atmospheric pressure
alone. But pure water, completely filling
clean tubes of appropriate structure, will
maintain itself at a height many times
32 feet, owing to its capacity of resisting
tensile stress.
Although there are certain difficulties, all
of which have not as yet been fully met, in
explaining the movement of the current of
water up through the trunks of tall trees,
there is little doubt that the principle just
indicated is the main factor in the matter,
for though the column of water thus main-
tained is very stable as a whole, the individual
