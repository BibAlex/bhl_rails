encountered in nature are just those whieh are
fitted for actual environmental conditions.
Plants not so adapted are unable permanently
to occupy any position at all. The positively
unfit are speedily exterminated, and only
those combinations which give good results
can persist. But the good results are
primarily the result of particular operation
of internal factors. They arise as the in-
evitable consequence of the particular algal
and fungal combination, and they are quite
independent and irrespective of ultimate
adaptation to light or other external conditions.
These external conditions are the tests which
largely determine not the origin, but the
persistence (or extinction) of each and every
individual sort of hehen.
It may not be possible to push very far
our analysis of the factors involved in the
genesis of form and structure on the one hand,
and those correlations of growth wherein so
many adaptive modifications consists on
the other. It may well be, however, that
an experimental study of lichens is destined
to throw light on much that is now obscure.
For in witnessing the synthesis of a lichen,
and the modification in structure and habit
whieh results from the association of the two
symbionts, we seem to have caught a glimpse
of the secret methods and processes which
direct the evolution of organic form.
