190 PLANT LIFE
regarded at once as parasites. We have
already seen that vast numbers of the fungi
feed on dead remains, rather than on Hving
plants and animals. There are, likewise, many-
flowering plants whieh apparently behave in
a similar manner and they are generally, on
that aceount, classed as saprophytes. But,
as we shall see, a closer examination of the
facts indicates that many of them more
nearly resemble the parasites after all, though
the method of their parasitism is well con-
cealed. The Birds-nest Orchis furnishes an
excellent illustration of this.
The birds-nest orchis (Neottia, Fig. 21) is a
fairly common, though frequently overlooked
inhabitant of the humus soil of dense wood-
lands. It lives under the ground in the leaf
mould, except when it pushes up its cluster
of sickly looking flowers on a yellowish or
brown stem in early summer. No green
leaves are produced, though the flowering
shaft bears rather large brown ones. Hence
the plant is unable to manufacture carbo-
hydrate food for itself in the way that its
green relatives can do. Traced below the
soil, the flow^ering stalk is seen to spring from
a short, stumpy root-stock from which arises
a huddled crowed of short, brittle roots.
The special interest of the birds-nest
orchis in the present connection centres in
these roots, for it is through them that,
somehow or other, the stores of food locked
up in the humus soil are absorbed by the
