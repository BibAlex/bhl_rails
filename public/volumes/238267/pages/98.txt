94 PLANT LIFE
(Figs. 13a and b). A fairly young stem cut
across and examined under a moderate magni-
fication shows that the centre is occupied by
a bulky pith around which are seen the cut
ends of the conducting strands â€” the vascular
bundles. Just outside these are to be found
the cut ends of small rod-like strands of tissue,
the sclerenchyma. These run down the stem,
following, roughly, the course of the vascular
bundles. They are connected laterally at
intervals, and especially at a node where a
leaf springs from the stem. Each of these
sclerenchymatous strands consists of very
much elongated cells wdth pointed ends that
grow and insert themselves between their
neighbours above and below, thus giving the
rod or strand of sclerenchyma as a whole a
considerable degree of tenacity.
The walls of the cells become greatly
thickened,-, and the rod is sharply marked off
from the soft tissues of the rind in which it
is embedded. Regarded from the point of
view of its physical properties it exhibits
remarkabla strength. It is quite elastic even
when submitted to considerable stress. This
means that within certain limits it can be
pulled out (i. e. elongated) by applying a
force, and when this is withdrawn it will
recover, and contract to its former length.
In this respect the sclerenchymatous strands
of many plants are but little inferior to good
steel, and a strand one millimeter in cross
section will stand a pull of about twenty
