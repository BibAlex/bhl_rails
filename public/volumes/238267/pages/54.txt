essential for water plants, and we shall find
that the complex structure of terrestrial
species becomes simplified in any descendants
that may have taken to a watery habitat.
Even amongst the algae high differentiation

magnitude. This is well seen in those sea-
weeds that consist of a large number of cells
which, though enclosed in a common peri-
pheral membrane of cellulose, are not parti-
tioned off from each other by cell walls. An
example of such a plant, which combines
a somewhat highly differentiated external
