pate it afterwards.
Some of these destruetive fungi, instead of
only attaeking the dead tissues — the wood — •
of the trees, invade and kill the living cells.
This is a more serious matter, for we must
remember that only a very small part of a
trunk is really alive in the striet sense of the
word, that is, contains living protoplasm.
Any pest which attacks the living tissues, and
especially the cambium, often speedily kills
it, or at any rate renders it practically worth-
less. Such fungi are those which produce
the larch canker (Dasyscypha W illkommii) and
the beech canker (Nectria ditissima), the
latter being especially destructive to the cells
of the cambial region and thus producing
very dangerous lesions.
One of the most interesting of the tree
diseases is that produced by the fungus known
as Armillaria mellea. The fructifications are
easily recognised as clusters of brown toad-
stool-like bodies which spring from the roots
or stumps of dead trees at the ground level.
Each toadstool is characterised by the
possession of a ring or frill underneath the
cap which bears the gills. Before its life
history became known, and consequently
methods could be devised to check its progress,
the fungus was a very dangerous one, especi-
ally when it invaded the pine woods, for it
spreads fairly rapidly from one tree to
another. The mycelium grows in the cambial
