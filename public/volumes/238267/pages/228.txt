are watched under the microscope while the
sperms are swimming about them, they will
be seen, one by one, suddenly to change
their form — they swell up, and at some one
spot on their surface they become prickly.
This prickliness spreads with great rapidity
over the surface of the egg. The onset of
this curious appearance marks the entrance
of a sperm into the egg. The immediate effect
of that sperm on the egg protoplasm is to
render it not only no longer attractive to
the rest of the sperms, but actually poisonous
to them. An explanation is therefore at once
furnished as to how the entrance of more
than one sperm is prevented. The change is
a sudden one, resulting from the interaction
of the substance of the egg and sperm — a
circumstance which sufficiently emphasises
the physiological difference existing between
them. Under unfavourable conditions, e. g.
badly aerated water, or by the addition of
certain substances to the water, the sudden-
ness of this reaction can be slowed down, and
then it may happen that more than one
sperm effects an entrance. But it seems to
be a general rule that if more than one of
them fuses with the nucleus of the egg,
either no further development takes place,
or monstrous embryos are produced which
commonly die during the earlier stages of
development.
It is evident, then, that the act of sexual
fusion produces striking and immediate change
