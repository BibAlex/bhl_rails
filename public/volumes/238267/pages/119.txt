CLIMBING AND WATER PLANTS 115
kind, which indicate that when an organism
has once modified its constitution so as to
exhibit any special trend, the chances are
all in favour of advance along the new lines,
and very slightly indeed in favour of a return
to the old ones. The history of abortion of
parts (e. g. leaves), of concrescence in flowers,
and many other morphological series of facts,
may be adduced in support of this proposition.
Thus while stem anomaly is often (but
far from invariably) associated with climbing
habit, the connection is seen to be, after all,
rather obscure. Sometimes perhaps fortui-
tous, at others it is to be regarded as the
independent, but concomitant, and mutually
advantageous result of a modification of
the living substance of the plant itself.
Finally, it is not unlikely that the abnormali-
ties are sometimes elicited as the response,
on the part of plants which have the faculty
of making them at all, to stimuli given to the
living cells by the strains and torsions, as well
as by the internal nutritive conditions specially
characteristic of the climber, or incident to
the climbing habit.
The same sort of argument may be extended
to apply to the well-known fact that in many
climbers certain definite organs become modi-
fied, and are enabled thereby to attach the
plant to a support. The particular organ
(Figs. 15 and 16) affected varies widely in
different plants, but whether it is a hook, a
branch, a leaf, or part of a leaf, it is constant
