THE PLANT AND ITS FOOD 17
liquid which arc continually contracting and
expanding. This kind of vacuole is also
characteristic of many of the primitive
animals, whilst it is only met with in com-
paratively few of the more primitive and still
motile plants. A small, somewhat refractive,
spot in the protoplasm marks the position
of the nucleus, an important structure which
is found in the protoplasm of animals and
plants alike. Another part of the protoplasm
is coloured green, and is clearly defined from
the rest of the living substance not only by
its colour, but by its denser consistency. It
is termed the chloroplast, and it often contains
a clear spot in its interior, termed the pyrenoid.
Finally, close to the point of insertion of the
two cilia, there is a small brown or yellow
eye-spot. The little plant swims about
through the water, and though the movements
appear at first sight to be aimless, they are not
altogether so, for if a large number of in-
dividuals are present, so as to give the water
a green tinge, it i^ seen that they congregate
on the illuminated side of the vessel. That
is to say, they are affected by the stimulus of
light, and the members of the colony spread
themselves out towards the source of illumina-
tion. In other words, they are irritable,
which is the technical way of expressing the
fact that they are capable of responding by
a movement to a stimulus â€” in this instance,
to the stimulus of light.
