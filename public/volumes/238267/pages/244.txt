somes. It invariably happens, so far as at
present is known, that when the eggs are
fertile at all they produce new ferns directly,
that is, without fertilisation. Moreover, even
the tissue cells of such a prothallus may
change their mode of growth, and develop
into fern plants without the definite produc-
tion of sexual organs at all.
Such a departure from the normal course
of life history strongly emphasises the relation
of meiosis to fertilisation, but it does more
than this. It indicates that the striking
difference between the fern plant and the
prothallus is not itself essentially bound up
with those nuclear changes which are inti-
mately associated with the sexual phases.
It points rather to the conclusion that in these
plants the life history, with its two different
stages, may have developed in coincidence,
though not in causal connection with the
separation of the sexual process into two
stages. It would clearly be futile, in the face
of the evidence, to attempt to maintain the
existence of a causal relation between the
nuclear changes and the characteristic differ-
ences between the two stages of the life
history of the fern. In this way we may
understand the continuance of the alternate
appearance of fern and prothallus, even when
the cellular rhythm no longer obtains.
Considerations of space preclude the follow-
ing up of this matter in any detail; it may,
however, be said quite generally that wherever
