and diffusible sugar, travels in the latter form
to other parts of the plant. It passes to the
growing regions, where it is utilised in growth
processes, to storage tissues where it is re-
converted into starch or into some other food
reserve, or it is drawn towards any other centre
of activity where a consumption of carbo-
hydrate is in progress.
We have learned in a former chapter that
water plays an important part in photo-
synthetic production of carbohydrate. It
not only acts as a physical agent, by main-
taining the protoplasm in that state of watery
consistence essential to chemical change, but
it also forms part of the raw material which
enters into the actual composition of the
sugars and similar substances. Furthermore it
serves as the vehicle by which salts containing
phosphorus, sulphur and other substances
which enter into the composition of proto-
plasm, or are essential to its proper working,
can enter the plant from w^ithout. The excess
of water is eliminated from the plant by the
diffusion or transpiration of the watery vapour
through the stomata.
