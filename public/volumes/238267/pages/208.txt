VEGETATIVE REPRODUCTION
Reproduction, in its simplest and most
primitive form, is one of the most obvious
results of growth. It represents, after a
fashion, and in a certain tangible form, the
balance of profit over expenditure on the
part of the individual, which is applied to
the extension of the business of the species
or race. But the process is not a simple one.
When a unicellular plant, Chlamydomonas
for example, has reached a certain size, the
protoplasm ceases to grow. It divides, and
the products of this fission, which may be
repeated several times, separate from each
other as new and independent individuals.
Nothing is left of the old organism, it has
simply split up into a number of smaller ones.
In other words, the nutritional processes which
enabled growth to proceed have prepared
the way for, and have then given way to, a
new set of chemical processes, and these
result in the cleavage of the mass into smaller
parts. This cleavage, or cell-multiplication,
may be started in several different ways, but
the method most often encountered in nature
clearly depends on factors which are them-
