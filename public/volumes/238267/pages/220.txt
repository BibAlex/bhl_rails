216 PLANT LIFE
its nutrition. It is possible to maintain the
plant, apparently for an indefinite period, in
a state of vegetatively aetive growth. On
the other hand, it may with almost equal
certainty be compelled to enter on the
sexually reproductive phase of its life. A
sudden starvation, if previously well nourished,
and so long as the organisms are exposed to
light, will at once bring about the change
that leads to the formation of gametes. But
v^e may at once confess that we do not as
yet understand how these conditions work
in producing the observed effects. Nor are
we able to form a clear idea as to why the
addition of nutritive salts to the water in
which the chlamydomonas is living suffices
at once to arrest sexual development, and to
switch the life processes back on to the
vegetative course; so much so, indeed, that
even gametes can develop independently,
and in a vegetative manner, i. e. without any
sexual union.
But the effects of sudden starvation on
previously w^ell-nourished organisms are well
known to conduce to the development of
sexual reproductive organs. In a chlamydo-
monas the organism and the sexual cell are
practically identical, and it is in the highest
degree suggestive to find that what stimulates
the production of sexual organs in a complex
and highly differentiated plant will also cause
the undifferentiated primitive one also to
enter on a sexual condition or phase. More-
