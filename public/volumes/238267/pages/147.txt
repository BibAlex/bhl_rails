doubtless they further serve to protect the
delicate leaves within from a variety of other
injurious influences. Nevertheless, in spite
of their wonderfully perfect adaptation to
these functions, they may be shown to owe
their existence in their present form to certain
conditions which affect nutrition during a
far earlier period of active vegetation, for
they are simply modified leaves or parts of
leaves. In a sense they may be said to have
been starved and arrested, or rather dis-
torted, in their development. This can easily
be proved in such a plant as a young ash or a
plum, by pulling off the young and active
outer foliage leaves. The operation must be
performed quite early in the summer while
the bud scales are young, and before they are
fully formed. The result of the experiment
is to cause the young leaves that otherwise
would have been destined to form the bud
scales, to grow out, and provide a further crop
of foliage leaves. The removal of the active
leaves has diverted nutrition into the young
bud scales that were to be, and has caused
them to assume the form and character of
foliage leaves; and this happens for precisely
the same material reasons that the foliage
leaves themselves are forced to assume their
own proper form.
In many parts of the world the climate is
sharply marked into a wet and a dry season.
During the wet period, vegetation of a meso-
phytic type can exist ; but unless it has some
