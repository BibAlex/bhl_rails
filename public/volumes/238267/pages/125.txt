has grown for a certain distance, it bends
up out of the mud into the air. Then as it
grows on, it curls down and its tip again
enters the mud. The bowed portion or
knee which sticks up into the air forms
a quantity of spongy tissue full of intercellular
spaces, and as these communicate externally
with the atmosphere, and internally with
the intercellular spaces in the rest of the root,
the respiration of the root cells is amply
provided for, although there is no supply of
free oxygen in the mud through which they
grow.
A number of other trees of the mangrove
swamp form special roots which grow up like
spikes out of the mud. They do not again
turn and grow downwards, but are definitely
specialised as aerating organs. They may be
compared to ventilating pipes, for their use
is entirely confined to enabling an interchange
to take place between the air in the plant and
that of the atmosphere.
The submerged aquatic plants have to
meet a set of conditions very different from
those which confront the land vegetation.
Inasmuch as they are surrounded with water
there is no risk of desiccation, and the cuticle
is poorly developed and often is hardly
perceptible. Water is not continually being
lost, nor is there any difficulty in obtaining it.
Hence it is not surprising to find that the
development of water-conducting elements is
feeble. And one of the striking features of
