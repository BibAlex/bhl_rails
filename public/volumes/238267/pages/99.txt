IMECHANICAL PROBLEMS 95
kilograms, and still spring back when the
weight is removed. They elongate more
than a steel wire would do under the same
stress, and they differ in another respect from
steel, in that they break if loaded only a
little beyond their elastic limits.
To understand how effective a system of
such strands really is in enabling the stem
to withstand bending stresses, or to recover
its original position when the force (e. g. that
of the wind) is withdrawn, we must consider
the way in which they are arranged, and what
actually happens when a stem is made to
bend. In the first place the sclerenchymatous
strands form a tissue system, and in the second
place the strands cannot shift from their
relative positions, being prevented from doing
so by the surrounding cells of the stem which
occupy the space between them. If we there-
fore consider the condition of two of these
strands situated on, let us say, the east and
west sides of the stem they may together be
regarded as forming a girder, the relatively
weak tissue of the stem lying in the east and
west plane forming the webbing or lattice-
work of the girder. Now when a girder of
this construction is bent, the concave side
is shortened or squeezed, while the convex
side is lengthened or pulled. The intervening
webbing merely serves to hold the two bars or
flanges in their relative positions and is itself
subject to less and less stress the nearer the
middle Hne between the two flanges is reached.
