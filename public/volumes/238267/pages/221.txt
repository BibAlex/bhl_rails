SEXUAL REPRODUCTION 217
over, the converse is also true, though it is
often less easily demonstrated. For a reversal
of the conditions that led to the development
of the sexual state will arrest it, and cause not
only lowly, but many of the higher plants
to resume their vegetative growth. Some of
the malformations often seen in flowering
plants, as the consequence of injudicious
manuring, represent the results of the
antagonism between the sexual and vegetative
functions.
But in the more specialised plants, where
the sexual and other reproductive cells are
different from the general mass of the body
cells, the sexual elements themselves are
more limited in their range of development.
We can, in favourable instances, so influence
the plant as to determine whether or not it
shall form sexual organs. But where once
the sexual cells are formed, these can seldom be
induced to develop further, unless they unite
in appropriate pairs. For some reason the
chemical processes no longer run in the
direction of growth and development. They
result in death and disintegration unless a
sexual fusion occurs.
We do not as yet know why this should
be so, but the experimental work of recent
years has taught us that by suitably altering
the conditions of chemical action within the
protoplasm of the gamete, and especially by
appropriately regulating the oxidative pro-
cesses, the cell will again be able to resume
