the structure of the organism and its environ-
ment. It is, further, almost a truism to
remark that the more complex the organism
the more patent is the perfection of its
adjustment.
It is only when we get at closer quarters
with our problem that its intricacies really
begin to reveal themselves, and we are
obliged to confess that our search for the
causes, and even for the proximate agents by
which the production of appropriate mechan-
ical tissue is produced, has not been greatly
rewarded. Of the means whereby the corre-
lation is secured between functional need on
the one hand, and its peculiarily correct
satisfaction on the other, we have no positive
knowledge at all.
It is easy to talk of capacity to vary,
survival of the fittest, and so on. Such
formulae have their uses as expressing rather
clearly certain definite facts, and as indicat-
ing in a general way some of the probable
or possible processes which have been con-
cerned in, or have at least influenced, the
modification of plants and animals in their
long course of evolution. But, after all, they
are only generalised descriptions, and give
us very little real or direct insight into the
nature of the processes themselves, and yet
it is precisely in the latter that the whole
secrets of evolution, and all that it implies,
are contained. In the particular example
we have been considering, we want to know
