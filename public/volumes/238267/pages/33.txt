CELLULAR STRUCTURE 29
which is essential to the exercise of its vital
functions. In the absence of sufTicicnt water-
content the protoplasm may actually die.
Even if it is able to tolerate comparative
desiccation, it passes into a state in which
all vital reactions are slowed down until they
are practically brought to a standstill.
We see clearly, therefore, that an adequate
water supply must be regarded as a primary
condition of all active life â€” prior in import-
ance even to the provision for photosynthesis
in the green plant. For when water is cut
off, the building up of complex carbon com-
pounds is ipso facto arrested, however com-
pletely all other conditions of photosynthesis
may be satisfied.
It is clear that plants which pass the whole
of their lives in a watery medium are not
confronted with the risk of water starvation,
but this danger may, and often does, become
acute as soon as they exchange a purely
aquatic for a terrestrial habitat. It is no
exaggeration to assert that the most salient
features in the structure, and the behaviour
of green vegetation in general, is mainly
connected with a solution of the problems pre-
sented by water requirements on the one hand,
and by those of photosynthesis on the other.
It is in relation to these two overwhelmingly
important functions that vegetation has
assumed much of its present form, for any
plant failing to achieve success in these two
directions must either suffer extinction, or
