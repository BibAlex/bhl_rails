ROOTS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS 71
CHAPTER VII
ROOTS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS
In order to complete our story of the green
leaf and its duties to the plant, we must know
how the water is absorbed into the plant and
how it is transmitted to the leaves or other
organs where it is required.
We might still keep the oak tree before us
as a concrete example in which to study these
things, and we should discover that it is only
by the roots that the tree obtains the water
it needs, and that these organs absorb it
directly from the soil in which the tree is
growing.
If we attempted to pull the roots out of the
ground it would be found that, even in a
seedling tree, the task is not an easy one.
They penetrate the soil deeply, and ramify
widely through it. It is easier, therefore, and
for certain other reasons better, to study the
roots of a more easily accessible objecl â€” say
a sunflower or any other herbaceous plant.
On carefully digging out the roots of such
a plant, we should see that the tips are
smooth and conical, a shape well suited to bore
through the soil. At a short distance behind the
tip, the root is rather velvety or hairy, and it
