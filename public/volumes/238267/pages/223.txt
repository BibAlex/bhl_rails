SEXUAL REPRODUCTION 219
mistakablc, and is of considerable import-
ance in its connection with the sexual act.
The chief character which urges itself on
our notice consists in the relatively large
size of the egg or female gamete, and the
small size of the other, the male or sperm.
The egg not only becomes large, but it
loses the power of independent motility.
It consists of a bulky mass of cytoplasm, in
which nutritive matter is often present, and
it also contains a large and somewhat watery-
looking nucleus.
The sperm, on the other hand, is small and
compact. It is nearly always actively motile,
though this character is almost or entirely
abandoned in certain groups, such as the
highest flowering plants in which this has
evidently occurred as the result of correlation
with other secondary changes connected with
pollination, which render motility useless
or even disadvantageous. In another im-
portant respect the sperm also differs from
the egg, inasmuch as it tends to become
composed almost entirely of the cell nucleus,
the cytoplasm being merely represented by
the cilia and a thin skin w^hich sheaths the
nucleus as a whole.
One of the results secured by fertilisation
has already been pointed out, namely,
the vigorous development so characteristic
of the sexually produced organism. But
there is another and perhaps hardly less
important consequence, namely, that the
