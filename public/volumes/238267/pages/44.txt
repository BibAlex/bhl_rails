CHAPTER IV
THE CELLS AND THE ORGANISM
Turning from the flattened forms to the
filamentous types of algae, we find a great
variety of forms, aeeompanied by a very
different degree of autonomy in the constituent
cells of the filamentous body. Moreover, we
see very clearly that closely analogous forms
have been reached by several evolutionary
routes. In other words, much the same
kind of organisation may have been arrived
at by plants which have descended from
several diverse simple stocks. This con-
vergence of type, or analogous similarity
between remotely related forms, is of fairly
wide occurrence both in animals and in plants,
nor is it by any means restricted to the
simpler members of either kingdom.
Our first illustration of an alga organised
on the filamentous plan is afforded by the
species known as Hy drums fcetidus (Fig. 5). It
is an aquatic plant, rare in Britain, but fairly
abundant in many Alpine rills near the
melting snow. The reason of this is that the
alga only thrives at a low temperature, soon
perishing in water above 12° C. ( = about
54° F.). The plants are rather plumosely
