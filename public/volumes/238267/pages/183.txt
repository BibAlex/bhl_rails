FUNGAL PARASITES 179
injuriously affect the development of the
cutiele of the leaf. Or, again, it may lead to
an excessive amount of watery sap in the
superficial tissues, quite apart from the effects
of external moisture on the outer surfaces of
the stems and leaves. It is well known that
bad cultural conditions may predispose plants
to disease, and observation teaches that some-
times, at any rate, the effects are due to
imperfect development of the tegumentary
tissues.
The presence of nitrogenous manure in
excessive quantities, in proportion, that is,
to the other nutritive constituents of the soil,
is another predisposing cause of fungal attack.
It operates in several ways, but often in-
directly by causing an undue accumulation
of soluble nutritious substances in tissues
and cells the walls of which are imperfectly
thickened.
Starvation of an essential food constituent
may act as a specific cause of predisposition.
Thus many grasses, when they are grown on
land in which the supply of potash salts is
inadequate, become very liable to epidemic
attacks of a fungus known as Epichloe typhina.
The disease makes its appearance in the form
of white (changing to yellow) zones situated
just above the knots of the stem, and extend-
ing upwards for a centimeter or two. These
zones mark the regions w^here the reproductive
organs of the fungus are formed. A poor
supply of potash is also known to affect the
