146 PLANT LIFE
The hyacinth is by no means necessarily
a woodland plant. In many parts of Wales
and Scotland it grows amongst the grass in
the open fields, wherever it is able to compete
with the growing herbage.
The point which the hyacinth enables us
to emphasise is this, that whilst the bulbous
(or tuberous) habit is one which will put its
owner into favourable relation with certain
types of dry climates, it will also, and for
analogous reasons, prove an adaptation
suitable for other and very different conditions
as well, provided that these also include a
brief period favourable to the vegetative
activity of the plants.
When the climate is persistently dry the
vegetation is usually mixed and consists of
plants which are either succulent or spiny.
These seem contradictory features, and in a
measure so they are. Nevertheless, each
habit, that of succulence and that of spininess,
is well adapted for dry climatic conditions.
The succulent plant stores what water it can
get and when it can get it. A remarkably
extensive and deep root system is often
developed, by which it is enabled to search
the ground thoroughly and effectively for the
requisite moisture. Moreover, such water as
it does acquire is lost very slowly, owing to
peculiar features connected with the stomata.
The presence of wax or bloom also serves
as an additional check to the escape of watery
vapour.
