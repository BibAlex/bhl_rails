preserved it, but have acquired all the acces-
sory complications of structure that purposive
motion necessarily entails ?
The answer is to be sought in the results of
an apparently trivial difference in structure
between the animals and plants which made
its appearance at an early period in evolution-
ary history. It is a difference which from
the start was fraught with consequences of
the greatest importance, and has profoundly
affected the entire course of development
in the two kingdoms respectively. Stated
simply, it consists essentially in this, namely,
that the living substance of the plant secretes
over its surface a skin of cellulose, or some
analogous substance, whilst that of the
animal does not.^
If we examine any one of the simplest
microscopic individuals of whose vegetable
nature there can be no dispute, we shall find
that the protoplasm, or living substance, is
enclosed in a not-living skin or bag of cellulose.
This skin is not an indispensable structure,
for the living substance may, for a time at
least, exist without it. Even in the highest
plants this commonly occurs during the first
stages of embryonic existence, but as soon
as development begins the membrane is
1 This statement is broadly true, for although cellulose
is not unknown in the animal kingdom it has never been
so arranged in the body as to affect the whole relations
of the animal to its physical environment as it does in
plants.
