molecules of the water are free to move within
the column.
Of course, this condition of stress is propa-
gated throughout the water system from the
leaf back to the root. Water thus tends to
be withdrawn from the outer cells of the
root which abut on the ends of the conducting
tissues within, and in this way a continuous
flow is maintained from the root-hairs, which
in their turn are replenished from the supplies
of water contained in the soil. It comes to
be a balance of forces represented on the one
hand by those leading to the escape of water
vapour from the leaf, and on the other the
forces which tend to cause the water to be
retained by the soil plus the effects of friction,
etc., within the plant itself.
But, as a matter of fact, although the short
description given above probably represents
in a general way what goes on in connection
with the translocation of water in a plant, there
are other factors which are involved and may
affect the process.
The living parenchymatous cells of the
roots are not merely passive agents in the
matter, for the water absorbed from the
soil is in many plants (and perhaps in all)
forcibly pressed or excreted from these living
cells into the conducting channels. It is to
this active propulsion of water within the
plant that the phenomenon of bleeding is
due. When trees are felled in spring, sap
may continue for a long time to flow forcibly
