growth of individual cells, and hence the
shape of the colony as a whole. Doubtless
the elongated, narrow cylindrical form of
fungal hyphge is to be interpreted, in part
at any rate, as an expression of this fact-
Vegetative reproduction tends, in such forms,
to occur by the transverse fission of the
cylindrical growths; but, as we have already
seen, multiplicative processes are not identical
with those of growth, and both in the fungi
and in other lowly plants, nutrition sets other
processes in action which lead to the formation
of various sorts of specialised reproductive
cells. This does not, however, interfere with
the ordinary multiplication by fission, which
still remains as a common feature among them.
In the evolution of the more complex
plants, the cells — the primitive individuals —
become organised into a higher individuality.
The sense in which we use the term repro-
duction gradually and insensibly changes,
and we distinguish between cellular multipli-
cation and the reproduction of the multicellular
individual. We may still think of the multi-
plication of cells as reproduction in the
abstract, but our unit organism, so to speak,
has become transformed; it is no longer
identical with the isolated cell, but is repre-
sented by the cell colony. Reproduction in
such a colony, concretely considered, comes
then to signify the process by which, not new
cells only, but new colonies are started. It is
a change in the point of view.
