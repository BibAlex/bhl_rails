form, are generally called parenchymatous
cells (Fig. 11, WP). The wood parenchyma,
which largely serves the purpose of storage
(or occasionally as an excretory tissue) is very
often lignified. There are also other cells
which are specialised for mechanical purposes.
They are of various forms and sizes, and are
grouped into more or less definite tissue
systems. To the consideration of the latter
we shall return when we come to consider the
architecture and mechanics of the plant. For
the present, hoAvever, we are only concerned
with those tissues of the wood that are de-
tailed for the service of translocation of water.
The vessels and tracheids form a continuous
communicating system in the plant, and when
water enters this system it can readily be
transmitted from any one point to any other,
the direction of flow being determined by
purely physical conditions of pressure.
We can now endeavour to trace the passage
of water from the soil into the water-conduct-
ing tissue of the plants, and thence into the
leaves, to which most of the water that is
absorbed ultimately finds its way. The root-
hair is in close contact with the particles of
soil, and it not only absorbs water from it,
but it exerts a disintegrating influence on it
owing to the excretion of carbonic acid from
the living cell.
The absorption of water (which contains
very small quantities of salts in solution) by
the root-hairs is an active process, and it has to
