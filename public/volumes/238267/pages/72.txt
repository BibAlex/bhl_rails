strand, and some have the transverse walls
which separate the elongated eells of a row
perforated by small pores. These are the
sieve tubes, and mueh of the various food
substanees whieh reaeh the vaseular strands
passes through them. But it is probable that
sueh an easily diffusible substanee as sugar
passes as well through traets of other elon-
gated, but not so obviously perforated, eells
of the phloem. Be this as it may, it is
largely through the vaseular strands that the
sugars of the plant are carried away from
the regions where they are present in excess
to other regions where they are relatively
deficient. This occurs whether the deficiency
arises through the sugar being directly used
up in the chemical operations of the cells,
or whether the special conditions of the local
deposition of food reserves are such as to
produce a diffusion gradient, that is a steady
flow within the plant from a place of high to
one of lower concentration. It is well to
emphasise the limitation thus expressed in
the last sentence, for however readily sub-
stances may travel from one plant cell to
another, it is a very different thing if one
endeavours to get them to diffuse out of the
region of the living cells into a mass of sur-
rounding water, for example. Such attempts
commonly do not succeed unless the cell
protoplasm be first modified, as, for example,
by means of an anaesthetic or by some more
violent and lethal agent.
