near the tips of the fronds. The eggs and
sperms are extruded from the conceptacles
into the sea-water, and the sperms are soon
observed to be aetivcly swimming in all
directions. At first the eggs exercise no
influence upon them, but as the membranes, in
which they are at first enveloped, dissolve in
the water, the sperms are seen to cluster
around the eggs, and each egg becomes the
centre of a crowd of male gametes which
are endeavouring to gain entrance into its
substance. Presently one slips through the
peripheral limiting pellicle of the protoplasm
and gains the interior of the egg. It passes
rapidly through the cytoplasm and becomes
appressed to the egg-nucleus. In a few
seconds it swells up, and finally the two
nuclei, belonging to the egg and sperm
respectively, coalesce, and fertilisation is thus
achieved.
Now it is a remarkable fact that during
fertilisation only one sperm is required to
fertilise the relatively large egg. This is true
of animals as well as plants. Experiments
have clearly proved that normally only one
male cell can enter the egg at all, and that in
any case only one male nucleus fuses with the
egg nucleus. The study of seaweeds has
furnished a clue to the means by which the
entrance into the egg of but one of the crowd
of struggling sperms is effected. It has also
thrown light on some important features of
fertilisation itself.
