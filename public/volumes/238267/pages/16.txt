12 PLANT LIFE
complex phenomena of life are at once reduci-
ble to terms as simple as those which regulate
the reactions just indicated, and it is beyond
all doubt that much more refined investigation
than our present knowledge renders possible
will be needed ere we shall solve the ultimate
secrets of life, if indeed we ever are able to do
so. But we shall go far by employing the
methods which have already taught us so
much, methods which consist in exact ex-
periment and accurate analysis.
The principal reason why our knowledge
of the modus operandi of the living organism
is so largely lacking in precision lies just in
the vast range of the materials with which
we are there dealing, and in the consequent
difficulty of analysing the results of our experi-
ments sufficiently to be able to refer them
to their real causes.
But although it may not be possible as
yet to explain the great majority of the life
processes, either of animals or of plants, it
will soon be apparent that relatively simple
chemical and physical processes have pro-
foundly modified the course of evolution of
structure and form. This is more obvious,
perhaps, in plants than in animals, because
the retention of relatively simple mechanisms
in connection with the absorption of food
materials has kept the plant free from the
complications introduced by the development
of specialised locomotory activity, and the con-
comitant elaboration of a nervous system.
