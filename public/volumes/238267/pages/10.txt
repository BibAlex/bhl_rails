vi PREFACE
It is not impossible that some readers will
expect to find much that is absent from this
little book â€” but it seemed better to utilise
the space at my disposal by devoting it to
matter not so generally discussed in a volume
of this size, than to attempt to say again what
has already been well done in other works of
this scope.
In conclusion I wish to express my thanks
to Mr. Tabor and to Mr. Trowbridge for the
assistance they have kindly given me in the
preparation of nearly half the illustrations.
