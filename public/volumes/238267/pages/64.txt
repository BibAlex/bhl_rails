60 PLANT LIFE
swiftly flowing streams, the roots may ex-
hibit new and remarkable developments that
especially fit their possessors to occupy such
stations.
Let us inquire somewhat more closely as
to what are the special qualities, both of
general behaviour and anatomical structure,
which render a terrestrial life possible for
plants. If we select a concrete example of
a land plant, such as an oak tree, we observe
that there is a large branching top, covered
with leaves for part of the year. Below, this
crown passes into the trunk, and the latter
again ends in the branched root system under-
ground. The leaves are, of course, the fac-
tories in which the operation of food- making
is going on so long as they are exjDOScd to the
light. The roots are absorbing water from
the soil, and such salts as are dissolved in it,
whilst the trunk forms an intermediate con-
ducting region through which exchange be-
tween the substances in the root and the rest
of the tree can take place. The circulation
of materials in a plant is not really like the
circulation of the blood in animals, although
an analogy — largely a false one — is often
drawn between them, for there is no con-
tinuous circulating system in the oak tree
at all comparable with the arteries and veins
of the animal body. Nevertheless there is
a process of exchange, though arranged on
different lines, and serving quite different
ends. In order to grasp this clearly, it will
