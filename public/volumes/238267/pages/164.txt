conceivable device which has not been actually
put into practice by one or another of them.
But whatever be the particular nature of
the adaption in any given instance, its final
significance, and its ultimate justification, is
to be sought in the assistance it renders towards
the proper discharge of the photosynthetic
functions of the green surface.
Plants which contain no chlorophyll — and
there are vast numbers of them — have no
use for the varied complications that circum-
stances may render essential or ancillary to
the green members of the vegetable kingdom.
Indeed, it is not too much to say that all the
beauty of form, all the elaborate structure,
which is so copiously displayed by the vegeta-
tive organs of trees and plants generally,
spring from the possession of this substance
chlorophyll, with its wonderful power of
trapping and utilising the energy of the
sunlight.
But apart from all aesthetic considerations,
and regarding the matter solely from the
most material point of view, we may further
assert that the elaboration of chlorophyll
has been fraught with consequences to the
whole organic world compared with which
all the other structural products of evolu-
tionary change sink into insignificance and
obscurity.
