PLANTS AND WATER 133
may be incidental to the particular kind of
habitat in which a plant is growing. For
example, plants which live on bare rocks, or
on tree trunks, are evidently exposed in a
greater degree to intermittence in water
supply than those which are rooted in the
soil. We find that such lithophytic and epi-
phytic vegetation is especially rich in species
that exhibit wonderful adaptations to their
own particular environment, adaptations
which enable them successfully to cope with
the difficulties and disadvantages that so
obviously face them.
A somewhat wider survey of the water
problem as it affects vegetation generally,
shows that it is necessary to distinguish clearly
between that kind of drought w^hich is merely
physical, i. e. is due to actual scarcity of water,
and another kind which may be more properly
described as physiological. In the latter case
a plant, however favourably it may seem to
be situated so far as access to water is con-
cerned, may nevertheless be unable to absorb
it in sufficient quantity.
This may happen when the temperature
of the medium is too low; for the active
absorption by roots is only possible within
a rather narrow range of temperature, the
limits varying somewhat for different plants.
Or the water itself may contain substances
in solution which prejudicially affect the
exercise of the absorptive functions. Thus
the water of salt marshes, as well as that
