selves more or less intimately connected with
an abundant supply of nutrition.
The rapidity with which many of these
simple plants can multiply, provided the
nutrition conditions are favourable, is truly
astonishing. Instances are not uncommon,
especially among bacteria, in which a cell
colony will double its numbers every twenty
minutes or so. That is to say, in about
twelve hours one cell might give rise to nearly
seventy thousand million cells. It is highly
improbable that anything approaching this
number would actually be reached, because
as the colony begins to grow the individuals
composing it compete with each other for the
food supply, and those more centrally situated
will obviously be at a disadvantage in this
respect. Many other conditions, also de-
pending on the crowding of the cells, will
begin to make their effects felt on the repro-
ductive capacity of the members of different
portions of the colony.
Now what is true of a colony of detached
individuals is still more applicable as soon as
the dividing cells cease to separate at once
from each other. This naturally follows from
the simple geometrical fact that if the cells
are all growing and dividing equally and in
all directions, the surface of the cell colony
only increases as the square of the radius of
the growing spherical mass, whilst its mass
increases as the cube. The difference in
available nutrition evidently must affect the
