plant. Microscopic examination of a root
shows that they are permeated by fungal
hyphce, and careful experiments have proved
that it is through the intermediation of these
fungal threads that the saprophyte chiefly
obtains its food. It thus appears that the
term saprophyte is not a very happy one
as applied to a plant like Neottia. The
relation is rather more akin to parasitism,
and it is the fungus from which nourishment
is finally extorted. But inasmuch as the
root both houses the fungus, and also con-
tributes something towards its support, the
parasitism is not very one-sided, although
the final balance lies with the flowering plant.
This association of the root with a fungus
is a very intimate one in a large number
of instances, and it occurs in a very great
number of plants which would never be sus-
pected of parasitic habits. The fungus-root
is often called a mycorhiza, and it is worth
while to study it a little more closely.
The roots of many of our forest trees
produce few or no root-hairs. Instead of
this they are closely invested with a hairy
coating of fungal hyphse. Not only do these
hyphae ramify in the soil, but they also enter
the root itself. Sometimes, as in the pines,
they only pass between the cells, and do not
enter them, but in other cases, as for example
in orchids generally, they pierce the cell walls
and enter the living cells. In both of these
types of mycorhiza the fungus is doubtless
