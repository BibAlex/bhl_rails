THE PLANT AND ITS FOOD 21
of sunlight, which enables it to construct com-
plex carbon compounds when supplied with the
raw materials, carbon dioxide and water. In
other words, the chloroplast is a mechanism
which is able to build up carbon compounds
which are poorer in oxygen than are the raw
materials upon which it w^orks, and thus the
kinetic energy supplied by the sunlight be-
comes converted into the potential energy re-
presented by the chemical products which are
formed as the result of chloroplastid activity.
This energy (which w^as derived from the sun),
can again be released by oxidation, that is
by more or less rapidly burning those products.
It may then be utilised to heat a furnace, to
drive a steam engine, or to maintain the bodily
processes of a man.
This property of the chloroplast is of funda-
mental importance, not only for the plant,
but for animals as well, for every animal is
directly or indirectly nourished by vegetable
products, which form the starting-point of the
food-supply of the w^orld. In the absence of
chlorophyll there would be none of the higher
plants as w^e know them, nor would there, in
all probability, be any of the higher animals
at all. In this sense we are indeed all children
may be termed a syncytium. It must be borne in mind
that the membrane is not an essential feature of cells,
although in plants, as stated in the text, it is of very general
occurrence. The cell contains other bodies, e. g. chloro-
plasts, starch, oils, etc., but these are non-essential, and
are often absent.
