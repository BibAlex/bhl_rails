CLBIBING AND WATER PLANTS 113
these anomalies are of obvious advantage
to a climber, and are calculated to minimise
risk of damage to the conducting channels
of the stem under the special circumstances
of their habit of life. The main stem is
sometimes lobed, and it may ultimately even
split into a rope-like mass of cordage. Or
it may be flattened and wavy in contour,
a character obviously associated with con-
siderable resilience. Again, the soft phloem
is frequently embedded amongst the woody
tissues, and is thus shielded from injury
such as might arise through torsion of the
stem, and in other ways.
But it is not true that every specialised
climber is provided with a special or anomalous
stem structure, nor are these abnormalities
confined to climbing plants. The facts seem
to indicate that the anomalies in question
are to be regarded as instances of a break
away from traditional structure, that they
owe their origin primarily at least to the
inner constitution of the living substance of
the plants in which they arise. They may
be regarded as one of the expressions of
inherent tendency to vary which in dominant
groups of plants is seen in a multiplication
of related species. Any such break away
from the type form of structure may prove
useful in enabling a plant to develop new
functions, or more perfectly to discharge
nascent ones. And there are a very large
number of instances, of the most varied
