20 PLANT LIFE
with food materials, it multiplies rapidly.
When an individual has reached a certahi
size it divides into two, and this process being
repeated in the various individuals of a colony
the Pleurococcus spreads rapidly over the
surface of the damp wood. Furthermore,
the individual plants withstand desiccation
without dying, and in this condition they are
carried by currents of air to fresh spots where
new colonies can be started.
But to return to Chlamydomonas. Its
second feature of importance, from our present
point of view, consists in its greenness.
As we have seen, the green colouring matter,
or chlorophyll, is not diffused through the whole
protoplasm, but is restricted to one or more
(in this plant, one) definite and specialised
masses or corpuscles, each of which constitutes
a chloroplast. The part which the chloroplast
plays in the cell ^ is that of utilising the energy
* Cell. â€” This is the term commonly used to denote the
unit of a living organism, though, unfortimately, it is
not always used in the same sense by different wiiters.
In this book it will be taken to denote a mass of protoplasrn
(whether enclosed in a cellulose membrane or not) which
is dominated by a single nucleus. This protoplasmic mass
is commonly, but not necessarily, separated by a cell
membrane from other similar ones in the cell -aggregates
which together constitute the bodies of larger plants.
A plant may thus consist of (1) a single cell ; (2) a number
of coherent cells, each more or less delimited from the
rest by a membranous envelope or partition wall; (3) a
number of coalescent cells, consisting of protoplasmic
units, each containing one nucleus, but the units iwt
separated from each other by cell walls. Such a cell colony
