244 PLANT LIFE
plant does the same, but the subsidiary
events that have happened during its evolu-
tion obscure its record. However, we find
two kinds of sporangia, one commonly
grouped in a cluster of two or four, and form-
ing the so-called pollen sacs borne on each
of the stamens. The pollen sacs produce the
spores or pollen grains in much the same
way as the spores are formed in a fern. But
the other sort of sporangium is less easily
recognised (Fig. 28). It is often known as an
ovule, and the ovules are situated inside a
closed cavity called the ovary, w^hich forms
the lower part of the pistil of the flower.
Each ovule (or sporangium) usually contains
but one spore, and this is not, like the pollen
grain, thrown out of the sporangium, but
germinates inside it, and produces an egg as
well as a number of other cells. Moreover,
the sporangium is retained w^ithin the ovary,
and hence the methods of fertilisation which
are appropriate for a fern would clearly be
impossible here. As a matter of fact, the
pollen grain, i. e. the spore from which the
male gamete will be derived, has to be brought
into special relation with that part of the
flower in which the ovule is situated. At the
summit of the ovary there is a specialised
structure called the stigma. This is often
viscid just when the ovules are mature, and
thus any pollen w^hich falls on to the stigma
is retained.
The pollen grain or spore already contains
