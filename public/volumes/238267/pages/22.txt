18 PLANT LIFE
and nutriment the Chlamydomonas plant
rapidly multiplies in a vegetative or non-
sexual manner. This is brought about by
the division of the protoplasmic contents,
within the membrane, into a number of
smaller lumps, each of which becomes a small
image of the original parent. They are
commonly two, four, or eight in number, and
finally escape from the ruptured membrane of
the mother cell into the surrounding water
w^here they grow, and may give rise in their
turn to new individuals.
Now such a plant as Chlamydomonas is
relatively very simple, and yet it already
exhibits the most striking characters that
distinguish the majority of plants.
In the first place its living substance is
enclosed in a membrane, and in the second
its protoplasm contains a green chloroplast.
In order to grow it must clearly obtain food,
but the presence of a membrane precludes
it from acquiring any except such as is already
dissolved in the water. No solid particles
can pass the membrane and so reach the
protoplasm, but water and substances dis-
solved in it will readily do so. The whole
of the mineral food substances, and such
gases as oxygen and carbon dioxide, reach
the protoplasm in this, and only in this way.
But this external membrane not only
limits the nature of the food-supply, but as
the size and complexity of the body increase,
it continues more and more to restrict the kind
