SEXUAL REPRODUCTION
Sexual reproduction occurs in almost all
the divisions of the animal and vegetable
kingdoms, although it has not as yet been
detected in some of the lower groups. These
consist either of organisms of extreme sim-
plicity, or of those in which we have grounds
for believing that sexuality has been lost,
probably in connection with special conditions
of nutrition. In some of the higher plants
the sexual function has degenerated, though
we cannot clearly trace the loss to any definite
cause.
The most striking peculiarity connected
with sexual reproduction, next to its almost
universal occurrence, lies in its remarkably
complex character. Moreover, its effects on
the development of the vegetable kingdom
have been extremely far-reaching, and have
profoundly influenced the direction of evolu-
tionary progress, as interpreted by a study
of the life-history of the plants themselves.
The sexual act itself stands in strong
antithesis to vegetative propagation, for it
does not directly involve an increase, but a
reduction in the number of cells. Two cells.
