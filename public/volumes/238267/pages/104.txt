may be allowed, it does not seem to matter
mueh how it is disposed.
Every one must have notieed that the great
majority of our shrubs and branehing trees
increase in girth as they get older. This in-
crease is produced by a specially active layer
of embryonic tissue known as cambium
(Fig. lie), which forms a cylindrical sheet of
cells situated at the outer limit of the wood,
which it thus completely encloses. By the
active division of this cambium the cylinder
or zone of young cell tissue is temporarily
rendered thicker every year, and then the
layers of cells which abut on the existing
wood are themselves differentiated into xylem,
to form the new annual ring of wood which
is added every year to the wood of the trunk.
A few of the outermost layers of the cylinder
are similarly transformed into bast or phloem,
and only a thin cell layer now remains as
a cylindrical sheet of cambium which still
continues to separate the wood and bast.
Next year this again increases in thickness,
and the new layers thus produced go through
the same changes as before.
In this way the annual rings of wood are
produced which are seen when tree trunks
are sawn across. It is due to the still un-
differentiated and relatively thick sheet of
young cells produced every spring that the
bark is so easily separated from the
wood at this season. For the walls are thin
and the cells are rich in protoplasm and cell
