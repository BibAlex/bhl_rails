CELLULAR STRUCTURE 37
The group of algae to which belongs the
green sea-lettuce, so common on some of our
coasts, especially where the sea-water is con-
taminated by sewage cfllucnts, furnishes
beautiful examples of the simpler stages in
the evolution of a flattened leaf-like type of
thallus, Ulva, the sea-lettuce in question
(Fig. 3), is somewhat advanced, for it consists
of cells which are arranged in two layers, but
otherwise division occurs in the cells of each
layer in such a way as to increase the area of
the surface. The multiplication of cells is not
very uniform over the whole surface, those
nearer the margins dividing and growing
faster than those nearer the middle line of
the leaf-like plant. Thus the surface of the
frond is thrown into folds and wrinkles as
the necessary consequence of this unequal
growth But that there is some co-ordinating
influence at work amongst the cells is shown
by theiact that this wrinkling does not become
excessive, and the plants assume a fairly defi-
nite form which makes any given individual
easy to recognise as belonging to this and no
other species. The Ulva plants are securely
anchored to stones and other supports by
a special development of the cells near the
base of the plant. These grow out into long
filamentous strands, and adhere very closely
to the surface of the rock. The specimens
one often sees washed up after a storm tare
usually the upper parts of the plants, which
have become torn off by the waves.
