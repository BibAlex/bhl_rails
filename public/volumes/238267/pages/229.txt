in the egg, and that the fusion of the two
nuclei is an essential part of the whole
proeess.
The result of fertilisation is invariably to
start a series of chemieal changes in the egg.
The first of these changes commonly results
in the secretion of a membrane over its outer
surface, and then a period of quiescence
usually intervenes before any further visible
development begins. After the lapse of a
certain time, which may vary within rather
wide limits, the fertilised Qgg commences to
develop.
The lines along which development proceeds
differ greatly in different groups of plants.
In the simpler ones, such as Chlamydomonas,
no apparent growth takes place, but the
zygote divides, giving rise to a number of
separate cells which escape as zoospores from
the zygote membrane, and finally grow into
as many different individuals. A somewhat
similar course is pursued by many other algae,
but in some of them the production of motile
zoospores is postponed until after an embryo,
composed of a larger or smaller number of cells,
has been formed.
In the higher plants, from the mosses
upwards, the zygote gives rise to a plant
quite unlike that from which the gametes
were produced. This plant forms repro-
ductive bodies known as spores, and when
the spores in their turn germinate, they
give rise to another very dissimilar cellular
