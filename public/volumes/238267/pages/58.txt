54 PLANT LIFE
photosynthesis; whilst it has overcome the
disabiUties apparently inherent in its type
of organisation, by strengthening and cement-
ing together the branching filaments, of which
it is built up, by means of the calcium car-
bonate which it withdraws from the sea-water.
The consideration of the noncellular or
syncytial plant has been introduced in order
to illustrate the varieties of one possible
type of structure. Save, however, for the
production of a few aquatic representatives
it does not mark a line of important advance.
The multicellular condition contained within
itself the promise of the future, and it is as
multicellular organisms that the higher plants
have been evolved.
It will be useful at this point to sum up the
salient points of the preceding discussion,
so as to gain a clear starting-point from which
to study the evolution and modification of
form and structure in the higher terrestrial
forms of life.
We have seen the striking consequences
which accrue from the possession of an invest-
ing membrane in their effects upon the mode of
nutrition, and indirectly upon other functions,
e. g, that of motility, in plants. We have learnt
in the relatively lowly members of the vege-
table kingdom which have been passed under
review, why a need for the presentation of
the green surfaces to light should be a matter
of such cardinal importance as to dominate
the organisation of every one of them. We
