168 PLANT LIFE
breaking up of the complex substances
constituting the dead bodies of other organ-
isms into simpler chemical compounds, and
sometimes even into their elements. They
utilise a certain amount of the energy thus
finally set free in building up the materials
of which their own bodies are constructed,
but the proportion of matter (and of energy
too) thus locked up again is extremely small
when compared with that which has been
liberated in the process.
Regarded from this standpoint the sun is
seen to be the very fountain of life and power.
The complex materials which jostle each other
as they are borne down the stream of life
break down here, provide the power for
synthesis there, but on the whole are ever
losing more of their energy, for some is
continually dissipated as heat. Many of the
useless molecular fragments which drift out
of the stream of life are presently caught up
again at the fountain-head, the chlorophyll
machinery driven by the solar energy once
more draws them into the mill, there they
are broken up, are compounded with other
ingredients, and the whole turned out once
more as energy-containing carbohydrate.
Again the compounded matter re-enters the
stream of life, to part, little by little, with
the energy it contains. Some is destined to
reappear in vital units of almost infinite
complexity, the rest is utilised or lost in
various ways, and the broken and buffeted
