122 PLANT LIFE
the water plants consists in the degenerate
character of the wood. This poverty in
water-conducting tissue is, however, chiefly
to be seen in the parts which have elongated.
The nodes, whence the leaves arise, often
exhibit quite a considerable amount of vessels
and tracheids. These parts of the stem,
which do not elongate, are in sharp contrast
to the internodes, in which practically all the
growth in length of a stem takes place. In
the internodes the wood is often merely
rudimentary, and it may be absent alto-
gether. On the other hand, the phloem, in
which the organic substances mainly travel,
is usually as well developed as in a land plant,
and sometimes even better, relatively speaking.
As regards the mechanical tissues, aquatics
are specially interesting. They are Â» almost
of the same specific gravity as the water, and
when the air-spaces are taken into account
they are usually much lighter. Consequently,
arrangements for providing the mechanical
condition of support are unnecessary and
would be wasteful. The only serious me-
chanical requirements are those adapted to
prevent the plants growing in swift torrents
being torn asunder by the force of the current.
We find that, on the whole, the mechanical
tissue, when present, and also the vascular
strands, tend to occupy an axile position.
This is especially advantageous for the latter,
as the bending and waving movement of the
flexible stems will naturally cause the mini-
