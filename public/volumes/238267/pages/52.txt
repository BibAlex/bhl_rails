48 PLANT LIFE
directly illuminated cells which take an
active share in photosynthesis. What is the
use, then, of those vast numbers of internal
cells which lie beneath the outer surface of
a large seaweed, and constitute its main
bulk ? Let us examine one of the big sea-
weeds, for example Laminaria, wiiich form
the large leathery strap -like plants growing
below the tide limits. We shall find it
consists of a stout stalk, firmly adhering by
a specialised base to the rocks, and thinning
out abruptly above to form the flattened
frond. The cells which compose the plant
are by no means all alike, and at least three
different kinds can be distinguished. First
there are the crowded, rather small ones,
forming the superficial layers. These are
those chiefly concerned in photosynthesis.
Beneath the outer layers are other cells,
larger and more irregular in shape. These
are, partly at least, concerned in storing up
the surplus products of photosynthesis.
Thirdly, in the more central regions of the
massive stalk are to be found strands of
very much elongated cells which clearly serve
as conducting elements. In some of the larger
seaweeds the cross partition walls between
these cells are visibly perforated, thus admit-
ting of still easier passage of soluble contents
along their course. Some of these large
brown seaweeds recall the habit of our
terrestrial plants in that they even throw
off their leafy portions periodically, and
