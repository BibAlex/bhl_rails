CELLS AND THE ORGANISM 47
instances connecting strands of protoplasm
have been demonstrated, and these serve as
the obvious channels of direct communication
between the living contents of adjacent cells.
When the interchange has been sullicicntly
interrupted the old order cannot be again
restored. The cells are released, as it were,
from the influence that previously controlled
them and caused them to be welded together
into a higher individuality. Each cell, thus
breaking away from the union, reverts to
a more primitive condition, recovering an
independence akin to, and perhaps identical
with, that which distinguishes zoospores
and other reproductive cells that are set
free from the organism which gives them
birth.
Although the simpler filamentous algae,
and especially the branching kinds, share with
the primitive flattened leaf-like types the
advantage of disposing their surfaces so as
to make the most of the means of illumin-
ation, they yet remain far behind the more
advanced types, in which other functions
beside those of photosynthesis press for
notice.
The larger seaweeds, although their green
colour is masked by yellow or red pigment,
are as dependent on light for the manu-
facture of their food as are their simpler
green companions. But their size introduces
an element of physiological complexity.
It will be remembered that it is only the
