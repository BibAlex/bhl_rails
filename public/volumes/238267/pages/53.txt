the base of the expanded frond.
CHAPTER V
THE NON-CELLULAR TYPE OF
ORGANISATION
In the series of plants hitherto considered
we have been mainly concerned in tracing
certain lines of evolution in form and structure,
accompanied by a corresponding differentia-
tion and specialisation, amongst the cells of
which the bodies of the plants are constructed.
These culminate in such forms as the higher
red and brown seaweeds in which the char-
acter of leafy plants is very closely imitated,
save in one important respect. The terrestrial
plant, unlike the submerged seaweed, is
exposed to difficulties connected with the
water supply, and, as we shall subsequently
see, this has necessitated structural and other
developments far in advance of those ex-
hibited by aquatic plants. Indeed, a high
