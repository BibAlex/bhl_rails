THE NON-CELLULAR TYPE 53
The whole is strongly impregnated with a
deposit of lime, whereby the plant aequires
a considerable degree of strength and
rigidity. The remarkable caetus- or opuntia-
hke form is produced by a wonderful weaving
together of the branching filaments of which
the whole plant is made up. There are no
traces of cross walls in these tubular branches,
but there is a considerable difference between
the different regions of the branches them-
selves. The lower part of each branch
system runs down the centre of the plant,
while the final short twigs form the outer
surface of the flattened segments. These
final branchlets are closely adherent, and the
flattened segment of the plant, looked at
from the outside, seems to be clothed with
a mosaic of small cells â€” these being, of course,
the tips of the branches just mentioned.
Not only this, but the chlorophyll is almost
entirely confined to these peripheral branch-
lets, whilst the hinder and wider parts of the
tubes serve to store and distribute the food
material manufactured in the tips when
exposed to light.
Halimeda, then, furnishes a wonderful
example of co-ordinated growth. The singular
completeness with which it has solved the
problem of attaining a very high degree of
specialisation with the simplest materials,
extends to every detail of its structure. It
is admirably adapted, both to utilise the light
and to store away the material products of
