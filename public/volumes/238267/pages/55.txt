THE NON-CELLULAR TYPE 51
simplicity, is furnished by the seaweed known
as C aider pa StaliUi. As is shown by the
annexed illustration, the plant consists of
a creeping stem from which arise the erect
leafy expansions ; while the whole is anchored
by root-like structures which penetrate, or
adhere to, the substratum. In spite of this
high degree of external differentiation, there
is no internal partitioning, and no one of the
vast number of nucleated protoplasts, which
together make up the living substance, is
segregated physically from its neighbours by
ob\ ious boundaries. But there is one signifi-
cant and interesting feature about the dis-
tribution of the nuclei in the protoplasm.
They are crowded at the growing points,
and are more widely spaced asunder in the
older regions. In this apparently trivial
circumstance we can discern exactly the
same arrangement as would have been ob-
served had the partitioning walls been actually
present, for the dividing cells in the growing
points always appear to be both numerous
and small, owing, of course, to the rapid
cell division which is going on in such regions.
Now this non-cellular or syncytial
(see p. 21) type of organisation entails
certain obvious disadvantages on its possessor,
but we find that in some instances the at-
tendant risks have been overcome in a
wonderful way. On coral reefs and similar
calcareous stations an alga known as Halimeda
Opuntia is sometimes found (Fig. 8). It resem-
