82 PLANT LIFE
required to leave about 1 % in coarse sand.
These experiments are of great value in
enabling us to see the way to attaek many
problems of plant and soil relations, and they
show that the notion that the plant has forcibly
to wrest the water from the soil is a fairly
accurate one.
How, then, does the root-hair do this ?
What force can it exercise in the process ?
Experiments show that a plant cell will,
in general, absorb and retain water with
considerable avidity. This it does by means
of the so-called osmotic pressure exerted within
it by various substances, such as sugar,
organic acids, and the like, which are dissolved
in the watery sap within the cell. For whereas
water can pass freely in and out of the cell,
the protoplasm either does not allow the
dissolved substances to pass out, or it only
lets them through very slowly. Without
going at all fully into the difficult and complex
subject of osmotic pressure in general, it may
be remarked that, under these circumstances,
water tends to flow into the cell and to such
an extent that the cell sap exerts a very
considerable pressure. This may easily
reach a value equivalent to about eleven
atmospheres. It is this circumstance which
at least partly accounts for absorption of
water from even relatively dry soil by the
root-hairs, to make good that which is
lost from other parts of the plant. For, as
already explained, the parts of the plant above
