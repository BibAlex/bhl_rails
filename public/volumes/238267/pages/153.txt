CHAPTER XIII
THE EPIPHYTES
Hitherto we have chiefly considered the
relation of vegetation to an exiguous water
supply rather from the point of view of par-
simony. A short or precarious supply is
met by reducing the output, hoarding the
precious liquid, or living an abstemious life.
But other plants have shown greater powers
of invention, so to speak, in overcoming
the difficulties of life. They have countered
intermittence by the construction of more or
less ample cisterns, and they have developed
new methods by which the available water is
absorbed. These modifications of structure
have rendered existence possible, and even
easy, in many situations from which ordinary
plants are debarred from establishing them-
selves. Perhaps the best examples of this
inventive resourcefulness are to be met with
amongst the plants that have exchanged a
terrestrial for an arboreal habitat. Such
plants are generally called epiphytes. They
are in no sense necessarily parasitic^ that is
to say they do not tax their host for food.
All they demand from the trees is the space
whereon to grow.
