wheat) with albumen or endosperm. It
is a very remarkable faet, this seeond fusion.
The sperm nueleus whieh takes part in it is
the sister nueleus of that sperm whieh fuses
with the egg. Henee it might be expected
that it would carry paternal characters, and
that these might make themselves felt in
the nature of the endosperm to which the
triplicate nueleus gives rise. It turns out
that the expectation is realised, and where
the endosperms of the pollen parent and the
seed parent differ in a well-defined character,
â‚¬. g. in colour or sugar contents, the char-
acter imported by the sperm from the pollen
may dominate the whole endosperm. Thus,
when pollen grains of different varieties of
Indian Corn are blown on to a female ear,
the endosperm of some of the grains will be
found to be affected by the characters borne
by the strange pollen. And it is just these
identical grains that will betray evidence of
hybrid characters in the embryo which each
of them contains. For the same pollen grain
provided both the sperm for fertilising the
egg, and also the second sperm which formed
part of the triplicate combination from which
the endosperm originates.
When fertilisation has been accomplished,
remarkable changes are produced, not only
within the ovule, but outside it as well.
Within, the endosperm arises, by the re-
peated division of the triplicate nucleus as
already explained, while at the upper end
