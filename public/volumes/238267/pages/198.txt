phytes, and it is reasonable to conclude that
the loss of the green leaves and all the
structural change consequent on their abor-
tion is directly connected with the growing
ability of the saprophytic plants to develop
the physiological faculty of utilising the
resources thus rendered available. They
come more and more to depend exclusively
on the nutritive processes of fungi, not only
for their carbohydrate kind of food but for
the still more complex nitrogenous nutriment
as well. Of course, the decaying leaves and
other vegetable matter in the soil maintain
a plentiful and practically continuous supply
of carbonaceous food which is constantly at
the disposal of those organisms which are
adapted to make use of it. There is little
doubt also that during the decomposition
of the carbonaceous humus free nitrogen is
sometimes forced into combination with other
elements, either by micro-organisms, or myco-
rhiza, or both, and so is rendered available
for the higher plants.
This way of looking at the matter fits in
with the very remarkable nutritive processes
so characteristic of the leguminous plants of
which the peas and clovers are representative
examples. If one of these plants be dug up
(Fig. 22), its roots will be seen to bear nodular,
or wart-like, swellings. These swellings are
due to luxuriant growth of the tissues of the
cortex or rind. Examined microscopically the
cells are found to contain enormous numbers of
