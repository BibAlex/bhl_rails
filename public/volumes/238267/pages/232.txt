same time the chromatin increases in quan-
tity. Stains of various kinds show that the
chromatin -containing strands are, as it
were, becoming individuahsed within the nu-
cleus, although anastomoses between adjacent
strands are still of common occurrence. As
the strands continue to differentiate, the
chromatin is seen to form two parallel streaks
in the convoluted linin bands, but this duplex
appearance becomes temporarily obscured,
though not obliterated, at a somewhat later
stage. Each one of these duplex chro matin-
containing linin bodies is a chromosome (Fig. 26).
When fully formed, the chromosomes assume
the form of rods, hooks, etc. The most strik-
ing point about the chromosomes lies in
the fact that their number is normally quite
constant for a particular species of plant.
The chromosomes become clustered in a
very characteristic position, and form a zone
or plate across the centre of the nucleus ; but
preceding this arrangement, and intimately
connected with it, a remarkable spindle-shaped
structure arises in the extra-nuclear proto-
plasm (cytoplasm). It is made up of fibres
which are ultimately arranged in very much
the same curves as iron filings take up when
scattered on a piece of paper under w4iich lie
the poles of a horseshoe magnet. The spindle-
like structure extends across the space origin-
ally occupied by the nucleus, while the wall
of the latter usually (but not alw^ays) dis-
appears, and the only nuclear structure that
