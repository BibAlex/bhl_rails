FUNGAL PARASITES 177
plant. The hyphae secrete a poison wliich
kills the cells in advance of its track, and thus
the fungus succeeds in completely destroying
the plant. Critically regarded, the change
from saprophytism to parasitism in this
instance is a somewhat imperfect one because
the fungus, inasmuch as it kills in advance,
is really living on dead tissues. But it shares
this property with the majority of the de-
structive parasites. It is only the more
specialised forms that tax but do not destroy.
It represents a transitional phase, and one of
interest, inasmuch as it shows how appropriate
nourishment may accelerate, and increase
to an effective degree, physiological powers
already present, but normally inadequate,
for purposes of direct application.
As regards the susceptibility of the host
plant to fungal attacks, it is a matter of the
commonest experience that some individuals
of a race are more liable to contract disease
from these causes than others. Every year
sees the introduction of new varieties of
potatoes which are claimed to be immune
towards the disease (Phytophthora) that often
does so much damage to the crop. Sometimes
these varieties are resistant in certain districts
and less so in others, and it may happen that
their immunity gradually disappears after
some years of cultivation. It is evident, then,
that immunity in such instances is not a
simple matter. Whilst it may partially depend
on those properties which together make up
