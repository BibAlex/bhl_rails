FLOWERING PARASITES 187
to germinate unless they happen to lie in
close proximity to the host of a plant whieh
they can successfully attack. This striking
peculiarity enables us to appreciate some-
thing of the remarkable qualities which
render so specialised a parasitic habit feasible
at all. For the parasite has evidently become
sensitive to the presence of a definite sub-
stance which emanates from the host-root.
The seed is then stimulated, and it awakes
from its dormant condition. It germinates
and its roots immediately grow towards,
and penetrate, the plant from which it will
ultimately draw practically the whole of its
food.
A further state of simplification of vege-
tative structure is exhibited by Rafflesia
Arnoldii, which is in many respects perhaps the
most wonderful of all living flowering plants.
It occurs in the Eastern tropics, and it pro-
duces the largest flower known, for it may
attain to as much as a yard in diameter.
The rafflesias are mostly parasitic on vine-
like climbers (Cissus), and they pass their
vegetative life entirely within the com-
paratively slender stems of their hosts. In
this stage Rafflesia is extremely simple in
structure, and indeed it resembles colourless
fungal hyphae more than anything else.
The filamentous cells branch through the tis-
sues of their host, and it is only when the
period of flowering draws near that the para-
site gives any sign of what is about to issue
