ROOTS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS 77
xylem which are concerned with translocation
of water. The walls are thickened, but nearly
always show thin spots or pits. These are
of special use inasmuch as the water from
one tracheid can more easily and rapidly pass
through a thin than a thick membrane. Now
there are considerable variations of pressure
conditions in these conducting channels, and
an unprotected thin membrane would stand
a good chance of becoming ruptured. The
risk is obviated by a partial roofing over the
thin spots by the thickened parts of the walls,
which gives the pits a curious appearance
under the microscope, and has caused them
to be known generally as bordered pits.
Pits of this kind are, as we might now antici-
pate, of almost universal occurrence in water-
conducting tissue. They are more easily seen
in some woods than others, and perhaps in
none better than in a bit of deal or pine wood
(Fig. 12).
A striking character of these conducting
tracheids and vessels lies in the absence of
living protoplasm from them. All functional
tracheids and vessels are therefore merely
the dead skeletons of once living cells. The
protoplasm disappears from them as soon as
the thickening and lignification of the walls
is complete. It is good that this should be
so, for the presence of viscous protoplasm
within the channels would greatly impede the
flow of water through them.
In addition to the conducting tracheids and
