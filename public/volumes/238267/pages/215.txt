VEGETATIVE REPRODUCTION 211
portions grow up into plants like those from
which they have themselves been derived.
From simple beginnings the propagative
bodies advance in complexity, and other
structures, not in the first instance differenti-
ated as propagative bodies (e. g. thickened
stems in which food is stored), easily assume
this function of vegetative reproduction.
One may often trace the stages by which
this is brought about within the limits of a
group of closely related species. The Jerusa-
lem Artichoke, a sort of simflower, is connected
by all imaginable transitions with other
species in which the underground stems have
not yet proceeded to form tubers (as in the
artichoke), but exist as mere whip-like runners
which turn up and only grow to new plants
by the slow and accidental process of rotting
off their connection with the parent plant.
In others the propagative character is still
less evident, and the storage function is
absent altogether. Finally, there are many
sunflowers which normally fail to produce
any underground runners at all.
Thus, in spite of the endless variety in the
carrying out of the process, the essential
character of vegetative propagation is really
a simple one. In this respect it stands in
marked contrast to the other, the sexual,
reproductive process, which will form the
subject of the next chapter.
