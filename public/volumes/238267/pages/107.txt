MECHANICAL PROBLEIMS 103
large arms of the trees have snapped, because
the mechanical tissues have proved inadequate
to meet the unusual demands thus thrown
upon them.
When we compare the mechanical arrange-
ments of the root system of a plant with those
affecting its aerial portions, we are at once
confronted by a new set of factors. There are
two sets of conditions which largely control
and limit the possible lines of variation in the
mechanical structure of roots. One of these
concerns the apical growth of the organ as
it burrows through the soil, the other relates
to the pull exerted on the root system by
the swaying of the parts above ground
when they are fretten with the gusts of
heaven.
As regards the growing points of the roots,
the means for pushing forward in the soil is
at the same time extremely simple and most
effective. Unlike the stem, the actually
elongating portion of the root is situated
a very short distance behind the conical
apex, and lies just in front of the zone of
root-hairs already described (p. 73). The
latter affords a sort of support which holds
this part of the root immovable, whilst the
turgid cells of the very short growing region,
as they expand in growth, drive the smooth
conical tip resistlessly forward. If the growing
region were a long one, as it is in the stem,
there would be an imminent risk of buckling,
as may be easily understood if we consider
