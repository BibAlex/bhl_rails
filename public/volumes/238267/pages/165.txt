THE FUNGI 161
CHAPTER XIV
THE FUNGI
We may now turn our attention to a very
different type of vegetation, the members
of wliich are wholly, or almost wholly, lacking
in chlorophyll. The fungi and bacteria are
typical representatives of these non-green
organisms, but a certain number of the
higher flowering plants have also departed
from the way of their ancestors, and have
lost their green colour. It is a significant
fact, which strikes us at the very outset, that
every one of these colourless flowering plants
live on ready-formed organic matter derived
either from dead or still living organisms.
As a class, the plants which lack chlorophyll
are distinguished by the relatively simple
structure of their vegetative organs, although
their reproductive organs may, on the other
hand, be very complex. For example, the
somewhat elaborate objects popularly known
as fungi are not the vegetative bodies of
the fungi at all, but only their fructifications.
Flowering plants which have adopted the
non-chlorophyll habit similarly tend to be-
come greatly modified in everything except
their reproductive organs â€” the flowers and
