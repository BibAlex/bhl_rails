FUNGAL PARASITES 181
there are a number of species in Britain, are
liable to the attacks of a parasitic rust fungus
known as Puccinia dispcrsa. Now when the
parasite has been growing for a while on one
species of brome, it loses the power of infecting
some of the others. And yet the puccinia
is found flourishing on these apparently
resistant species also. The clue to the puzzle
lies in the fact that although the puccinia
thus develops races which preferably
attack single species of brome, they can be
induced to recover their powers of infecting
others by the simple device of cultivating
them on other species which are only inter-
mediate in their powers of resistance. Thus
a race w^hich will thrive on a species A, but
cannot attack another species C, will never-
theless recover the power of doing so if it be
growTi on a third species B. This remarkable
occurrence of bridging species of plants is
of obvious importance in connection w^ith the
sudden appearance of parasitic epidemics.
It is not confined to the rust fungus, but is
known to extend to others ; amongst them is
Erysiphe graminis, wliich also infests the
brome grasses
