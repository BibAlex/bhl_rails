same tendency in a still more advanced degree.
Only a few of the earliest leaves on the seed-
ling exhibit a blade, all the succeeding ones
having flattened petioles only.
More often, however, it is the stem which
undergoes modification and develops leaf-
like characters. When only certain branches
become specialised in this way, as in species
of Butchers Broom (Ruscus), it may require
careful examination to detect the cauline
nature of the apparent leaves. But the
genuine leaves are really present, and although
they are reduced to small brown scales, they
suffice to indicate the true condition in this
as in other extreme examples.
A still more remarkable modification is
seen when the roots assume the functions
of green leaves. An instance of this is fur-
nished by the genus of epiphytic orchids known
as Taeniophyllum (Fig. 18). These orchids,
which possess very inconspicuous flowers, are
also destitute of foliage leaves. But the
function of photosynthesis is discharged by
the green, band- or tape-like roots which are
appressed to the bark of the trees upon which
the plants are growing. In some species
the roots are very long, and hang freely from
the tree trunk, when their resemblance to
narrow strap-shaped leaves becomes addition-
ally striking.
It often happens that new structural modifi-
cations — adaptations in the making, as it were
— respond to the influence of the stimulus
