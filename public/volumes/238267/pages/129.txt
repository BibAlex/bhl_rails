that it is only an apparent, and not a real
risk. The fact is, the veins form a beautiful
system of unions or anastomoses, and these
are often arranged in a series of arehes whieh
pass just under the indentations charaeteristie
of the leaf margins of so many plants.
There are certain exceptions, however, to
the general rule that leaf construction is
adapted to prevent tearing. All palms have
leaves which are primarily undivided. But
by complicated processes which result in the
dying out of strips of leaf tissue extending
from the midrib to the margin, the leaf
surface as a whole may be broken up into
strips resembling pinnae or leaflets. This
occurs in the Coco-nut, and many other
palms. These leaflets are very different
from the true leaflets of a vetch and most
other plants, where they arise as the result
of a true process of branching. The so-called
fan-leaved palms have leaves in which there
is no great elongation of the midrib, and
the pleated or concertina-like folding represent
the imperfect separation of the leaflet
which is only completely carried out in forms
like the Coco-nut, Areca, and other pinnate-
leaved species.
The Banana plant is especially interesting
in this connection, for it is provided by
nature with a leaf quite unsuitable for a
plant growing in any but the most sheltered
situations. The banana plant consists of a
thick herbaceous axis, sheathed by the bases
