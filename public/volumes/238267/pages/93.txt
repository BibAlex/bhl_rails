FUNCTION AND FORM 89
position as regards the source of light, would
be as useless as a heavily shaded one. More-
over, with the increase of the leaves the
mechanical requirements vitally affect the
whole subsidiary apparatus of the plant. The
root is concerned in this no less than the stem,
for the leaf depends for the proper discharge
of its functions on an adequate degree of
fixity on the part of the plant as a whole.
Another factor which materially influences
the foliar organs of a plant, lies in the
water supply, for if this be deficient or
precarious, the leaf area must either be
correspondingly reduced, or there must be
found some means of checking the loss of
water, or else the difficulty must be met in
yet other ways. The particular form of solu-
tion of the water problem which happens to
be adopted by any given plant is a matter
that will mainly depend, as already pointed
out, on its own inherent constitution.
It is worth while to endeavour to follow out
some of the numerous and diverse ways by
which those problems relating especially to
mechanical needs and to water supply have
been solved by various sorts of plants. Not
only shall we encounter remarkable examples
of adaptedness to special conditions, but we
shall incidentally be brought into close con-
tact with some of the more difficult questions
of biological philosophy.
In any event we shall gain a clearer idea
of the way in which the whole anatomical
