232 PLANT LIFE
In this particular nuclear division we find
that the chromosomes are not longitudinally
divided and the moieties then distributed be-
tween the two daughter nuclei, but that the
whole process is carried through in another
way.
The earliest stages resemble those of an
ordinary vegetative nucleus which is about
to divide. The chromatin-containing gela-
tinous strands make their appearance, and the
chromatin is arranged in parallel streaks.
But instead of going on to differentiate and
finally to divide, the chromosomes proceed
to unite in pairs. We have very strong
grounds for believing that in no case is this
union a chance one, but that a chromosome
descended from one contributed by the sperm
unites with another corresponding to it but
derived from the egg. In other words, each
pair consists of a chromosome of maternal
and a paternal origin.
The net result, then, of the approximation
and union of the paternally and maternally
derived chromosomes to form the respective
pairs is, of course, a reduction to one-half of
the number apparently present.
Each pair now behaves as if it were a single
chromosome. They flock to the equator of
the spindle, but when they divide there, what
happens is simply a disjunction of the two
members of each pair, one of the members re-
treates to one pole, the other one to the other
pole. Hence a real reduction is now effected.
