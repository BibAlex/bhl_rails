132 PLANT LIFE
that a closer examination of the matter will
reveal much that is of intense interest, and
of great importance in its theoretical bearings
on the problems already adumbrated.
The urgent need of water, common to all
vegetation, is especially great on the part of
the green plants, although the larger portion of
that which is absorbed is not used directly in
the synthetic functions, but is exhaled through
the stomata with which most leaves are so
plentifully provided. Its value to the plant
stands even before that of light, for photo-
synthesis, like other characteristically vital
functions, is practically arrested as soon as
the supply of water falls below a critical
amount.
Some of the higher and many of the lower
green plants are able to tolerate long periods
of drought; but they do so by passing into a
condition of suspended animation, during
which many of their chemical processes
are slowed down and others are completely
arrested. Thus a large number of lichens,
certain mosses, and various other plants, may
all become so far desiccated during dry periods
that they can be easily reduced to powder.
A shower of rain, however, serves to restore
them in a few minutes to a condition of
renewed and active vitality.
Nearly all land plants are liable to encounter
periods during which the supply of available
moisture runs short. The shortage may be
due to seasonal or climatic causes, or it
