236 PLANT LIFE
formed at meiosis often separate as four
spores, each of which may give rise to a new
plant destined in time to produce gametes.
Thus meiosis in plants has come to be asso-
ciated with a special kind of reproductive
multiplication which is sometimes called
asexual reproduction.
It would be better to replace the terms
sexual and asexual reproduction by the terms
gametic and meiotic reproduction, and thus
do away with a misleading antithesis. For
asexual and sexual reproduction are
parts of one process, carried through in two
stages. The two phases of reproduction,
gametic and meiotic, in all the higher plants are
associated with two distinct stages in the life
history. One of these begins with the fertilisa-
tion of the egg, and ends in the meiotic
divisions. The spores, which are formed as
the result of meiosis, inaugurate the second
stage of the life history in which the differ-
entiation of sexual cells takes place.
This rhythmic alternation of a spore-pro-
ducing with a gamete-producing generation
is well illustrated by the fern. Starting with
the fertilised egg, an embryo is produced,
which grows into the ordinary fern. If the
backs of the leaves are inspected, brown spots
or stripes may often be seen, and these are
found to consist of small capsules or spor-
angia. A young sporangium contains a fairly
definite mass of internal cells which are
enclosed by nutritive tissues, the whole being
