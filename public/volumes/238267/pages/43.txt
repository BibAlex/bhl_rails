CELLULAR STRUCTURE 39
not motile, and the plant is furthermore
increased by budding and by outgrowths from
detached portions of thallus. The cells are
very regularly arrayed in the thallus, and the
conformation of the plant is clearly the result
of a co-ordination existing between the con-
stituent cells, and this is of a tolerably
advanced nature. Indiscriminate multiplica-
tions of the individual cells has been replaced
by a more ordered and regulated distribution
of the power of division amongst the cells
which together make up the Prasiola plant.
The relation of the frond to light is one of
the important factors in bringing this about.
But there is, besides this, and perhaps behind
it, a subtle intercommunicating influence
between the individual cells which together
constitute the colony, and this influence
determines the share that each is to take in
the building up of the organism as a w^hole.
Although we may find it impossible to identify
the exact nature of this influence in the
majority of instances, we know quite enough
to convince us that it is of a material nature.
We are well aware that the processes of growth,
and many other bodily functions besides, are
greatly affected by the presence of even
minute traces of certain substances, and the
physical approximation of the cells of an
organism renders it possible for substances
t-o diffuse from one to the other, and thus
to determine, in a plus or minus direction,
the rate of cell growth and multiplication.
