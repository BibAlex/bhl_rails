definitely modified in relation to conditions
of drought that they have become extremely
intolerant of moisture, even in quantities such
as would barely sufTice to keep an ordinary
mesophyte alive. Plants such as these
stand at one extreme end of the scale of
vegetation, the other end being occupied by
the genuine aquatics or hydrophytes which
also are unable to endure mesophytic con-
ditions, because they lose water too readily.
Different as are these extreme examples from
one another, they yet agree in this respect,
namely that the chemical processes character-
istic of their vital functions are incapable of
becoming so modified as to produce the kind
of structure suited to average mesophytic
conditions. In the case of aquatics the
general nature of this defect is clearer than
in the xerophytes, and mainly depends on
the inability to form a suitable cuticle, added
to which the functions of water conduction
and mechanical support are often inadequate
for a terrestrial habitat.
