108 PLANT LIFE
on the development of a correspondingly
thick trunk.
But the various exigencies and risks in-
separable from a climbing habit, have given
free scope to the play of individual variation
among the numerous species, both related
and unrelated to each other, of which the
great group of the climbers is composed.
It is this circumstance that gives them their
special interest, and also renders them so
instructive.
Many of the climbers which grow in the
tropical jungles exhibit extreme specialisation
in connection with their climbing habits, by
which they are enabled rapidly to reach the
leafy canopy of the forest, although this is
often many feet above the ground. Some-
times they steal a march on circumstances, as
it were, and the seed is able to germinate in
the upper fork of a tree. This occurs in
many of the large figs, e. g. the India-rubber
Fig, which, perhaps, can hardly be called
a climber in the ordinary sense of the term.
Plants of this kind produce roots which
rapidly grow downwards and penetrate the
soil, the young fig securing the great ad-
vantage that, when its foliage sprouts forth,
it is very soon fully exposed to light.
Other climbers behave differently, and
more nearly resemble the kind of growth of
an ordinary plant, but with certain significant
differences. The seed germinates on the
ground, and the thin shoot, which grows
