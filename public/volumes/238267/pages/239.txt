CELL-NUCLEUS— FERTILISATION 235
of future development on the part of the
offspring.
Naturally, the whole story of the nucleus
in its relation to heredity is a very long one,
and in this brief sketch it has not been possible
to attempt more than to indicate, in the
barest outline, a few of the most important
features of meiosis and of fertilisation.
Meiosis has, however, a further claim on
our attention, inasmuch as it has served as
the starting-point for some of the most strik-
ing morphological developments in the whole
series of higher plants.
It has been seen that sexual cells cannot,
as a rule, arise until after the nuclei have
undergone meiosis. It might, perhaps, be
expected that immediately the meiotie phase
is over, the four cells which result from it
would at once become sexual gametes. In
animals this commonly is the case — for in the
male animal the four sperms arise by the direct
transformation of the cells and nuclei that have
just passed through meiosis. In the female
the same is true, for the ripe egg, together
with the three transitory polar bodies, form
the corresponding female gametes. Of these,
however, only the egg is normally functional.
In plants, on the other hand, the four cells
formed at meiosis never differentiate directly
into sexual cells — at least no instance of their
doing so is yet known. Often a long series
of cell generations intervenes between meiosis
and the formation of gametes. The four cells
