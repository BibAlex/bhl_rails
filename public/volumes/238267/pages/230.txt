are ultimately produced.
It is, however, impossible to appreciate the
significance of all this without some prelimin-
ary acquaintance with the behaviour of the
cell nucleus, and its relation to cell division
and cell organisation, which will form the
subject of the following chapter.
CHAPTER XX
THE CELL-NUCLEUS AND FERTILISATION
In order to be in a position to grasp the
essential facts of fertilisation, and their far-
reaching consequences on the organism in
general, it is necessary, as stated in the con-
cluding paragraph of the preceding chapter,
to learn something of the structure of the
nucleus. Moreover, a study of the nuclear
processes will enable us to apprehend the
meaning of some of the most constant and
singular features which, in the form of alterna-
tion of generations, are of such widespread
occurrence in the vegetable kingdom.
