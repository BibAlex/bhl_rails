THE PLANT AND ITS FOOD 27
when it will withstand complete desiccation.
When it is grown in water containing traces of
available nitrogenous food it is green, thrives,
and multiplies rapidly, but if the supply
of nitrogenous food is used up, the rate of
increase drops, and the plants change colour,
owing to the degradation of the chlorophyll
and the corresponding development of a
reddish pigment. When it has reached this
condition the addition to the water of a small
supply of nitrogenous food, such as a crushed
fly, rapidly brings about the restoration of
the green colour in the cells. When found
growing on snow-slopes, the red tint is
obviously due to the absence of available
nitrogenous food, possibly coupled with the
conditions of intense illumination and low
temperature prevailing in such situations, for
when the plant is once more suitably nourished
the green colour soon re-appears.
To sum up, then, what we have learned of
the significance of chlorophyll, both to the
plant and to the world at large, we may say
that its primary function is to enable its
possessor to synthesise important complex
foodstuffs from very simple raw materials;
in other words, that a part of the energy
contained in the sunlight is rendered available
for the use of the plant. Furthermore, that
the sugars or their representatives thus
formed, provide the starting-point for still
other reactions which go on within the body.
They more directly supply the energy which
