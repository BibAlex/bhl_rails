THE FUNGI 165
Although the fungi, as a class, are dependent
for their nourishment on substances which
have originated from other living things,
they differ a good deal among themselves as
to the kind of food material they can use.
Some are dependent on the living bodies of
animals or plants, and then we call them
parasites. Others live on dead or decaying
remains, and are commonly termed sapro-
phytes. The saprophytes are a very extensive
class, and include many species that can live
on relatively simple organic residues such as
sugar, organic acids, and so forth. But these
simpler feeders are connected with more
obviously saprophytic types by all con-
ceivable intermediate forms, and even the
distinction between saprophytes and parasites
is far from absolute, for many saprophytes
can become parasites, and vice versa.
Now the utilisation of all food, regarded as
a means to an end, is connected with changes
in the states of energy. Complex organic
substances possess a considerable amount of
energy in a locked-up, or potential form.
When the food substances undergo oxidation
and are broken down into simpler ones, the
potential energy is set free as kinetic energy,
just as happens when a piece of coal is
oxidised or burnt. This kinetic energy is
directly available for doing work, and may
be utilised to boil a kettle or to build up the
body of a fungus. In the former case, the
kinetic energy is used to alter the physical
