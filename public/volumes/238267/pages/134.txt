130 PLANT LIFE
with began to differentiate meehanical tissue,
appropriate both in form and position to the
particular forces it became necessary to
counteract.
In another connection, it may be observed
that new vascular tissue can be differentiated
in the leaves of some plants if their vascular
bundles are injured, and this new tissue is
formed at the expense of cells which hitherto
have discharged other and very different
functions. The union of appropriate tissues
between stock and scion in grafting furnishes
yet another example. These instances have
been mentioned here to avoid giving too one-
sided an impression of the evidence available
in connection with the problem.
Such experiments as those above mentioned
serve to throw a little light on the matter,
by enabling us to realise that the final result
is due not so much to a process of direct
adaptation as to the interaction of a number
of different functions. These have somehow
or other to be correlated within the plant, in
order to produce the observed effect. Nutri-
tion obviously plays a part, though how large
or important it is we do not know; but at
least it is essential, if only as providing the
means for thickening the cell walls. It is,
however, very clear that the causes under-
lying the adaptive character of the distribution
of the tissues are still far to seek, and much
more detailed analysis of the life processes
are required before we shall be able to trace,
