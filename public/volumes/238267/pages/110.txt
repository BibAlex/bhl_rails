or bending stress. An axial cord of mechan-
ical tissue, however strong, would be useless
to resist such a stress on the lee side, while
the arched form of the roots would minimise
the value of an axile strand of a root on the
windward side. This special form of mechan-
ical stress is overcome by the Indian corn
roots in a remarkable way. The extra-
terrestrial arched parts of the roots have a
thick ring of mechanical tissue specially
differentiated from the cells of the outer rind,
whilst at the same time they retain the cord-
like axile strand. Thus these roots are
excellently adapted to withstand both crush-
and pulling strains from whichever quarter
they may come. Beneath the ground only
the pulling strains, of course, are operative,
and we find that the peripheral thick tissue
ring is not formed in the subterranean parts
of the root system.
