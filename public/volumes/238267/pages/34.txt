must obviate the inevitable difficulties of
existence in another way altogether. Some,
like fungi and many parasites, have adopted
the latter alternative; but as regards the
vast majority of the green plants, we shall
find that a recognition of these two dominating
factors, water and light, will serve us in good
stead, as furnishing an important clue to
much of the complexity of structure to be
observed in so many of the more advanced
types of plants. Such complexity is intimately
related with a corresponding differentiation
and specialisation of junction, and indeed
it is largely to this circumstance that many of
the more striking examples of adaptation
to the environment are to be attributed.
The best way of arriving at a clear concep-
tion as to how the higher plants, with their com-
plicated structure and high degree of differ-
entiation, have come into existence in past
times, is to study the more primitive types
which illustrate various degrees of advance
on the simple unicellular stage. The class
of Algse, which includes the simpler water
and land plants, will furnish us with excellent
material wherewith to reconstruct, in outline
at least, the course of vegetative evolution.
This must not, however, be taken to imply
that the simple types in question are to be
regarded as new forms which are now on an
upward grade of evolutionary development.
They are to be understood, rather, as per-
manent representations of some of the phases
