THE GREEN LEAF 69
Neither of these needs is specially pressing
in the case of water plants, and indeed we find
that when any of the descendants of the land
flora take to an aquatic life, they tend more
or less rapidly to lose those distinctive ana-
tomical characters that marked their terres-
trial forebears. Plants which are growing
submerged in water are obviously better
fitted to absorb it through any part of their
surface and consequently have less need for
elaborately specialised organs, either for
absorption or conduction, than those w^hose
roots alone are in contact with the damp soil,
while the rest of the body is exposed to the
drying influence of currents of air.
At the same time the water plants also
escape most of the mechanical difficulties,
and easily maintain a properly spread out leaf
surface, and even an upright position, owing
to the circumstance that their specific gravity
is so nearly identical with that of water.
Their weight thus becomes an almost negli-
gible factor, especially as they are often
buoyed up in the water, omng to the
presence of air or gases entangled in their
tissues.
But most of the higher water plants have
not entirely lost the traces of their terrestrial
inheritance. Even the roots of many of them
still function as absorbing organs, and the
mechanical tissue is often present, though in a
more or less rudimentary condition. Some-
times, indeed, as in species that inhabit
