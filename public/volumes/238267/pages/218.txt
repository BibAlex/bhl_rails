214 PLANT LIFE
place to glance at a few examples, in order to
gain some knowledge of the general character
of the sexual process itself so far as we at
present understand it. At the same time, we
shall be in a better position to appreciate the
bearings of its elaboration on the evolution
of the series of higher plants.
If we once more take as our starting-point
a relatively simple unicellular plant such as
Chlamydomonas, we find that under certain
conditions it continues to grow and to multiply
itself vegetatively (see p. 15). After a time,
however, and under certain altered nutritive
conditions, sexual reproduction sets in (Fig.
24). The young individuals which have been
recently liberated from parent cells, after
swimming about for a while, undergo a change.
The living protoplasmic body slips out of
the cellulose skin, and swims as a naked cell
in the water. Very soon these cells are
observed to approach one another in pairs.
Two individuals become attached, and then
gradually coalesce. The cilia disappear, and
the now motionless zygote becomes spherical
and surrounds itself with a new cell wall.
Chemical changes continue to go on within
its body, for the chlorophyll loses its green
colour and gives way to a red pigment.
Later on, and after a longer or shorter period
of rest, the green colour returns, the cell
reawakens to vegetative activity, its contents
divide, and new chlamydomonas individuals
are produced.
