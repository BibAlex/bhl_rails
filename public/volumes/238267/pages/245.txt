CELL-NUCLEUSâ€” FERTILISATION 241
fertilisation recurs meiosis is never omitted, ^ and
this is true for animals as well as for plants.
The ordinary course of life histories has been
developed long after sexuality and meiosis
appeared, and has progressed independently,
and on different lines in different groups.
Sometimes, as in the higher plants, the stages
of the life history are more or less obviously
connected with these nuclear cardinal points,
at other times the relation is not so evident.
For example, it may happen, as in many of
the flowering plants, that the two stages in
the life history so well separated and analysed
in the fern, become curtailed. This happens
when the cell which should give rise, by the
two divisions, to four spores, cuts the process
short, grows, and itself becomes the spore
without any division. Such a short cut is
taken in certain of the sporangia (ovules) of
a lily, orchis, and many other plants. But
meiosis is not cut out. It supervenes at the
very next divisions which follow the omitted
stages during which it would normally have
been effected.
As we advance to types of plants above the
ferns we find the life history becoming more
complicated and less diagrammatically clear.
The principle which underlies the complica-
tion is, however, a simple one; it consists
in a provision for giving the sexually produced
embryo an advantageous start in life.
^ The occasional anomaly reported for certain mosses
requires further investigation.
