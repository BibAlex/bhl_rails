PLANTS AND WATER 147
The spiny plants arc similarly built on lines
calculated to limit the out})iit of water,
though why the reduced branches and leaves
should so commonly assume the form of
spines it is not easy to say. The supposed
function of the spines in keeping off browsing
animals is a ready, but not very satisfying,
explanation.
Observation teaches that both classes of
plants, the spiny and succulent, are of com-
paratively slow growth. But it is not quite
correct to assert of xerophytes generally that
in their habits and rate of growth they com-
pare unfavourably with the mesophytes. The
truth rather is that they are able if need be
to support life on a very limited income, by
cutting down their expenditure in various
directions. It is by this faculty of exercising
economy that they are enabled to flourish in
regions from which the less hardy mesophytes
are excluded. A large number of xerophytes
are, however, by no means solely adapted to
a life of austerity. Transplanted and grown
under ameliorated conditions, they often
respond to the change by a rapid and vigorous
growth. It seldom happens, however, that
they are able to hold their own in competi-
tion w4th the mesophytes in a natural en-
vironment suitable for the latter, and they
commonly become killed out sooner or later
by their more vigorous rivals.
There are a few of the highly specialised
xerophytes, such as cacti, which are so
