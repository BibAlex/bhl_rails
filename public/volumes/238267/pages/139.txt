PLANTS AND WATER 135
conform to its requirements, and to tolerate
the limitation which it imposes.
It is necessary, however, to observe the
greatest caution in concluding, as is sometimes
done, that the various adaptations to
dry conditions are to be attributed offhand
to a faculty assumed to be possessed by the
plant which enables it to make a direct and
appropriate response to the demands of the
environment in question. As a matter of
fact many plants are incapable of making
any purposive response at all ; and the matter
is by no means a simple one even in the case
of those which can so react. The constitution
of the living protoplasm is the main factor
which determines the nature of response to
water requirements, no less than to mechanical
needs. It is only those plants, the living
substance of which has become definitely
altered in certain (but alternative) ways, that
are capable of exhibiting adaptations (or
adaptedness) towards a particular set of
external conditions. The successful reaction
is commonly bound up w4th complex internal
functional relations, and among these nutrition
often plays a leading share. It may happen,
as in the formation of winter bud scales (see
p. 142), that the functional conditions which
are more immediately concerned in the forma-
tion of adaptive structures ensure their
production quite independently of their ulti-
mate utility as protective organs during the
winter months.
