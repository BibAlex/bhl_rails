FUNCTION AND FORM 87
plant, while the other will readily tolerate
shade.
This toleration only applies to the plant
taken as a whole, and there are limits beyond
whieh enduranee of shade does not go. Most
people who have wandered through a dense
and well-tended wood must have been struek
by the great differenee between the forms of
the individual trees whieh compose it and
those of the same speeies grown in the open
or in the hedgerow. The clean tall trunks
and the compact small crown of the forest
tree contrast strongly with the spreading
gro^vth of the park specimen. And yet the
difference is merely a consequence of the
different conditions of illumination. A tree
grown in the open exposes its leaves to light
on all sides. The spreading limbs space out
the foliage and the leaves are all more or less
actively functional. But closer inspection
reveals the fact that it is only the leaves on
the periphery of the tree and its branch
systems which are thus flourishing. The
inner portion is bare of leaves, or at any rate
comparatively so. This is because the inner
twigs which become shaded by the outer
ones are starved, and sooner or later they die
and fall off. The leaves they bore did not
act efficiently, and they were quietly crushed
out of existence.
Precisely the same thing, on a different
scale, happens when young trees are grown
close together, as in a well -managed forest.
