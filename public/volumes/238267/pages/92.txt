88 PLANT LIFE
The lateral branches, which in isolated trees
spread out and constitute its charm, here
compete with each other, and all are over-
shadowed by the topmost branches which
alone get properly illuminated. Consequently
the lower leaves become useless, and they,
together with the branches which bear them,
become starved and are destined to perish.
The tops are constantly growing higher, while
the trunk is as perpetually being denuded
of its lower lateral branches. In this way
the grand boles or trunks are formed which the
woodman delights to see, and they are the
distinguishing features of forests managed with
skill and intelligence. The foresters aim is
always secured, broadly speaking, in this
way, though of course there are differences
in actual treatment depending on the par-
ticular kind of tree or association of trees
it is desired to produce. The tall trunks are
the result of a sort of natural pruning, brought
about by growing the trees at the correct
distances apart, the actual distance being
regulated by the size, age, and other conditions
which affect the gro\\1:h as a whole.
The amount of leaf surface is not only
influenced by the available exposure to light,
but is influenced by other conditions as well.
Thus mechanical requirements need to be
satisfied, and they may easily limit the dimen-
sions practically attainable by the green
surface as a whole. A leaf too weak in itself,
or too feebly supported to retain a suitably
