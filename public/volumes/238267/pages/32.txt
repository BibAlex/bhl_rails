renders possible the production of those
almost infinitely complex substances which
form the very substratum of life itself.
CHAPTER III
EVOLUTION OF CELLULAR STRUCTURE IN
SIMPLE PLANTS
Emphasis has already been laid on the
circumstance that the plant cell, owing to
the presence of its investing skin of cellulose,
is only able to absorb and use substances
capable of diffusing through the membrane.
Consequently food from without can only
reach the protoplasm in solution. Salts
and other solid food materials are invariably
absorbed in a state of solution, and the same
is true of gases, such as oxygen and carbon
dioxide, as well.
But water has other functions to discharge
within the plant, besides that of serving as a
vehicle for the intake of nutritive materials.
It serves to maintain the protoplasm itself
in that characteristic semi-fluid condition
