though only indirectly, by the environment,
whereby the loss of water is limited when
the moneywort is flourishing in dry soil.
Most plants do not share this faeulty of
quiekly altering their chemieal processes so
as to become adapted to so wide a range of
conditions.
The most striking character common to all
the higher water plants consists in the enormous
development of intercellular spaces (Fig. 17).
These air-spaces, communicating finally with
the atmosphere by the stomata, represent
an exaggerated development of an aerating
system that occurs in every land plant. The
aquatics have not, in this respect, acquired
anything new, they have merely enlarged
and often specialised, what was already an
ancestral trait. Such an aerating system
sharply marks off the higher water plants
from the lower ones. In the larger seaweeds
it is true that there is often a localised forma-
tion of air cavities. These, however, serve
rather as floating organs than for the
general purposes of respiration and gaseous
exchange generally.
The remarkable congeries of trees and
shrubs that make up a mangrove swamp in
the inlets and estuaries on tropical coasts
furnish striking examples of specialised aerat-
ing systems. It is the roots which run
through the mud of the swamp that are
principally affected by the urgent need of
free oxygen. After the root of a mangrove
