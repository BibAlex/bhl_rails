248 PLANT LIFE
out from the parent plant with the scantiest
supplies of ready-made nutriment. Henee,
on germination, they must quickly begin to
make their own living.
Both methods have proved successful in
different lines. The advantage of small seeds
lies in the number of offspring produced,
and in the ease with which their dispersal is
ensured. Of course, it is inevitably accom-
panied by great mortality — a waste in so far
as the individuals are concerned, but by no
means necessarily so from the point of view
of the race.
Parasites generally (though not invariably)
produce huge quantities of small seeds. The
profitable result is sufficiently obvious, for
the individual chances of success cannot, at
best, be very great — a species that relied on few
seeds would, in the majority of cases, be placed
at a disadvantage, inasmuch as the conditions
of successful development can only be seldom
realised. Every unsuccessful individual would
naturally be exterminated, and thus, w^ith a
scanty progeny the race itself might easily
die out. Moreover, the advantage of big
seeds is less in the case of a parasite than in
that of ordinary plants, because if a seed
secures a lodgment enabling the embryo to
attack a suitable host, nutrition in abundance
is ready to hand. But for those that fail
to reach a host, no stock of nutrition, however
great, would be of any real avail.
It matters little in what direction we cast
