CHAPTER XVI
FLOWERING PARASITES
It has been already pointed out that the
non-green saprophytes or parasites are by
no means Umited to the classes of Fungi and
Bacteria. Quite a large number of the
flowering plants have adopted the habit
of utilising extraneous stores of organic
food, and in connection therewith have more
or less lost the faculty of producing chloro-
phyll. There is the strongest possible
evidence that the change has come about
in correlation wdth the altered conditions of
nutrition. In other words, the more or less
complex food-substances present in the living
or dead bodies of other organisms do influence
the structure of those plants which make use
of them, and one result is seen in the loss of
the faculty of producing chlorophyll.
One might, then, expect to find many links
connecting the normal green plants with those
highly specialised, or as they are often called,
degraded, forms characteristic of extreme
parasites. And as a matter of fact we can
trace such a series in a number of instances.
The Mistletoe (Viscum album) is a parasite
which betrays very little of the degeneration
