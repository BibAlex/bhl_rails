CELL-NUCLEUSâ€” FERTILISATION 245
developed within it a very rudimentary
structure which it is possible to trace back
to an extremely reduced prothallus. The
pollen grain presently begins to put forth a
tube which grows into the tissue of the stigma,
feeding, like a fungal hypha, on the juices it
contains. The tube grows down through the
intervening tissue of the style into the cavity
of the ovary. When it reaches this it is
attracted to the tips of the ovules, and enters
one of them by way of a little pore (the
mieropyle), burrowing through an intervening
tissue of the sporangial (^. e. ovular) wall that
may be present, until it reaches the spore.
Meanwhile, from the body of the pollen
grain the essential structures above alluded
to have entered into the tube. Two sperms
are developed, but they are not provided
with locomotory cilia. They are finally dis-
charged into the cavity of the spore, when
they at once lose all cytoplasmic invest-
ment, and appear as naked nuclei, somewhat
vermiform in appearance. They pass through
the protoplasm, which is contained in the
spore (or embryo-sac as it is often called),
apparently by autonomous movement, and
one of them approaches, and finally fuses with,
the ^gg. The other one fuses with a remark-
able pair of nuclei which are found near the
centre of the ^gg^ and the nucleus resulting
from the latter fusion is responsible for the
production of the nutritive matter that
later on fills so many seeds and grains {e, g.
