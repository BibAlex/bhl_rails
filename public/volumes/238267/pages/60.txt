cellular colonies. This proves at once that
each is suited for existence, in so far as physical
conditions are concerned. We may indeed
inquire whether the more specialised colonies
actually do succeed better at all than their
simpler unicellular relatives. In the higher
forms there is the accumulation of food-
supplies, and such consequent advantages
as accrue from the possession of these re-
serves, but it is clearly impossible to see how
this could account for the origin of the multi-
cellular types. Perhaps, indeed, we are
attacking the problem at the wrong end by
regarding it as one of profit and loss at all.
It seems at least as likely that the same sort
of influence which we discern to subsist
between, and to determine the organisation
of the units of a specialised colony, operates
in a similar, albeit in a simpler and cruder, way
between the potentially free lUnits of a primi-
tive colony. In other words, the cause of
coherence is primarily independent of ad-
vantage or disadvantage, and may hardly
exceed an almost accidental lack of disunion
{e.g. in Spirogyra); or it may depend upon
some attractive influence which causes the
units, primarily separate, to cohere in clusters,
as happens in the series of algae exemplified
by well-known forms such as Volvox or
Hydrodictyon.
