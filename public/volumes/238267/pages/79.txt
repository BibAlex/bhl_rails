ROOTS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS 75
stem. But in the young root the xylem and
phloem are arranged alternately, whilst in the
stem and leaf they are superposed in pairs,
with the phloem usually exterior in position.
The cells of whieh the woody or xylem
portion of the vascular strands is composed
generally undergo a peculiar change in chemi-
cal and physical characters known as lignifi-
cation. Lignified walls are less extensible
and less collapsible, and in general are more
rigid than the ordinary cellulose membranes.
Moreover the lignified walls often become
considerably thickened, which further empha-
sises the same qualities.
In dealing with wood, especially in the
stem, we must remember that we are con-
cerned with a complicated mass of tissues
associated with the discharge of many and
very different functions (Fig. 11). Some of the
wood tissues are concerned with storage of
food, others have to do with the mechanical
functions of support, etc. To these we shall
return later, but the special tissues of xylem
that just now concern us are those whieh
are connected with the conduction of water.
The cells of the water-conducting tissue differ
amongst themselves in details, but they are
commonly elongated in form, and are arranged
more or less in longitudinal continuity. It
sometimes happens that the end w^alls separa-
ting two or more cells become perforated or
even obliterated, so that the cavity of one
