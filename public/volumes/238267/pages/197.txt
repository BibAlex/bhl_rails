attracted to the root by substances which
have a food value for its hypha?, just as para-
sitic fungi arc induced to enter the bodies
of their victims. But in a mycorhizal
association the cells of the root control the
degree of invasiveness which the fungus can
manifest, and not only so, but they often
proceed to actually digest the fungus itself
after it has flourished within them, and at
their expense for a while.
We have here, then, a beautiful example
of two-sided parasitism, in which the final
balance of profit very clearly lies with the
flowering plant. It is practically certain that
the fungus obtains some carbohydrate food,
at first at any rate, but in return for this the
plant acquires mineral substances in solution,
which the fungus absorbs from the soil.
A considerable number of flowering plants
are unable to thrive unless their roots become
infected in this way. This is especially true
of orchids. Indeed, one of the great diffi-
culties experienced in raising these plants
from seed has been solved by supplying the
young seedling, during its germination, wuth
the fungus appropriate to it. And so close
has the degree of association between fungus
and flowering plant become, both in orchids
and in many other plants, that neither
can grow properly in the absence of the
other.
Now this intimate mycorhizal relationship
is found to exist in all the flowering sapro-
