CELL-NUCLEUSâ€” FERTILISATION 237
encased by the sporangial wall. The central
cells increase, and whenever their nuclei
divide, the full, unreduced number of chromo-
somes can be seen, just as it may be ob-
served in any other dividing nuclei of the fern
plant.
But a time arrives when the central cells
within the sporangium become free from
each other. Each one proceeds to grow, and
it finally divides twice, to give rise to four
spores. It is during these two divisions that the
reduction in the. number of chromosomes takes
Elace in the manner already described, and
ence the nucleus of each spore only contains
half the number of these nuclear structures.
When the spores are ripe the sporangium
bursts and the spores are scattered. If they
happen to alight on a suitable spot, they
germinate, but they do not bring forth a plant
like a fern (Fig. 27). A filamentous body is
formed which gradually develops into a heart-
shaped green expansion known as a prothallus.
It is very delicate, and is easily dried up, and
consequently is only suited to live where
conditions of moisture prevail.
The prothallus sometimes multiplies vegeta-
lively, by the dying off of part of the plant,
while the living fragments grow into new
prothalli. Sexual organs, called antheridia
and arehegonia, are developed on its under
side. In the former a number of sperms are
produced, while each archegonium, when
mature, contains a single egg. We need not
