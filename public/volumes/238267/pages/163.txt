THE EPIPHYTES 159
Another plant, Dischidia rafflesiana, be-
longing to the very different family of Ascle-
piads, may be considered in this connection
though it is not strictly speaking an epiphyte.
It commonly grows on rocky surfaces, but
it is subjected, like the epiphyte, to the need
of special adaptations for obtaining water.
Its ordinary leaves are rather thick and fleshy,
and thus are to be regarded as dealing econo-
mically with such water as may be available.
But some of its leaves undergo a most
remarkable modification in the course of
their development, and assume the form
of pitchers. The mouth of the pitcher is
directed upwards, and they are readily
filled by the heavy showers that prevail in
the regions of the Eastern Archipelago and
Malay where the plant occurs. The utilisa-
tion of the water is finally effected by small
branching roots, which spring from the stem
close to the insertion of the leaf pitcher.
These enter it and ramify inside it. Often
detritus of various sorts becomes w^ashed into
the pitcher, and thus it not only serves to
collect water, but it actually provides soil
for the plant as well.
A few of the epiphytes have been chosen
for consideration here because they so admir-
ably illustrate the remarkable methods by
which the difficulties of obtaining water have
been overcome. An extended study of
these remarkable plants would have shown
this more in detail, for there is hardly any
