formation of carbohydrates in the plant.
In other words, the predisposition to infec-
tion in this instance is probably connected
with a disturbance of the photosynthetic
processes.
The whole matter of immunity is evidently
very closely related with nutrition. It may
be the result either of a defective hereditary
constitution or of some property of the
environment (e. g. excessive or deficient sup-
plies of essential food elements) which inter-
feres with the chemical processes of the
manufacture, distribution, or utilisation of
food within the organism. The part played
by the fungus depends on its physiological
capability to take advantage of the host
plant. It must be able to enter the body of
its victim, and either utilise there whatever
stores of nutriment are directly available, or
it must modify the vital processes, and in
this way secure for itself the nourishment it
needs. Some of the extremely specialised
parasites, and especially some of the rusts, are
limited to particular species, and even sub-
species, of plants as hosts. This can only be
interpreted as meaning that they are adapted
to live on a very special kind of food, and
perhaps also that they are easily affected in a
prejudicial manner by substances which occur
in species nearly related to their own proper
hosts. But even the specialised parasites
are capable of further extending their range.
For example, the Brome grasses, of which
