is impossible completely to wash the soil away
from this portion. Still further behind, the
soil ceases to adhere to the surface. Other
roots or rootlets are seen to be growing out,
and still further away from the tip the
diameter of the young root begins evidently
to increase. Thus we distinguish four regions :
(1) the tip and clean surface; (2) the hairy
zone ; (3) the region from which young rootlets
are springing; (4) The older parts which are
getting thicker.
The only part of the root which is actively
absorbing water from the soil is the hairy
zone, and the hairs themselves — outgrowths
from the superficial cell layer — are the essential
structures which perform this task. The apex
is chiefly concerned with boring on through
the soil, and it is covered with a characteristic
covering of cells called the root-cap, the outer
cells of which are continually being worn away
by attrition in the soil, and as constantly being
replaced by the formation of fresh layers from
within. The superficial cells behind the
region of the root-cap do not begin to elongate
at once to form hairs. This does not happen
till the part of the root from which they
spring has ceased to elongate. The meaning
of this at once becomes clear when we reflect
that these delicate protuberances, the root-
hairs, are in very intimate contact with the
particles of soil — and if the part of the root
which bears them were to continue to grow
in length, they would be torn away from their
