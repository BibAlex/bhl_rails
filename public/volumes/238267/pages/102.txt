by which they can be very greatly lengthened,
although they become, of course, considerably
thinner as the result. This tissue is often
called collenchyma, from the peculiarly bright
gelatinous appearance of the walls. It is
specially adapted, by its extensibility, to the
requirements of small and growing organs,
whilst its inferior value as a supporting tissue
is largely compensated by its advantageous
position in the stem. Indeed, collenchyma
affords a wonderful example of an accurate
balance of qualities possessed by a tissue
which is required to be carefully adjusted to
meet very diverse needs. For whilst the
function of support is its main raison d^Hre,
it is obvious that it must not be so strong
or so rigid as to materially interfere with the
growth in length of the organ in which it is
present.
It sometimes happens that the structures
on which the rigidity of a stem depends have
to be provided in a rather different way. In
wheat, and most other grasses, the stem
continues for some time to elongate just above
the node or knot. Most people know that
it is easy to pull the stem out from the knot,
and that the broken end is soft and succulent.
But a series of such weak joints in a stem,
however well the mechanical requirements
might be fulfilled in the intervening regions,
would of course be fatal to the retention of
an erect position. In the grass this weakness
is remedied by a curious arrangement of the
