CELL-NUCLEUSâ€” FERTILISATION 239
sexual nature of these two kinds of gametes
depends, but it seems pretty clear that it is
connected with the shedding off of some
substance during the course of their develop-
ment.
When a sperm unites with an egg, the
life history enters on the fern stage. The
fern plant, like the prothallus, may undergo
vegetative multiplication in various ways,
but sooner or later this asexual generation
normally culminates in the production of
spores, just as the prothallial generation
closes with the production of gametes.
But the fern does not always go rigidly
through these stages in a perfectly invariable
manner. We are acquainted with a number
of kinds in which the spore-bearing fern leaf
may grow out directly into a prothallus.
Sometimes a prothallus sprouts from a spor-
angium, and then all the spores die away.
Furthermore, these prothalli may bear male
and female sexual organs, and from the egg
a new fern plant may arise. What has
become of alternation of generations in such
a case, and how are meiosis and fertilisation
respectively affected ?
Taking the second point first, it may at
once be said that prothalli formed in this way
resemble the fern in that their nuclei have not
undergone reduction. Meiosis has been omitted
from the life history. But as a consequence
of this, the egg is already provided, as also
are the sperms, with a double set of chromo-
