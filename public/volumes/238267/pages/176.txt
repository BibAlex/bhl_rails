region, and also in the sapwood of the tree,
but the special point of interest about this
fungus lies in the circumstance that black
cord-like mycelial strands are produced in the
tree by the approximation of hyphse, which
then become woven into thin strands. These
grow as organised structures, and some of
them force their way out of the tree below
the surface of the soil, there continuing to
elongate till they reach the roots of other
pines. They then enter these, and so the
pest may easily assume the character of an
epidemic, extending from one pine to another
as from a centre, and killing the trees in its
advance.
CHAPTER XV
FUNGAL PARASITES
The history of our cultivated plants, both
in Europe and, to a far greater extent,
in the tropics, bears abundant testimony to
the magnitude of the evils caused by fungal
enemies. The conditions under which crops
are generally grown happen, unfortunately, to
