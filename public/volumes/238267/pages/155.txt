THE EPIPHYTES 151
but others arc able, owing to certain peculi-
arities of structure and habit, to endure
recurrent periods of drought provided that
they do not suffer too much in this respect
during their season of active vegetative growth.
Disregarding, then, the less highly specialised
epiphytes, which respond to a dry season
by simply closing down their vital processes,
we will turn our attention to the more highly
adapted types amongst the flowering plants.
The orchids will serve as our first examples.
A large proportion of the members of this
family are not epiphytic at all, but grow in
the ground. Even there they exhibit many
deviations from the typical structure of roots,
but in a number of the epiphytic species, so
common in the tropical forests, the root-
system undergoes a remarkable and adaptive
change of structure. Whilst some of the
roots may depart but slightly from the form
commonly met with in these organs, and
serve to fasten the plant to its arboreal perch,
others are thicker, often green, and when
dry are of a white or lustrous grey colouro
The whiteness is due to the presence of air
in the outer layers of cells which form a very
peculiar sheathing mantle on the root. In
ordinary roots there is but one w^ell-defined
layer sheathing the rind and giving rise to the
root-hairs; but in these orchids it divides
and forms many layers, whilst the root- hairs
are usually suppressed. The illustration will
better explain what is meant, and will serve
