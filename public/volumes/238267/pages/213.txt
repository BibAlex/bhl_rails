VEGETATIVE REPRODUCTION 209
and planted in soil, will commonly give rise
to new plants, and this faculty is taken
advantage of in propagating new and valuable
species.
Sometimes young plantlets are produced
by the development of a cluster of cells which
still remains attached to the parent plant.
This happens in many ferns, where bulbils
are formed on the leaves or leaf stalks, and
when they are set free they are already
provided with all the organs necessary to
start at once into growth. The process of
propagation by gemmae and by young plantlets
is essentially the same, the difference consists
in the particular stage of development which
is reached when the propagative body is cast
adrift from the parent. The gemma is shed
at an early stage, while the bulbil represents
a gemma that has remained to develop on the
parent plant, and has been fed at its expense
during the early stages of growth. But there
are advantages and disadvantages in both
methods. The gemmae are small, and are
more readily dispersed over wide distances
than the larger young plants. Furthermore,
the latter by their very complexity are more
liable to perish unless they speedily reach a
spot in which they find conditions suitable
for immediate development.
But in spite of these numerous and elaborate
kinds of vegetative reproduction, most plants
still retain the primitive capacity of merely
regenerating lost parts to a surprising extent.
