whether into or out of its interior, is achieved
as the result of a nice adjustment to the
physical conditions that regulate the diffusion
of gases through a perforate membrane. If
we try to explain to ourselves how such a
mechanism could have become so perfectly
evolved, how the correlation between the cells
of the epidermal tissue became so perfectly
— and apparently so purposefully — arranged
and adjusted, we shall find ourselves con-
fronted with a task of no mean order. And
the same difficulty arises whenever we attempt
to give a satisfactory explanation of any
other instance of complex adaptedness in the
structure of living things.
Utilising the physical advantages which
the arrangement of its constituent cells and
tissues have placed at its disposal, the oak
leaf, under the influence of light from the
sun, of carbon dioxide from the air, and of
water from the soil, carries on the operation
of photosynthesis in certain cells which are
situated just beneath the epidermis. From
their form these are commonly known as
palisade cells, and they are continuously
active, provided the general conditions, such
as suitable temperature, light, and adequate
supplies of oxygen and of carbon dioxide,
are fulfilled. The need of oxygen by plants,
in contrast to animals, is a very modest one,
and indeed the oxygen which is liberated
within the leaf during the process of photo-
synthesis may really suffice for respiratory
