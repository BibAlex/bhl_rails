PREFACE
I HAVE not attempted in this little book to
cover the whole ground indicated by its title.
My object has rather been to try to place before
the reader a few of the salient features of plant
form from the point of view of function. In
this way, as I think, it is less difficult to keep
in mind the general nature of the causes which
have been operative in bringing about the
marvellous beauty and adaptedness of form
which is so apparent in every branch of the
vegetable kingdom.
The task of selection has not proved an
easy one, and nobody can be more fully alive
to the imperfections of treatment, and other
sins of commission and omission, than I am
myself. Some, at any rate, of the last-named
defects are attributable to the limitations
of space.
I have deliberately touched, though with
enforced brevity, on certain of the more
difficult problems which are even now con-
fronting us, and I have endeavoured to
present them with as little technicality as
possible, but whether I have been successful
in this I must leave to the judgment of
others.
