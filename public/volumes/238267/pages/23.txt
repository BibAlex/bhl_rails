THE PLANT AND ITS FOOD 19
of movements which make for locomotion.
Such movements indeed soon come to lose
their value, even in water plants, when the
capacity for ingesting solid food has been lost,
whilst they would tend to render the exist-
ence of a land flora practically impossible.
We may consider Chlaniydomonas, then, as
a plant belonging to a class the members of
which have not as yet diverged far enough
along the plant line of evolution to have
lost the power of movement. But even
amongst the near relatives of the species under
consideration there are forms which pass at
least a part of their vegetative lives in the
passive and non-motile condition character-
istic of more advanced members of the
vegetable kingdom. A familiar example is
afforded by the green incrustation everywhere
to be seen on old damp palings. This in-
crustation consists of countless numbers of
minute green cells known as Pleurococcus,
which grow and multiply by division. The
separate individuals are habitually destitute
of all locomotory mechanism, and each grows
and multiplies in the spot where it happens
to have become fixed.
The Pleurococcus plant thrives in damp air,
and it depends on the chance supplies of
moisture for the water it requires. The gases
of the atmosphere, passing by diffusion
through the membrane or cell wall, are dis-
solved in the watery sap which bathes its
living protoplasmic substance. Thus supplied
