complex, so clearly related to the sexual act,
and so similar in its details in the animal and
vegetable kingdoms alike, can be devoid of sig-
nificance. It emphasises the individuality of
the chromosomes in the strongest way, and in
this respect it is in accordance with results of
many experiments which indicate that the
chromosomes are, as a matter of fact, different
from one another, i. e. possess an individuality
of their own. Moreover, we see that in the
nuclei before meiosis, the chromosomes are
present as pairs of homologous individuals,
the individuals of each pair having originated,
one from the sperm, the other from the egg,
at the act of fertilisation to which the plant
owed its existence. Furthermore, there is
a considerable body of evidence to show that
the chromosomes in some way represent the
agents by which hereditary qualities are trans-
mitted from each parent. Meiosis provides
an obvious method by which the qualities,
through the agents that are responsible for
them, may be shuffled in the sexual cells;
and, as a matter of fact, when hybrids are
inbred, or when plants are crossed with one
another in a variety of ways, we find the
results agree in practice very closely with
what is deduced as possible from a study of
the behaviour of chromosomes. Indeed, it is
not going too far to say that in meiosis and
fertilisation we are witnessing the chief act
of distributing and recombining the very
substances which determine the possibilities
