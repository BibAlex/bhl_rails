210 PLANT LIFE
a circumstance of which advantage is taken
in the propagation of valued species and
varieties. Everybody knows how simple it
often is to increase a plant by cuttings.
Sometimes cuttings of roots will grow just
as easily as those of stems, and even the
leaves of some plants may be used with almost
certain chances of success. Begonias, for
example, and certain other greenhouse plants,
are generally propagated in this way.
Again, in the operations of budding and
grafting, we see how the process of cell division
and multiplication is followed by cohesion;
the bud or the graft takes, becomes
united with the tissues of the stock. Instead
of the bud or cutting being planted in the
soil, it is here planted on to another organism.
And, in passing, we may note that the graft
produces no roots, as it would have done if
planted in the soil. The internal stimulus
which might have led to root production is
absent, inhibited, perhaps, by the nutrition
that is plentifully poured in from the tissues
of the plant on which the bud or graft is
growing.
All the various examples of multiplication
and propagation to which allusion has been
made in this chapter are instances of what
may best be called vegetative reproduction or
propagation, and they are seen to be intimately
related with the functions of growth and
nutrition. They represent various methods
of dividing up the individual, and the liberated
