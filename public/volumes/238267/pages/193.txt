Nevertheless it has not wholly lost its chloro-

a larger amount of chlorophyll can be
formed ; the stems, indeed, may even become
distinctly green. Such an observation as
this clearly indicates how closely the forma-
tive processes of a plant are bound up with its
nutrition. But the extreme readiness with

It would be an error to imagine that all
the flowering plants in which the production
of chlorophyll is arrested are therefore to be
