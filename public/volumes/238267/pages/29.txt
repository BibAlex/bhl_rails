THE PLANT AND ITS FOOD 25
A solution of chlorophyll examined by
means of a spectroscope exhibits a number
of very definite absorption bands, due to the
absorption of certain of the coloured rays
of the spectrum (= the dark bands) while
the rest of the light filters through and is
unaffected. There are two very dark bands
in the red region of the spectrum, and others,
mostly fainter and more diffuse, in the yellow,
green and blue-violet regions. Furthermore
the extreme red and the violet end of the
spectrum are also obliterated.
It is found, as might perhaps be anticipated,
that the rays of light which correspond to the
dark absorption bands in the red region of
the spectrum are those principally concerned
in promoting photosynthesis. The other rays
which are absorbed are not indeed without
influence, but they are of comparatively little
consequence from the point of view with which
we are just now concerned. We see from the
foregoing why it is so essential that the chloro-
phyll in the living plant should be directly
exposed to the light from the sky, inasmuch
as any light which has already traversed a
layer of chlorophyll will have been deprived
of those rays that are essential for photo-
synthesis. Such filtered light will of
course be unable to develop photosynthetic
activity in a chlorophyll-containing organ or
organism that may be exposed to it. The
apparent exceptions afforded by plants which
flourish in deep shade are due to the circum-
