THE EPIPHYTES 155
by curiously developed hairs on their leaves.
Examples of this habit are afforded by the
Tillandsias, and other Bromeliads of the
tropical forests of the Western world. The
roots may be altogether laeking in some speeies,
and even when they are produced they merely
serve to attach the plant to a branch, and
function only slightly, or not at all, as water-
absorbing organs. Tillandsia usneoides, com-
mon in the damp West Indian forests, pos-
sesses no roots ; it bears sickle-shaped leaves
which readily become entangled in small
twigs, and the greyish-green festoons of this
plant, as they hang down from the branches,
resemble luxuriant lichens rather than a
flowering plant. Indeed, the resemblance is
so great as readily to deceive any but a care-
ful observer.
The epiphytic tillandsias absorb the whole
of their water supply through remarkable hairs
which clothe the surfaces of the plant. The
accompanying figure illustrates their general
appearance and structure (Fig. 20). From a
slight depression there arises a stalked hair,
the upper portion of which is flattened out
as a membranous expansion consisting of
many cells arranged around the central group
that terminates the stalk. The cell walls
on the upper surface of the hair are very
thick, but they are practically destitute of
a cuticle, and water probably can pass
through them as well as through the walls
on the under surface which are much thinner.
