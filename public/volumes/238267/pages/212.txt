become detached as a sort of bud or gemma,
and so reproduce the parent plant. Mosses
and hverworts are freely reproduced in this
manner. The gemmae are of all shapes and
sizes. They may be produced in a variety
of ways, e, g. as biscuit-like outgrowths from
the leaves, and sometimes, as in the moss
Tetraphis, the whole of the leaves at the
growing point of older stems may develop
into reproductive bodies of this kind. Pro-
pagative outgrowths may also occur on the
underground parts of the stems of mosses and
liverworts, and they are often filled with
reserves of food. Thus they enable the
species to tide over periods of drought, etc.,
which might easily prove fatal to the indi-
vidual. On the return of better conditions
they sprout, and thus reproduce the plant
afresh.
Passing to the higher plants, the vege-
tative propagative processes are seen to
exhibit almost infinite variety. The smallest
parts of some plants are capable of reproducing
the whole â€” as any one may discover who
endeavours to eradicate troublesome weeds,
e. g, bindweed, from a garden. The regular
storage organs, bulbs, tubers, etc., are speci-
ally fitted to serve as propagative organs on
account of the stock of organic food they
contain. Bulbs, for example, consisting of
a short squat stem bearing fleshy leaves,
form the ordinary propagative bodies of lilies.
Even a single scale, detached from the bulb
