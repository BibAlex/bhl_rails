96 PLANT LIFE
Exactly the same happens in the plant.
When a sunflower, or a wheat stem, is bent
by the wind the tissue on the outer side is
stretched, that on the concave side is com-
pressed, and it is easy to see that both con-
ditions tend to straighten the stem again.
Since the axis of the stem is neither pulled
nor compressed, it is obvious that there
would be no advantage in placing the mechan-
ical tissue where the pith is ; the further away
from the axis, i. e. the nearer to the circum-
ference, the more effective it becomes.
But the wind does not act only in the east-
west plane, and plants are apt to be subjected
to stresses from any and all sides. Thus the
girder systems are more complex in their
arrangement, and are so multiplied as to be
ready and meet the stress from whatever
quarter it comes. Moreover, they commonly
receive additional rigidity by being tied
together, in a tangential direction as well as
transversely, by specially strong tissues, at the
nodes.
Now it is evident that this form of mechanical
tissue is not suited for all the conditions that
may be experienced by stems. For example,
the young parts are often elongating, and
sclercnchyma is far too little extensible to
admit of this gro^\i;h. On examining such
a growing region w^e find that although the
sclercnchyma strands are recognisable there,
they are not yet functional. In fact the cells
which compose them are only beginning to
