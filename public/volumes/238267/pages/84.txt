work in opposition to the surface-forces that
tend to retain the water in the soil as a film
which wets the minute particles of which soil
is composed. The root-hairs are very closely
adherent to some of these particles, and
they wrest the water from the film which
surrounds them. This disturbs the equili-
brium of the water as distributed in the soil,
and it causes a constant flow towards the
spot whence it is being abstracted. It is to
this circumstance that much of the drying
effects of plants on soil is due, for the total
amount of root-hair surface of a tree is far
smaller than the area of ground that it will
drain. Another example of the movements
of water in soil is seen in the way that it loses
moisture in dry weather. This is because
evaporation is going on at the surface of the
ground, and water is continually passing up-
wards from the lower levels to replace that
which has passed into the atmosphere as
vapour. The resistance to movements of
water as the films lining the soil particles
become very thin rapidly increases, and thus
ordinary ground does not easily become dry
for a great distance below the surface. Any-
thing that disturbs the continuity of the soil
particles also- interposes a further hindrance
to the movement of water, and this is why a
garden soil that is kept stirred with a hoe
withstands drought so much better than one
that is not cultivated in this way. The
particles of soil that have been stirred by the
