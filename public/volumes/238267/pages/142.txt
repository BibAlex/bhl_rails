138 PLANT LIFE
part of the more intolerant trees such as the
lime. The evergreens, on the other hand, are
usually very long suffering, but, as we have
seen, a severe diminution of water supply is,
or may be, followed by the hurrying up of
those internal processes which culminate in
the differentiation of the separation layer at
the base of the leaves.
Thus a plant which is fitted for average
conditions of water supply (and is often there-
fore called a Mesophyte) may assume certain
of the distinctive characters of plants fitted
for dry conditions, when its supplies of water
are from any cause suddenly interfered wath.
Plants which are specially adapted to dry
conditions are called Xerophytes, and they
are directly contrasted with the Hygrophytes,
i. e. wath those restricted to very wet
surroundings.
In the examples we have just considered,
the adaptedness to dry or xerophytic condi-
tions is attained by reduction of the transpiring
surface. This is a very common feature of
xerophytes,^ and it forcibly illustrates the
limitation of one important function (that of
1 Not all plants with reduced leaf surface are xero-
phytes. The large Water Rush {Scirpus lacustris) used in
the manufacture of rush-bottomed chairs is an instance.
The reduction of the leaves, and the transference of the
photosynthetic function to the stems of these plants is
certainly to be correlated with mechanical requirements.
A plant built on the plan of the water rush would
be an impossibility if any weight of green foliage had to
be sustained.
