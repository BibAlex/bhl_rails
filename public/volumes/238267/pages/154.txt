150 PLANT LIFE
The epiphytes form a large class, and they
include many of the humbler members of
the vegetable kingdom as well as a consider-
able number drawn from the highest ranks of
flowering plants.
They exhibit all grades of adaptedness for
the acquisition and storage of water. At the
lowest end we find some of the simpler forms,
especially amongst the algae and mosses,
which will stand complete dessication. But
there are other species of mosses, and especially
of the nearly related family of liverworts,
which have advanced far beyond the attitude of
mere tolerance, and not only exhibit adapta-
tion for rapid water absorption, but also
possess means of storing it during a time of
plenty. In some liverworts tuberous bodies
are formed, and during the dry season these
alone persist, to break out into growth as
soon as the rains commence. In the leafy
forms it often happens that some or all of
the leaves are modified so as to form bottle-
like receptacles (Frullania, Physiotium, etc.)
for water.
It is amongst the ferns and flowering plants,
however, that we find the greatest diversity,
and perhaps we might add perfection, in the
adaptations to solve the problems connected
with a precarious and intermittent water
supply.
It is true that the majority of the highly
specialised epiphytes are more or less restricted
to regions of large and fairly frequent rainfall,
