CELL-NUCLEUS— FERTILISATION 247
of the ovule the embryo begins to develop.
Gradually the ovule changes mto the seed.
Reserve materials of food aeeunuilatc within
it, and are most frequently stored either
in the growing endosperm, or partly (seldom
wholly) in tlie sporangium wall (nucellus,
perisperm). If the embryo reaehes any con-
siderable size within the seed, it may presently
destroy these tissues, and absorb the nutritive
contents into its own body. When this
happens, some part of the young plantlet
usually becomes thickened and so forms the
repository for the food. Most commonly it
is the seed leaves (cotyledons), as in the
bean, or it may be the young stem below
them, as in the brazil-nut, which thus becomes
charged with the reserves of food.
In whatever w^ay the food material is dis-
posed, however, it is always so situated as to
be readily available when the young plantlet
starts into growth, on the germination of the
seed.
It does not invariably happen that con-
siderable stores of food after this fashion
await the embryo on its awakening to its
new life. Many of the flowering plants have
followed other lines than that of transmitting
to a relatively small posterity large accumula-
tions of hereditary capital. The commonest
alternative is seen in the production of vast
quantities of small seeds. The seed and the
contained embryo have been well cared for
during the earlier stages — but they are cast
