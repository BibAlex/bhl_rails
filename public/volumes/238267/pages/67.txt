veins which are left, and constitute the
delicate network of skeleton leaves on
macerating leaves in Avater. The vascular
bundles are rather complicated in structure,
and they represent the most highly specialised
tissues of the plant body. A vascular
bundle consists of wood (xylem) and bast
(phloem), and a thin band of tissue known
as cambium often lies between them. They
anastomose freely in the oak leaf, and in
the stalk they are collected into a few large
vascular strands which join the vascular
tissues of the stem. Similarly the root pos-
sesses vascular strands, and these are like-
wise joined with those of the stem or trunk,
and thus there is a general continuity of the
vascular tissue throughout the plant. The
water enters the root from the soil, passes up
the trunk, and flows thence into the leaves,
travelling through certain specialised cell
elements of the wood. In the leaf it is dis-
tributed to various kinds of cells, and especially
to those containing the bulk of the chloro-
phyll (P, in Fig. 9) in which photosynthesis
is especially active. The greater part of it
evaporates from the cells into the large air
spaces which are present in the leaf substance,
and the contained air is thus saturated with
aqueous vapour.
The cuticle, which forms the outermost
membrane of the epidermis, would prevent
the exit of any water, either as liquid or
vapour, if it were perfectly continuous. In the
