INTRODUCTION 11
incalculably more obscure than those with
which we have, in a measure, become familiar
in ordinary chemical and physical researches,
nevertheless they are similarly influenced by
physical conditions, and they obey the same
chemical laws. The chief dif{erenees between
the reactions in the living body and those
which occur outside it seem to lie mainly in
the greater complexity of the substances con-
cerned, as well as in the necessity for accurate
adjustment of the reacting substances towards
each other in ways which we can at present
but feebly imitate. An important feature in
this matter of adjustment consists in that
state of aggregation which we call colloidal,
which is so characteristic of the framework
of living things, and by virtue of which
the physical conditions for many chemical
reactions are provided.
A simple example perhaps may serve to
make the point clearer. A piece of platinum
wire will not bring about the ignition of a
mixture of coal gas and air, but if the plati-
num be finely divided, e. g. in the form known
as platinum black or spongy platinum, it
will do so. If the platinum be still further
divided, it assumes the condition known as
colloidal platinum, and it is then capable
of promoting many other chemical changes in
a manner closely resembling, and perhaps
essentially similar to, that characteristic of
many organic ferments.
Of course it is not meant to suggest that the
