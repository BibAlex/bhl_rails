of the huge leaves. The midrib of each leaf
is a massive structure, and it possesses a
considerable degree of rigidity. The blade,
which it traverses, forms a long oval expansion,
and thus exposes to the air a very considerable
surface. Any one acquainted only with the
banana as it grows in a plant house, where
the air is always quiescent, might easily
imagine that these large unbroken leaves
must be remarkably well provided with
mechanical tissue in order to maintain their
outline intact. As a matter of fact, however,
precisely the reverse is the case. The veins
run out almost at right angles from the
midrib to the margin, and anastomose very
little with each other. There is thus no
mechanical reason why the leaf should not
be easily torn, and as a matter of fact this
is what actually happens to a plant grown
out of doors. The whole blade is reduced to
a number of separate flaps or strips, each
firmly attached, of course, to the midrib.
Hence they can easily give to the breeze, and
the banana escapes the overthrow to which
it would be liable were it to hoist such large
leaves, if unbreakable, in the teeth of the
wind. The efficiency of the leaf surface is
practically unimpaired by the tearing, because
the vascular bundles, running parallel to each
other, are not broken across, and their
functions as conducting channels to and from
the midrib to the green leaf surface are not
interfered with in any way.
