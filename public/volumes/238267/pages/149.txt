of the rains. Everything is almost complete,
and is ready to push above the ground at a
few days, or even a few hours, notice.
This form of response to periods of drought,
namely the capacity to store up food, and
even water, is very widespread, but one must
not imagine that all bulbous plants are to be
looked on as xerophytes, though the bulbous
habit undoubtedly does confer on its possessor
the power or faculty of colonising localities
such as those just indicated. Many of our
spring woodland plants are bulbous or
tuberous ; but in their case it is not so much
a question of drought as one of light.
The bulbous character of the wild hyacinth,
for example, enables it to thrive in shady
woods, even under beech and hornbeam, for,
hke its relatives in the open field, it is provided
with a large stock of available food in the
bulb scales, which w^as manufactured and
stored up during the preceding spring.
When the warm weather returns after the
winter the hyacinths rapidly sprout, and their
green leaves are fully exposed to the light.
Later on, however, as the trees unfold their
leaves the light soon weakens, and little or
no photosynthesis can go on under the dense
shade of a beech wood. But by this time the
plants have done their work, and have already
laid up a stock of food for the following year.
Their leaves die down, and only the ripening
seed capsules reveal their presence in the
wood.
