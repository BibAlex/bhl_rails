proportion to the bulk of the funjrrus, the
better this process of absorption will go on.
Consequently, we ean easily understand that,
up to a eertain point, the simpler the structure,
and the more independent the individual
mycelial hyphse are of one another, the more
thoroughly the plant is adapted to explore its
nutrient surroundings and to absorb its food.
As with the root-hairs of a root, increase of
surface is the keynote of the performance.
We find that all non-green plants tend towards
this adapted simplicity of organisation, though
the higher green plants have far to go before
they can shake off the shackles of complexity.
It is only from an anthropomorphic stand-
point, then, that we can regard these plants
as merely degraded or degenerate, for they
are just as accurately adapted to obtain
their more specialised form of food as is the
complex green plant in relation to its simpler
sources of nutrition.
Furthermore, from this physiological point
of view, the fungi are even more complex
than their green ancestors, for they do not
merely absorb, but they also profoundly
influence the nature of the substratum in
which they live by means of the ferments
and other substances which they excrete.
Some of these non-green plants show an almost
diabolical ingenuity of physiological action,
as, for example, when some of the parasites,
by emitting an attractive excretion, cause
their victims to actually grow towards them.
