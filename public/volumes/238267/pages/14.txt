10 PLANT LIFE
inorganic worlds now appears less sharply
defined than formerly, and many reactions
which used to be regarded as immediately
and essentially associated with life and active
vitality are now recognised as being sus-
ceptible of a less mystical interpretation.
Thus it has become more and more clearly
apparent during the last few years how great
a share the various ferments may take in
promoting those reactions which formerly
were regarded as inseparable from the living
organism.
Now although these ferments, in the
narrower sense, are doubtless the products of
protoplasmic activity, they can initiate and
carry out their specific reactions in a test-
tube under conditions which are incom-
patible with the concurrence of life in the
ordinary, or indeed in any real, sense of the
word. Evidence is accumulating to show
that the ferments owe their specific activities
to their physical structure, and that they
approximate to the singular class of cata-
lytic inorganic bodies, which, like them,
are able to promote and accelerate certain
chemical changes without themselves under-
going destruction.
Indeed, as time goes on, exact investigation
is continually lifting corners of the curtain
which conceals the mysteries of life, and the
glimpses we have caught tend to suggest that
although the reactions which are going on
in the living laboratory are (at present)
