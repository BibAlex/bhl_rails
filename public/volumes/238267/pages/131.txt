ADAPTATION 127
CHAPTER XI
ADAPTATION
The sketch of the formation and distribu-
tion of mechanical tissues attempted in the
last few chapters, raises rather forcibly the
question of how the existence and elaboration
of the green leaf has succeeded in so pro-
foundly affecting, even in this one particular,
the construction of the whole organism. Of
course, we recognise that the influence of the
leaf depends on its position as the chief bearer
of the chlorophyll of the plant, and to this
extent our question becomes more precise.
But if we limit ourselves for the moment to
the consideration of this single problem of
mechanical adaptation and correlation, in
order to try to get a clear issue, we find that
the issue is far from being clear, and the
approaches to the problem itself bristle with
difficulties.
It is true that we can readily find, in our
analysis of the influence of the leaf, a very
complete justification for the various me-
chanical adaptations and correlations which
we have learnt to recognise. It is but one
aspect of the much larger generalisation that
there is a real and obvious relation between
