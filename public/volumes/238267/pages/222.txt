vegetative aetivity. Loeb and others have
shown this to be experimentally possible
with eggs of various animals ; and although it
has not yet been satisfactorily demonstrated
in plants, this is largely owing to the very
small size of the egg^ and to its ordinary
inaccessibility for purposes of this kind of
experiment. There is no doubt that the
essential processes are identical in animals
and plants, and, moreover, we are aware of
instances amongst the latter in which eggs
can be stimulated, though by indirect means,
to grow and develop in the absence of
fertilisation.
We do not as yet at all understand — and
yet this lies very near to the root of the whole
matter — why the sexual change should pro-
duce two kinds of states. We speak of these
states as male and female respectively in the
higher forms, but there is no detectable
diSercnee between the gametes of the sim-
plest organisms. Why there should be this
difference of state, and why the coalescence
of two individuals should not only obliterate
it, but give special vigour to the resulting cell
we are not as yet in a position to declare.
As we pass from the lower to the higher
ranks of the vegetable kingdom, we find
that the primary physiological differences by
which sex is first differentiated are betrayed
by secondary changes which enable the male
to be distinguished from the female gamete.
The general trend of the distinction is un-
