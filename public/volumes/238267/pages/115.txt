CLIMBING AND WATER PLANTS 111
growing points. Consequently the stem is
gradually falling downwards as the older
anchoring branches die and rot away. A
further cause of the same slackening of the
stem is to be discovered in some climbers,
depending on the odd circumstance that the
growth in length of the stem continues long
after it would have ceased in ordinary
plants.
The general effect of this elongation of the
stem below the forest roof, in whatever way
it is produced, is to relieve it entirely of all
danger from tensile stress. Hence the stem
can now, to the great advantage of the plant,
become almost entirely concerned in provid-
ing the means for the transmission of w^ater
from the roots to the mass of foliage above.
A secondary consequence also is to be seen
in the development of the other tissues by
which the food material manufactured by
this foliage is distributed in the plant. If
much of it is withdrawn to the roots the stem
is rich in phloem, but it is not especially
so if, as is generally the case, most of the
manufactured food is immediately utilised
in the copious production of flowers and fruit.
The structure of such specialised climbers
as these is capable of being interpreted as
the result of a compromise, so to speak,
between the opposing functions of nutrition
and mechanics. The compromise is more
obvious than in the majority of land plants
because the issues are more strictly defined.
