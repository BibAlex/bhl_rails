by which they have been enabled easily to
bring about these quite definite and charac-
teristic changes of form. It is evident that
the physiological adjustments must be very
delicate, for all attempts to imitate them have
so far ended in failure. But it is just on this
quality that the more educated fungal
parasites depend for their subsistence, and
it is a quality which they share with other
specialised vegetable parasites, as well as with
the gall-producing animals.
It has already been said that all stages can
be traced between a saprophytic and a para-
sitic habit as exemplified in the life histories
of different fungi. Sometimes it is possible
to trace the change from one to the other in a
single individual. This may occur either by
the fungus acquiring additional powers of
attack or it may happen through a diminution
of the power of resisting infection on the part
of the victim.
As an example of the first of these we may
select a common brown mould known as
Botrytis cinerea. Like many of these fungi,
Botrytis represents the mould form of one of
the cup fungi (Peziza).
If the spores of the peziza fructification are
sown on a living plant, say a carrot, they
usually fail to infect it ; but if they happen to
fall on to a dead or decaying portion of the
carrot, they grow and produce a mycelium
which spreads through the dead tissues.
And this mycelium can now invade the living
