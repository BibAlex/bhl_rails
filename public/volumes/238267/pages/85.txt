ROOTS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS 81
hoe are separated from each other, and thus
the continuity of their surfaces with that of
the lower soil is largely interrupted. At the
same time the broken, loose soil serves to
check evaporation, inasmuch as it shelters
the lower unbroken (therefore continuous) soil
both from the sun and from the drying
influence of currents of air. It is a matter
of common experience that if plants are
grown in unwatered soil long enough, they
begin to droop and wilt. This means that
the root-hairs are not able to extract enough
water from the ground to keep pace with that
which is lost by the plant. Wilting takes
place when the water contents of the soil fall
below a certain amount, and this varies greatly
in different soils, but is fairly constant for
each particular kind. Thus, in sand a plant
may utilise all the water down to about 1 -2 % ;
while in heavy clay the water ceases to be
available as soon as its content sinks below
about 25 %. It is evident that there is
probably some relation between the physical
state of the soil, and its ^physiologically avail-
able water content. And this turns out to
be the case. The fine particles of clay, with
their relatively enormous surface, retain far
more water than sand with its large particles
and relatively small surface. Ingenious ex-
periments on soil in centrifugal machines have
shoA\Ti that approximately the same amount
of force is required to clear out water from
clay so as to leave 25 % remaining as is
