24 PLANT LIFE
as regards the direction of the Hght is, however,
a very widespread one, and we shall meet
with it again, although in a modified form, in
studying the behaviour of the highest plants ;
for the property of irritability which in
Chlamydomonas finds expression in the inde-
pendent movement of the organism as a whole,
is a necessary condition of existence for every
plant to a greater or less extent. Only in
this way is it possible for it to place itself
en rapport with a variable and changing
environment, and hence with the physical
conditions under which it lives.
A brief survey of the more salient physical
characters of chlorophyll will not be out of
place here, inasmuch as they stand in sugges-
tive relation to the properties of this remark-
able substance.
It is easy to extract the green colour of plants
by soaking a quantity of grass in strong
alcohol. A dark green liquid will thus be
obtained which if examined by reflected light
will appear to be not green, but blood-red in
colour. This property of fluorescence
is not confined to chlorophyll, but is shared
by many other organic and some inorganic
substances, and it affords useful hints as to
their more intimate chemical architecture. A
solution, prepared by the rough-and-ready
method indicated above, is of course not pure
chlorophyll, but it contains several other
colouring matters which can be separated from
it by appropriate means.
