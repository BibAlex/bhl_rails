44 PLANT LIFE
the slippery gelatinous character of its mem-
branes. The cells of the filaments arc com-
monly elongated, but each one behaves very
much as an independent unit. The effect of
one cell upon another is of the slightest under
ordinary circumstances. Each divides trans-
versely, and so multiplies, independently of
its neighbours. The filament thus grows in
length, but it usually has no distinguishable
base or apex, nor does it branch. Altogether
the organising effect of the cell union is as
yet of the very simplest kind.
Another common alga, Cladophora, presents
quite a different state of affairs {Fig. 6). This
plant, like the foregoing, consists of cells placed
end to end, but there the similarity ceases.
Each cell is definitely part of the organism.
The filament is attached by a specialised basal
cell and it increases in length solely by trans-
verse division of the apical cell. Branches
may spring from the cells behind the aj^ex,
and they then commonly appear in regular
sequence, the youngest branches arising as
outgrowths from the anterior (e. g. nearer the
growing point of the stem) end of the cell
nearest the apex.
Not only, therefore, is the plant as a whole
organised in such a way that there is a base,
as distinct from an apex, but this distinction
is also impressed on every cell ^ which helps
1 In a certain sense the expression cell is not
appropriate to the structural unit of Cladophora, since
each cell really represents a sjTicytium (p. 21) because
its protoplasm contains several nuclei.
