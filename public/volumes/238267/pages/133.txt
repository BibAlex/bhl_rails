ADAPTATION 129
how the production of the mechanical tissue
is effected, and how the remarkable and
evident correspondence between its distribu-
tion within the plant and the various condi-
tions imposed by the environment is brought
about.
It might seem to be a simple affair to pro-
duce, or at least to promote, the development
of mechanical tissue by merely subjecting a
part of the plant to an artificial stress. But
even if we could do this, it would still leave
the kernel of the matter untouched. As a
matter of fact, however, the attempt has
often been ma.de, but the results have been
for the most part entirely negative. Voch-
ting, for example, endeavoured to induce the
appropriate formation of strengthening tissue
by attaching weights to plants in various ways,
and in a number of different positions. In
no single instance did he get a clearly positive
result. But what cannot be done by merely
applying an external force, can readily be
accomplished if the requisite nutritive func-
tions, and perhaps other internal processes
also, become involved. We know how the
growth of muscle is stimulated by use,
consequent, at least in part, on the better
nutrition which an improved condition of
circulation ensures. An analogous instance
is furnished by plants. Vochting, experi-
menting with certain kinds of cabbages,
found that after grafting heavy tops on to
younger and thinner stems the latter forth-
