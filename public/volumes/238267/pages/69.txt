THE GREEN LEAF C5
when the siirphis vapour is constantly passing
away throuf^h the stomata.
But the stomata are important as the means
of gaseous intake, as well as for the output of
water vapour and other gases. Now, although
the apertures are very numerous, the total sum
of their areas reckoned as a fraction of the
surface of the leaf is still very small. The
amount of carbon dioxide in the air is likewise
very minute, and yet the intake of carbon
dioxide is very large. For many years the
explanation of this apparent anomaly re-
mained obscure, but investigations revealed
the fact that the leaf actually absorbs as much
carbon dioxide as if its chlorophyll-containing
cells were exposed freely to air, and wxre not
covered by a membrane or epidermis at all.
The explanation is to be found in a remark-
able modification of the ordinary conditions
of diffusion through their perforated mem-
branes. It is to the effect that when the
orifices become small enough the rate of
diffusion through them increases, area for
area, up to certain limits. Or to express it
more precisely; while the rate for relatively
large holes varies very nearly as the areas of
the holes, it varies as the diameters of small
holes if these are sufficiently spaced apart.
In these respects, then, the leaf is an organ
admirably adapted for the discharge, in the
most efficient manner possible, of the im-
portant function of photosynthesis. TJic
