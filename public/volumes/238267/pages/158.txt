154 PLANT LIFE
epiphytic members of a very different family,
the aroids, have also, and independently,
acquired the faculty of developing a velamen
which is closely similar to that formed by
the orchids.
It is very easy to see that the presence of
velamen is of great use to a plant growing
as an epiphyte, but that is not at all the same
thing as accounting for its presence. It
certainly enables the plant to take advantage
of such positions as the trunks of trees, where
it becomes lifted up to the light, and enjoys
various other advantages. But how has it
come about that it is just developed in these
orchids (and aroids) in response to their
particular needs, whilst the innumerable
epiphytes belonging to other families of
plants have not altered their roots in this
striking manner ? We cannot tell â€” at any
rate at present.
The same difficulty in giving a real explana-
tion is inherent in every problem of plant (and
animal) form, but it is often slurred over,
especially when the structure is obviously of
use in a particular connection. To describe
it as an adaptation to a particular condition
of the environment is merely to state an
impression. Such descriptive phrases furnish
no explanation of origin, nor do they illum-
inate in any material degree the hidden
relations of cause and effect.
There are other flowering epiphytes which
absorb water not by their roots at all, but
