220 PLANT LIFE
zygote combines within itself the slightly
different properties borne by the egg and
sperm, in so far as they are of different
origin. This must be specially true when
the gametes spring from different parents,
for there is no doubt as to the transference,
by means of the gametes, of the hereditary
qualities of the organisms from which the
gametes have sprung.
Experience teaches us that the egg and
sperm contribute equally towards the char-
acters of the plant which will develop from
the zygote. The reason for this almost
certainly lies in the preponderant share taken
by the nucleus in determining the organisa-
tion of the individual. The sperm and egg
contain about equal parts of the essential
constituents of the nucleus, and this explains
the circumstance that the minute sperm is as
potent, from the point of view of the trans-
mission of hereditary characters, as is the
bulky egg.
These two functions, rejuvenescence and the
combination of diverse hereditary characters,
then, are the most obvious results achieved
by fertilisation. Probably the first-named
function, rejuvenescence, is the more primi-
tive, and the chemical affinity between the
egg and sperm first arose and was maintained
by the primitive conditions that made fertili-
sation a conditio sine qua non of further
development. But the second was inevi-
tably bound up with it. This latter circum-
