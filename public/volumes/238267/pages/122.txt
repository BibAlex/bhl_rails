the same, but the real causes responsible for
its appearance are equally obscure. The most
we can at present say is that in the exercise
of the function new conditions are introduced
which lead to the supply of abundant nutritive
material, together with the power to use it.
But the mode of interaction of all the inner
functional conditions is far too complex for
us to express the matter in any rough-and-
ready formula. Least of all is it useful to say,
in anthropomorphic fashion, that structural
peculiarities like those of climbers are due to
the plant having adapted itself to its environ-
ment. We readily discern that the plant is
adapted, but we know remarkably little about
the processes whereby this interrelation has
been brought about. It conduces neither to
clearness of judgment nor to the advance
of science to mistake more or less fanciful
descriptions for real explanations of complex
phenomena.
Groups of plants such as climbers are
interesting for the very reason that they serve
to illustrate the fact that any species, what-
ever its ancestral origin, may join a specialised
biological class provided it has the capacity
for developing an appropriate structure.
Another biological group is constituted by
the higher water plants. These have, for the
most part, descended from terrestrial fore-
bears, and they display many significant
features of interest in connection with their
more recent environmental conditions. Some
