persists are the chromosomes. These bodies,
as already indicated, take up a very definite
position, and now lie in an equatorial plane
half way between the two poles to which
the spindle fibres converge.
Each chromosome then divides longitudin-
ally into two symmetrical halves, probably
along the line of the parallel streaks of chro-
matin described above. The two halves then
diverge, and the daughter chromosomes at once
retreat along the spindle fibres, to form two
groups, one at either pole. The daughter
chromosomes swell up, a nuclear wall is
formed around them, some of the substances
which escape from them run together and
form new nucleoli, and thus the two daughter
nuclei are formed. A cell w^all is often de-
veloped across the spindle which persists for
a time between the two nuclei which have
thus been constituted, and nuclear division is
then followed by cell division. When the cell
wall is not so formed, a binucleate, or later
a multinucleate, arrangement is produced.
The main conclusions that emerge from a
consideration of the facts thus briefly out-
lined are : (1) The number of the chromo-
somes is constant, and individual peculiari-
ties in form and size are seen to reappear
whenever the chromosomes are sufficiently
contracted as to become sufficiently clearly
recognisable. (2) The chromosomes, when
they divide, transmit their peculiarities to
each daughter chromosome. In other words,
