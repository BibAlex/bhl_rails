CELL-NUCLEUSâ€” FERTILISATION 249
our attention on the manifold variety ex-
hibited by plants, the adaptedness of s})ccies
to thcii^ environment is always one of the
most striking of their many qualities. But,
as we have seen, this adaptedness is intrinsic-
ally the result of the inner constitution of
the plant, which impels it of necessity to
develop in this or that particular manner.
Only those plants whose constitutions are such
as to cause their development to be adapted
to a given environment can flourish under the
particular conditions imposed by it.
Adaptedness is often achieved in an indirect
fashion, but it must be susceptible of realisa-
tion in some way or another if the individual
is to survive.
Every species, just as every individual of
the species, has to face its critical problems.
And the problems of the species are really
the same, though sometimes disguised under
different forms, as those which confront the
individual. The race problems are solved by
the individuals, often in a wonderful way.
Thus many tolerably heavy fruits are dis-
persed by a wing-like outgrowth which delays
their descent to the ground. But at an
earlier stage this wing-like outgrowth is
generally green, and so may well have helped
in the nutritive processes. We can state with
confidence that it was not developed in order
to aid in the dispersal of the fruit, but that it
arose as the result of far backward-reaching
correlations of ultimate structure and cheroical
