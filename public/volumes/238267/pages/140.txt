136 PLANT LIFE
The behaviour of plants at the different
seasons of the year is instruetive from this
point of view.
The habit of shedding the leaves on the
approaeh of winter which is so characteristic
of the majority of our trees and shrubs is
often regarded as an adaptation to physiologi-
cal drought rather than as directly due to
the action of the lowering of temperature on
leaves. Although there is plenty of water
in the soil in winter, the temperature of the
ground is too low to enable the trees to absorb
it freely enough. It is true there are evergreen
trees which do not throw off their leaves in
autumn, but they generally exhibit definite
structural features indicative of a normally
slow rate of transpiration, i. e. of water lost
as vapour through the stomata. The leaves
are leathery or small, the stomata are compara-
tively few, whilst various other features point
to an economy in the matter of water expendi-
ture. The deciduous trees and shrubs, which
shed their leaves in winter, are relatively more
prodigal of water during the warmer season,
thus compensating for the alternate periods
of inactivity.
Without doubt there is much to be urged in
favour of the deciduous habit being regarded
primarily as an adaptation to a reduction of
the water supply. This argument is strength-
ened by a consideration of plants which
quite definitely respond to periodic drought,
physical or physiological, by casting off their
