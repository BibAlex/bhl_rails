photosynthesis) by another factor which also
influences the process of nutrition as a whole.
The reduction of leaf surface, which is of
intermittent or annual occurrence in our every-
day vegetation, may become the normal state
of a more specialised xerophyte. The leaves
may be very small, or they may even be
practically absent so far as photosynthetic
function is concerned. In such plants, how-
ever, this office may continue to be discharged
by the stems, which remain green, and thus
to some extent may take the place of the
leaves. Their special advantage in this con-
nection is mainly due to their structure, and
to the relatively small number of stomata,
which enables them to check the escape of
water from the plant.
It is a singular fact that when a species
or race has once exhibited a tendency towards
the loss or atrophy of an organ, e. g. the leaf,
the descendants commonly appear to be un-
able to check it. If any of them vary in such
a way as to increase their green surface, this
is effected not by enlarging their diminished
leaves, but by flattening and specialising
some other organ. Sometimes the process
may even be seen to accompany the diminu-
tion of the leaves, as in some species of acacia.
In Acacia melanoxylon, for example, we find
the leaf stalk gradually flattening, and
assuming the functions generally undertaken
by the blade, which becomes completely
atrophied. Other species of acacia show the
