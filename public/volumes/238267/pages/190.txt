186 PLANT LIFE
of modifying certain rootlets to form suckers,
which then become attached to, and penetrate
the tissues of, the underground parts of neigh-
bouring plants. Although they have thus
taken a considerable step on the road to
parasitism, they are still not very dependent
on the advantage they have gained. They
retain their green leaves, and they will often
continue to grow even when there are no suit-
able hosts which they can attack.
There are other species, not very distantly
related to the foregoing, which have advanced
much further. The Broomrapes (Orobanche)
consist of a number of species, each parasitic
on some kind of flowering plant. One of the
common species grows on the roots of the
broom, but it betrays no obvious sign of its
existence until the flowering shaft is formed.
The vegetative part of the plant consists of
a small tuberous mass which is closely ad-
herent to the root of the broom from which,
by means of its sucker-like roots, it derives
the whole of its food. The bodily structure
is simplified, and the broomrape consists of
little more than a small underground tuber
which produces a few specialised roots. It
only shows itself above ground when the
time comes for it to put forth its large and
rapidly developing flowering shaft, on which
are borne the reddish flowers and small
brownish-yellow leaves. Its tiny seeds,
like those of* some other parasites, are re-
markable in that they do not even begin
