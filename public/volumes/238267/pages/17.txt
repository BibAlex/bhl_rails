THE PLANT AND ITS FOOD 13
CHAPTER II
THE PLANT AND ITS FOOD
One of the most striking points of difference
between the animals and the plants consists
in the evident and purposive motility of the
former, and the apparent (but only apparent)
immobility of the latter. Nearly all animals
more or less actively seek their food, and
ingest it in a solid form; and even those
species which, like the adult oyster, are
tolerably stationary, nevertheless exhibit some
sort of motion by which currents of water,
bearing particles of food are drawn into their
bodies.
The general tendency in the plant kingdom,
on the other hand, has been to produce
relatively stationary forms which do not
actively pursue their food, but passively
absorb it from their surroundings. Many of
the most primitive plants, however, share
with the animals a faculty of vigorous loco-
motory movement, swimming through the
water in which they live by means of vibratile
filaments or cilia. What is it, then, which
has caused the higher members of the one
kingdom to abandon this locomotory activ-
ity while those of the other have not only
