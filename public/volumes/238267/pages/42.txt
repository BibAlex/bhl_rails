PLANT LIFE
So far we have only considered aquatic
forms of algae, but there are certain kinds
which grow in damp situations on land.
Amongst these is Prasiola, which is not un-
frequent in certain localities (Fig. 4). Its body
is composed of a leaf-like expansion of cells
which lower down form a contracted stalk-like

body attached to the soil by means of special
filamentously elongated cells called rhizoids.
The cells which compose the substance of the
thin leaf-like body are all alike, but the
common walls, as befits a terrestrial organism,
are more cartilaginous and tough than those
of the more aquatic types. Even repro-
duction is correlated with the change of
habitat from water to the land. The cells
which become detached from the frond are
