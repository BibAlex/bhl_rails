SEXUAL REPRODUCTION 213
which we may call the gametes, are concerned
in the process, and they invariably coalesce
to form one â€” the zygote.
From the zygote, which is always a single
cell, there springs a new generation which
may multiply in various ways, but sooner
or later a process supervenes which leads
once more to the formation of new gametes.
These in their turn may coalesce in appropriate
pairs and so form new zygotes.
In the more primitive unicellular plants the
sexual cells or gametes are often apparently
precisely similar to each other. They may
also be externally indistinguishable from the
ordinary vegetative organism itself, or at
any rate from the newly formed individuals
which have just arisen by vegetative propaga-
tion. Nevertheless the sexual individuals are
physiologically very distinct. If it were not
so, they would scarcely be definitely impelled
to unite, and to unite only in pairs.
Closer examination reveals the fact that
in sexual union the coalescence of the gametes
is a very intimate one. Not only do the
extra-nuclear protoplasms flow together, but
the two nuclei also unite and mingle their
contents in common. A study of the higher
types, both of animals and plants, leads to
the further conclusion that it is in the nuclear
fusion, more than in anything else, that the
significance of the sexual act is to be sought.
We shall return to this point later, but it will
be convenient and profitable in the first
