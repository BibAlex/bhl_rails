CLIMBING AND WATER PLANTS 107
CHAPTER X
SPECIAL FEATURES OF CLIMBING AND
WATER PLANTS
There are several groups of plants in
which the stems are more or less exposed to
forces similar to those commonly affecting
the roots we have been considering. We find
that such stems often exhibit corresponding
deviations from the normal stem structure,
whereby they become enabled to withstand
these special directions of stress.
One of the most interesting examples is
furnished by the great group of climbing
plants. The climbers have sprung from non-
climbing ancestors, in the different ranks
of the vegetable kingdom, but we here are
concerned only with those which belong to
the flowering plants. Many obvious points
of close similarity are shared by all climbers,
however distantly related they may be in
other respects. They usually possess rela-
tively thin main stems which are dependent
on other objects, bushes, trees and the like,
for their support. By growing to the tops
of the latter they are enabled to expose their
own abundant foliage freely to the light
without the economic disadvantages attendant
