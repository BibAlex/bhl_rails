THE FUNGI 169
fragments of the carbohydrate are once more
cast forth into the inorganic world as simple
and vitally useless molecules.
Let us take a specific instance by way of
illustration of the foregoing consideration.
Wood is an almost imperishable substance, at
least under ordinary circumstances, and so
long as it is preserved from the attacks of
living organisms. But timber is liable to the
depredations of a large number of different
fungi which, under conditions favourable to
their existence, are able to use it as food.
They act on it by various ferments, bringing
some of its constituents into solution, absorb-
ing and partially breaking them down. The
wood is soon reduced to a friable mass,
weighing far less than the original timber, owing
to the decomposition of its chemical substance,
and the elimination of some of the products
of its oxidation. Even the solid residue will
soon disappear under the further influence
of a succession of micro-organisms, which will
finally disintegrate whatever the fungus may
have left. Thus, in course of time, the whole
of the chemical materials out of which the
timber was constructed will again become
part of the floating capital of nature, available
for the constructive processes of new organ-
isms, or destined for yet other purposes in the
chemical change going on in the world.
Most timbers are liable to infection by
fungi when they are stored in a damp condi-
tion. The danger is greatly accentuated if
