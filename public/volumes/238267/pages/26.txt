22 PLANT LIFE
of the sun, for its energy, reaching us through
the mediation of the plant, is the fons et
origo Oi our existence. How, then, docs tlie
Chlamydomonas proceed by means of its
chlorophyll to make these more complex
food substances ?
Although we are not as yet fully acquainted
with all the steps of the process, we already
know enough to enable us to sketch in out-
line the main sequence of events. Putting
the story in its simplest form, we may say that
the carbonic acid, which is formed when
carbon dioxide dissolves in water, is con-
tinuously broken up as the result of the action
of sunlight of a suitable intensity upon the
chlorophyll of the living plant. Oxygen
is liberated, and organic compounds, usually
sugars, are produced inside the cell. When
the reaction is sufficiently rapid, so that the
concentration of sugar reaches a certain
strength, starch often makes its appearance,
but it is merely a secondary product, depending
on the prior formation and accumulation
within the cell of sugar in sufficient quantity.
The earlier stages of sugar formation are still
obscure, but there is little doubt that form-
aldehyde (the formalin of commerce) is pro-
duced during the process. This substance has
been used as the starting-point for the synthesis
of sugars in the laboratory, and although it
is difficult to detect it with certainty in the
plant there are strong reasons for considering
that it really is formed as an intermediate
