to bring out the more salient features of this
remarkable strueture, which is generally known
as the velamen of the orchid root (Pig. 19).
The cell walls of the velamen are strength-
ened by bars of thickening, which gives them
a spiral or netted appearance under the
microscope. The function of the velamen
as a whole is to act as a sort of sponge which
soaks up liquid falling on it with extreme
rapidity. Thus the plant is able quickly to
replenish its supplies of water during a shower.
In many orchids the bases of the stems and
sometimes the leafy joints are swollen with
the so-called pseudobulbs, which form
additional storehouses for the water thus
obtained. During the periods which inter-
vene between the rains, the plant often
throws off its leaves, its flowers drawing on
the water suppHes stored in the pseudobulb.
The surface of the latter becomes more and
more wrinkled as its storage cells become
depleted of their water contents.
The roots, although specialised in the way
described above, have retained, in many in-
stances at any rate, the power of growing like
ordinary ones if they should happen to pene-
trate the substratum. This sometimes occurs
when there is sufficient vegetable detritus
caught in the orchid clump, or when the root
penetrates a piece of damp rotten wood.
Root-hairs are then produced, and the velamen
may be scarcely produced at all.
It is a remarkable fact that some of the
