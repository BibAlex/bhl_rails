SEXUAL REPRODUCTION 221
stance was fraught with tremendous conse-
quences which were destined to influence the
course of evolution of the entire organic
world, of animals no less than plants.
One of the most singular features of the
sexual act, in so far as it can be actually
observed, consists in the attraction which
the gametes exercise on each other. It is
by this means that fertilisation is rendered
possible, and is definitely secured.
As the differentiation of the male and female
gametes becomes more pronounced, the im-
mobile egg is ardently sought by the motile
sperms, and the latter are evidently stimulated
by something which emanates from the egg.
Even when the sperms are not themselves
vigorously motile, they are often, as in the
case of the flowering plants, conducted to
the egg in an analogous, though more indirect,
method in which attraction plays a part.
For the pollen tube, in which the male gametes
are contained, grows into the cavity of the
ovary, and thence to the ovule in which the
egg is formed, and it there discharges them in
such a way as to render fertilisation almost
inevitable.
But it is simpler to choose a less specialised
type than the flowering plant in order to
become familiar with the essential facts of
fertilisation. For this purpose some of the
brown seaweeds (Fucus) afford admirable
material. They produce large quantities of
eggs and sperms in little conceptacles situated
