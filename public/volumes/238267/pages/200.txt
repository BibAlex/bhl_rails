196 PLANT LIFE
producing the nodular outgrowths in question.
It feeds and grows mainly at the expense of
the sugars and other substanees supplied by
the host plant, these having, of course, been
produced as the result of the photosynthetic
activity of its leaves.
But when thus provided with carbohydrate
food, the bacillus is able to manufacture the
essential nitrogenous compounds necessary for
the production of protoplasm by utilising the
jree nitrogen of the air. Most plants have to
take in their nitrogen in a combined form, as
ammonia salts, nitrates, etc., for nitrogen is
a very inert element, and difficult to force into
combination with others. Bacillus radicola
is one of the very few organisms which can
perform this really stupendous task, provided
that it is supplied with the means of obtaining
the energy required for the process in the
form of appropriate carbohydrate nutrition.
There is no doubt as to the facts, for the
bacillus will do the same thing when culti-
vated outside the body of the plant, and
under the most rigidly controlled experimental
conditions.
After the bacilli have thriven for a while,
mainly at the expense of the food supplied
by the root in which they are living and multi-
plying, a change comes over them. Many of
the individuals become weaker, and undergo
a sort of degeneration, whilst a few pass into
a resting stage in which they become highly
resistant to adverse conditions of life. The
