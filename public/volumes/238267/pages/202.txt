owe their faculty of fixing free nitrogen
to the energy which the chlorophyll enables
them to obtain from the sunlight. This is
the motive power which enables the machinery
of the green leaf to maintain its output of
carbohydrate, and it is from this carbohydrate
that the power or energy is more immediately
derived which enables the bacillus to perform
the tremendous operation of forcing free
nitrogen into combination, and thus to build
up from the raw materials the stuff from which
protoplasm itself can be made. Although
the leguminous root ultimately profits by
its relations with the bacillus in thus ac-
quiring a costly food in exchange for a cheap
one, there is no indication of any degeneration
of leaf structure on the part of the flowering
plant. It even becomes almost unthinkable
that it could occur, inasmuch as the continuous
supply of carbohydrate from the green parts
is a prime condition of the nitrogenous
synthesis. The importance to the organic
world of these plants which bring nitrogen
into combination in a form that can be
utilised by living beings is overwhelming.
For apart from some means of maintaining
the supplies of nitrogenous food, life itself
would ultimately cease to be possible in the
world.
There are many other instances of remark-
able associations of two or more plants, in
which each is in turn more or less parasitic
on the other, or, at the least, lives on the
