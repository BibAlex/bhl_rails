THE GREEN LEAF 57
CHAPTER VI
THE GREEN LEAF
We now pass from the study of the lower
types of green plants to a consideration of the
higher and more specialised forms of terrestrial
vegetation. But if we restrict ourselves to
a comparison of the vegetative organs of the
more highly differentiated algae and of the
higher plants, we shall be struck, not so much
by the dissimilarities, as by the likenesses
which exist between them. We meet with
the same specialisation of the shoot into a
stem bearing thin expanded structures â€”
the leaves. There are the same organs for
attaching the plant to rough surfaces, or
anchoring it in a looser sub-stratum. It is
not difficult to discern in the influence of light
the common factor which has been chiefly
concerned in the production of these resem-
blances, so far at least as external form is
concerned.
But when we probe more deeply into the
matter the real differences between the two
classes of plants begin to make themselves
apparent. They consist, so far as the vegeta-
tive structure is concerned, in a specialisation
of cells on the part of the land plant which
may reach a grade of complexity almost
