188 PLANT LIFE
from the vine. The filamentous strands in-
crease at the spot where a flower is to develop,
and a sort of ball of tissue is formed whieh
presently bursts through the rind of the Cissus
stem. Presently the ball splits open, and
there grows out from within it a flower bud
which opens out into the single enormous
blossom.
A more familiar flowering parasite is the
Dodder. This plant infests various hosts,
â‚¬. g. flax, clover, nettles, gorse, etc. It
rather suggests in appearance bundles of
pink string thrown at random over the vege-
tation. It belongs to the convolvulus family,
and still more or less retains the twining habit
so characteristic of many of its relatives. But
whereas the leafy convolvulus merely supports
itself by twining round its support, the almost
leafless dodder puts forth suckers where its
stem is in contact with that of its host, and
from the central portion of each sucker a
growth is formed which penetrates the plant.
In this manner the dodder obtains the whole
of its food, both water and organic substance.
Although the dodder is really little more
than a specialised twining convolvulus, never-
theless, in relation to its parasitic habit, it has
ceased to form green leaves, and it is not even
rooted in the soil. It is true that when the
seed first germinates it is anchored by hairs
to the ground, but the lower part of the stem
soon dies away, and the whole plant comes to
be absolutely dependent on a parasitic life.
