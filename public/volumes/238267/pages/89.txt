ROOTS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS 85
out from the surface of the wood. If vines
are pruned too late the water thus pressed
out by the root eells through the xylem will
flow for many days, and it is squeezed out
at a pressure often amounting to several
atmospheres. The maintenanee of the pres-
sure depends on the living eells of the root,
henee it is called root pressure. Anything
which interferes with the life of the root eells
causes the pressure to diminish. Thus chil-
ling the roots, depriving them of oxygen, or
treating them with anaesthetics as well as
with other poisons, may temporarily or per-
manently abolish root pressure.
No very satisfactory explanation has been
given of root pressure, nor indeed of any other
form of excretion. We are sure, however, that
as our knowledge of the physical and chemical
processes of protoplasm increases the diffi-
culties will one day vanish. In the mean-
time the problems connected with water
absorption and its movements within the
plant are still in the interesting condition of
incomplete solution. We know more or less
what happens, but we do not as yet fully
understand the how of the happening.
