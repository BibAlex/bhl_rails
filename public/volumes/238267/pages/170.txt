state of the water; in the latter, it is used
to construet eomplex out of relatively simple
chemical substances. And in this process
the energy, instead of becoming dissipated
over an infinite field, is concentrated within
narrow limits. It is again locked up as
potential energy in the construction of chemi-
cal molecules, and it can be reconverted into
the kinetic form when the molecular groupings
once more break down.
We have already seen that the various
organic substances on which the fungi and
other colourless parasites and saprophytes
subsist are all traceable more or less directly
to the synthetic processes of the green plants.
The latter are empowered to build up this
organic material by utilising the energy of
the sunlight for the work. Thus we are
justified in saying that the products of
photosynthesis practically represent the total
means available for supplying the energy
required to drive the machinery of the rest
of the life of the world. In other words,
the potential energy of the organic food is
resolved into kinetic energy in the body of
an organism, and it is solely by virtue of
this kinetic energy that an organisn can live
and move and have its being.
Now the essential chemical process which
is carried on when the energy of the sunlight
drives the photosynthetic machinery of the
green plants results in reduction or deoxida-
tion. The carbohydrate food â€” the tangible
