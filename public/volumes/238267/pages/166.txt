fruit. We often speak of them as degraded
or degenerate forms, but this is a somewhat
loose and inaccurate form of expression. The
vegetative structure has, it is true, been
simplified, but in such a way as to render
the plants much better adapted to the new
conditions of nutrition than they ever could
have been had they retained the complexity
appropriate to the green ancestral type.
For the moment we will pass over the
bacteria, which differ in many respects from
other plants, and survey the most salient
features presented by the fungi.
Fungi, like the flowering parasites above
mentioned, have descended from green
ancestors, but it is among the lower ranks
of the vegetable kingdom that their origin is
to be sought. It is tolerably certain that the
class of fungi, as we know them to-day, repre-
sent a number of not very closely related
families, and that these have descended from
more than one chlorophyllous algal stock.
There is no reason, therefore, to think that
their vegetative structure has undergone
very important alteration in the direction of
simplicity. It would probably be more in
accordance with facts to say that it has never
emerged from a primitively simple type of
organisation.
The body of a young, actively growing
fungus consists entirely of simple tubular
threads, or hyphce, which, in the majority of
species, are partitioned by cross walls. These
