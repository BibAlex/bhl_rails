As far as aquatic plants are concerned, it
is only for those which inhabit torrents that
the mechanical tissue possesses much real
significance. In the ordinary vegetation of
ponds and sluggish rivers, a large number
of the stems of the submerged vegetation
are provided, it is true, with strands of
mechanical tissue, but they often appear to
be scattered rather at haphazard through the
substance of the stem as a whole. Indeed,
it almost seems as if these water plants had
rather free play in the differentiation of the
tissue in question. Ordinary aquatic condi-
tions are not constant or strenuous enough
to demand a high standard of mechanical
efficiency. Hence the less rigorously adapted
individuals are not eliminated, and the average
of the race in this respect is soon corre-
spondingly lowered.
We may complete our survey of mechanical
tissues, and kindred matters, by briefly
considering the mode of construction of the
leaf from this point of view.
The flattened shape of most foliar organs
evidently exposes them to risks of being
torn, and furthermore it is of prime import-
ance that the ordinary leaf should retain
an extended form, and not easily buckle;
otherwise the chlorophyll would cease to be
advantageously displayed to light. The
danger of buckling is partly met by the
