purposes. Sugar then begins to form in the
manufacturing cells. But it is a character-
istic feature of this, as of so many other
chemical reactions, whether in the living cell
or in a test-tube, that the rate of formation
of the soluble product slows down as the con-
centration of that product increases. Any
such wasteful lowering of the rate of produc-
tion is avoided in the plant cell by the
starting of a second process, whereby insolu-
ble starch is formed as soon as the con-
centration of the sugar in the cell reaches a
certain point. The sugar is thus continually
prevented from accumulating in quantities
sufficient to bring about the cessation of
photosynthetic activity within the cell.
As long as the leaf remains attached to the
tree, a certain amount of the sugar is, in any
event, being withdrawn from the cells in
which it is being manufactured. This sugar
does not, however, diffuse from cell to cell
in any casual direction. Thus it does not
readily pass from one palisade cell to its
adjacent neighbour. But it does very readily
pass into the subjacent cells, and through
them to the vascular strands of the leaf.
These strands consist, as already explained,
of wood and bast (or xylem and phloem)
and it is mainly through the cells of the
latter that the sugar travels, diffusing
from one cell to another. The cells of the
phloem are of various shapes, but they are
mostly elongated in the direction of the
