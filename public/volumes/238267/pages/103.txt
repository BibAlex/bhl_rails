leaf, which at first sight often seems to spring
from the stem some distance above the node.
In reaUty, however, the lower part of the leaf
forms a cylindrical sheath surrounding and
supporting the succulent, elongating portion of
the stem just above the actual node. The
cylindrical leaf sheath is supplied with abun-
dant selerenchyma, which is arranged in a
more complex way than in the sunflower, but
again in the strictest accordance with what
we have discovered to be sound mechanical
principles.
It is the mechanical tissue which forms
the economically valuable fibre yielded by
many plants — such as hemp, flax, jute and
the like — and for commercial purposes it has
to be separated by various processes from the
softer tissues in which it lies imbedded.
As a plant becomes larger, the crushing
effect of the increasing weight of the foliage
and branches begins to make special demands
for additional mechanical tissue. This is
most often provided for by a large increase
in the tissues of the wood. In a cross section
of such a plant as an old sunflower the wood
is seen to have assumed the form of a hollow
cylinder, variously buttressed and thickened
towards the pith.
In many of the perennial plants the character
of the mechanical supporting tissue is less
obvious, principally because it has to serve
several purposes, and also because it is rela-
tively so abundant that, if the expression
