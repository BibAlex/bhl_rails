same way it would preclude the entrance ol
oxygen and carbon dioxide, at any rate in
sufficient quantity. But as a matter of fact
it is not continuous. There are immense
numbers of minute gaps in the epidermis,
termed stomata (Fig. 9, S), and these form
the external orifices of an extensive system of
air spaces which are present between the cells
of which the leaf is composed. These inter-
cellular spaces are of the utmost importance
to the leaf, inasmuch as it is by means of them
that gaseous exchange between the cells and
the atmosphere is rendered possible.
Each pore or stoma is really a slit formed
between two sausage-shaped cells of the
epidermis, and these two guard cells, as they
are called, can change their shape according
as they become more or less distended with
water. When they are distended, or turgid,
the aperture between them becomes wider, as
they lose water the pore tends to close. We
see then that the leaf, as regards water, is a
beautifully self-regulated mechanism. When
a plentiful supply is available the opening of
the stomata enables the vapour which satu-
rates the air in the intercellular spaces to
diffuse out; but when the supplies fall short
the loss is avoided by the closing together of
the guard cells. Other things being equal, it
is advantageous that water should be abun-
dantly available, as in this way mineral salts
are brought to the leaves. A relatively rapid
flow to these organs, liowever, only takes place
