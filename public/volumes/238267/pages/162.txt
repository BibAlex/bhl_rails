158 PLANT LIFE
Many of the other members of the natural
order (Bromcliaccsc) to which the pine-apple
and the tillandsias belong, are variously
speeialised with respeet to water supplies.
The large bromeliad of tropical America
possess clasping roots which fasten the short
stem with its, relatively speaking, immense
crown of foliage, on the branch of the tree
which serves as its perch. The roots have little
if anything to do with absorption, a function
which has been almost entirely taken over
by the tillandsia-like hairs which are found
on the upper surfaces of the leaves. The
latter form remarkable cisterns in which
water is collected and stored, and from which
it is absorbed by the hairs that are especially
numerous where the water is stored. Each
leaf is a long, more or less strap-shaped body,
with the edges curving towards each other in
the middle portion, thus forming a sort of
gutter. Nearer the base, the leaves press
tightly on each other and thus constitute
the cisterns. Water falling on the upper
surface of the leaf is directed into them by
means of the gutter-like curvature just
described, which causes the rain to run down
to the centre of the crown, instead of dripping
off as it does from most leaves. The efficient
manner in which the foliage is arranged to
form cisterns may be gauged by the fact that
water plants are fairly often found growing
and flourishing in the water thus collected
and retained.
