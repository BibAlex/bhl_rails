CELLULAR STRUCTURE 33
veloped by the swelling jelly, and they may
even entirely disappear. The cell colonies
thus consist of motionless masses of green
jelly. But there is as yet very little organisa-
tion in such colonies. The form of the mass
is not constant, and a return to what may be
termed normal conditions of life may readily
lead to a complete disruption of the colony,
the individual cells escaping from the jelly
and returning to the unicellular motile condi-
tion w^iich is in the main characteristic of this
group of algae.
This tendency to form agglomerations of in-
dividual cells is carried to a far greater degree
of perfection in some other groups of the lower
algae. Thus Apiocysiis Brauniana (Fig. 2),
an alga fairly often to be met with in ponds,
attached to larger algae and other objects,
consists of a pear-shaped mass of jelly in
which are scattered masses of chlorophyll-
containing protoplasm. The little proto-
plasmic spheres, which represent the living
part of the individual cells composing the
Apiocystis plant, are grouped in the more
peripheral parts of the gelatinous matrix
formed by the swelling of the common cell
walls. Each cell (see footnote on p. 20) is
furnished, like Chlamydomonas, with a pair
of cilia, but these have ceased to be functional,
for they are enclosed in a thin projection
of the gelatinous wall. When examined
attentively, it can be observed that the
individual cells, or protoplasts, are multiplying
