184 PLANT LIFE
intimate connection with the wood of the
tree which is necessary both to fix the parasite
to its support and to draw from the host
plant the suppHes of water it requires for its
own purposes.
There are other near relatives of the
mistletoe, belonging to the genus Loranthus,
which are far more dangerous and destructive
parasites. These plants are common in the
tropics, and they form leafy, bush-like growths
in the trees they infest. Many of them bear
beautiful trusses of red flowers, and they some-
w^hat recall the appearance of fuchsia bushes
perched among the trunks and boughs on the
outskirts of the forest.
Like the mistletoe, it is the roots of a loran-
thus that have undergone important changes
in relation to the parasitic habit. They arise
as sucker-like outgrowths from special creep-
ing stems of the loranthus which grow along
the surface of the tree. As the sucker-bearing
branches are freely produced, and may reach
a considerable length, the parasite often does
very serious damage.
It is not a little curious that in a large
family of plants like the Loranthaccir, to which
both Loranthus and the mistletoe belong, some
species should not have advanced still farther
in the parasitic direction. But although
nearly all of them draw their water supplies
from another plant, they have never taken
the final step of absorbing from it the organic
food. They have consequently, or perhaps
