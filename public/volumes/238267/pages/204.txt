itself to several kinds of algae, and vice versa.
In every instance, however, a specific lichen
results from the union of a definite fungus with
a particular alga â€” if either the alga or fun-
gus be changed, a correspondingly different
species of lichen is formed.
Both organisms thrive. The algal cells often
become unusually large, and the fungal
mycelium is evidently well nourished. But
multiplication of cells and consequent growth
is often greatly modified, especially in the
more specialised lichens in which the two
organisms become more intimately dependent
on each other.
The symbiosis only continues to pay as
long as the alga is properly exposed to light,
and for so long as it is properly supplied
with water, together with the small amount of
mineral food it requires. The latter offices
are largely discharged by the fungus, which
usually attaches the lichen to the substratum,
whilst its gelatinous walls retain the water
supplies derived from intermittent showers
or other sources. Thus a remarkable degree
of correlation is displayed in the growth
processes of the specialised lichens, and some
of them simulate to a wonderful extent the
form, and partly even the structural arrange-
ments, to be met with in the green leafy
shoots of higher plants (Figs. 23a and b).
Lichens are particularly instructive in
showing that the form assumed by an organ-
ism is in the long run determined by the
