58 PLANT LIFE
infinitely beyond that to be encountered
in any alga. Furthermore, the organs of
attachment in the land plant no longer serve
merely as holdfasts, but they discharge
important functions in connection with the
absorption of water and mineral food-supplies.
Their structure becomes increasingly modified
with reference to the larger functions they
have to discharge.
In another respect, also, the higher plants
differ from the lower, namely in the greater
degree of definiteness with which their
various organs are produced. In other words,
the organisation of the individual is as a whole
more specialised, and is less apt than are
simpler types to vary its normal sequences
of growth. The different morphological
structures are less and less susceptible of
alteration than is the case with more primitive
plants, in which the bonds of correlation and
co-ordination between the constituent cells
and tissues are weaker.
If we ask why there should be this advanced
degree of anatomical differentiation associated
with a land habitat, we shall find the answer
to lie on the one hand chiefly in the needs
for adequate water supply and all that this
involves, and on the other in the demand for
a body constructed on sound mechanical
principles, so that it may be enabled success-
fully to withstand the various stresses and
strains to which it is continually liable to be
subjected.
