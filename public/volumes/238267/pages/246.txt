242 PLANT LIFE
Even among plants nearly related to the
ferns we find that the prothalli produced by
the spores tend to differ in their capacity for
growth. Those which are destined to produce
eggs are large and well stocked with food, those
which will produce the sperms are small.
This difference becomes reflected in the
spores, and even in the sporangia.
In the Selaginella plants, often grown in
greenhouses, certain of the sporangia produce
a large number of small spores, whilst others
become much larger, but only bring a very
few (usually four) large spores to maturity.
The small spores form a rudimentary
prothallus and a larger or smaller number of
sperms. It is essential that the number of
small spores should be kept up, so as to
maintain a fair chance of a sperm from one of
them reaching the relatively few available
female prothalli.
Passing to the flowering plants, it is difficult
at first sight to realise that we are only
witnessing the final stages of an evolutionary
development of the structures so clearly
distinguishable in the fern. But so it is, and
it will be of interest to trace, even briefly, and
in spite of the wide gaps, the points of resem-
blance between them.
The obvious starting-point in both cases is
the fertilised egg. The fern plant and the
flowering plant each spring from this source.
The fern closes its life cycle by producing
spores in the way we have seen. The flowering
