FUNGAL PARASITES 175
furnish another example of remarkable inter-
ference Avitli the ordinary growth-processes
of the host plant that a parasite is able to
induce. The wild cherry trees are particu-
larly subject to the attacks of a fungus
(Exoascus) which fruits within the leaves
and alters the boughs affected by it in a
curious manner. They are much more freely
branched, the leaves are often smaller and
sometimes deformed, and flowers are seldom
or never produced on the affected parts.
Another kind of witches-broom occurs on the
fir trees in continental forests, though they
are not so frequently seen in this country.
It is produced by one of the rust fungi
(/Ecidium elatinum). A twig affected with it
is a striking object, inasmuch as it grows up
vertically on the bough instead of horizontally.
This erect habit is maintained, and as the
years pass the witches-broom comes to
resemble a little Christmas tree arising from
an ordinary, horizontally-growing bough of
the fir tree. Several kinds of firs are liable
to the attacks of this fungus, but it is on the
silver fir that the witches-broom is most often
seen.
Such relations between fungus and host as
those just described, and many other examples
might be added, very clearly prove that these
apparently simple parasites are remarkably
complicated from a physiological point of view.
The surprising thing about them is their very
accurate degree of specialisation to the hosts,
