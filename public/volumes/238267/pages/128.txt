thickness and resilience of the epidermis, but
much more effectively by the strengthening
of the abundant veins or vascular bundles
which run through it. These form, especially
on the underside, a connected system of
projecting and supporting strands.
In the elongated strap-shaped leaves of
grasses, irises, palms, and suchlike plants, in
which the principal veins pursue a longitudinal
course in the leaf, we encounter the most
beautiful examples of precise mechanical
construction by which the proper form and
position of the leaf is maintained, and is again
recovered after any displacement that may
have occurred. Bands of sclerenchyma run
down the leaf, just below the upper and lower
epidermis, and they are often placed, girder-
wise, opposite one another, with the vein or
vascular bundle running down between them.
The latter thus occupies the position of the
webbing of a girder. Although there is a
good deal of difference in the details of differ-
ent plants, the general application of sound
mechanical principles of construction and
arrangement, as well as the presence of suit-
able strengthening tissues, is patent to any
observer who cares to examine the leaves.
The netted veined leaves of ordinary
dicotyledons are exposed to considerable
risks of damage by tearing the margins.
The forms of many leaves seem at first sight
almost to invite the risk of tearing, but any
one who tries will soon convince himself
