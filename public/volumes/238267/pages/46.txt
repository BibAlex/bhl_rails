a smooth stalk, and is attached to stones, etc.,
by a slightly expanded dise-like foot.
An individual Hydrurus is made up of a
colony of unicellular algge, the walls of which
have become swollen and rather firmly
gelatinous. The whole organisation of the
plant depends on the different mode of
development followed by the various in-
dividual cells. The apices of all the branches
and hair-like protuberances are occupied by
single cells, and it is to these that the alga
owes its definite form. The terminal cells
of the branches multiply by dividing longi-
tudinally ; one of the two daughter cells then
gradually slides in front of the other and
continues to function as the growing apex,
the other one, which has taken a rearward
position, contributes to the building up of
the plant body. Some of these cells behind
the apex extend outwards from the cylindrical
surface and become the starting-points of
new branches; or, if their growth is but
limited, they merely give rise to the villous
hairy outgrowths.
The important lesson to be learned from
Hydrurus is that a definite co-ordination
exists amongst the individuals composing
the colony or association. In this way it be-
comes possible to speak of the terminal cells
as apical cells ; that is to say, they have
assumed the role of determining the fashion
of the branching, the rest of tlie cells merely
building up the plant on the lines laid down
