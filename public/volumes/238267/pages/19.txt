THE PLANT AND ITS FOOD 15
secreted over the surface of the Hving sub-
stance, which is henceforth shut off from the
outer world throughout the vegetative Hfe of
the individual. It is usually in connection
with certain reproductive processes only, as,
for example, when a new generation is about
to arise, that the plant-protoplasm is more
or less freed from the cellulose skin with
which it is almost invariably clothed at other
periods of its existence.
The simplest method of realising what all
this means to a plant is to study some definite
example, when other salient features of
plant life will also come directly under notice.
For this purpose one of the common lowly
plants belonging to the algce may be chosen,
and we will select as an example a microscopic
organism belonging to the genus Chlamydo-
monas.
This plant is of fairly common occurrence
in ditches and pools, especially in late spring
and in the autumn. Its body consists of
a single cell, that is to say its somewhat
oval-shaped protoplasm is contained within
a single membranous cavity. At one end
two vibratile hair-like filaments of protoplasm,
called cilia, project through the membrane,
and it is by means of these that the little
plant is able to swim actively through the
water in which it lives. Within the proto-
plasm of the body, and just beneath the spot
where the cilia sprout from it, are two con-
tractile vacuoles â€” hollow spaces filled with
