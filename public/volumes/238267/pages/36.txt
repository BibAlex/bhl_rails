32 PLANT LIFE
however, we can generally distinguish between
what is primitively and what is secondarily
simple, and all that need be said here about
the matter is that in any classification of this
sort most people more or less unconsciously
adopt an anthropomorphic standpoint and
standard. Provided we recognise this for
ourselves, we shall avoid confusion of thought,
and our mental picture will be the clearer.
Within the genus Chlamydomonas, which
we selected as an example of a primitive
plant, we find that some, at any rate, of the
species are able to manifest a change of form
and character according to the circumstances
under which they are growing. This fact
will serve as a starting-point from which
to trace the development of complication of
form and structure in the plant kingdom.
Individuals belonging to certain species,
e. g. Chlamydomonas Braunii, when cultivated
on appropriate nutritive media, such as a
relatively concentrated solution of mineral
salts, or on a damp substratum, cease to
multiply in the ordinary way. Instead of
the cells which have been formed by the
division of a parent-cell becoming separated
and swimming away, they remain cohering
together. Their cellulose walls swell up and
form a gelatinous mass in which, as in a
matrix, the cells {i. e. the nucleated proto-
plasmic units) which have arisen by the
repeated fission of parent cells remain em-
bedded. Even the cilia may become en-
