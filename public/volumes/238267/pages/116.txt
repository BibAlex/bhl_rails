112 PLANT LIFE
The narrow diameter of the stem is incom-
patible with waste or ineflicicncy in any of
its parts, whilst by its unsuitability to act
as an organ of storage, the obscuring effects
of subsidiary functions are comparatively
eliminated.
But there is always a danger in an appeal
to metaphor, and the suggestion conveyed in
the term compromise ought not to be accepted
as containing any definite explanation of the
facts, for it implicitly begs the whole ques-
tion as to whether the plant can adapt itself
to the exigencies of a particular environment ;
it rather indicates, without actually giving, an
affirmative reply. But it may well be that
the question is to be answered in a totally
different way, and that what strikes us at
first sight as an obvious adaptation may
be still better described as an adaptedness
brought about by causes and conditions not
at all directly connected with the circum-
stances under which they are so clearly
appropriate. In other words, the power of
direct adaptation may be (and probably is)
a very small part of the whole problem of the
fitness so generally to be discerned between
the plant (or animal) and its natural
surroundings.
It is a remarkable circumstance that many
of the climbers, especially the more advanced
ones, exhibit a considerable degree of anoma-
lous structure in their stems, and especially
in their main stem. A large number of
