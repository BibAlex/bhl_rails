the cells. This property of respiration secures,
inter alia, an economic transformation of
energy within the organism.
In respect, then, of the functions of respira-
tion and photosynthesis an oak leaf does not
primarily differ, in essential respects, from a
seaweed. But in the important matter of
water relations the two are on a very different
footing. It has already been pointed out
that a supply of water to the living cells is
essential for the exercise of their functions.
The alga, in its watery habitat, has no diffi-
culty in this respect, but the oak leaf, so far
from obtaining, is continually losing water
from its surfaces. Even in wet weather very
little, if any, of the rain which falls on it is
absorbed by the cells. This is owing to the
circumstance that the outer layer of the wall
of the external sheet of cells (epidermis) has
undergone a change, and no longer consists
of cellulose, through which water can readily
pass. It has become converted into cuticle^
which is extremely impervious to water,
and partially so to gases as well. This
cuticle is of extreme importance to terrestrial
plants, inasmuch as it provides one of the
chief means for preventing their losing water
by the ordinary process of evaporation. All
the water required by the leaf is received
from the root by way of the stem, and it is
distributed to all parts of the leaf by means
of the vascular bundles, which are often kno^\^l
as the veins of the leaf. It is these
