CELLULAR STRUCTURE 31
through which the ancestors of the higher
plants have ahiiost certainly passed. They
may be regarded as morphological survivals
that have slipped out from the main stream
of evolution into the quiet backwaters of life,
preserving in themselves the types and forms
of a vegetation that otherwise might well
have passed into oblivion. Furthermore,
whilst they may be, and often are, admirably
fitted by their very simplicity and variety
to certain kinds of surroundings, they are
not suited for a life under other conditions
which demand a more highly speciaUsed
body.
As a matter of fact it is far from easy
to define very exactly what is meant by
higher and lower types respectively.
We commonly associate the ideas of spe-
cialisation and differentiation with the higher
types. An obvious adaptation to a particular
environment is often taken as a sign of high
organisation, but in reality very many of the
extremely simple plants are admirably adapted
to their particular surroundings. Moreover,
we are acquainted with numerous species
which at the present time are simple because
they have lost the complexity of structure
formerly possessed by their ancestors. We
often speak of these as degraded forms ; but
parasites, which illustrate this point very
well, are frequently admirably adapted by
their very simplicity of structure to their
particular modes of life. In practice,
