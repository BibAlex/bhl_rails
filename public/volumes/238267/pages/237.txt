CELL-NUCLEUSâ€” FERTILISATION 233
for each of the two daughter nuclei receives
entire chromosomes, but of course the original
number, now shared between two nuclei, is
really reduced in each of them to one-half of
what it originally was in previous nuclear
divisions.
It will be remembered that prior to the
temporary union of the chromosomes to form
the pairs, each one of them showed indications
of longitudinal fission. It is of special interest,
then, to find that immediately on the form-
ation of the daughter nuclei, in the way just
described, this fission becomes operative. For
a second division supervenes in each daughter
nucleus, and so four nuclei are produced. The
reduced number of chromosomes in each
nucleus is, of course, maintained. Indeed, it
invariably happens that all nuclei which are
derived from one in which reduction has
occurred only possess the halved quantity.
It is not until the union of the sexual cells
takes place that the original number is again
restored.
The term meiosis has been applied to this
process of reduction, and meiosis occurs in
every animal and plant which reproduces
itself sexually (with possible exceptions, per-
haps, in some of the lowest and most aberrant
types). Not only so, but even the details of
the process are remarkably similar in the
many species of animals and plants which
have been studied.
Now it is hardly possible that a process so
