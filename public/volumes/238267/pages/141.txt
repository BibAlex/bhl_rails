leaves. Thus, in the tropics the dry season
is marked by the leafless character of many
trees which renew their foUage as soon as the
rainy season sets in. Again, many evergreens,
when transplanted, frequently throw off their
leaves. This is the result of injury to, and
disturbance of, the root system, whereby
absorption is suddenly checked. Hollies and
laurels often display this reaction, and indeed
it is generally to be regarded as a favourable
sign for the future of the plant; individuals
that shed their leaves promptly always suffer
less than those which retain their foliage in
a flaccid or withered condition on the branches.
But if we look a little further into this
question of leaf fall, it turns out to be not so
simple as it appears at first sight. It must be
premised that the fall of the leaf is not a
matter of mere detachment, but it ensues in
consequence of definite changes which have
caused a layer of tissue to become differen-
tiated across the base (usually) of the leaf.
Thus, even before the detachment of the leaf,
the wound is practically healed in advance.
Although various functions connected with
nutrition are concerned in bringing about the
formation of this separation layer, the most
powerful stimulus is unquestionably that of
physiological water starvation, whether this
starvation results from physical shortage or
from a physiological inability to absorb. The
intermittent periods of drought in summer
are often followed by early leaf fall on the
