86 PLANT LIFE
CHAPTER VIII
CORRELATION OF FUNCTION AND FORM
In the higher and more specialised green
plants the organ principally charged with
carrying on the important function of photo-
synthesis is commonly, though not invariably,
the leaf. Now a green leaf only pays its
way for so long as it is adequately exposed
to light. But the intensity of light which
produces the best results varies greatly with
different plants. Moreover, a plant may lose
so much water when exposed fully to the
light, and hence to the air, that any advantage
of illumination may be more than balanced
by the chance of wilting. We find, as a
matter of fact, that all these various con-
siderations are of practical importance in the
practice of forestry. Some kinds of trees
will tolerate shade, others speedily succumb
if they are not fully exposed to the light.
Beech, for example, when young will thrive
under the shade of the birch, and in many
places it is best raised under this latter tree,
which shields it in various ways during its
infancy. But birch will not grow under
beech. One is a strenuously light-demanding
