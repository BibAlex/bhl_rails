develop, the cell walls are still thin, the
strand is itself still growing, and has not as
yet developed those properties whieh will
ultimately render it so valuable from the
meehanieal point of view.
But just beneath the outside skin or
epidermis we may see that the cell layers
whieh make up the periphery of the outer
rind or cortex are characterised by cell walls
of a remarkable form. They are much
thickened, especially at the corners where
the cells abut on each other, and this thicken-
ing often extends to the tangential walls,
while the radial ones usually remain thin.
The general impression they give is that of
a number of concentrically arranged bands
of thick substance (= the tangential walls)
bound together by thin plates (= the radial
walls). These thickened walls possess remark-
able mechanical qualities whieh are very
different from those which distinguish the
sclerenchyma. They are much weaker, but
this is partly compensated by their more
advantageous position at the periphery of
the stem. The essential feature in which
they differ from sclerenchyma lies in the
ease with which they can be stretched beyond
the elastic limits, for a weight of about two
kilograms suffices to produce a permanent
elongation in a strand of one millimeter in
cross section. They differ still further from
sclerenchyma in that they do not break at
this limit, but will stand a much stronger pull,
