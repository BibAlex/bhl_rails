170 PLANT LIFE
the wood contains organic matter wliich is
cither soluble or easily rendered so, and this
is one of the reasons why trees are felled at
a time of the year in which the wood naturally
contains least moisture or sap, and why the
tree is, or should be, left to season (i. e. to
dry) before being cut up. A source of danger
to stored timber may arise from contamina-
tion with organic matter consequent on the
neglect of proper sanitary precautions. For
wood which is so contaminated forms a very
suitable substratum for the germination of
a number of pests, and attacks of the
dangerous dry rot fungus (^Mcrulius) has
sometimes been traced to this source. When
once a wood-destroying mycelium has estab-
lished itself in a piece of timber it may be
difficult to get rid of it. It will often lie
dormant for a considerable time when the
wood is dry, and only moisture or dampness
is required to awaken it to dangerously active
growth.
The wood of living trees is liable to attack
by various fungi which commonly gain access
to it by means of wounds, due to abrasion of
bark or the falling off of branches. The
mischief is usually far advanced by the time
the first symptoms are apparent, and it is
often then too late to adopt remedial measures.
In these matters a stitch in time saves
nine, and it is generally a simpler matter
to clean and tar a wound at once so as to
prevent the entrance of the disease-producing
