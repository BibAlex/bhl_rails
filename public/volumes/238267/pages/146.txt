142 PLANT LIFE
cactus, often grown for the sake of their
beautiful flowers, bear a strong resemblance
to lobed, fleshy leaves. They are, however,
merely stems, flattened by the action of
light, which is probably indirectly operative
through nutritive processes. If the phyllo-
cacti are grown in the dark they only produce
rod-like stems, very different from the leaf-
like shape assumed under ordinary conditions
of illumination.
The cacti furnish a remarkable range of
forms. All of them are pronounced xero-
phytes. Now it is a curious fact that these
plants of the Western hemisphere have their
doubles in some of the euphorbias, or spurges,
of the hot, dry regions of the Eastern tropics.
So faithfully, indeed, are many of the leading
types of cactus forms reproduced, that an
untrained observer may easily be deceived.
No satisfactory explanation has been given for
the occurrence of these closely similar forms
of plants, which are widely sundered in
affinity and properties, as well as in their
geographical distribution.
The ordinary winter buds of our trees and
shrubs, with their protective scales, provide
us with still other adaptations by which loss
of water from the enclosed leaves is prevented.
The young leaves, since they are not only very
thin, but are imperfectly protected by a cuti-
cular surface, would assuredly suffer if they
were exposed to the air. This is probably
the chief function of the bud scales, though
