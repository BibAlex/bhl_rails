VEGETATIVE REPRODUCTION 207
The most common method by wliich the
simpler aquatic alga? reproduce themselves
vegetatively is by giving birth to zoospores.
The protoplasmic contents of a cell contract
away from the wall, cilia are developed, and
the zoospore escapes through a hole which is
formed in the cell wall. Very often a series
of adjacent cells may be seen all to give rise
to zoospores in this way. Sometimes the
zoospores are not so simple, and represent not
single cells only but a cluster, the individuals
of which are not delimited by walls from
each other. The huge zoospore of Vaueheria
belongs to this type ; it is easily visible to the
naked eye, as it rolls about through the water
by means of its numerous pairs of cilia.
But however the zoospores are formed,
they generally settle down after a period
of independent movement. They withdraw
their cilia, secrete a cell wall over their naked
surface, and grow into an organism generally
similar to that from which they themselves
have sprung.
It is different with land plants. Motile
propagative bodies would be practically
useless here, and the nakedness of the proto-
plasm would render them specially susceptible
to numerous adverse influences inseparable
from existence on land. In the simpler forms
we find that entire cells, i. e. protoplasts
which remain enclosed in cellulose membranes,
replace the naked zoospore. From this simple
stage the rest is easy. A few coherent cells
