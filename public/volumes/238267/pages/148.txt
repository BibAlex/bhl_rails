special adaptation to tide it over the dry, and
often hot, time of year it would be unable
to oecupy sueh climatal regions. Often the
adaptation is fairly obvious. Thus, when the
rain falls on the South African veldt, in-
numerable leaves and flowers spring up as if
by magic. They flower and fruit, and then
disappear for the rest of the year. A re-
latively large proportion of this vegetation
consists of perennial plants of a bulbous
or tuberous character. As long as the dry
weather lasts they remain in a resting condi-
tion, the bulbs or tubers showing no sign of
life. If they be cut open, they are found, even
at this season, to be juicy ; that is to say, they
store water and retain it with great tenacity.
When conditions become favourable, the
leaves rapidly develop, and they are often not
at all the leathery or even succulent structures
one might expect to meet with. In fact they
frequently resemble those of typically meso-
phytic vegetation, and are thus simply
adapted for an average water supply, and
indeed such conditions do actually prevail
during their period of active growth. Their
food manufacture goes on rapidly, and the
surplus is stored up in the swollen portion,
so that when the growing, moist season is
over, they will have accumulated an amount
of easily utilisable food. It is the possession
of these qualities which enables them to
form underground the flowers and leaves
which will expand so rapidly on the return
