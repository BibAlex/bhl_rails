174 PLANT LIFE
This species of Lychnis is a dioecious plant.
That is to say, the flowers of some plants are
exclusively female whilst the rest are ex-
clusively male. The unisexual character is
produced by the abortion of the pistil in the
flowers of the male, and of the stamens in
those of the female plants. The fungus only
reaches maturity and produces its violet
powdery spores in the stamens. So far as
the male plants are concerned there is no
difficulty, but with the female flowers it is
otherwise. What the fungus does when it
attacks the latter is to stimulate the plant to
produce stamens exactly like those of a male
flower. The mycelium grows sparsely in
them until the pollen sacs are approaching
maturity, then it suddenly breaks out into
virulence and destroys the pollen-producing
tissues, filling up the space with its own spores.
Nor does the influence of this remarkable
parasite stop here, for the pistil is arrested
at an early stage of its development and in
certain other structural characters the flower
closely approximates to that characteristic
of a male plant â€” so closely indeed that very
careful experiments were needed to clear up
the matter.
It is not known what the substance formed
by the fungus, and responsible for the change,
really is. All attempts to imitate its action,
and to produce a similar result artificially
have so far proved unsuccessful.
