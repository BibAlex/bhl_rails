waste products formed as the result of the
chemical life processes of its associate. Such
an association is often spoken of as symbiosis,
but it is evident that the transition from
symbiosis to parasitism is only a matter of
degree. An excellent example of symbiosis is
furnished by Lichens. These plants are com-
pound organisms, made up of a fungus on
the one hand, and a green alga on the other.
It is often possible to separate the two, and
to cultivate them apart, and the habit of
growth (except in the most primitive forms)
is very different from that which occurs
when they associate to form the lichen.
Lichens are formed in countless numbers
every spring, and scrapings from the bark of
damp trees at this season will generally yield
quite a large selection of these compounded
organisms in the making. Sometimes a
particular fungus filament which comes in
contact with an appropriate alga may be seen
to branch and then to embrace the alga
within its threads. Many of these early
beginnings of lichens are really due to the
escape, from older lichens, of algal cells, each
of which is already accompanied by a few
fungal hyphae. These young associations — •
called soredia — may be recognised as the green
or grey powdery dust which often occurs on
lichens when in vigorous growth.
It is possible to make a lichen artificially,
by bringing together the alga and fungus.
And we learn that one fungus may attach
