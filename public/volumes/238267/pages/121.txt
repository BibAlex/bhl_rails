for the individual species. The most special-
ised of these organs are the tendrils.
Tendrils may be formed from specially
modified branches as in the passion flower,
or from leaf- stalks as in clematis, or from the
leaves or leaflets as in various species of
vetch, and even from roots as in the vanilla
orchid. But they all tend to become very
similar in form, and to assume in common just
those characters that enable them so well
to discharge their functions.
But the very fact of their diverse origin
(from leaves, stems, etc.) in the different
plants suffices to emphasise the importance
of w^hat we may call the internal living
factor, as opposed to the environment directly,
in their production. And this is further
strengthened by the circumstance that they
are produced fully formed, they are not
gradually and tentatively produced and
perfected during their development, any more
than are any of the historically older organs
of the plant. But nevertheless, many of
them are endowed wdth the faculty of further
growth in thickness and strength if they
become functionally active. This power is
not restricted to tendrils but is of widespread
occurrence, and is especially obvious in the
case of the stalks of heavy fruits. These,
like functional tendrils, greatly increase the
amount of mechanical tissue primarily present
in their tissues as the fruits increase in w^eight.
The advantage secured is in both examples
