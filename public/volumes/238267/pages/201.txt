leguminous plant, which hitherto has been
paying out carbohydrate food to the bacillus,
now begins to receive, and the harvest is
a rich one, for it acquires from the degenerat-
ing mass of bacilli the stores of nitrogenous
matter they have accumulated, and this affords
a very good return for the sugars, etc., which
it had previously expended.
The comparatively few surviving bacilli
serve to infect the soil, as the roots gradually
rot, and they thus are enabled to attack the
roots of new leguminous plants with which
they may be brought into contact.
In comparing the leguminous plants with
the saprophytes and parasites that have
undergone simplification (or degeneration )
of vegetative structure we can readily under-
stand why they have not lost their green
leaves, and all that the possession of green
leaves entails. For a continuous supply of
carbohydrate is essential for the growth of
the bacilli, and without it there is no manu-
facture of nitrogenous substance from the
free nitrogen of the air. Moreover, the Legu-
minosae have by no means abandoned the
absorption of nitrates from the soil. The
combined nitrogen they acquire from the
bacilli is, for most of them at all events,
rather of the nature of an additional supply,
though it will, and often does, enable them
to thrive under conditions of nitrogen starva-
tion which would be fatal to the majority
of other plants. Ultimately, however, they
