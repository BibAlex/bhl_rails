result of tliis process â€” represents a store of
energy equal to that required to tear the
oxygen away from the various parts while it
was in the making. This energy can be
again released in the kinetic form by oxida-
tion. But it need not take place in one stage.
We shall get a certain definite amount of
kinetic energy set free if we burn a pound of
sugar, but we can break up the sugar more
gradually, and at each stage a definite amount
of energy will be liberated. It is only when
we have completed the destructive process,
and carbon dioxide and water alone remain,
that we can get no more energy from our
sugar products. And if we were to add up
the various amounts of energy liberated
during the various stages of destruction of the
sugar, they would amount to the sanie figure
as if we had burnt (^. e. oxidised) it at once.
Of course, neither an animal nor plant can
ever burn itself completely down to the simple
substances into which it is capable of being
resolved. Some portions of it will remain
intact, and of the rest all sorts of intermedi-
ate products will be formed. These possess
different energy values according to their
composition, and especially according to their
complete or incomplete state of oxidation.
It is on these intact or partially broken up
chemical substances that the non-green organ-
isms are able to live, and the fungi and bacteria
especially serve an important purpose in the
world because they are able to induce the
