CELLULAR STRUCTURE 35
We see here a simple example of co-ordination
between the eells of an organism. It is true
that it is of a very rudimentary kind, but
the fact that an organism, originating in this
manner, possesses a definite form at all, is
a clear proof of its existence.
The form of Apioeystis seems to be fairly
constant, but when conditions are suitable,
some or all of the protoplasts may escape
from the gelatinous sheath and swim away
as biciliate Chlamydomonas-like organisms,
though they are destitute, for a time at least,
of even a cell membrane. In this condition
they are known as Zoospores; when one of
them settles down it becomes invested in a
cell wall secreted by the protoplasm, and
by repeated fission builds up another Apio-
eystis plant. This mode of reproduction by
means of zoospores is very common in the
algae, and it serves to recall the early stages
in the history of the race which is thus re-
peated during the beginning of the life of a
new individual.
Now a pear-shaped organism is, by its
very form, rendered incapable of reaching
a large size, at any rate without such accessory
complications as are not to be thought of in
connection with primitive plants. There are
other lines of development which have proved
more fruitful from an evolutionary point
of view, and of these the flattened expansion
and the filamentous types represent the most
successful. Indeed, it is on these lines, or
