MECHANICAL PROBLEMS 91
matter of engineering construction the plant
has nothing to learn of man â€” although the
converse might not be equally true. The
more closely one examines the construction
of a plant from the mechanical point of view,
the more wonderful and complete does it
appear. Certain cells or cell tissues become
differentiated from their neighbours, and
develop the requisite strength, elasticity,
and other desirable qualities. They are not
distributed in the plant at haphazard, but
occur in situations where they are mechanic-
ally effective and physiologically appropriate.
Furthermore, they are united so as to form
definite tissue systems, and in connection
with the more specialised types we may, with-
out any exaggeration, speak of a mechanical
arrangement of tissues.
Suitable rigidity is secured by the young
undifferentiated parts of plants in the same
way as in the more primitive ones, namely
by the pressure of the watery sap contained
within the cells. This confers the same
sort of resilience as an inflated rubber ball
possesses, and it amply suffices for many
aquatic forms, although it is not sufficient
for the needs of land plants generally, and
only serves for small species growing under
special conditions. An ordinary rooted plant
has not only to hold itself in position, but it
has to be capable of withstanding the effects
of forces that are repeatedly acting upon it.
