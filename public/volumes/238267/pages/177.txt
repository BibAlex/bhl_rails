FUNGAL PARASITES 173
be specially favourable to the spread of
infectious fungal disease. Diseases of this
kind are apt very easily to get beyond control
unless they can be checked in their early
stages. Even with all our present precautions
the annual loss from fungal disease is gigantic,
amounting to many millions sterling in this
country alone.
Regarded from a biological point of view,
the parasitic species are in many respects
the most interesting of the group of fungi.
In spite of their simple structure ^ye find
their physiological properties are very much
specialised, and admirably adapted to their
particular habits as parasites. In these
respects, however, they show wide differences
in behaviour. Some ruthlessly kill their host,
reducing it to a mass of rottenness â€” for
instance, the Phytophthora, which is the
cause of potato disease. Others, while taxing
their host for their own means of support,
make no excessive demands, and may even
stimulate a locally increased growth on the
part of their hosts, at any rate during the
earlier stages of their development. Some
of the rust fungi furnish examples of this,
causing local thickenings on the stems of
roses, nettles and other plants. A very
striking instance of the influence that a
parasite may exert on its host is afforded by
a species of smut (Ustilago violacea) which
sometimes infests the Red Campion {Lychnis
dioica) of the hedgerows.
