THE GREEN LEAF 69
If a leaf which has been active enough
to have accumulated starch in its tissues be
examined after a sufficient interval during
which photosynthesis has been in abeyance
(owing to the absence of Hght, for example),
the amount of starch w^ill be found to be
lessened, and it may have all disappeared.
The reason of this lies in an extension of
the process already sketched in outline. The
sugar continues to be withdrawn from the
leaf cell even after all further synthesis has
ceased. But as the concentration of the
sugar sinks, a ferment action makes itself
felt within the cell. The starch is gradually
attacked by a ferment or enzyme known
as diastase, and it is thus converted into
a soluble sugar called maltose; the maltose
then continues to pass away from the cell, or
at least so much of it as is not immediately
required by the cell protoplasm itself. The
process of migration continues till all the
starch has been fermented and rendered
soluble.
The change from starch to sugar is a very
simple one, merely involving a dislocation of
the larger molecular aggregate together with
the incorporation of a molecule of water. It
is of a totally different order of change to that
which is involved in the oxidation of the
carbohydrate. For oxidation involves a con-
siderable change in the state of energy, as
well as of chemical constitution.
