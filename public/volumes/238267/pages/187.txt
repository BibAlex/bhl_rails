FLOWERING PARASITES 183
we often associate mentally with a parasitic
habit, but it has nevertheless undergone
considerable modification in its root structure,
whilst there is little in its stems and leaves,
or in the internal anatomy of these organs,
to indicate its particular habit of life. The
reason lies solely in the circumstance that it
has in no way abandoned the functions of
independent photosynthesis. It only with-
draws water and inorganic salts from the
host plant which it infests, but makes no
demand upon it for sugars and other com-
plex organic food. It is mainly in respect of
its root system that it has become modified,
for the machinery requisite for continual
absorption of water from the wood of a living
tree is very different from that which is
adapted to discharge a similar function in
the soil. Branching green structures, which
probably represent creeping stems, traverse
the rind of the tree on which the mistletoe is
growing, and from these there grow peg-like
protuberances which become firmly embedded
in the wood. These pegs are the real mistletoe
roots, and they are very carefully adjusted in
the manner of their growth to the habits of
the particular tree in which they occur. Their
rate of elongation exactly coincides with that
of the increase in thickness of the branch.
It is, of course, only this accurate adjustment
that renders it possible for the mistletoe to
flourish at all, for it is clear that the roots
would otherwise be unable to maintain that
