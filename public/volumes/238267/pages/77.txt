ROOTS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS 73
attachment to the soil. They are only efficient
so long as they arc uninjured, and perhaps
this helps to explain why the hairy zone is
such a short one on any one root, for the hairs
do not grow again when once they are injured
or worn out. The underground system as a
whole, however, repairs this defect by forming
a mass of branching roots, each one of which
may repeat the form and the four stages
indicated above.
In order to understand how the root-hair,
and the root as a whole, play their respective
parts in the absorption of water, some ac-
quaintance with the cellular structures con-
cerned is necessary.
We can ascertain this by examining under
the microscope sections of roots cut in various
directions. The annexed illustration (Fig. 10)
represents, rather diagrammatically, a trans-
verse section of a root. The hairy outgrowths
are the root- hairs. They consist of an outer
cell wall enclosing the living protoplasm which
lines the interior of the wall, though it does
not fill the entire space, for its own interior
is occupied by a vacuole of watery sap.
Passing inwards from the superficial root-hair
layer we notice a band of cortical cells
consisting of several layers forming the rind.
Still more interiorly we arrive at a starlike
arrangement of certain cell groups. This
inner cylinder is the vascular strand of the
root, and it consists of wood (xylem) and bast
(phloem), just as in the strands of the leaf or
