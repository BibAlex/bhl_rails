104 PLANT LIFE
what a thin, cord-like organ the ordinary
young root is.
Farther back from the growing point the
mechanical function of the root, as already
stated, is that of holding the plant in the soil.
The most effective position for the mechanical
tissue to occupy to withstand pulls from
various directions is along the centre or axis
of the organ. For in this position the stress
is most evenly distributed. Indeed, the me-
chanical strands may be regarded as cables
in this form of construction.
Sometimes it happens that a root has to
discharge still more complex mechanical
functions, and its structure in this respect
may then vary accordingly. The Indian corn
plant, for example, has a thick stem, large
leaves, and heavy fruit (Fig. 14). The rooting
end where it penetrates the ground is quite
thin, and the plant is obviously top-heavy,
but a circle of roots springs from each of
the nodes of the stem, that succeed each other
at very short intervals just above the level
of the ground, and each root grows towards
the soil in a more or less arched manner;
in this way the plant as a whole is well
supported by means of a series of arched
struts which admirably enable it to over-
come the mechanical disadvantages of its
original conformation. Now it is clear that
when the plant is exposed to a force tending to
bend it, the roots on the side towards which
it inclines to fall over are exposed to crushing
