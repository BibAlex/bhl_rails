CELLS AND THE ORGANISM 43
at these apices. Althouf?h Hydrurus recalls
other algcc already described, in so far as it
consists of an organised cell colony, it is very
far removed from a near relationship with
them, for it belongs to quite a distinct group.
The cells are of a yellow colour, and when
the protoplasts escape from their containing
gelatinous walls they only possess one cilium
instead of two as in Chlamydomonas.
The majority of the filamentous algae are
composed of cells of an elongated form, placed
end to end, and the colonial origin of such
plants is more and more obscured owing to the
specialisation which takes place amongst the
cells, for these gradually cease to form merely
coherent but obviously distinct units. They
come to exist as mere parts of a higher
organisation, the latter more and more control-
ling the arrangement and development of the
constituent cells. Thus the relative import-
ance of the cell and the organism is gradually
reversed. In the lower types it is not always
easy to discover the organism in a congeries
of cells, whilst in the higher ones the control-
ling organisation of the complex individual
may almost completely override the independ-
ence of the constituent cells.
As an example of a plant the cells of which
have still retained a considerable measure of
autonomy, we may name Spirogyra, one of
the commonest of the thread-like algai to be
met with in ponds and ditches, where it is
easily recognised by its bright green colour and
