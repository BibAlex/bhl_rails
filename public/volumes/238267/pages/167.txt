THE FUNGI 168
hypluTC ramify over and through the nutrient
substratum, and sometimes they cohere in
strands. They then become easily visible to
the naked eye and are popularly known as
spawn. The spawn thus represents a
specially luxuriant condition of the vegetative
body or mycelium of the fungus, the mycelium
being taken as a collective term for the mass
of hyphal threads of which the vegetative part
of the fungus is composed. Even the toad-
stools and other fructifications of fungi are
entirely produced by the organised weaving
of the hyphae into more or less solid structures,
followed by differentiation in the mass thus
formed, together with the specialised growth
of certain groups of hyphae.
The fungus obtains the whole of its food
from the substratum in which it is growing,
and some of the nutriment is always of
organic origin. Inasmuch as the fungus
contains neither chlorophyll, nor any other
material which would enable it to utilise
the energy of sunlight, there is no necessity
for the growing mass to expose itself to light
at all. Indeed, to do so would carry with
it the manifest disadvantages of removing it
from the immediate source of nutrition, as
well as of exposing it to the risk of desiccation.
Now, having regard to the fact that the
vegetative plant of the fungus is absorbing
the whole of its food in a dissolved form from
the material in which it is ramifying, it will
be evident that the larger the surface, in
