thick and lignified walls, whether they are
specifically mechanical, or are discharging
other functions as well, such as that of
storing supplies of food in the trunk. An
enormous proportion of the wood of ordinary
trees consists, then, of thick-walled cells of
various kinds which are more or less intimately
knit together, with the result that the whole
possesses not only considerable strength but
also a high degree of resilience. This latter
quality differs greatly in different timbers,
but it is entirely the result of the properties
of the individual cell walls, combined with the
manner in which the cells themselves have
interdigitated with one another.
An ordinary tree, by virtue of these pro-
perties of the wood, is able to withstand the
effects of a direct crushing stress far greater
than it will ever be called to meet in nature.
It has also, by virtue of its resiliency, the
faculty of recovering its position when it is
swayed or bent by the wind.
As regards the great lateral branches of
large trees, their heavy weight of foliage and
small branchlets renders the need for power
of resistence and recovery from strains of
various sorts even more pressing. Some-
times, indeed, they prove inadequate, as when
a branch becomes overloaded with fruit. In
the present year (1912) the great weight of
beech mast is causing many large branches
to bend down till they have come to rest
upon the ground, and in not a few instances
