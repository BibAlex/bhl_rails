FLOWERING PARASITES 185
one should say corrclativcly, retained their
leaves, and all the complexity of strueture
whieh, as we have seen, the presence of the
green leaf entails.
The parasitic habit has appeared inde-
pendently in a number of other families of
flowering plants. In some of them it is char-
acteristic of practically all the members,
just as in the Loranthaceae mentioned above.
As a matter of fact, in very many of the
larger natural orders or families we also find
species which have more or less broken away
from the ranks of typical green plants in con-
nection with their assumption of saprophytic
or parasitic habits. Sometimes we can
construct, within the limits of nearly related
groups, all the stages, starting from a sort
of dalliance with robbery which is hardly
betrayed by any essential structural change,
but culminating in species which, so far as
their vegetative structure is concerned, have
lost all resemblance to the forms of higher
plants.
Thus in the alliance or family to which
the snapdragon belongs, the familiar little
Eye-bright (Euphrasia), abundant on grassy
downs, the pink Lousewort (Pedieularis) of
the marshes, and the yellow Cow-wheat
(Melampyrum) of the woods, all have begun
to supplement the legitimate stock of food
which they manufacture for themselves by
stealing from adjacent plants. This they are
enabled to do owing to the ability they possess
