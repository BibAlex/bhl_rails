THE EPIPHYTES 157
water causing the grey colour to turn green.
Water rapidly passes into the cells of the hair
and thence is transmitted to the leaf. As
the air becomes dry again the hair gradually
flattens down, and its thick outer wall serves
as an additional barrier to prevent undue
loss of water from the leaf.
It is obvious that tillandsias, and other
plants which, like them, grow on the branches
of trees, must be largely dependent on some-
v/hat casual sources for the small supply of
mineral salts which are required for their
subsistence. Most of it reaches them in the
form of dust, or as vegetable detritus of
various kinds. Inasmuch as the leaf-hair,
like the root-hair, can only absorb substances
already in solution, it becomes a question
of some interest to ascertain whether the
salts really do pass into the plant in this
way, and if so whether the absorbent hairs
of the epiphytic tillandsias differ in this
respect from their near relatives which still
grow in the ground.
It has been ascertained that salts are so
taken in by the epiphytic species, but, as
might be expected, not necessarily or com-
monly so by the rest. The Pine-apple, a
terrestrial plant related to Tillandsia, possesses
hairs similar to those of the latter plants, on
its leaves. They are able to absorb water,
but the salts dissolved in it do not pass in,
for they cannot traverse the protoplasmic
lining of the cells.
