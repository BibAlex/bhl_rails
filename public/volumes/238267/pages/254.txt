the completeness with which it is adapted
to overcome the difficulties that beset it —
difficulties that arise partly from within, and
partly also from without — and so to emerge
victorious in the struggle for existence. But
unless it is so constructed as to launch a
successful posterity on the world, its race is
destined in the long run to perish, and The
place thereof shall know it no more.
