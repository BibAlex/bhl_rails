CHAPTER IX
MECHANICAL PROBLEMS AND THEIR SOLUTIONS
We will, in the first place, direct our atten-
tion to the mechanical problems which affect
plants. These are, broadly speaking, the
same as those which confront the engineer
in his ordinary work of building and con-
struction. There are a variety of stresses
and strains that have to be guarded against,
unless the fabric is to collapse either by its
own weight or by the action of other external
forces. These mechanical requirements are
satisfied in practice by choosing materials
which, in the first place, possess the requisite
physical characters of strength, toughness
and the like; and in the second, by utilising
them to the best mechanical advantage
economy is combined with efficiency.
Now it may safely be said that in the
