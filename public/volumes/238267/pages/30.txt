stance that they are able to utilise light of low
intensity which pases through the interspaces
of the leaves of the trees above.
It turns out also that the chlorophyll green
is destroyed by the same rays that are photo-
synthetically active, and this destruction is
without doubt intimately connected with its
function in relation to such rays. It does not,
however, follow, nor indeed is it probable, that
the role of chlorophyll is a very direct one in
influencing all the stages of photosynthesis.
It is more likely that its primary function is
concerned with the earliest stages, utilising
the energy of the absorbed light, and thus
providing the conditions for starting those
processes of chemical change which, under the
influence of protoplasm, culminate in the
formation of the higher carbon compounds.
For, so far as is certainly known, it is only
when chlorophyll is united with the living
substance that these higher compounds are
able to make their appearance.
When the green chlorophyll matter is decom-
posed in a living plant cell, other colours,
commonly red or a rusty orange, make their
appearance. A striking example of this is
furnished by the red snow plant, Hcemato-
coccus nivalis. This unicellular alga is closely
related to species of Chlamydomonas, and
indeed by some writers is included in that
genus. It exists in a green and a red form,
and is either motile, like Chlamydomonas,
or it may pass into a non-motile resting stage,
