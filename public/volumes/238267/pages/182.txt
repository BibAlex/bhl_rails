178 PLANT LIFE
the constitution of a plant, it is also
affected by the influence of surrounding
conditions of life.
We know very little, as yet, about the
nature of constitutional resistance. In
some cases it depends on a well-developed
epidermis, and on the absence of attractive
substances, such as sugar, from parts of the
plant readily accessible to the fungus. A
curious example of immunity against rust
fungi is furnished by some of the cereals
recently raised at Cambridge. The fungus
normally gains access to the interior of the
leaf by the germ tube or hypha growing in
by way of a stoma, and then attacking the
living cells. But it is possible to find a
wheat plant so sensitive to the influence of
the fungus that the cells die immediately the
hypha approaches them. The fungus is thus
effectively starved, and is unable further to
infect the plant. It may also happen that
when a fungal hypha has entered a plant, the
attacked and injured tissues are cut off from
communication from the healthy ones by
a layer of impervious cork, and in this way
the further spread of the disease within the
body of the plant is prevented.
The part played by the environment in
increasing liability to infection depends on a
number of possible factors, all of general
biological interest. A close damp atmosphere
is not only favourable to the germination of
the fungus spore, but it may at the same time
