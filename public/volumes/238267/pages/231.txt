CELL-NUCLEUSâ€” FERTILISATION 227
The nucleus is perhaps the most important
organ of the cell. There are strong grounds
for believing that it is largely concerned in the
determination of those hereditary qualities
which distinguish one species from another;
and we are also well aware of its great import-
ance in governing the chemical changes which
proceed within the protoplasm.
The nucleus consists, essentially, of a
variety of substances, more or less gelatinous
in consistency. These, together with more
fluid constituents, are contained within a
membrane, and are thus sharply delimited
from the surrounding cytoplasm. The con-
tents of the nucleus are not homogeneous.
One or more spherical bodies, the nucleoli,
may often be seen inside it. These, although
often very prominent, are of subordinate im-
portance, inasmuch as they chiefly represent
reserves of material to be drawn on at periods
when the nucleus is undergoing division. The
more solid gelatinous matrix (linin) contains
the most important nuclear constituents. A
more or less finely divided substance distri-
buted in the gelatinous matrix often gives the
nucleus a rather granular appearance. Stains
of various kinds render this much more
evident, and the stainable particles are often
known as chromatin.
When the nucleus is about to divide, strik-
ing rearrangements are observed to take place
within it. The gelatinous linin, in which the
chromatin is difiused, contracts, and at the
