remain in this condition for about four days
the strong salt solution is gradually replaced
by sea-water. The ellipsoidal cells swell out
until they approximately fill the space they
previously occupied within the old membrane.
But the disunion has obliterated the mutual
relationship formerly existing between cell
and cell. Each one proceeds to develop with-
out any reference to the rest, and puts out a
basal attaching organ below, which usually
penetrates the adjacent cell cavity. Later
on the cell also proceeds to grow in the
apical direction. Thus the individual cells
of the filamentous colony have been, in this
experiment, released from the influence which
bound them together into an organism, and
have recovered complete autonomy and in-
dividuality. This has occurred as the result
of sundering the protoplasts from all com-
munication wdth one another for the period
of time during which they remained con-
tracted in the strong salt solution.
An experiment such as this is specially
valuable, since it enables us to appreciate
not only the reality of the continuous inter-
change of material between cells that are
in close contact, whereby co-ordination is
rendered possible, but it serves to show how
closely this co-ordination to form an organism
is bound up with such mutual interchange.
For the protoplasts, although separated by
membranous cell walls from each other,
are yet in intimate connection; in many
