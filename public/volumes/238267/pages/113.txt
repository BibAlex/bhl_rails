CLIMBING AND WATER PLANTS 109
upwards, along or through the supporting
vegetation, only produces minute leaves, and
at very distant intervals. It is not until the
roof of the forest is reached tfiat the large
crop of big green leaves is unfolded, and their
weight is entirely borne by the vegetation
over which they are growing and spreading.
Entangled as the climber becomes among the
branches of the sustaining trees, it is evident
that when the latter are swayed by the wind,
the danger of snapping which confronts its
thin stems is a very real one. Furthermore,
while the plant is a young one, the risk of
being parted from the root is not small. These
difficulties are all obviated in several ways.
In many of them the first formed wood of
the young plant consists almost entirely of
strong mechanical tissue, and this is especially
true of those climbers which produce no
functional leaves worth mentioning till they
reach the roof of the jungle. The presence of
this axile cord of sclerenchymatous wood is
most important to all these plants, for they
need to be very flexible, and at the same
time to be able to withstand very considerable
pulls which might otherwise snap them
asunder. The fact that they are admirably
constructed in these respects is illustrated by
the name of jungle ropes, by which so
many of them are commonly known â€” a
popular tribute to their flexibility and their
very great strength.
But it is evident that stems constructed
