CELL-NUCLEUSâ€” FERTILISATION 231
the chromosomes are constant in qualities
and properties from one cell generation to
another. (3) Owing to the mode of division,
and distribution of the chromosomes at a
nuclear division, the two daughter nuclei are,
to all appearance, exactly alike, each is the
reflected image of the other. Subsequent
dissimilarities in size, and likewise in other
respects, are not excluded, but these are
almost certainly of secondary importance.
What does all this mean ? We cannot as
yet give a complete answer to the question,
but a consideration of the events connected
with the differentiation of the sexual cells
will perhaps serve to throw some light on the
problems involved.
In the first place, we have seen that the
sexual act consists essentially in the fusion
of two nuclei. How, then, can we reconcile
this with the circumstance that the number
of chromosomes is constant in the cell nuclei ?
For it is evident that the nucleus of each
fertilised egg must contain twice as many
chromosomes as those present in the nucleus
of each of the fusing gametes.
The solution of this problem is furnished
by a most remarkable nuclear division which
is invariably intercalated somewhere in the
series of nuclear divisions that intervene
between the first formation of the embryo
at fertilisation and the final production of
sexual cells which closes the life cycle of the
organism (Fig. 26, l-6i).
