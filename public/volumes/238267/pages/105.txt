sap. They are thus easily ruptured, and
every country boy knows that in late spring
the bark of willow or ash twif^s can easily be
slipped off the wood as an unbroken cylinder.
This is because the debris of the torn young
cambial cells serve as a sort of lubricant
which facilitates the process. Later on the
bark will not slip off readily if at all, and
this is due to the fact that the inner and outer
cell layers of the previously undifferentiated
zone have gradually become changed into
wood and bast. The thin layer of residual
cambium is now not thick enough, nor can
it provide sufficient lubricant to enable the
ring of bark to slip off.
The new wood thus produced consists of
young water-conducting tracheids and vessels,
as well as of other sorts of cells which have
various functions to discharge. Some of
these cells, as they change from the embryonic
to the permanent or adult state not only
thicken their walls, but grow considerably
in length, inserting their tips between other
similar cells above and below them. They
are largely, though not exclusively, of mechan-
ical significance. From a commercial point
of view it is mainly to the mechanical tissue
that woods of various sorts owe their technical
value as timber.
A relatively considerable proportion of the
new^ wood is thus more or less definitely
differentiated to serve mechanical purposes.
This applies to most of the cells wliich have
