Fig. 26. â€” Diagram to explain the course of an ordinary nuclear
division and the relation to it of the meiotic divisions.
The series 1-6 P M represents selected stages, in the order in which they
occur naturally, of an ordinary nuclear division before reduction in the
number of the chromosomes has occurred.
The series I1-61 M represents the stages which roughly correspond to
the premeiotic in the first meiotic (reduction) division. Stages 1 and 2 are
practically identical. In 5 the longitudinal fission previously seen in 2,
IB again clearly visible.
The series :3o-62 (M2) represents the second meiotic division. It shows
the subsequent division of nucleus A (Mi-61) in the series immediately
preceding M2. The corresponding nucleus, B, in series Mi 6, is not shown,
but its further division is exactly like that of A.
When A (or B) in Mi 6 proceeds to divide, it does so without going
through the stages 1-2, but passes at once into A32. TTie sides of each
loop represent the early longitudinal fission of the previous series now be-
coming effective. At4othe halves are seen in pairs and they separate in
60; in 62 is shown the stage at which the nuclei A1A2 are finally going back
to a resting condition.
