110 PLANT LIFE
on the lines just indicated have other functions
besides purely mechanical ones, and these
must be adequately discharged if the plant
is to be a success. As soon as the foliage
is produced, water is imperatively demanded,
and thus there arises, so to speak, a conflict
between opposing requirements. The scleren-
chymatous tissue is excellent for supplying
the needed strength, and its axile position
renders it very efiective. But it is of little
or no use as water-conducting tissue. Now
as a matter of fact we find that in the higher
types of climbers (e. g, many members of the
natural orders Leguminosae, Sapindaceae,
Bignoniacese, etc.), that this strong flexible
axile core is succeeded externally, and quite
suddenly, by vessels of wide calibre which,
though admirable as water conduits, are
practically useless regarded from the stand-
point of material strength. But the latter
defect loses all significance as the plant grows
older, for the difficulties that were to the fore
in the climbers earlier life become obviated
later on in a very simple manner. If one
observes an old climber in the jungle, the
lower part of the stem is often seen to be
lying in snaky coils on the ground, and is
evidently not at all exposed to any serious
tractive forces. The peculiarity in question
is due to the fact that up above, in the roof
of the forest, the lower leafy branches of
the climber are dying back as they give place
to the younger ones springing nearer the
