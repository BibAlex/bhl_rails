THE NON-CELLULAR TYPE 55
have also followed out the gradual loss of
motility, and the coherence of the individual
cells, for a period of their lives at any rate.
We have furthermore recognised the fact
that there exists a mutual influence, of a
material kind, which leads to the co-ordination
of the cells of a colony in such a way as to
produce, not a mere congeries of separate
entities, but an organism. In other words, we
have traced the gradual curtailment of the
individuality characteristic of the primitive
cells, and have witnessed the corresponding
transference of it to the cell colony as a whole.
This transference of individuality is intimately
connected with physiological correlation,
which is doubtless exerted through functional
and material agencies — largely by modifica-
tions in the nutritive processes — with the
result that each cell unit is intimately affected
by what is going on in its neighbours, as well
as in other and more remote regions of the
organism; the final result is that the cell
tends to become more definite and circum-
scribed in form, and more limited and special-
ised in function. To put it a little differently,
the efTiciency of the colonial organism is
purchased at the price of the individual
independence of the units which compose it.
If, however, we ask the question. What
advantage do the cells gain by this union ?
the answer is not easy to give. The uni-
cellular forms succeed very well, and they live
in the same sort of environment as the multi-
