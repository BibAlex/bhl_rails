THE KEMEDIES OF NATUKE.
By FELIX L. OSWALD, M. D.
CONSUMPTION.
THE organism of the human hody is a self-regulating apparatus.
Every interruption of its normal functions excites a reaction
against the disturbing cause. If a grain of caustic potash irritates
the nerves of the palate, the salivary glands try to remove it by an
increased secretion. The eye would wash it off by an immediate flow
of tears. A larger quantity of the same substance could be swallowed
only under the protest of the fauces, and the digestive organs would
soon find means to eject it. The bronchial tubes promptly react
against the obtrusion of foreign substances. The sting of an insect
causes an involuntary twitching of the epidermis. If a thorn or
splinter fastens itself under the skin, suppuration prepares the way
for its removal. If the stomach be overloaded with food, it revolts
against further ingestion.
These automatic agencies of the organism generally suffice to coun-
teract the disturbing cause, and the sensory symptoms attending the
process of reconstruction constitute merely a plea for non-interference.
The suppurating tissues push the thorn outward, and resent only a
pressure in the opposite direction. The eye volunteers to rid itself of
the sand-dust, but remonstrates against friction. The rum-soaked sys-
tem of the toper undertakes to eliminate the poison, and only asks
that the consequences of the outrage be not aggravated by its repeti-
tion. But, if that plea remains unheeded, it finally takes the form of
the emphatic protest we call disease. For, even in its urgent manifes-
tations, the reaction against a violation of Nature's health-laws is a
cry for peace, rather than a petition for active assistance in the form
of medication. "Accustom yourself in all your little pains and aches,"
