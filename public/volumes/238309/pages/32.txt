MICROSCOPIC LIFE IN THE AIR.

with glycerine, and placed at the bottom of the cylinder, receives the
jet of air which is produced by the aspirator. The glycerine retains
the corpuscles which are brought in by the current, and it is then easy
to observe them. This apparatus has been modified in various ways,

but with it, or something like it, the earlier investigators, MM. Pasteur,
F. Pouchet, Maddox, Douglas Cunningham, and others, have explored
the atmosphere. It did not take long to discover that the air around
us contains remnants of articles that we use existing in the condition
of impalpable dust. Wool from our clothing, cotton, silk, starch, are
floating in it, associated with fragments of various kinds butterflies'
scales, dried tarsuses of insects, feather-barbs, and skeletons of little
worms. Pollens of the coniferre and of numerous plants are abundant
in it during the floral season. Particles of mineral matter are also
found there, among them those curious spherules of meteoric air which
have been described by M. Gaston Tissandier.*
Attention is, however, most strongly fixed upon the number and
variety of spores of cryptogams of which the air operates as a vehicle
of dissemination. Germs of the common molds, and the reproductive
cells of the algae that live on the roofs of houses, on walls, and on
damp earth, are nearly always abundant. M. Miquel has tried to de-
termine the laws that govern the appearance of these plants in the
atmosphere. He first counted them, by disposing his aeroscopes so
that they should register the volume of the air passing through them,
