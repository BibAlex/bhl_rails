manently at one end, and by a hinged double door of sheet-iron (d d)
at the other. Ths doubling of the door is for the purpose of retaining
the heat by means of an inter-
vening lining of ill-conducting
material. Or a single door
of sheet-iron, with a panel of
wood outside, may be used.
The whole to be set horizon-
tally in brickwork, as shown
in Fig. 4, the door-front being
flush with the front of the
brickwork. The flame of the
small fire below plays freely
all round it by filling the en-
veloping flue-space indicated
by the dotted lines on Fig. 4.
Inside the cylinder is a shelf
to support the dripping-pan
(d), Fig. 1, which is separate-
ly shown in Figs. 2 and 3.
This dripping-pan is an
important element of the ap-
paratus. Fig. 3 shows it in
cross-section, made up of two
tin-plate dishes, one above the
other, arranged to leave a
space (o) between. This space
contains water, half to three
quarters of an inch in depth.
Above is a gridiron, shown in
plan, Fig. 2, on which the
meat rests ; the bars of this
are shown in section in Fig. 3.
The object of this arrange-
ment is to prevent the fat
which drips from the meat
from being overheated and
filling the roaster with the
fumes of " burnt," i. e., par-
tially decomposed, . fat and
gravy, to the tainting influ-
ence of which Rumford at-
tributed the English prejudice
against baked meat. So long
as any water remains, the dripping can not be raised more than two
or three degrees above 212.
