MICROSCOPIC LIFE IN THE AIR.

compare different periods of the same year, we shall not find the vari-
ations so regular. Sometimes the number of germs diminishes while
the heat is increasing. In that case the effect of temperature is
masked by the preponderance of another factor the hygrometric
condition of the air. This fact is explained by remembering that

the development of molds is dependent upon both heat and moisture.
The effect of moisture, however, varies according to the season, and
with changes in temperature. Dry weather diminishes the number of
germs in summer, and increases it in winter, while moist weather oper-
ates in an inverse manner.
Storms in the pleasant season are followed by a growth of cryp-
togamic vegetation, and purify the atmosphere for only a very short
time. Fifteen or eighteen hours after a rain, says M. Miquel, " the
spores appear to be five or ten times as numerous as before. On the
other hand, mineral dusts and several kinds of microbes continue to
be rare till the moisture which has caused them to adhere to the blades
of grass and the moist soil of the surface has dried away."
These investigations, while they are profitable in a purely scientific
aspect, are also destined to be of service in agriculture and hygiene.
