Thus, by means of repeated selection alone, the length of the ears
has been doubled, their contents nearly trebled, and the " tillering "
power of the seed increased fivefold.

It was supposed by ancient writers that the powers of grains dif-
fered in relation to their positions in the ear. This Major Hallett
investigated in 1858, by planting the grains of ten ears on a plan
showing their several positions in the ear. The only general result,
among most conflicting ones, was that the smallest grains, those most
remote from the center of growth, exhibited throughout, most unex-
pectedly, a vigor equal to that of the largest ; and that the remarked
w r orst grains, in one or two instances, did not by any means fall so
far short of the good ones as had been expected. Frequent trials have
also been made of the comparative power of large and small, plump
and thin grains, and, in the case of oats, which produce a small grain
attached to a large one, trials as to their respective powers with uni-
form results, viz., that, in good grains of the same pedigree, neither
mere size nor situation in the ear supplies any indication of the su-
perior grain.
Very close observation during many years led to the discovery
that the variations in the cereals which Nature presents to us are
not only hereditary, but that they proceed upon a fixed principle,
and from them has been educed the following law of development of
cereals :
1. Every fully-developed plant, whether of wheat, oats, or barley,
presents an ear superior in productive power to any of the rest on that
plant.
2. Every such plant contains one grain which, upon trial, proves
more productive than any other.
3. The best grain in a given plant is found in its best ear.
