fairly outlined ; but that these stumps and logs and splinters have
been wood there can be no possible doubt. Our microscope settles the
question once for all by revealing the very form and markings of the
original wood-cells now replaced by silex. In Fig. 1 we have the mi-
croscopic view of a section taken from a log lying on the summit of
one of the buttes. The medullary rays are plainly seen, as well as
wood-cells bearing series of peculiar concentric circles, which every
botanist instantly recognizes as characteristic of the Coniferce, the
cone-bearing trees, pines, cedars, firs, sequoias, so that we may not only
safely pronounce the petrifaction on the hill-top a fossil log, but we
have determined without doubt the vegetable order to which it belongs.
For the silicifying of such masses of organic material long submer-
gence was doubtless necessary, but to which of the beds of the series
exposed these relics belong it is difficult to determine. Such fossils
come to light only by erosion, and erosion leaves them always at the
lowest levels.
But these are not the only evidence of a former vegetable life very
different from that now prevalent in the Bad Lands. All these beds

of lignite, said to exceed in area all the other coal-fields of the world,
are of undoubted vegetable origin. Knowing what we do about coal
in general, we can conceive of no other history for them, and although
we find in these American beds no such veritable logs as characterize
the hraun-Jcohle of Northern Europe, yet the presence in the lignite of
