been exposed to a heat of from 158 to 167, without being free from
germs ; for, if we afterward add a quantity of broth which has been
sterilized at 230, the mixture of the two liquids, which, separate,
would have continued perfectly limpid, will shortly swarm with ba-
cilli and other organisms. Cohn's liquid can not be fully deprived of
active germs till it has been boiled for four hours. If, continues M.

Miquel, we add sewer-water that has been heated for several hours in
an hermetically sealed retort at 176 to Cohn's liquid which has been
sterilized at 230, and place the mixture in a hot bath, nothing will
appear in it even after a month. Apparently it is perfectly free from
living -germs. But if a few drops of it are placed in a broth, also
fully sterilized, the broth will in a day or two appear full of bacilli.
We must, then, unless we would expose ourselves to grave errors,
distinguish between apparent and real sterilization. While beef -broth,
neutralized with potash and heated to 230, will remain sterile for an
indefinite time, it is a good plan with other compositions and for par-
ticular bacteria to attain a temperature as high as 302.
Heat, unfortunately, modifies the composition of organic liquids,
