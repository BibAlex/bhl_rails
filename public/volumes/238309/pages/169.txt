I am the child of earth and air and sea !
My lullaby by hoarse Silurian storms
Was chanted ; and through endless changing forms
Of plant and bird and beast unceasingly
The toiling ages wrought to fashion me.
Lo, these lar^e ancestors have left a breath
Of their strong souls in mine, defying death
And change. I grow and blossom as the tree,
And ever feel the deep-delving earthy roots
Binding me daily to the common clay.
But with its airy impulse upward shoots
My life into the realms of light and day ;
And thou, O Sea, stern mother of my soul,
Thy tempests sing in me, thy billows roll !
in.
A sacred kinship I would not forego
Binds me to all that breathes ; through endless strife
The calm and deathless dignity of life
Unites each bleeding victim to its foe.
What life is in its essence, who doth know ?
The iron chain that all creation girds
Encompassing myself and beasts and birds,
Forges its bond unceasing from below
From water, stone, and plant, e'en unto man.
Within the rose a pulse that answered mine
(Though hushed and silently its life-tide ran)
I oft have felt ; but when with joy divine
I hear the song-thrush warbling in my brain,
I glory in this vast creation's chain.

I stood and gazed with wonder blent with awe
Upon the giant footprints Nature left
Of her primeval march in yonder cleft ;
A fern-leaf's airy woof, a reptile's claw,
In their eternal slumber there I saw
In deftly-wrought sarcophagi of stone.
What humid tempests, from rank forests blown,
Whirled from its parent stem yon slender straw ?
What scaly creature of a monstrous breed
Bore yonder web-foot through the tepid tide ?
Oh, what wide vistas thronged with mighty deed
And mightier thought have here mine eyes descried !-
