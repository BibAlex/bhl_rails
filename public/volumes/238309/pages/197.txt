sighted men of capital and public spirit saw something of what rail-
roads were to be, and soon the iron way began to connect the great
cities of the Atlantic together, and then these with the interior of the
New England and Middle States, until at last the continent has been
belted, and the distant mining-camps of the Rocky Mountains, and the
broad stretches of the Calif ornian and Texan plains, are directly con-
nected with every city and town in the country. A single life covers
the entire period which separates the time when stage-coaching and
wagoning were the methods of transportation, from to-day, when rail-
roads loom up in capital and centralized control as the most important
element of American commerce.
The benefits derived from the railroads have been so great as to
have virtually created the population and wealth of some of the wide
Western States and Territories. Railroads have opened up homes for
millions sent across the sea from overcrowded Europe, have cheapened
food, clothing, and shelter, have practically broken down State and
sectional lines, and by interfusion of capital and population have done
more to weld the Union together than any other influence. The loco-
motive has proved a giant indeed, capable of bearing heavy burdens,
and accomplishing splendid results ; yet of late railroad corporations
have shown a disposition to abuse their strength for public oppression,
and the railroad problem is, how this tendency may be best overcome.
While on all hands the indebtedness of the community to railroad
enterprise is gladly acknowledged, and while the average return on
railroad investments throughout the country is but three per cent, and
the charges generally are lower than elsewhere in the world, yet the
complaints made against some of the leading lines are so serious as to
have given rise to one of the angriest discussions of the time.
The chief complaints, of course, have been made against the lucra-
tive roads, those which run through thickly-settled regions, like the
New York Central ; and against lines which, like the Central Pacific,
are monopolies pure and simple. The complaints are of exorbitant
charges, of discrimination in favor of individuals, firms, and localities ;
that the railroad companies lend themselves to the aggrandizement of
monopolies such as the Standard Oil Company, and of minor subsidiary
organizations, car, bridge, express, stock-yard, and elevating companies
which absorb parasitically profits which should belong to the railway
shareholders, and which, if rightfully appropriated, would tend to re-
lieve the burdens borne by the general public. The complainants fur-
thermore aver that the railroad companies make use of their influence,
as employers of large bodies of voters, to corrupt Legislatures and
courts that they may remain unpunished in committing acts of fraud
and rapacity, and defeat attempts by the State to exert the control
which the highest authorities declare to be within its rightful powers.
To take up these complaints somewhat in detail and beginning
with that of exorbitant charges there was provision made in most of
