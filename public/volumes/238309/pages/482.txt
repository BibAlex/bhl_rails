MATTER LIVING AND NOT-LIVING.
By PAUL E. SHIPMAN.
THE Victoria Institute, or Philosophical Society of Great Britain,
has published, in pamphlet form, a paper by Professor Lionel S.
Beale, in which that eminent physician and microscopist attacks, with
free assertion and aspersion, the doctrine of the identity of living and
not-living matter. Dr. Beale is himself a member of the Victoria In-
stitute, and, if one may judge from the imprimatur which the society
has set on his paper, he is esteemed a spokesman worthy of its name,
if not a foeman worthy of anybody's steel ; and no doubt the paper
has proved acceptable to those for whom it was intended. It may be
worth while, therefore, in the interest especially of this excellent class,
to examine what he has to say.
Dr. Beale, it might better be mentioned at once, has a theory of
his own, or at least of his adoption, with which he confronts the theory
of his aversion ; and it will conduce to clearness, as well as brevity, if
we first look at the opposing theories side by side, premising that Dr.
Beale expressly lays the question of their relative merits before the
tribunal of science, whose jurisdiction in the case he thereby acknowl-
edges. Let us at the outset, then, regard the two theories as he sets
them face to face.
Dr. Beale opens the discussion by confessing that he finds himself
among the "very small number" who "have objected to the physical
view of life as untenable in the present state of scientific knowledge,'''' a
qualification which in the course of his paper he repeats and reiterates,
and which means, if it means anything, that the capacity of physical
causes in this relation has not yet been explored exhaustively, and that
the view in question may become tenable in the progress of scientific
knowledge. "The living world," Dr. Beale proceeds to say, in the
