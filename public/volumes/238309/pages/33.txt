deducing the number of spores contained in a cubic metre of air.

ological conditions, he succeeded in defining the influence of the sea-
sons, and of temperature, dryness, and moisture in the progress of the
phenomenon.
This method, applied at the Montsouris Observatory, shows that the
number of mold-spores is weak in January and February, diminishes
in March, and rises in April ; the increase is very sensible in May, and
the maximum is reached in June. The number then diminishes slowly
till October, considerably in November, and reaches a minimum in
December.
It may be said, generally, for the locality where the experiments
were made, that a cubic metre of air contains on the average seven
thousand mold-spores in December, January, and February ; twelve
thousand in May ; thirty-five thousand in June ; twenty-three thou-
sand in August ; fourteen thousand in October, and eight thousand in
November. If, instead of considering the means of several years, we
