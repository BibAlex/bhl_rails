THE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY.
of a traveler whose mission is scientific,
and who expects to make a study of all that
he sees, and to draw a lesson valuable to
students and to mankind from every object
he meets. The impressions are recorded
here. The studies will come afterward,
and the fruits of them, probably, be given
to the world in volumes which will be heav-
ier in proportion as they are of more solid
value. Professor Haeckel, as may be in-
ferred from the character of his mind, saw
more than common tourists do, and, in one
direction at least, more intelligently. To
him, in Ceylon a country of tropical luxu-
riance, contrasting strongly with cold and
frugal Germany everything was fresh, new,
and full of blooming life. These qualities
are exhibited also by his narrative, which is
brilliant in color, warm with admiration,
and diversified with the lively effusions of
an imagination which might have made a
poet had it not been bestowed upon a stu-
dent of prosaic biology.
The Maintenance of Health. A Medical
Work for Lav Readers. By J. Milner
Fothergill, 'M. D., M. R. C. P. New
York : G. P. Putnam's Sons. Pp. 366.
Paper. Price, 60 cents.
A work that was first published several
years ago, but which is so thorough in its
treatment of the subject, and contains so
much that is of practical value, that it still
remains one of the best books of the kind
in the market. We have already given full
notice and commendation of the two pre-
vious editions, the larger and expensive one,
and the more popular edition in 12mo; so
we need only mention the appearance of
this cheap edition, and say that the publish-
ers deserve the tbanks of the public for
issuing it.
