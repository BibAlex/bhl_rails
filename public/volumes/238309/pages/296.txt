CHANGES IN NEW ENGLAND POPULATION.
By NATHAN ALLEN, M.D., LL.D.
IN the history of a nation or a people there are sometimes important
changes taking place, so gradually and quietly that they are scarce-
ly perceptible at the time. It may require a series of years or several
generations to work out the problems involved, but they may be fol-
lowed with results of great magnitude.
Some changes of this character have been taking place in our New
England population, which we purpose here briefly to notice. In the
earlier history of New England there were few changes in the resi-

cipal occupation, the same farms and lands continued to a great extent
in the same families from generation to generation. Prior to the
Revolutionary War very little emigration took place out of New Eng-
land. In the early part of the present century many persons removed
to New York and some to Ohio. From 1810 to 1830 this emigration
continued steadily to increase, not only to those States but to the
States and Territories farther west. To such an extent had this emi-
gration been carried on that, in 1840, the United States census re-
ported nearly half a million of persons boi'n in New England who
were living in other States.
Whenever new lands were thrown into market by the Government,
or by means of railroads, or some new mining interests, then a " West-
ern fever" started up, and great numbers might be seen "going
West." While we have no means of ascertaining the exact number
removing from New England, during any one year or period of time,
the United States census gives, every ten years, the birthplace of all
people residing in every State at the time the count was made. The
census of 1880 reports that the whole number born in New England
