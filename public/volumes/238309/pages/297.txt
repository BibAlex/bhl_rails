but living in other States and the Territories was 566,848. This num-
ber is made up by emigration from the different States as follows :
From Massachusetts, 175,349 ; from Vermont, 117,590 ; from Connect-
icut, 108,797 ; from Maine, 93,256 ; from New Hampshire, 49,397 ;
and from Rhode Island, 22,459.
From another point of view it will be seen how these natives of
New England are distributed. New York has 133,272 ; Illinois, 53,128 ;
California, 46,908 ; Iowa, 38,170 ; Michigan, 37,865 ; Wisconsin,
37,615 ; Minnesota, 34,636 ; Ohio, 32,819 ; Pennsylvania, 26,787 ;
Kansas, 19,338 ; New Jersey, 18,148 ; and other States under 10,000
and much less. Vermont has sent away the largest number for its
population, and New Hampshire the least. Maine and Massachusetts
have sent the largest delegations to California, being three fourths of
all the emigrants in that State from New England. It appears by the
census that the States bordering on New York Vermont, Massachu-
setts, and Connecticut have sent over 100,000 persons to that State,
while the other New England States have sent only some 20,000. The
representation from New England (178,207) in the Middle States is
much larger than is generally supposed. This emigration has now
been going on for three fourths of a century, and it would constitute
a fact of great interest if we could ascertain the number of persons
born in New England who have ever removed from her borders to
the Middle and Western States as well as to the Territories.
The census of 1850 shows that at that time there were 454,626 ; in
1860 there were 562,997 ; in 1870 there were 615,747, and in 1880,
566,848. It will be seen by these figures that for twenty years the
number has been very stationary, the new emigrants making not quite
good the number who had deceased.
It is full two generations since this emigration commenced. As
nearly all those persons emigrating were between the ages of twenty
and forty, great numbers must have died at various periods. The
exact amount of this mortality it is impossible to ascertain, and the
data for forming anything like a correct estimate are altogether too
uncertain. It may have been a quarter of a million, and possibly a
half million. What has been the effect of this steady and large drain
of people on New England opens a question of much interest.
Without entering upon the discussion of the subject, we make two
or three suggestions. It will be admitted, we presume, that those
young men and women, leaving their homes, possessed, as a general
thing, more physical energy and mental stamina than those remain-
ing behind. Such a loss of physical vigor and character must have
had a decided effect upon business interests as well as the present
state of society. But, from another point of view, the loss may have
had a more decided and lasting influence, that is, in its permanent
effect upon physical and mental development. The better the princi-
ples of physiology are understood the more we discover what a pow-
