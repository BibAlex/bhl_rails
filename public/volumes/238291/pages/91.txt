Information for Authors
Articles from botanical systematics and ecology, including
biographical sketches, critical reviews, and summaries of literature
will be considered for publication in PHYTOLOGIA. Manuscripts may
be submined either on computer diskeue, or as clean typescript.
Diskettes will be returned to authors after action has been taken on
the manuscript. Diskenes may be 5.25" or 3.5" and may be written in
any IBM or Macintosh compatible format. Typescript manuscripts
should be single spaced and will be read into the computer using a
scanner. The scanner will read standard type fonts but will not read
dot matrix print. Manuscripts submined in dot matrix print cannot
be accepted. Use underscore (not italics) for scientific names.
Language of manuscripts may be either EngUsh or Spanish. Figures
will be reduced to fit within hmits of text pages. Therefore, figures
should be submitted with internal scales. Legends for figures should
be included in figures whenever possible. Each manuscript should
have an abstract and key word list. Specimen citations should be
consistent throughout the manuscript. Serial titles should be cited
with standard abbreviations. References cited only as part of
nomenclatural summaries should not appear in Literature Cited.
Nomenclatural work should include one paragraph per basionym
and must provide proper (as defined by the current Internationa]
Code of Botanical Nomenclature) citation of sources of epithets and
combinations.
Authors should arrange for two workers in the appropriate field to
review the manuscript before submission. Copies of reviews should
be forwarded to the editor with the manuscript. Manuscripts will not
be published without review.
