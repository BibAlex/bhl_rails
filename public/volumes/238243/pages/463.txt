A few specimens may be referred to this species, having the char-
acteristic form of the last chambers.

There are a few specimens of this species which are very similar
to those figured by Brady.^ It is evidently a species occm-ring in
the Indo-Pacific region in shallow water. Brady's material is all
from the South Pacific. Chapman records it from the Arabian
Sea, and it is known as far east as off the Galapagos, and Juan Fer-
nandez. Most of the records are in comparatively shallow water.
Genus SIPHOGENERINA Schlumberger, 1883.
SIPHOGENERINA BIFRONS. var. STRIATULA Cushman.
Siphogenerina bifrons, var. striatula Cushman, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., vol. 51,
1917, p. 662.
There is a single specimen of this variety in the material. It is
common in the Philippine region and extends its range very much
to the south, showing that it is probabh^ widely distributed in the
Indo-Pacific.
Subfamily Ramulininae.
Genus RAMULINA Rupert-Jones, 1875.
RAMULINA GLOBULIFERA H. B. Brady.
Ramulina globulifera H. B. Brady, Quart. Journ. Micr. Sci., vol. 19, 1879, p.
58, pi. 8, figs. 32, 33; Rep. Voy. Challenger, Zoology, vol. 9, 1884, p. 587, pi. 76,
figs. 22-28.— Chapman, Trans. New Zealand Instit., vol. 38, 1905, p. 99.—
Cushman, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt. 3, p. 110, pi. 39, fig. 1. — Sidebottom,
Joum. Roy. Micr. Soc, 1918, p. 149.
There are one or two specimens which probably belong to this spe-
cies, although they may be possibly very fistulose PolymorpMnae.
Both specimens, however, have a definite chamber, from which
branch the numerous arms. Therefore the}^ seem to be reasonably
placed under Ramulina.
