384 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. vol. 56.
It was not until after 1883 that King's term PlatystropMa came into
general use.*
Several recent investigators have added mucli to our knowledge by
their specific interpretations, among whom Prof. E. R. Cumings and
Dr. A. F. Foerste ^ are most prominent. Professor Cumings pub-
lished a detailed study on the Morphology of the Genus ^ which
brought out the fundamental lines of evolution and viiriation. The
aim of the present paper is to corroborate and add some facts to the
work which he has done.
The mutability of species has been accepted by most investigators
since Darwin published his "Origin of Species" in 1859. However,
many systematists to-day find difficulty in including more than one
species in a well-graded series, even though the extremes are quite
different. When individuals possessing common characteristics and
possessing the tendency to acquire certain other characteristics are
subjected to varying influences they develop differentially. This
results in groups which differ to a greater or less degree. These
groups are regarded by the writer as species.
The material on which this study is based belongs for the most
part to the United States National Museum. It consists of about
4,000 specimens from various points in North America and Europe.
The specimens were mainly from the Ulrich collection, with addi-
tions made in recent years by various members of the museum
paleontological staff.
In addition to these, several hundred Piatystropliias from the
Paleontological Museum of Columl)ia Uni^'e^sity v/ere at the writer's
disposal. Dr. A. F. Foerste also kindly presented about 500 speci-
mens from the Ohio Valley and from Michigan to the United States
National Museum in order to further the present study.
With the fullest appreciation of Professor Cumings's work on the
"Morphogensis of Platystrophia" the writer gladly acknowledges
her indebtedness to him for the inspiration received from that valuable
work. He has also been of great service in offering helpful suggestions
and criticisms. Acknowledgments are extended to Dr. E. O. Ulrich,
of the United States Geological Survey, who supplied information
which could not be secured from any other source. The writer
desires to express her appreciation to Dr. R. S. Bassler, curator of
