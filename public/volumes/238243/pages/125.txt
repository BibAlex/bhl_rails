American Museum of Natural History and at least two, Nos. 4061
and 4121, the former, which was figured ^ by Cope, now belongs to
the United States National Museum collections. These cotypes and
other specimens were collected in the Green River beds of the
Wasatch formation, at Black Buttes, Wyoming.
In 1908 Hay ^ redescribed these cotypes and other materials and
figured some additional parts.
The typical material is quite inadequate so far as giving a clear
conception of the bony structure and the true relationships of the
species, and the provisional recognition of a more perfect specbnen
in the United States National Museum collections here referred to

Echmatemys megaulax (Cope) is a welcome addition to our knowledge
of this species.
This specimen (No. 7316) was collected by Mr. D. F. Hewett of
the United States Geological Survey in 1911 from the Wasatch forma-
tion, in sec. 9, T. 50 N., R. 99 W., near Wiley, Big Horn County,
Wyoming. It consists of a considerable portion of the carapace and
plastron as shown in Plate 36, as well as the humerus and ulna of
the right side.
The principal portions missing are all of the peripherals posterior to
the third, posterior half of the eighth neural, suprapygal, pygal, seventh
and eighth costals of the right side and the eighth of the left side;
