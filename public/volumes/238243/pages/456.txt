Two forms occur — one with the apical spine as figured by Brady ^
the other with the apical spine wanting, and a the costae of the
surface extending over the apical end. These have the appearance
of a test in which the first chamber has in some way become detached.

Nodosaria obliqua Linnaeus, var. vertebralis Chapman, Trans. New Zealand

This species seems to attain a large size in this material and may
be compared to that found in the Philippine region.

There is a single specimen mounted which is very close in its
character to that figured by Brady {Challenger, pi. 63, fig. 14).
Genus LINGULINA d'Orbigny, 1826.
LINGULINA CARINATA d'Orbigny (7).
Lingulina carinaia d'Orbigny, Ann. Sci. Nat., vol. 7, 1826, p. 257, No. 1. — H. B.
Brady, Rep. Voy. Challenger, Zoology, vol. 9, 1884, p. 517, pi. 65, fig.(?)16.
There is a single specimen which is almost identical in all its
characters with that figured by Brady ^ under this name. This is,
however, evidently not L. carinata d'Orbigny. Brady mentions
in his list of localities that he had material from the South Pacific,
and this form figured by him may possibly be characteristic of this
region. It is evidently a new species or variety, which should be
described when more material is available.
