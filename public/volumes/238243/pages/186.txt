separate at basal and apical areas, evidently a condition of age.
Both liave the same fin formula, though the West Indian fish agrees
with Jordan and Evermann's Hawaiian ^ in the slightly shorter
pectoral, though at present without any traces of the four dark spots
on the back below dorsal as shown in the figure. They mention but
three blotches as sometimes present. Steindachner notes an ex-
ample from Acapulco Bay, Mexico, 738 mm. long, but dark dorsal
spots are not mentioned.^
SELAR CRUMENOPHTHALMUS (Bloch).
Head, 3; depth, 3^ to 3^; D. VIII— I, 25; A. II— I, 22; scales,
50 to 51 — 40 to 41 in lateral line; snout, 3 J to Sh in head, measured
from snout tip; eye, 2| to 3; maxillary, 2^ to 2^; interorbital, 4J to
4J; rakers 11 to 13 +27 or 28, lanceolate, long as filaments, or 2 in
eye. Two examples, 223 and 254 mm.
A comparison of scales and other characters, as gill-rakers, radii,
scutes, etc., reveals no distinctions other than individual, in examples
from the Philippines and Hawaiian Islands. The circuli on the scales
are very fine and mostl}^ continuous where approximating.
CEPHALOPHOLIS TAENIOPS (Valenciennes).
Head, 2f; depth, 3^; D. IX, 15, i; A. Ill, 9, i; scales, 107 along
and above lateral line to caudal base, and 8 more on latter; 70 pores
in lateral line to caudal base and 4 more on latter; 13 scales above
lateral line to soft dorsal origin, 26 below to spinous anal origin;
snout 3f in head, measured from upper jaw tip; eye, 6; maxillary,
about 2J; interorbital, 5f. Body well compressed, elongate, also
caudal peduncle. Head compressed, flattened sides slightly approxi-
mate above, and upper profile little concave above nostrils. Snout
slightly broader than long. Eye high, well advanced or center near
first third in head. Mouth large, lower jaw well protruded. Maxil-
lary to hind pupil edge, expansion If in eye. Teeth in rather wide
bands, pair of canines above and double pair below in front. Lower
teeth mostly larger, in three or four rows, graduated to inner row
which longest, and all but outer row depressible inwards. Patch of
large inner depressible teeth each side in front of upper jaw. Sides
of upper jaw with outer row of slightly larger erect teeth, and inner
row of vilhform ones. Vomer and palatines each with row of minute
or villiform teeth. Tongue pointed, free. Interorbital broadly con-
vex. Hind preopercle edge minutely and obsoletely denticulate, but
ver>^ slightly enlarged at angle, which rounded. Rakers iv, 4 +11 vr,
lanceolate, slightly longer than filaments, or 1| in eye. Scales small,
