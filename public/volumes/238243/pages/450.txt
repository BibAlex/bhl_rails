the figures given by Brady in the CTiallenger report.

There are four specimens which are very evidently this species.
Chapman records it from off Great Barrier Island, and our specimens
show an exserted aperture very much like that shown by Brady in
the Oliallenger report, but more strongly marked. The neck itself,
however, has a definite labyrinthic opening, except for the smallest
specimens, which are valvuline. I, however, do not think that all
specimens referred to Ilajylostiche soldanii and H. duhia should
belong to Clavulina, for in the Philippine region especially the two
are very distinct. Uaplostiche has no elongate aperture, and the
labyrinthic opening is much more complex than in this species.

There are a few specimens of this species on the slide.

This seems to be the most common species of the material, and the
specimens are very characteristic for the most part. Some of them,
however, have spines at the base which make them tend toward
B. aculeata in this respect. No typical aculeata were found, how-
ever. Sidebottom records all three of these species, and Chapman
records B. pyrula and B. marginata; the latter is abundant off Great
Barrier Island.
