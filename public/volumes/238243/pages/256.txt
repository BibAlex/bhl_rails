NO. 2295. NEW NORTH PACIFIC MOLLUSKS—DALL. 337
NEPTUNEA TOLOMIA, new species.
Shell small, short, inflated, white, with an angular shoulder near
the periphery on the spire, v/ith more than four whorls (the apex
defective), the suture distinct, not appressed: axial sculpture of (on
the last whorl about 35) sharp ribs, regularly spaced, with wider
interspaces, extending from the suture over the base; these ribs only
become lamellose with senility: the canal is axially striated and the
incremental lines visible; on the upper spire the intersection of the
ribs and shoulder angle tends to become nodulous; aperture rounded,
simple, body erased, canal narrow, a little recurved; height of shell,
19; of last whorl, 15; of aperture, 10; diameter, 10 mm. IT. S. Nat.
Mus. Cat. No. 222441.
Type-locality. — U. S. Fish Commission station 2896, off San Miguel
Island, California, in 376 fathoms, mud; ])ottom temperature, 43° F.
NEPTUNEA APOLYONIS, new species.
Shell small, white, subturrited, with more than four whorls, the
apex eroded, the suture distinct; axial sculpture of (on the last
whorl 13 to 15) sharp low varices with wider interspaces, sometimes
feebly angular at the shoulder on the spire but on the last whorl the
angle is blunted or obsolete; there is no spiral sculpture and the
incremental lines are not conspicuous; aperture rather wide, ovate
white, the outer lip reflected at the varices: body and pillar with a
coat of white enamel; canal narrow, slightly recurved, rather long;
the base of the last whorl gently constricted. Height of three whorls,
21; of last whorl, 17; diameter, 10 mm. U. S. Nat. Mus. Cat.
No. 209303.
Type-locality. — U. S. Bureau of Fisheries station 4423, in the vicinity
of the Santa Barbara Islands, California, in 216 to 339 fathoms, sand.
This is much like N. tolomia in general form but has fewer varices
and no spiral cords.
NEPTUNEA rrKITOMA, new species.
Shell elongated, slender, acute, with a 3-eilowish tinge, v,'ith eleven
varices, spinose at the shoulder, mth five or more whorls, the apex
decorticated; suture distinct, more or less undulated by the sculp-
ture; the varices sharp and imbricating; sculpture only of obvious
incremental lines and here and there a minute vermiculation; aper-
ture elongate-oval, outer lip thin, sliarp; body erjised; pillar arcuate,
twisted; canal long, narrow, curved; height of shell, 38: of last
whorl, 29; of aperture and canal, 25; diameter, 16 mm. U. S. Nat.
Mus. Cat. No. 222623.
