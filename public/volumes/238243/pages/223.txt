ill-defined band along middle of side silvery white, with slightl}^ leaden
undershade at lino within silvery area. Fins all pale brownish, ends
of dorsal rays blackish. Fourteen examples, 118 to 148 mm. Quanza
River.
These all differ from Boulenger's figure ^ as it does not show
the caudal lobes s(5aled basally above and below, the upper dorsal edge
not emarginate, while the dark median lateral band bends a little
below, so to appear nearly concurrent with the lateral line, doubtless
conditions of age.
BARILIUS ANSORGII Boulenger.
Two examples, 83 to 105 mm., labeled "West Africa," from the
Echpse Expedition, are included here as they may have been obtained
in Angola. Head, 3* to 3i; depth, 3f to 4i; D. ii, 7; A. in, 13 or 14;
scales 40 or 41 in lateral line to caudal base and 3 more on latter.
ALESTES ANSORGII Boulenger.
Head, 4 to 4f ; depth, 3* to 3|; D. ii, 8; A. iii, 17 to 19; scales, 34
to 38 in lateral line to caudal base and 2 or 3 more on latter; 6 scales
above lateral line, 3 below to anal; predorsal scales, 15 to 17; snout
3 to 3* in head ; eye, 3 J to 4 ; maxillary, 2| to 3 J ; interorbital, 2ยง to 3.
Elongate, slightly ovoid or lower profile more convex, deepest at
ventral origin. Caudal peduncle compressed, about deep as long;
least depth, 2^ to 2f in head. Head width, If to 2 in its length.
Snout conic; length, three-fourths to four-fifths its width. Eye
large, with broad adipose lid, advanced or hind pupil edge slightly
before center in head length. Mouth broad, gape short or to nostrils,
about midway in snout length. Lips thick, tough. Upper teeth in
2 rows, 6 outer smaller with 3 to 5 points; 7 inner broader with 7 or 8
points; and in ail median point largest. Lower teeth 8, large except
last lateral, with 5 to 7 points, and median point enlarged. Also
pair of smaller conic teeth, close inside, outer medially. Maxillary
extends slightly behind nostril, not quite to eye. Nostrils together,
midway in snout length. Interorbital convex. Broad suborbitals
not completely covering cheek, leave narrow naked strip below.
Rakers, ll-f-17, lanceolate, rather flexible, 2 in filaments. If in eye.
Scales large; basal striae 1 to 5 and apical 2 to 6; fewer in half-
grown. Dorsal origin midway between snout tip and caudal
base; slightly more advanced in half -grown; first branched ray,
IJ to H in head. Adipose fin, 1 J to IJ in eye. Anal inserted about
opposite depressed dorsal tip, slightly advanced in half -grown; first
branched ray, 1-| to 2 in head. Caudal well forked, lower lobe
slightly longer, 1 +i to 1+i in head; pectoral, IJ to U, ventral,
IJ to If. Color in alcohol uniform brownish above, sides and fins
all paler. Body -with silvery reflections, but no dark blotches on
