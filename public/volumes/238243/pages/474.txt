There are a number of specimens which are very evidently this
species, and show little variation in form and general characters
Chapman and Howchin record this from the Tertiary of Australia
Terquem described the species from the Pliocene of the Isle of
Rhodes; Sclilumberger described his species, which is evidently the
same as Terquem's, from the Gulf of Marseille.
Sidebottom had the same species from the Bay of Palermo, Sicily.
The figure given by Brady referred to above seems to be this same
species. From other material that I have had it seems to be wide-
spread and of very constant characters in this general region.

There is a single specunen which is very clearly this variety de-
scribed by Chapman from "forty miles south of Cape Wiles." It
has the same peculiar surface markings as shown in the type figure,
and probably has a widespread distribution about Australia and
elsewhere.

There are two specimens which are referred to this species. One
represents several close-set chambers irregularly coiled. The other
