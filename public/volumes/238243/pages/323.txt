Figs. 25-28. Platystrophia brachynota (Hall), p. 408.
25. Cardinal view illustrating the short hinge.
26. Brachial valve of the same specimen. The figure shows the five plications
on the fold.
Niagarian group (Louisville limestone), Louisville, Kentucky.
27. Pedicle valve. The presence of four plications in the sinus is characteristic.
28. Brachial valve of a small specimen.
Albion group (Brassfield limestone), Nelson t'ounty. Kentucky,
Figs. 29-31. Platystrophia. species.
29. Brachial valve. The fold scarcely rises above the general convex outline.
30. Cardinal view.
31. Pedicle valve. The shallow sinus it- characteristic. The plication pattern of
the fold and sinus shows that this species belongs to the biplicate group.
Middle Ordovician ( Wesenberg limestone), near Wesenberg, Esthonia, Russia.
Figs. 32-35. Platystrophia, spec ius.
32. Cardinal view showing the shoft hinge-line and globose form.
33. Brachial valve. The three plications of the fold is typical. The varices are
so strong as to be almost lamellote.
34. Pedicle valve.
35. Anterior view. This species has two plications in the sinus. The plication
pattern of the fold and sinus places this species in the biplicate group.
Upper Ordovician (Fl) Kiu-kiill, Russia.
Figs. 36-38. Plastystrophia rhynchonelliformis, new species, p. 413.
36. Brachial valve showing a compressed fold.
37. Pedicle valve. The triplicate arrangement of the plications of the sinus is
typical.
38. Cardinal view. The short hinge line is typical.
Trenton limestone Ellisburg, New York.

39. Pedicle valve showing the triplicate plication pattern.
Trenton group (Hermitage limestone), two miles north of Hartsville,
Tennessee.
40. Cardinal view. The thin valves are characteristic.
41. Brachial valve.
Trenton group (Hermitage limestone), Auburn, Tennessee.

42. Brachial valve showing the presence of three plications on the fold.
43. Pedicle valve. The two plications in the sinus show the biplicate arrange-
ment.
