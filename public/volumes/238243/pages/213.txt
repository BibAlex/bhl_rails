Color in alcohol dark brown above, paler to whitish below, with
silvery reflection. Along side from shoulder to caudal base pale
leaden band, below dorsal apparently wide as pupil, but ill defined.
Iris pale. Fins brownish; dorsal, pectoral, and caudal darker, and
dorsal nearly blackish behind. Length, 545 mm. (beak and caudal
damaged).
Compared with an example I identified as Tylosurus crocodilus
(Le Sueur) from Sumatra,' about 622 mm. long, the scale structure
is similar, and no specific characters of strong contrast noted. In
the Sumatra specimen the scales are larger, about 315 in a lateral
series to the caudal base, less narrowly imbricated, and the median
and last dorsal rays lower or at least not twice least depth of caudal
peduncle. The Sumatra fish has larger predorsal scales, about 290.
Peters records Belone carihaea Le Sueur from Victoria,^ which possi-
bly may be the present species. It apparently differs in having 210
predorsal scales
