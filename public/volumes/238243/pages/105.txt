The posterior surface for the calcaneum is concave along its greater
diameter; slightly convex along the shorter. The surface for the
fibula is nearly plane in its upper part, but convex from front to rear
in its lower half. The articular surface for the navicular is concave,
but not deeply so. The surface for the cuboid is convex,
TRUCIFEHS FLORIDANUS (Leidy).
Plate 28, figs. 1-3.
In 1889* Leidy described a skull of a saber-tooth tiger to which
he gave the name Machairodus jioridanus. This had been secured
by Mr. Joseph Willcox, in a limestone quarry at Ocala, Florida.
From the same quarry had been obtained other remains which are
referred to Equus leidyi, Bison, sp. indet., Odocoileus sp. indet., Dasy-
pus sp. indet., Sylvilagus sp. indet., Procamelus minor, and Elephas
columbi? All of these indicate that the deposits belong to the
Pleistocene.
From the skull described by Leidy all the teeth were missing; but
there were present the alveoli for the upper incisors, the great
canine, the third premolar, and the carnassial. This skull was
figured in a later paper.^
In the Eighth Annual Report of the Florida Geological Survey,
on plate 29, figure 8, Dr. E. H. Sellards figured an upper carnassial
premolar which had been found at Vero, Florida, in the stratum
known in the literature of that locality as No. 2. This he referred
(p. 152) to Smilodon. Recently, through the kindness of Doctor
Sellards, the writer has been permitted to examine the tooth in
question. By comparing the figure of this tooth here presented
(pi. 28, figs. 1, 2) with that of Leidy's Trucifelis fatalis* it will be
seen that there is between them a close resemblance. It wiU be
necessary first of all to determine whether or not the Vero tooth
belongs to T. fatalis. The following measurements enable us to
make comparisons, those of T. fatalis being computed from Leidy's
description'^. In the second column under each tooth is given the
ratio of each dimension to the length of the tooth.
