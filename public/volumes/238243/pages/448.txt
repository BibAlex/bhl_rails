No. 2302. FORAMINIFERA FROM NEW ZEALAND— CUSHMAN. 603
TEXTUI*ARIA APERTURALIS Cushman.
Textularia solita (Schwager), var. inflata Goes, Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool., vol. 29,
1896, p. 42, pi. 5, figs. 1-3.
Textularia aperturalis Cushman, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt. 2, 1911, p. 20,
figs. 34-35.
There are several specimens which at first glance might be as-
signed to T. concava Karrer, but in the largest of these there is the
characteristic inflated portion with high chambers and a divided
apertm-e. The smaller, younger specimens have a simple aperture
and they have developed onl}^ to the stage where the inflated condi-
tion is beginning to be apparent. If it v/ere not for the only adult
specimen they might be taken for T. concava var. lieterostoma For-
nasini. Sidebottom ^ records a single specimen which he refers to
this variety. The type specimen of this species was from the west
coast of America, recorded by Goes.
Genus BIGENERINA d'Orbigny, 1826.
BIGENERINA NODOSARIA d'Orbigny.
Bigenerina nodosaria d'Orbigny, Ann. Sci. Nat., vol. 7, 1826, p. 261, pi. 11,
figs. 9-11.— H. B. Brady, Rep. Voy. Challenger, Zoology, vol. 9, 1884, p. 369,
pi. 44, figs. 14-18.— Cushman, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt. 2, 1911, p. 27,
figs. 46-48 (in text).
There are two specimens of this typical coral reef species. Neither
Chapman nor Sidebottom record this from this region.
Genus BOLIVINA d'Orbigny, 1839.
BOLIVINA DILATATA (?) Reuss.
There are several specimens which may be referred to this species,
but they are not typical. One or two of them suggest B. rohusta of
Brady (especially Cliallenger, pi. 53, fig. 7). Others are more like B.
dilatoM. Chapman records B. rohusta from off Great Barrier Island
and mentions that these specimens are smaller than usual for this
species.
BOLIVINA KARRERUNA H. B, Brady.
Bolivina karreriana H. B. Brady, Qiiart. Journ. Micr. Sci., vol. 21, 1881, p. 58;
Rep. Voy. Challenger, Zoology, vol. 9, 1884, p. 424, pi. 53, figs. 19-21.— Cush-
man, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt. 2, 1911, p. 40, fig. 65 (in text).
There are on the slide seven very typical specimens. This species
is recorded by Chapman from off Great Barrier Island, and Sidebot-
tom, from the east coast of Australia. It is one of the characteristic
species from the Indo-Pacific region.
