There is a single specimen which seems to be typical. It is micro-
spheric.

There are two microspheric specimens of small size which, although
not very irregular in surface pattern, resemble xery closel}'' the
young of this species as seen in material from the Philippines and
other portions of the North Pacific.
CORNUSPIRA, species (?).
There are two microspheric specimens on one of the slides which
seem to be different from any described species of this genus. The
earliest coils are smooth; the later ones are covered by longitudinal
or oblique costae. These are usually distinct and do not run one
into the other. The transverse lines of growth are also prominent
in the later portions. In the largest of the two specimens the coils
become somewhat expanded but not compressed, the test being at
its greatest thickness in this portion. It is not at all like C. striolata
H. B. Brady; in form it is somewhat similar to a specimen figured by
Chapman ^ from the Tertiary of Australia. Chapman's figure does
not show the surface markings as in our material, but the form is
very suggestive. Except for the very broad later growth it resembles
C lacunosa. The material of C. lacunosa which I had from the North
Pacific showed that the last coil loses its ornamentation largely.
Otherwise this largest specimen is quite similar to that form.

There are several well-developed specimens of this species in
various stages. The largest ones show adult characters very well.
