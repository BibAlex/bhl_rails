figs. 1, 2.— SiDEBOTTOM, Joum. Roy. Micr., Soc, 1918, p. 250.
There are five specimens on the shde, all of the same form and
general characters. The test is very thin and transparent, and
prominently, but finely perforate. The keels are more or less
irregular, occasionally somewhat angled in places.
SPIRILLINA DECORATA H. B. Brady.

p. 633, pi. 85, figa. 22-25.— Cushman, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt. 5, 1915, p. 7,
pi. 5, figs. 1, 2.— SiDEBOTTOM, Joum. Roy. Micr. Soc, 1918, p. 250.
There is a single specimen which is evidently this species. It,
however, agrees with the two smaller tests mentioned by Sidebottom,
resembling S. limhata var. denticulata.
SPIRILLINA LIMBATA H. B. Brady, var. DENTICULATA H. B. Brady.

There are two specimens very clearly this species. They are
mounted with the typical form. Both of these specimens are
broadest on the ventral side which is acutely angled.

A single very typical specimen is mounted. This species is not
mentioned either by Chapman or Sidebottom, but was dredged by
the Challenger off Australia in shallow water. I had the species
from the Hawaiian Islands and Japan, showing that it has a wide
range in this faunal area.

There are two sets of specimens mounted, one of which evidently
represents dead shells without color; the other, live ones in which
