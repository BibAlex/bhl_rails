No. 2300. SKELETON OF DIMETRODON GIGASâ€”GILMORE 539
The proximal row of phalanges, except on digit 1, have widely ex-
panded proximal ends and much narrower distal extremities. The
distal articulation is peculiar in having a blunt median projection
which is received in a median notch provided for it on the proximal
ends of the succeeding phalanges. The toes are terminated by
strong, clawed terminal phalanges that were cased in strong claws.
The whole structure of the carpus and other bones indicates a strong,
flexible foot, such as would be possessed by a carnivorous terrestrial
animal.
EXPLANATION OF PLATES.

Plate 73.
Model restoration of Dimetrodon gigas based on the mounted skeleton shown in plates
70 and 72. About one-twelfth natural size. Modeled by Charles W. Gihnore, 1918.
