preceding suture, the shell is adorned with alternating light and

CALLIOSTOMA CANALICULATUM, new variety NEBULOSUM.
Shell resembling the typical form except that the whorls are
painted with small brown nebulous patches in a radial fashion;
specimens of this kind from San Diego, California, illustrate the
variety and are numbered 159251.
CALLIOSTOMA CANALICULATUM. new variely TRANSLIRATUM.
Another variation occurs in the northern part of the range of this
species, from Sitka to the Straits of Fuca, in which the channels
between the yellowish spiral cords are of a dark reddish brown,
giving the shell a somber appearance, much in contrast with the
light straw-colored type from southern California. Specimens of the
former kind are in the collection from Biorka Island, Sitka Sound,
and are numbered 160558.
A dark and comparatively small form of C. gloriosum Dall seems
to be characteristic of specimens from the southern extreme of the
range of this species, especially in the vicinity of San Diego.
