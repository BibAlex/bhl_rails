time and marks the acme of specialization wliich was reached by the
genus.
The Ponderosa subgroup which is conspicuous in Maysville and
Lower Richmond time represents members of the genus which ex

turely old while the race as a whole was progressive.
The writer was unable to determine the relative abundance and
stratigraphic succession of European members of the genus.
Davidson's figures, 12, 13, and 25 ^ are distinctly of the triplicate
type, and seem to be related to PlatystropJiia colheinsis Foerste.
Figure 14^ evidently marks a retrograde form of this species as is
indicated by the one plication in the sinus.
