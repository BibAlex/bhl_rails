symmetricus . The eye is much larger in T. piduratus and the pec-
toral is also slightly longer. The scutes are within the same vari-
able limits in both species, my Californian material showing 50 to
54+46 to 52, though with rakers apparently slightly more numer-
ous, 16+45. The example I recorded from Valparaiso, as the present
species is T. symmetricus.^ It has scutes 50+50.
Scales of all three species are variable, though usually with three
basal striae more or less marginal. The circuli are fine, but little
coarser on middle of scale.
The Australian Oaranx declivis Jenyns ^ is shown with broad
scutes as in T. fncturatus, 82 in number, with about 50 on drawing
as spinescent in straight part of lateral line, though it has a few
more soft dorsal and anal rays than any of my examples of T. pic-
turatus. Bowdich originally published a wretched figure and his
description says soft dorsal with 17 and anal with 15 rays.^
CAESIOMORUS GLAUCUS (Linnaeus).
Head, 3| to 4; depth, 2^ to 2i; D. VI— I, i, 25, once 24; A. II—
I, r, 23 to 25; snout, 3| to 3 J in head; eye, 4 to 4|; maxillary, 2f to
2f; interorbital, 2| to 3; scales, 127 in lateral line to caudal base
and 4 more on latter. Body well compressed, contour evenly fusi-
form. Caudal peduncle compressed, depth ^ to f its length. Pre-
dorsal keel forward till over nostrils. Head compressed, sides about
evenly approximate above and below. Snout conic, long as wide
or length four-fifths of width. Eye round, advanced, hind edge
midway in head length and adipose lid around edges. MaxiUary
shghtly beyond eye front, expansion 2^ to 2f in eye. Mouth oblique,
jaws about even. Teeth minute, in narrow bands, resolving into
1 or 2 irregular narrow rows along sides of jaws. Narrow band of
very minute teeth, and similar ones in small arrow-shaped line on
vomer. Nostrils small, together, about two-thirds of eye diameter
before eye and level with its upper edge. Least infraorbital width
sUghtly over one-fourth to one- third of eye. Rakers 14 to 16 +
28 to 31, lanceolate, slightly longer than filaments. Scales cycloid,
rounded, largest along lateral line opposite soft dorsal and anal.
Patch of scales on front of cheeks behind maxillary, and another
behind eye, head otherwise naked. Spinous dorsal begins little
nearer soft dorsal origin than hind eye edge, spines low, second to
fourth subequaUy longest or about 1^ to 1| in eye. Soft dorsal
inserted about midway between snout tip and eye, or little nearer
caudal base, front of fin elevated though not as lobe and first branched
ray If to If in head. Soft anal similar, only first branched ray li-
te 2^ in head. Caudal very deeply forked, long slender pointed
