Genotype. — Matucania mellisquama, new species.
Clypeus gently sunken. Epistoma very short, not warped.

stout, long, bowed. Third antennal joint about three times second
in male. Arista longer than antennae, thin, bare. Eyes thickly
very long-pilose. Male vertex not one-fourth head width. Frontals

bare. Cheeks about two-fifths eye length. Two preacrostichals
and lateral scutellars; three sternopleurals, postintraalars, and post-
suturals; two or three postacrostichals ; rather long slender strongly
decussate apical scutellar pair. Third vein bristled only at base;
others bare. Apical cell open considerably before tip. Hind cross-
vein nearer to cubitus. Male claws long; median marginal pair on
first two segments; median discal pair on intermediate segments;
marginal row on last two segments ; discal row on anal.

height; palpi long, slender, crooked. Third antennal joint about
twice second in male. Arista microscopically pubescent basally.
Eyes nearly bare. Front of male much flattened, vertex not over
one-tenth head width. One frontal below base of antennae. Oscel-
lars present. Two sternopleurals, postintraalars and lateral scutel-
lars; three postsuturals; one or two preacrostichals; postacrostichals
at most very weak; short decussate apical scutellar pair. Third
vein bristled only at base; others bare. Apical cell open a little
