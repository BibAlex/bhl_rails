bescent. Eyes indistinctly short-hairy. Female vertex not one-
third head width. Female frontalia not as wide as one parafrontal.

orbitals down middle. Cheeks nearly one-third eye length. First
vein bare on distal half. Middle metatarsi as long as following joints
together. Female front tarsi plump, compressed, the claws minute.
A row of strong erect discals on anal segment. Apical crossvein
more oblique, nearly parallel with hind margin of wing. Abdomen
