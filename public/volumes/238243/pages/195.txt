Head, 8; depth, 32 1; snout, 6| in head; eye, 9|; maxiUary, 3|;
interorbital, 8; mandible, 2i; pectoral, 6; about 114? pores distinct
in lateral line; head, 3f to vent. Compressed, elongate, sides rather
flattened, and tail gi*adually tapers behind but not acuminate at tip.
Head moderately compressed; pharynx scarcely swollen, profiles
similar; width, 4^ its length; depth, 3f. Snout conic; upper profile
and surface convex; basal width, 1| its length; tip projecting well
beyond mandible. Eye large, rather ellipsoid, without eyelid, center
trifle before first fifth in head. Mouth large, broad, horizontal, or
but slightly inclined. Lips fleshy, entu'e, rather thick. Teeth conic,
sharp pomted, mostly directed back, moderate in size, not continu-
ous above with premaxillary or vomerine series. Upper lateral
teeth biserial. Mandibular teeth similar, continuous across sym-
physis. Several rather large premaxillary teeth, visible from below

in closed mandible. Vomerine teeth like upper laterals, beginning
just behind front nostril, biserial, conic, slope backward and anterior
little enlarged. Most all teeth little larger antei iorly in jaws. Tongue
not evident. Mandible shallow; surface rathei depressed, rami low.
Front nostril in small tube on upper lip opposite closed mandible tip.
Hind nostril deep slit in upper Up opening downward below front
eye edge. Interorbital convex. Gill-opening inclined in crescent
from opposite upper median pectoral rays obliquely back, about equals
eye. Skin rather smooth, with more or less distinct longitudinal
wrinkles on lowei sm'face of head and pharynx. Pores on head little
evident. Lateral line begins above on head little before middle in
latter's length, slightly elevated at fu*st along side of trimk, soon
median, ends short space before tail tip. Dorsal origin distant from
giU-opening, equals space between gill-opening and front eye edge;
fin low, continuous with low caudal behind. Caudal length about
three-fom-ths in eye. Anal, like dorsal, joins caudal behmd. Pec-
toral small, upper ray longest. Vent close before anal. Color in
alcohol largely brownish, obscm'ely dotted with darker. Head above
