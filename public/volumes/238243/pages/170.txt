Described from four females (type and paratypes a to c) reared
from material of leery a purchasi Maskell, Mendoza, Argentina (Carlos

predaceous on the Icerya. The specimens are poorly preserved as
two of the paratypes have lost the abdomen, and the antennae are
missing m all except the type.

2. BBETHESIA ABNOKMICORNIS (Glrault.)
Isodromus abnormicornis Girault, Insec. Insc. Menst., vol. 4, Jan., 1917, p. 118.
This species has not been seen by the writer, but seems to be closely
allied to latifrons. Accordmg to the original description the fronto-
vertox is moderately wide, the second funicle joint subequal to the
pedicel, the last funicle joint distinctly wider than long, the pro-
podeum with three widely separated canmae, and the postmarginal
vein only somewhat shorter than the stigmal. The coloration is
similar, but the pronotum more blackish, the mesopleura entirely
black, and the abdomen except at the base solidly black. The types
were reared from material of Icerya hrasiliensis Hempel, Sao Paulo,
Brazil (A. Hempel).
Type. —Cat. No. 20606, U.S.N.M.
