1. GYPONA RUGOSA Sp&ngberg.
Gyponarugosa SpIngberg, K. Svenska Vet. Akad. Handl., vol. 5, No. 3, p. 6, 1878.
This species has the general appearance of octo-lineata Say, but
from which it may easily be distinguished by the square deep notch
in the last female segment. The roughened or rugose surface of the
vertex, pronotum, and elytra is quite characteristic of this species.
