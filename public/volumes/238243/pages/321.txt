PLATYSTROPHIA CYPHA BELLATULA, new variety.
Plate 47, figs. 28-30.
In the Waynes ville formation of Ohio and Kentucky there is a small
variety of PlaiystropJiia cyplia with six, seven, or eight plications on
the lateral slopes. This variety has many characteristics in common
with Platystropliia unicostata. It is smaller and shorter than that
species, and has somewhat narrower plications on the lateral slopes.
Measurements. — 25.2 mm. along the hinge line, 21.5 mm. wide
across the middle, 14 mm. high, 17 mm. thick, 9.5 mm. sinal width,
13 mm. sinal depth, 4.5 mm. fold depth.
Occurrence. — Richmond group: Waynesville formation; Waynee?-
viUe and ClarksviUe, Ohio; Westport, Kentucky.

PLATYSTROPHIA WALLOWAYI Foerste.
Plate 45, figs. 5-8.
Platystrophia wallowaifi Foerste, Ohio Naturalist, vol. 1-, J 912, p. 453, pi.
22, fig. 6.
This represents a globose form with a hinge Ime somewhat shorter
than the width across the middle, a high, broad, rounded fold and
broad deep sinus. The brachial valve is strongly convex. The pedicle
valve is not as deep as the brachial valve; it is convex next to the
sinus, but becomes slightly concave toward the cardinal angles.
There are usually four plications on the fold and three in the sinus
but in some s])ecimens there are five or more plications on the fold
and fom* or more in the sinus. There are usually 9 or 10 plications on
the lateral slopes. Mature specimens have strong growth lines.
Measurements. — 19 mm. along the hinge line, 22.6 mm. wide below
the middle (greatest width), 17.3 mm. high, 17.2 mm. thick, 13.7
mm. sinal width, 11.3 mm. sinal depth, 6.7 mm. fold height.
Occurrence. — Richmond group: Arnheim formation: Walloway
Creek, near Boston, Bardstown, etc., Kentucky; Southeastern Indi-
ana.
