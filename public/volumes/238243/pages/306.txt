In the extensive collections belonging to the United States National
Museum no members of this genus were found below the Black
Eiver Group. Professor Cumings investigated this point and reached
the same conclusions. He says: '
I am unable to find any original references in the literature to its occurrence in
the rocks of tliia age (Chazy). Messrs. Ami, Whiteaves, and W. Billings of Ottawa,
Canada, inform me that the Museum of the Canadian Survey contains no Chazy speci-
mens; and that they are not aware that the species has ever been found in that series.
Mr. Billings suggests that it may have been found in rocks formerly held as Chazy.
but now known to be of later age. Mr. McBride, of Montreal, writes that there are
no Chazy specimens in the Museums at Montreal and that he does not know of the
occurrence of Platystrophia in the Chazy. Mr. Seely, who is familiar with the Chazy,
writes to the same effect. It is very probable, therefore, that the form is not known
to occur below the Trenton in this country.
Wliile our knowledge does not substantiate the occurrence of this
genus below the Decorah Shale, the degi-ee of variation which it
has reached by that time leads the writer to expect that earlier
species will come to light with more extended investigation.
The Black River and early Trenton species show but little varia-
tion in general physiognomy. The shells are equiconvex and have
