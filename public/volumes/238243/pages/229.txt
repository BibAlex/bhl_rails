First few front rays moderately elevated, graduated down from first or
longest ray. Anal spines short, depressible in groove, posterior little
longer, origin of fin opposite that of soft dorsal. Soft anal, like soft
dorsal, inserted about opposite pectoral tip, or about midway between
hind eye edge and caudal base. Caudal well forked, small slender
lobes (damaged) apparently pointed and equal. Pectoral moderately
long, falcate, origin about level with lower eye rim. Ventral mod-
erate, little longer than post-ocular region. Vent close before
spinous anal origin, well behind ventral tips.
Color in alcohol dull brownish with somewhat leaden tint on back,
sides and lower surface whitish, with silvery reflections. Black
blotch on upper opercle edge not quite deep as vertical pupil-diameter.
Fins all pale brownish, except large black blotch on dorsal near tip
and along front edge, its diameter slightly less than eye. Iris yellow-
ish. Peritoneum pale.
Length about 140 mm. (caudal tips damaged).
Type.— Csit. No. 42301 U.S.N.M. Loando, Angola. Wm. Harvey
Brown, U. S. Eclipse Exp. 1889.
Besides the above, also Nos. 42302 and 42300, including five
paratypes, same data. These show: head, 3^ to 3|; depth, 3f to
31; D. VIII— I, 31, sometimes 29 or 32; A. II— I, 27 or 28; scutes, 33
to 39 in straight section of lateral line; snout, 3 to 3^ in head from
upper jaw tip; eye, 3f to 3-|-; maxillary, 2f to 2f ; interorbital, 3§
to 3^; length, 120 to 137 mm.
This species is allied with Caranx ruber (Bloch) from the West
Indies and falls within the subgenus Elajihrotoxon. It differs strik-
ingly, however, upon comparison, in the last dorsal and anal rays
being semidetached or at least much further separated from their
penultimate rays, suggestive of Decapterus. These last isolated
rays are, however, connected by at least basal membranes with their
antecedents.
Caranx sanctae-helenae Valenciennes * is doubtfully referred by
Gtinther ^ to Caranx maruadsi Schlegel. Valenciennes gives more
dorsal (35) and anal rays (30). He says the last dorsal and anal rays
each form a "fausse nageorie bien distincte." The scutes are in
agreement with my Loando examples. If a Decapterus, as allowed
by Poey, it is not satisfactorily defined.
