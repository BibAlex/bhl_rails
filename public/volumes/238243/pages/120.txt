NEW FOSSIL TURTLESâ€” GILMORE.

Compared with B. pulchra the carapace has a more pointed anterior
end and a less sinuous margin. It is estimated that the shell had a
greatest length of about 280 millimeters with a greatest width of 244
millimeters. It is moderately arched transversely. The surface of
the carapace is slightly sculptured by a combination of nodes and
ridges. A low rounded inconspicuous, interrupted, longitudinal
ridge extends along the median line of the neural bones. On several
of the neurals there are on either side numerous oblique ridges and
grooves all faintly mdicated. Several node-like elevations occur
here and there along the front peripheral margin, and less weU-defined
ones are scattered over the surfaces of the costal bones. The plastron
is smooth.
The nuchal has a greatest width of 44 millimeters, which is reduced
to 31 millimeters on the margin; the length is 20 millimeters. It is
broadly excavated behind for the reception of the broad convex end
of the preneural. Neurals 1 to 5 are present in this specimen, and all
are wide in front, but with much narrowed posterior ends. The
first, as compared Math B. pulchra, is greatly elongated. Their
principal dimensions are given in the table:

The fifth costal narrows to its distal end as in B. pitlchra. The
peripheral bones present are mostly quadrangular in shape, except
the first, which is triangular and very small. The second and third
are about as long as high, but the succeeding ones, including the
eighth, are longer than their height.
The nuchal scute is smaller than in B. pulckra, measuring 20
milhmeters wide and 7 millimeters fore and aft.
The first vertebral scute is as broad as long, whereas in B. pulchar
it is nearly twice as broad as long. This scute is also characteristic
in being greatly narrowed toward the front. Posteriorly it has a
greatest width of 49 millimeters, which reduces to 19 millimeters at
the anterior end.
