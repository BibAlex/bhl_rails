THE GUANO BIRDS OF PERV—COKER.

be regarded as an asset representing a value of several millions of
dollars.
Nor is this the only flock, although the prmcipal one of the coast.
Other important flocks were noted at the Lobos de Tierra Islands of
the North, at Asia, Pachacamac, and other places, besides the neigh-
boring flocks at the Baliestas Islands, and on outlying rocks. There
were four or five small islets about the North Chincha Island, each
with something hke 1,000 guanays. In 1907 the Baliestas North,
Middle, and South Islands, respectively, yielded about 500, 800, and
900 tons of high-grade guano.
When first deposited the guano is wet and sloppy, but under the
baking sun this forms a hard thick cake, in color gray, which can be
broken with an axe or a pick. As the deposits of later years accu-
mulate, the lower layers undergo a change, becoming finely pulver-
ized, so that old buried guano can be scooped with a shovel. The
old or mineral guano may be of various colors, red, brown, almost
black, or light gray, or even green, due in part to chemical changes,
in part to foreign substances mixed in. Wlien exposed to the sun,
the old guano sometimes acquires a thin crisp whitish crust. Walk-
ing over this may give the sound of walking on the icy crust of snow.
The old guano does not, however, always bleach white.
Into the formation of such deposits go not only the excrement but
all offal matter, such as waste food, dead bodies of young and old
birds, and unhatched eggs — all may be finally blended into one ap-
parently undifferentiated mass.
It is related that one of the islands of the Chincha group was re-
duced 100 feet in height by the extraction of the deep crown of guano
deposited during past centuries. The story is by no means incredible,
since, if the flocks of birds of the South Chincha Island could have re-
mained undisturbed and continued breeding in the same place, the
top of the island would certainly have been raised a hundred feet in
about four centuries. The wonder is not how came the deposits of
tens of millions of tons, but what became of the other millions which
must have formed during past ages but which are not accoimted for
by the records of extraction. How much must have been lost by
wasting into the sea!
