« Estimated.
The supracaudal scute was probably divided as in Neurankylus
haueri. At the center they measure 17 millimeters in length.
Assuming that in the complete series there are 11 marginal scutes,
as in N. haueri, in this specimen the sixth to the eleventh of both
sides are present. The eighth is 80 millimeters long, 62 millimeters
high; ninth, 60 millimeters long, 66 millimeters high; tenth, 65
millimeters long, 53 millimeters high; eleventh, 65 millimeters long,
and 52 millimeters high.
Costal scutes three and four are broader than long, whereas in
N. baueri they are as broad as long. This difference in proportion
is indicated by the relatively narrower vertebrals.
The surface of the plastron has practically the same ornamenta-
tion as that on the carapace. None of the sutures on this aspect
of the shell are now visible, and only the abdominal-femoral sulcus
can be made out. At the center it crosses at a point 197 milli-
meters in advance of the posterior end of the hinder lobe. The pos-
terior lobe at the base has a width of 185 miRimeters. Its length
at the center is 142 millimeters. The lateral borders converge
from the inguinal notches back to the truncated end which measures
90 millimeters in width. This end is undulating as shown in Plate
30. The lateral borders present subacute edges but thicken rapidly
toward the center. The posterior end of this lobe reaches within
60 mihimeters of the median posterior border of the carapace. The
inguinal buttress is attached low down on the costals.
NeurartTcylus wyomingensis is distinguished at once from the other
species of the genus in having a sculptured shell, and relatively
narrower vertebrals. From N. baueri it differs further by the appar-
ent absence of a median dorsal carina, by the evenly rounded posterior
border without scallops, the rounded obtuse edges of the posterior
peripherals, and the relatively wider and more angular truncated end
of the posterior lobe of the plastron.
