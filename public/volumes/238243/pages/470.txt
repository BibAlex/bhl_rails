No. 2302. FORAMINIFERA FROM NEW ZEALAND— CVSHM AN. 629
Chapman, however, records it from Funafuti, and it is known from
numerous stations in the North Pacific.

There are several very typical specimens of this species which is
very common in the Indo-Pacific, and well developed in the Philip-
pines and coral-reef regions. These typical specimens have the
reticulate porous waU, as shown in the figures given by Goes and
Brady. There are, however, other very interesting specimens
moimted on the slide with these. These are not only different in
form, but also in the structure of the test, and especially in the
ornamentation. One series of these has the test very thin, and the
pores small and close together. Some of the specimens are loosely
joined in an irregular linear series. Others are irregularly piled, and
while they have the same type of test, they have an addition of a
superficial thickening of material which gives them a very different
appearance. This consists of more or less regular bosses on the
outside of the test already formed. These thickenings are circular
or irregularly elongate and are distinguished between the pores of the
test. This makes an entirely different looking test from the other.
(In worn specimens, even in later chambers, this secondary thickening
is lacking. ) The apertures also are very different in character. Some
of them, as sho\vn by Goes, are elongate and tubular, while others are
sunken and have numerous spines about the borders on the two or
three adjacent chambers. Altogether this forms a very interesting
series. The specimens are in considerable numbers, but not sufficient
to determine whether these are definite varietal characters or not.

There are several specimens representing both early stages and the
adult of this species. This species is very widely spread and shows
little variation in its characters. Neither Chapman or Sidebottom
seem to record it from this region.
