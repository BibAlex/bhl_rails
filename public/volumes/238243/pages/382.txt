10 years before and was not worked afterwards until the season of
1906. During two years there were removed m all something over
3,000 tons. If this information is correct, this guano was deposited
durmg a period of 10 years, and at the average rate of 300 tons a
year. This is on the supposition that the island was really cleaned
10 years before, though it is probable that it was not cleaned then
with the same thoroughness with wliich islands are swept now.
The guano was different in appearance and odor from that of birds,
an abundance of hair being especially noticeable. There was an
enormous quantity of skeletons and skins of lobos, many of which
perhaps had been left on the island when it was last cleaned of guano.
Although, except for the hairs and bones, it was largely pure manure
(with only 8 per cent of sand), there was scarcely any odor of am-
monia. The color was brown to black and somewhat greasy.
Analyses of two samples of guano taken from different places on
this island, as made by l^ir. H. H. Bunting, chemist of the Peruvian
Corporation, are given in the first two columns of the following table:

The presence of some feathers suggested a degree of participation
by birds in forming the deposit, but the low nitrogen value proves
that the part of birds was inconsiderable.
Another small island, in the Lobos de Afuera group, contained a
deposit of mixed lobo and bird guano, the high proportion of nitro-
gen indicating a substantial proportion of bird guano. The analysis
is given in the third colunm of the table of analyses.
The latter deposit had been formed in a more humid climate
(Lobos Island) than the other (Cerro Azul), so that the guano would
naturally have suffered more deterioration; yet the nitrogen content
was higher and there was other reason to suspect that birds had
contributed to the formation of the deposit. In order to ascertain
just what was the nature of the fresh lobo guano unmixed with that
of bird, several portions of fresh faeces were taken and mixed to form
one sample, which was dried, bottled, and analyzed. The result is
shov/n m the fourth column. The nitrogen figure is even lower than
the samples taken from the beds at Cerro Azul, but after allowance
