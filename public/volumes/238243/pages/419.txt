at 45°. Epistoma narrowed from clypeas, elongate, and in plane of
lower part of clypeus; the oral margin and vibrissal angles prominent
in profile. Facialia bare, much bowed. Vibrissae very strongly
decussate. Proboscis nearly head height; palpi nearly twice as long
as antennae and considerably swollen distally. Third antennal joint
one and one-fourth times second. Arista nearly one and one-half
times as long as antennae; swollen only at base, pubescent. Eyes
thinly hairy. Female vertex one-third head width. Three to four
proclinate fronto-orbitals in female. Parafacialia wider than clypeus,
setose in three irregular rows. Cheeks nearly two-thirds eye length.
Five to six sternopleurals, four strong; three postsuturals; two postin-
traalars; preacrostichals and postacrostichals present. Third vein
bristled only at base; others bare. Apical cell widely open well before
tip. Hind cross vein much nearer to cubitus. Middle metatarsi
nearly as long as following joints together. No median marginals on
first segment, but two pairs on second segment, marginal row on last
two segments; median discal pair on third segment.

STEVENIOPSIS, new genus.
Genotype. — Steveniopsis sinuata, new species.
General Moriniine characters. Form very narrow. Head of
Paramacronychia, but epistoma rather wide and arista short. Eyes
bare. Arista long-pubescent or short-plumose. Parafacialia nearly
as wide as clypeus; setose in three rows, the three to five lowest
bristles of outermost row strong. Two preacrostichals and lateral
scutellars; three postintraalars, postsuturals, and postacrostichals;
four or five sternopleurals; rather long divaricate apical scutellar
pair. Costal spine very strong. Third vein bristled nearly or quite
one-third way to small crossvein, others bare. Apical cell long-
petiolate, ending far before tip, the petiole about twice as long as
small crossvein. Hind crossvein a little nearer to cubitus, latter half
way between the front and hind wing margins. Apical crossvein sin-
uate. Abdomen cylindroconical. Median marginal pair on first two
