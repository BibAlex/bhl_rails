There is a single specimen whicli is undoubtedly the same species
which I described from the Philippines. This specimen is not as
large as the type: it is between 3 and 4 mm. in length, and 1.2 mm. in
width. This is another species which connects the foraminifere fauna
of the Philippine region with that of New Zealand and Australia.

A few specimens with the characteristic apertural characters
occur. They are close to the specimens figured by Brady,^ but with
the keel much more prcgiounced. In the general form of the cham-
bers and keel they are somewhat similar to the figm*e of C. nitida
as figured by Brady,^ except in the apertural characters.
There is one specimen mounted on a separate slide from the others,
which is one of the wild-growing forms mentioned and figured by
Brady and is very similar to Cliallenger.^ Sidebottom * had one
specimen of this same form. From a comparison of the Challenger
figures with the typical m-aterial, it is difficult to see what the two
forms have in common. Our specimen is certainly like Brady's fig-
ure referred to, but is very unlike the typical specimens found in
this same material.
