NO. 2293. PARASITIC CHALCIDOID FLIES— TIMBERLAKE. 177
broad at apex, with three short, equal or nearly equal teeth, of which
the lower two are acute, and the upper or inner one is much rounded
at apex. Palpi short, the maxillary pair four-jointed, with the basal
joint very short, the second about twice as long, the third and fourth
increasing still more in length, the fourth being about twice as long
as the second and slenderer; labial pair three-jointed, with the mid-
dle joint as long as thick, the other two subequal and a little longer.
Thorax rather more robust than in Homaloiyliis, but not differing
much in structure except that the axillae meet broadly at their tips
and are not infrequently slightly elevated above the surface of the
scutellum; the latter more to much more convex and slopes down-
ward more toward the sides and especially toward the apex, the mar-
gin, however, from base to apex generally well elevated and abruptly
declivous; propodeum the same except that it is declivous or slopes
downward from in front toward the abdomen, instead of being flat
as in Homalotylus; mesepimeron visible as a very narrow sclerite
along the posterior margin of the mesopleura. Legs about the same,
except that the middle tibial spur is rather shorter, or about three-
fourths as long as the first tarsal joint. Wings of the same com-
parative length but averaging a little wider than in IlGmalotylus;
marginal vein always punctiform, the stigm.al sometimes originating
just before the submarginal vein reaches the costal margin, moder-
ately long, straight and forming a right angle with the postmarginal as
in iceryae or somewhat less than a right angle as in most of the species,
postmarginal short and spur-like as in iceryae or nearly one-half as
long as the stigmal as in vinulus and pundiceps; the disk ciliated
about as in Homalotylus except that the subapical spot of transparent
cilia is absent, the speculum indistinct except in axillaria, pmicticeps,
and atriventris, and the basal third of disk is usually bare or nearly
so instead of being covered with transparent cilia; hind wings a little
wider, the costal cell being wider and not so attenuated near the
booklets.
Abdomen narrower than in Homalotylus, about two-thirds as long
as the thorax in most species or a little more and always longer than
wide, with the base broad, the sides parallel or subparallel and the
apex nearly truncate, or the base narrower and the sides more or less
convex as in vinulus, punciiceps, and airiveniris; first tergite reach-
ing about one-third to nearly one-half of the distance from base to
apex, the seventh tergite ranking next in length; tactile plates situ-
ated a httle nearer to the middle than to the apex of abdomen, the
vibrissae considerably longer and more conspicuous than in Homa-
lotylus and reaching to the apex: structure of venter hardly differ-
ing from Homalotylus, the ovipositor enclosed by the fifth ventrite
and not distinctly protruded in the known species.
