BOOPS BOOPS (Linnaeus).
Head, 3f to 3|; depth, 3| to 4|; D. XIV, once XIII, 14, once 13;
A. Ill, 15, once 16; scales 72 to 80 in lateral line to caudal base, and
5 or 6 more on latter; 5 to 7 scales above lateral line and 12 to 14
below; 20 to 24 predorsal scales; snout 3 J to 4| in head; eye 2J
to 3^; maxillary 3^ to 4; interorbital, 2| to 3|; rakers, 7 + 18
to 20, lanceolate, two-thirds to little less than filaments and latter
about half of eye. Seven examples, 85 to 207 mm.
These agree with a series of Mediterranean examples in the
Academy, though some of the latter vary greatly in depth. The
scales of all show about 10 to 12 basal striae.
PAGELLUS CENTRODONTUS (Delaroche).
Head, 3; depth, 3; D. XII, 10 or 11; A. Ill, 12; scales 75 to 78
in lateral line to caudal base and 6 to 8 more on latter; 6 or 7 scales
above lateral line, 16 or 17 below; snout, 3f to 3i in head; eye, 3;
maxillary, 3; interorbital, 3f to 4; rakers, 13 + 19, lanceolate, about
long as filaments, which 2 in eye ; 7 scales on cheek. Two examples,
98 to 108 mm.
Compared with a Mediterranean example 130 mm. long, scales of
all finely ciliated and with 6 to 10 basal striae. None of the other
Mediterranean examples, long in alcohol, show the dark shoulder
blotch distinct, and only a slight trace in the Horta examples.
PAGELLUS ACARNE (Risso).
Head, 3 J to 3^; depth, 3; D. XII, 10 or 11; A. Ill, 10; scales,
70 to 72 in lateral line to caudal base and 6 or 7 more on latter.
Body fusiform, elongate, moderately compressed. Head well com-
pressed, sides flattened. Snout about wide as long. Eye large,
slightly advanced, long as snout or 3^ in head. Mouth little
inclined, lower jaw shorter. Maxillary reaches slightly beyond eye
front, not quite to pupil. Front teeth fine and conic, and hind teeth
two rows of molars above and below. Front nostril pore about
two-fifths of eye before same, and hind nostril large slit close behind.
Interorbital broadly convex, wide as eye. Preorbital depth If its
length. Preopercle edge entire. Rakers, 10 + 13, lanceolate, nearly
equal filaments or 2J in eye. Pseudobranchiae long as gill-fila-
ments. Squamation very compact, scales narrowl}^ imbricated,
each with 9 or 10 basal radii, latter rather obsolete with age.
Suprascapula edge little jagged. Most of caudal covered with
minute scales. Lateral line nearly concurrent with dorsal profile,
elevated along side of caudal peduncle. Cheek with five rows of
scales. Dorsal spines pungent, slender. Soft dorsal inserted about
midway between spinous dorsal origin and caudal base, front rays
little elevated. Anal similar, spines slender and third longest.
