Unfortunately the writer has been able to examine only one speci-
men of flaminms from Europe, so that the identity of eytehveinii
(Ratzeburg) could not be investigated fully. Obviously the two
forms are much alike, flaminius being described as having the middle
tarsi black, the hind tai-si and middle tibial spur white, and eytel-
iveinii as having the discoloration of the tarsi just reversed. Mayr
considered them to be forms of one species, and apparently had
examined intermediate specimens. The specimen in the hands of
the writer may also be considered intermediate since the hind tarsi
are black, the middle pair almost entirely blackish underneath, and
the tibial spur dark brown or in part blackish. Nevertheless no such
variation in the color of the tarsi has been observed in specimens
from other parts of the world, the hind tai-si being uniformly dark
and the middle pair white or pale yellowish in all specimens exam-
ined from such remotely separated regions as South Africa, China,
and Australia.
Girauit's species orci and microgaster can not be separated from
fiar.iinius, as they are based on too variable characters. The com-
parative lengths of pedicel and first two funicle joints, of the stigmal
and postmarginal veins, and the slight variations in color noted above
can not be relied upon to distinguish species in this group. In gen-
eral it may be said that in very small specimens the fii-st funicle joint
is usually no longer than thick, and becomes gradual!}^ longer with
increase in size.

This species is known to the writer only by description. In colora-
tion it recalls certain forms of terminalis of North America, such as
