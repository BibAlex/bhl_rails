There are numerous finely developed specimens of this species
which Sidebottom records as "two very small immature specimens."
POLYSTOMELLA MILLETTD Heron-Allen and Earland.
Polystomella verriculata Millett, Joiu'n. Roy. Micr. Soc, 1904, p. 604, pi. 11,
fig. 3.
Polystomella millettii Heron-Allen and Earland, Trans. Zool. Soc, p. 735, pi.

There are five specimens which may be possibly referred to this
species. They have a reticulate surface, the lines of which are
oblique to the sutures. In the specimens from New Zealand, even
in the last-formed chambers, there is not developed the angled con-
dition shown by Heron-Allen and Earland in their type figures.
These correspond fairly well with the figures of P. hedleyi figured
by Jensen.^ His specimens, however, have less of the angled pattern
than is developed in our specimens, and ours are not very closely
like those of Millett. From the various figures given of similar
specimens of the Philippines and from this general region, there is
either one very variable species or numerous varieties or species
developed, and it should be carefully collected and studied in the
regions to determine this.
Family MILIOLIDAE.
Subfamily Cornuspirininae.
Genus CORNUSPIRA Schultze, 1854.
CORNUSPIRA FOLIACEA Costa, var. EXP ANSA Chapman.
Cornuspiru carinata Costa, var. expansa Chapman, Biol. Res. Endeavour, vol. 3,
1915, p. 318, pi. 1, fig. 3.
There are several well-developed specimens which are very clearly
this variety described by Chapman. Our specimens, however, are
better developed than that figured by Chapman. It is very clear,
both from these specimens and from abundant Philippine material,
that this would be a variety of C. foliacea. Some of the specimens
are very expanded and are nearly 4 mm. in length and nearly as
much in breadth. There are slight traces of very fine longitudinal
striae.
