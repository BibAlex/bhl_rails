the central chambers are the characteristic reddish brown. In
form these are very similar to the specimens figured by Brady .^
DISCORBIS VILARDEBOANA (d'Orbigny) (?).
There is a specimen which is very close to that figured by Brady
under this name.^ This is referred by Heron-Allen and Earland
in their Clare Island Paper to D. concinna Brady. However, com-
parison of these two in the Challenger plates show that there are
differences between them, which this specimen bears out. It is
evidently not D. vilardeboana d'Orbigny. A similar form to this
occurs in the Philippines and appears to be a definite species occurring
in the Indo-Pacific region.
DISCORBIS PATELLIFORMIS (H. B. Brady).
Discorbi7ta patelliformis H. B. Brady, E,ep. Voy. Challenger, Zoology, vol. 9,
1881, p. fi47, pi. 88, figs, '^a-c; pi. 89, figs. lu-c. — Sidebottom, Journ. Roy.
Micr. Soc, 1918, p. 254.
Discorhis patelliformis Cushman, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt. 5, 1915, p. 17,
pi. 5, fig. 5; fig. 19 (in text).
One very typical specimen is mounted. This seems to be a
species known largely from the South Pacific. It is recorded as far
north as Laysan Island by Rhumbler, and the Malay Archipelago
by Millett, and as far west as Madagascar. There are records for it
in the Mediterranean. It seems to occur mostly in comparatively
shallow water.
DISCORBIS BERTHELOTI (d'Orbigny).
Rosalhia bertheloti d'Orbigny, in Barker, Webb, and Berthelot, Hist. Nat,
Isles Canaries, vol. 2, pt. 2, 1839, "Foraminiferes," p. 135, pi. 1, figs. 28-30.
Discorbina bertheloti H. B. Brady, Trans. Linn. Soc. London, vol. 24, 1864,
p. 469, pi. 48, figs. 10a, 6; Rep. Voy. Challenger, Zoology, vol. 9, 1884, p. 650,
pi. 89, figs. 10-12. — Sidebottom, Journ. Roy. Micr. Soc, 1918, p. 253.
Discorbis bertheloti Cushman, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt. 5, 1915, p. 20, pi. 7,
fig. 3; fig. 23 (in text).
This seems to have been a common species from the material, as a
large set is mounted. They are very typical.
DISCORBIS RARESCENS (H. B. Brady).
Discorbina rarescens H. B. Brady, Rep. Voy. Challenger, Zoolog}-, vol. 9, 1884,
p. G51, pi. 90, figs. 2, 3, and 4. — Chapman, Journ. Quekett Micr. Club, ser. 2,
vol. 10, 1907, p. 136.— Sidebottom, Journ. Roy. Micr. Soc, 1918, p. 253.
Discorbis rarescens Cushman, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt. 5, 1915, p. 20, pi. 7,
fig. 4; fig. 24 (in text).
There is a single specimen of this species with four visible chambers,
and a thin narrow keel surrounding the entire test. It was described
by Brady from off Raine Island and from the Philippines. Side-
bottom had a few specimens from off Australia.
