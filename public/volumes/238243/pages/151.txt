protruded for a length fully equal to one-half that of the abdomen or
a little more. Wings with median cross-band somewhat convex on
its apical margin, tlie subapical hyaline area reaching nearly to either
margin of wing and about one-fourth narrower than the apical area
of dark colored cilia; postmarginal vein about as long as the stigmal,
unusually thickened proximad and completely obliterating the space
between its own base and that of the stigmal vein, so that without
careful examination the marginal vein appears to be fully thrice as
long as thick, or much longer than it actually is, stigmal vein very
slender but becoming somewhat enlarged at apex. Sculpture about
as in II. cocTcereUi except that the pin punctures of the head are
larger and deeper, the reticulations on the first tergite of abdomen
a little coarser than in cocJcerelli, but much finer than in jlaminius,
being longitudinally lengthened on the sides, transversely lengthened
toward the base, and becoming no larger and mostly pentagonal at
the middle of the posterior margin, the extreme base of the tergite
remaining smooth. Length of body, (1.50 to) 1.76; length of head,
