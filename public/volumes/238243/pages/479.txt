Chapman, however, has had material from this same general region
which he has sectioned and determined as B. pisum; therefore prob-
ably these specimens belong to the same species.
BILOCULINA SARSII Schlumberger.
Biloculina ringens H. B. Brady (not B. ringens Lamarck), Rep. Voy. Challenger,
Zoology, vol. 9, 1884, p. 142, pi. 2, fig. 7.
Biloculina sarsii Schlumberger, M^m. Soc. Zool. France, vol. 4, 1891, p. 16G,
pi. 9, figs. 55-59, text figs. 10-11.— Cushman, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mns., pt. 6,
1917, p. 76, pi. 30, fig. 2.
There are fine large specimens which may be referred to this species
that are mounted on one of the slides. I had material from the
North Pacific, from the Hawaiian Islands, westward to Japan, and,
from this material, it is evidently widespread in the Indo-Pacific.
BILOCULINA BRADYI Schlumberger.
Biloculina brudyi Schlumberger, M^m. Soc. Zool. France, vol. 4, 1891, p. 170,
pi. 10, figs. 63-71; figs. 15-19 (in text).
This seems to be one of the commonest species of this genus in the
material. The very broad flattened lip is very characteristic.
BILOCULINA COMATA H. B. Brady.
Biloculina comata H. B. Brady, Quart. Journ. Micr. Sci., vol. 21, 1881, p. 45;
Rep. Voy. Challevger, Zoology, vol. 9, 1884, p. 144, pi. 3, figs. 9fl, 6.— Cush-
man, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt. 6, 1917, p. 81, pi. 34, fig. 1.
There are three specimens of a striate triloculine form which are
close to the figures of Miliolina insignis, given by Brady in the
ClialUnger Report. From other material I have seen in the Pacific,
it seems that this may be the triloculine stage of B. comata.
