culmination is followed in the Upper Whitewater by loss of vitality,
as is indicated in the excessive deposit of lime, narrowing of the shell,
and loss of plications next to the cardinal angles.
The high-fold subgroup passes through an accelerated low-fold
development, and in the late neanic stage develops a high compressed
fold on which the plications are weak. It has no representatives in
the Trenton. There are occasional individuals which have a some-
what higher fold than others, but this seems to represent Only an
attempt at the realization of a latent tendency which was never
fully expressed.
PlatystropJiia fauciplicata is a Platystropliia juvenis, new species,
which has lost two of the lateral plications on the lateral slopes.
Variants from PlatystropJiia pauciplicata developed a high fold and
merged into PlatystropJiia profundosulcata by all degrees of variants.
From some of these variants PlatystropJiia crassa developed. The
most abundant mutation of this species has a globose form and high
compressed fold and deep sinus, on which the plications are weak.
In the mutation which James took as his type the lateral plications
of the fold and sinus have disappeared or exist as rudimentary struc-
tures ne:^t to the beak. Another mutation has only four or five pli-
cations on the lateral slopes. These mutations indicate that this
species was on the decline, having reached the highest point of
specialization in the high fold mutation.
PlatystropJiia laticosta is a transverse species with a high com-
pressed fold on which the plications are weak. The young of this
species resemble PlatystropJiia profundosulcata but the fold is not so
high nor the smus so deep. Index curves and the physiognomy of
the shell indicate that PlatystropJiia laticosta developed from one of
the high fold variants of PlatystropJiia pauciplicata}
PlatystropJiia unicostata developed from PlatystropJiia laticosta by
all degrees of variants. It marks the culmination of a development
toward a high compressed fold on which the lateral plications have
disappeared or exist as rudimentary structures next to the beak.
But with this high specialization came extinction, as loss of vitality
is indicated by the narrowing of the shell, increase in gibbosity, and
loss of plications next to the cardinal angles. The variety crassi-
formis marks extreme racial gerontism, as there are only four or
five plications on the lateral slopes and the form has become so nar-
row and gibbous that the thickness equals or is even greater than the
width and height.
The physiognomy of PlatystropJiia cypJia of the Arnheim formation
suggests its development from PlatystropJiia unicostata, but this is
not likely, as the latter species is taking on declining characteristics.
