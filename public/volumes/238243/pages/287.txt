admitting that it is perhaps more closely related to the Tryphoninae
than to the Pimplinae, still retams it in the Pimplinae, and, under the
name Oedematopsis, assigns it and Thymaris to the tribe Acoenitides
and adds a new species. Schmiedeknecht ^ retained it in the Pimp-
linae, where he tabulated it between Lampronota and Arenetra,
although he took note of Thomson's placing of it. Later ^ he tabu-
lated it with Neliopisthus and Thymaris in the Tryphoninae; and
still later ^ he follows Thomson, using the name HyopJianes, and call-
ing the tribe and subtribe Mesoleptini and Thymaridina, respectively.
Viereck * places Ilyhoplianes nasutus (Cresson) in his genus Pledis-
cidea under the name Plectiscidea (Campothreptus) nasuta Cresson.
Thymaris has been the basis of but little less disagreement than has
Hyhophanes. Originally placed by Foerster^ in his family Campo-
plegides, where the only characters assigned to it are those employed
in the key, no species was assigned to it until Brischke ® described his
Thymaris pulchricornis. Brischke also considered the genus Campo-
plegine. Thomson^ described two species and removed the genus, under
the name Thymarus, to his subtribe Thymarides. Bridgemau and
Fitch ^ and later Bridgemau^ described Thymaris fasciatus , which, as
pointed out by Schmiedeknecht ^ almost certainly does not belong
to the genus as typified by pulchricornis Brischke, but is apparently
a true Campoplegine. Ashmead^" followed Foerster in his placing of
Thymaris. Pfankuch " synonymized Thymans pulchricornis Brischke
with Mesoleptus tener Gravenhorst, Schmiedeknecht,^ without refer-
ring it to any tribe, tabulated it in a generic synopsis of the Try-
phoninae; and later ^ adopted Thomson's disposition of the genus.
He synonymized compressus Thomson with pulchricornis Brischke and
expressed doubt of the synonymy of Brischke's species with Meso-
leptus tener Gravenhorst, though admitting that a part of the male
material of Gravenhorst's species belongs here. Morley ^" placed Thy-
maris with Oedemopsis in the Acoenitini and described a new species.
Neliopisthus Thomson, aside from its original description by
Thomson/ has been treated at length only by Schmietleknccht,*
who follows Thomson in his disposition of the genus. Ashmead,^*
failing to recognize it, redescribed it as Polysphinctomorpha and
placed it in the Pimplini. In the same work (p. 179) he simply
listed Neliopisthus in liis bibliography of the genera.
