birds frequenting the guano islands or their environments. On
several occasions I was enabled to live in camp upon the islands during
the season when they were by law closed to the general public,
although on such favorable occasions it was never possible to give

After making the necessary reports with recommendations to the

uncompiled field notes, as weU as with a considerable collection of
specimens representing the fauna and flora of the coastal waters, and

specialists in the several groups.' A general account of the guano
