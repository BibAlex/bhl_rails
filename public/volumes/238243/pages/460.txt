material which I had it occurred as far north as Korea Strait, showing
that it has a wide distribution in the Indo-Pacific region. This should
be closely compared with the material from the Atlantic.

Brady described this species from two widely separated regions —
one off Culebra Island, West Indies, and the other from off New
Zealand. This material from "Poor Knights Islands" is of the form
figured by Brady.*
Flint's specimens from the Gulf of Mexico do not seem to be as
typical as these from New Zealand, and it is to be suspected that
Brady's figure is that from his New Zealand locality. It may be that
the two regions have distinct forms. It occurs in typical form in the
Philippines, recorded by Sidebottom, and I have material in the
Albatross and Philippine dredgings, so it is evidently a rather wide-
spread species, at least in the Indo-Pacific regions.

There is a species which seems to be common, wliich is much
broader than C. latifrons, and yet is not the typical form of C. italica.
The ventral base of the chamber in the adult is broadly triangular,
much like that of C. italica, but it extends nearly to the base of the
test. This is a form placed by some writers under C. acutauricularis.
