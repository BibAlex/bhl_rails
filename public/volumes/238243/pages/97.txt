spots in each cell of the elytra. Size, female, 9 mm. long; male
shorter.
Color, the dried specimens from which the description is made are
yellowish and grayish brown, indicating that in live specimens the
prevaihng color would be brown. The males are darker, being
more heavily dotted with black punctations along veins of elytra,
and also on vertex and pronotum.
The species more nearly resembles sanguinolenta Spangberg than
any other member of the genus although it is distinctly different
even from it.

Gypona alhosiqnata Uhler, Colorado Exp. Sta.. Bull. No. 31, 1895.
The characters as given in the key are sufficient to readily distin-
guish this species. It somewhat resembles modesta Spangberg but is
much more slender or narrow in form and with not so many darkened
veins or irregular dark lines on the elytra. The vertex is short and
broadly rounding. The four small black spots along the anterior
margin of the pronotum and the blackened apex of the clavus are
also characteristic for identification.
A cotype of Ulder's alhosignata is in the collection of the United
States National Museum.
The species is known to occur from Massachusetts westward to
Kansas and south into Central America and the West Indies.

This species resembles marginifrons Fowler in the short and has a
broadly rounding anterior margm of the vertex. The ocelli are
comparatively large and placed as in marginifrons. Bipunctulata
Woodworth is, however, somewhat smaller and lacks the distinctive
dark bordering of the veins of the elytra and the irregular dark
markings on the anterior border of the pronotum. There are two
