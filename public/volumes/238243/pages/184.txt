behind dorsal. Caudal with hind edge slightly concave. Pectoral
broad, upper rays forming slight point above and rounded lobe
below, larger than dorsal. Color in alcohol uniform brown above,
under surface same general tint except paler. Iris pale olive-brown.
Dark blotch over each eye on interorbital edge. Fins dull brownish.
Length, 248 mm.
The above interesting example appears identical with Tetrodon
cutaneus Giinther.^ Its distribution so far to the northward as the
Azores is likely due to the influence of the Guinea Current. In
Gtinther's short description few other than minor variants appear,
so that I am unable to separate the xizores fish from the South
Atlantic.

2. Porto Grande on St. Vincent, Cape de Verde Islands.
The Cape de Verde Islands partake largely of the African ichthy-
fauna, and, lying along the route of European exploration and dis-
covery of the West African region, are associated with its development.
As Goree Island, off the Senegal, was the first point on the African
coast from which any attempt was made to gather representative
collections of fishes, one finds the first enumeration of Cape de Verde
fishes, with those from the Gabun, also included in Dumeril's memoir
''Poissons Afrique Occidentale." ^ Brito-CapeUo gives a list of the
fishes obtained in the various Portuguese possessions,^ among them
a number from the Cape de Verde Islands. Other localities are
Angola, Madeira, St. Thome, Baissau, and Mozambique. Pereira-
Guimaraes, in the papers already referred to under the Azores col-
lection, also mentions species from the Cape de Verde Islands.
Gunther has a short list in his OJiaUenger shore fishes from St. Vincent
