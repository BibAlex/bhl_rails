>o. 2294. FISHES FROM WEST AFRICA— FOWLER. 251
^Uthougli much confusion has arisen from the composite account
of Eaja torpedo Linnaeus it appears the action of Briinnich' clearly
indicates the first restriction of the species with the later Raja mar-
morata Ilisso. Briinnich says: -Doi-sum fusco-sanguinolcntum, ma-
culis sparsis obscurioribus variuni * =<= * Spn-acula 5, subtus
utrinque ad pectus." He then mentions a new variety, unknown to
himself, however, but described by Stilviani with five black oc lli
arranged in the form of a pentagon.
MUGIL CEPHALUS Linnaeus.
Head, 3^ to 3|; depth, 4 to 4^; D. IV— I, 8; A. HI, 8; scales, 36
to 43 from shoulder to caudal base, and 4 to 6 larger out over latter;
12 or 13 scales transversely between soft dorsal and anal origins;
23 to 27 predorsal scales; snout, 4 to 4^ in head; eye, 3f to 4;
maxillary, 3| to 4|; interorbital, 2J to 3. Rakers, 30 + 32, 2| in
filaments and latter | of eye. Length, 95 to 139 mm. ; four examples.
Compared with an Italian example, with 41 scales from shoulder to
caudal base, the rakers were 33 + 46. The adipose eyelid much
better developed m the Italian fish, though scarcely as much so as
in adults from Italy and the Mediterranean. The scales of Italian
examples show basal radii 8 to 10, those from Ashantee 7 to 9,
doubtless a condition of age.
LIZA RAMADA (Risso).
Head, 3 to 3|; depth, 3^- to 3^; D. IV— I, 8: A. Ill, 9; scales, 37
to 39(?) from shoulder to caudal base, and 5 or 6 larger out over
latter; 12 or 13 scales transversely at soft dorsal and anal origins;
25 to 28 predorsal scales; snout, 3f to 5 in head; eye, 3i to 4;
maxillary, 3^ to 3|; interorbital, 2.V to 2|; rakers, 35 + 48. Length,
56 to 85 mm. ; four examples.
Though I only have young African examples, doubtless of this
species, considerable variation due to age was noted when compared
with Mediterranean examples. The latter, 155 mm. long, had 44 to
47 + 50 to 75 rakers. The African examples show 9 to 1 1 basal radii
and no apical denticles on the scales, while in 8 large Mediterranean
examples these variations are covered.
LIZA FALCIPINNIS (Valenciennes).
Head, 3| to 3f ; depth, 3t to 3f ; D. IV— I, 9; A. Ill, 11; scales,
35 to 39 from shoulder to caudal base and 4 or 5 larger out over latter;
12 or 13 scales transversely between soft dorsal and anal origins;
29 to 31 predorsal scales; snout, 3| to 4 in head; ej^e, 3| to 4^;
maxillary, 3| to 4; interorbital, 2f to 3. Elongate, well compressed,
deepest at anal origin. Caudal peduncle well compressed, long as
