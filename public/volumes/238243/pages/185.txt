SARDINELLA AURITA (Valenciennes).
Two examples.
MURAENA MELANOTIS (Kaup).
Head, 8; depth, 12^; combined head and trunk shorter than rest
of body by space between eye and gill-opening; snout, 6 in head meas-
ured from upper jaw tip; interorbital, 7^; upper jaw to rictus, 2^; eye,
2f in snout, 2^ in interorbital. Snout length, about 1^ its width.
Lower jaw well protruded. Teeth imiserial, strongly compressed,
entire. Two fang-like teeth in front above, hind one larger. Nostrils
in short tubes of about equal length, three in eye, posterior slightly
before eye. Anal edge inconspicuously and narrowly pale brown.
General color dark chocolate brown with largely uniform appearance.
Length, 1,373 mm.
This example does not show the short dark vertical lines forming
squares on front part of body above, as indicated in Kaup's figure of
Limamuraena melanotis* though the characteristic black rictal blotch
and much larger one embracing the gill-opening quite conspicuous.
The tail and trunk also show traces of obscure dark blotches or spots,
and along dorsal fin several distinct blackish blotches. Muraena
clepsydra Jordan and Evermann differs in color and has a much
shorter lower jaw, the black rictal blotch with white blotch imme-
diately forward and anal edge not pale.
GYMNOTHORAX FUNEBRIS (Ranzani).
One example, 950 mm. Edge of anal very narrowly pale. Com-
pared with an example from Santo Domin go, West Indies, it largely
agrees, except in its more olive-brown tinge. Bloch's figure of G.
afer ^ shows a moray with well blotched or deeper dark markings
and is closely related to Muraena moringua Cuvier, as contended by
Jordan and Davis.^
ABLENNES HIANS (Valenciennes).
One 760 mm. (jaws damaged). Compared with a slightly smaller
example from St. Cliristopher's Island, West Indies, which measures
384 mm. (beak broken), the scales are different, due to age. In the
West Indian fish the circuli are all more or less united, and with the
median narrow vertical area always more or less bridged, at least
above and below. In the Cape de Verde example they are always
