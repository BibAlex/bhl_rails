rudimentary papilla; guy fibrils are occasionally seen connecting the
egg with the leaf; the color is smoky-amber.
Type.—Csit. No. 19088, U.S.N.M.
The type material is from Orlando, Florida, August 28, 1914, from
the uppper surface of camphor leaves, collected by W. W. Yothers.
An extensive series of measurements of material on Eucalyptus and
camphor from Florida, and on oak, elm, and pecan from South Caro-
lina have yielded the following averages:

NOTES.
It is of interest to record that, whereas the common red spiders
have long been known to feed almost exclusively on the under surface
of the leaf, this species confines its activities entirely to the top of the
leaves.
To date the species has been recorded upon camphor (Camphora
officinale) and Eucalyptus, species at Orlando, Florida, avocado at
Miami Beach, Florida, and upon two varieties of elm, the willow
oak {Quercus pJiellos) , the white oak (Quercus alba) , and the pecan at
Batesburg, South Carolina. Mr. Yothers says that at certain times
it is everywhere present on the camphor tree, causing a reddening of
the leaves and reduced vitality of the tree.
The species is exceedingly abundant certain seasons in North and
South Carolina on the foliage of the small-leaved elm ( JJlmus arneri-
cana), to which it imparts a rusty appearance. In spite of the
exposure of this species on the top of the foliage very little control
seems to be exerted through rains. This may be accountable through
the possession by the species of the strongly hooked tarsal claws
which character also holds in the case of P. ilicis, another species that
frequents the top side of leaves.
