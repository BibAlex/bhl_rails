NEW SPECIES.

The subtribe Thymaridina of the tribe Mesoleptini was originally
formed under the name Thymarides by Thomson ^ for the genera
Oedemopsis Tschek, TJiymaris Foerster, and NeliofnstMs Thomson.
The first of these has since been shown to be synonymous with Hyho-
phanes (Foerster) Schmiedeknecht, the genotypes being synony-
mous. To these three is now to be added the new genus described
below.
The systematic position of Hyhophanes (Foerster) Schmiedeknecht
has been a subject of much disagreement among systematic workers
it and its various synonyms having been placed in no less than five
tribes, representing three of the Ashmeadian subfamilies. It was
originally placed by Foerster ^ in his family Lissonotoidae.
Tschek,^' redescribing it under the name Oedemopsis, placed it in the
Pimplinae. Brischke * synonymized Oedemopsis rogenhoferi Tschek,
the genoty]3e of Oedemopsis, with TrypJion scalriculus Gravenhorst
and placed it in the Tryphoninae, considering it allied to Eclytus
Holmgren, as did also Snellen van Vollenhoven.^
Thomson/ referred Oedemopsis along with TJiymaris Foerster
and Neliopisihus Thomson to his subtribe Thymarides, tribe
Mesoleptina. Davis, ^ considering the Plectiscini as a tribe of the
Tryphoninae, placed the synonymous Campotlireptus Davis (not
Foerster), based on the North American (TrypJion) HyhopJianes
nasutus (Cresson), in that tribe. Ashmead' left HyhopJianes where
Foerster placed it, but redescribed it ' (p. 59) in the Pimplini as Zar-
yncJius with TrypJion ? nasutus Cresson as type. ZarJiyncJius being pre-
occupied he later * proposed the substitute RJiyncJiotJiyreus. Morley,®
