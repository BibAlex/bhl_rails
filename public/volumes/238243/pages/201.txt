248 I'h'OCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. vol. 50.
If in head, ninth ray nearly 1. Second anal spine, 2h in head; first
ray about 1^. Caudal with median rays longest, slightly larger than
head; ventral spine, Ih, and first ray with filamentous end to second
anal ray base. Long falcate pectoral reaches caudal base. Color in
alcohol largely pale brownish; head and trunk everywhere tinged
with silvery-white. Iris whitish. Length, 140 mm.
No. 12229, A. N. vS. P., type of Crypt-osmiUa Una Cope. S.
Although described as 'everywhere uniform silvery" by Cope,
very slight indications of the darker transverse or vertical bands,
somewhat as figured by Pellegrin in his var. africana.,^ are evident.
This last was originally described by Osorio and appears in no way
to differ structurally from the above. Further comparison with
Philippine material, but slightly smaller, shows only a slight differ-
ence in scale structure or with usually 5 or 6 basal radii, while tiie
Liberian example has but 3 or 4 and usually 3.

Head, 3f ; depth, 2ยง; D. 54; A. 40; scales, 70 in lateral line to caudal
base and 6 more on latter; 21 scales above lateral line, 27 below;
snout, 3^ in head from upper jaw tip; eye, 6f ; maxillary, IJ; inter-
orbital, 2| in snout. Contour uniform ellipsoid. Caudal peduncle well
compressed; length, three-fourths its least depth or latter 2| in total
head length. Head width, 2f its length. Snout conic, broad as long.
Upper eye advanced for first third beyond lower. Mouth large, lower
jaw well protruded. Maxillary long, extends well beyond eye or about
three-fifths in head; expansion IJ in eye. Teeth long, slenderly
conic, in two rows with inner depressible inward, and all of larger
barbed. Interorbital level. Rakers, 14+20 short spincscent rudi-
ments; filaments, 1| in eye. Scales large, mostly cycloid; some
very weakly and sparsely ctenoid on left or colored side. Smaller
scales along body edges, and caudal very finely scaled. About
8 rows of scales on cheek; maxillary also scaly. Scales of colored
side with 40 radiating basal striae; same number but marginal on
pale side and very tine circuli incomplete. Lateral line midway
along side, inconspicuous. Dorsal origin eye-diameter behind lower
eye, twenty-third ray, 2^^ in head; thirteenth anal ray, 2f. Caudal
