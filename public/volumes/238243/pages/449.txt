BOLIVINA NOBILIS Hantken.
Bolivina nobilis Hantken, Magy. kir. foldt. int. ^vkonyve, vol. 4, 1875 (1876),
p. 56, pi. 15, fig. 4; Mitth. Jahrb. Ung. geol. Anstalt, vol. 4, 1875 (1881), p. 65,
pi. 15, fig. 4.— H. B. Brady, Rep. Voy. Challenger, Zoology, vol. 9, 1884, p.
424, pi. 53, figs. 14, 15.— CusHMAN, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt. 2, 1911, p. 39,
fig. 64 (in text).
There are two specimens that are evidently this species, although
the recent material is referred by Brady to this species of Hantken
from fossil beds of Hungary, It may be questionable whether this
reference is correct. All the records for the recent occurrence of the
species seem to be limited closely to the Indo-Pacific region, and it
seems likely that the recent form is a valid species.
Genus VALVULINA d'Orbigny, 1826.
VALVULINA FUSCA (Williamson).
Rotalina fusca Williamson, Rec. Foram. Great Britain, 1858, p. 55, pi. 5, figs.
114, 115.
Valvulina fusca M. Sars, Vid. Selsk. Forh., 1868, p. 249.— H. B. Brady, Rep.
Voy. Challenger, Zoology, vol. 9, 1884, p. 392, pi. 49, figs. 13, 14.— Cushman,
Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt. 2, 1911, p. 59, figs. 94-95 (ia text).
There is a single specimen which may be referred to this species.
The chambers, however, are more inflated and distinct from one
another, as characteristic of the species elsewhere. It may not
belong here.
Genus GAUDRYINA d'Orbigny, 1839.
GAUDRYINA QUADRANGULARIS Bagg.
Gaudryina quadrangularis Bagg, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mas., vol. 34, 1908, p. 133, pi.
5, fig. 1.— Cushman, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt. 2, 1911, p. 64, fig. 103 (in
text).
A single specimen seems very characteristic of this species de-
scribed by Bagg from the Hawaiian Islands. It is very close to the
specimen I have figured.^
GAUDRYINA TRIANGULARIS Cushman.
Gaudryina triangularis Cushman, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt. 2, 1911, p. 65,
figs. 103-104 (in text).
Numerous specimens are close to this species described from the
Hawaiian Islands. They are perhaps more regular in form than the
figured specimens, and are close to those given by Brady as G. rugosa.
Genus CLAVULINA d'Orbigny, 1826.
CLAVULINA cf. COMMUNIS d'Orbigny.
There are two specimens mounted which apparently may belong
to this species. They are elongate, tapering, widest at the aper-
tural end; the initial portion is somewhat angular and not in the
I Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt. 2, 1911, p. 65, fig. mV
