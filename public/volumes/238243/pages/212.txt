NO. 2294. FISHES FROM WEST AFRICAâ€” FOWLER. 261
close, near snout edge, hind one with well-developed flap, about an
eye-diameter directly before eye. Fontanel on head narrow, reaches
occipital buckler. Bones of head, occipital buckler, and front of
doi-sal spine strongly rugose. Rakere about 4 + 8, lanceolate, little
shorter than filaments. Lateral line complete, distinctly arched at
first. Opercles moderately striate. Humeral process about long as
snout, with few striae. Doreal origin slightly behind pectoral center.
Adipose fin rounded, about long as snout. Caudal well forked,
lobes about equal. Anal inserted little nearer caudal base than
doi-sal origin, front rays little shorter than last. Pectoral reaches
seven-eighths to ventral, which inserted midway between caudal base
and hind nostril and long fin reaches fu-st fifth of anal.
Color in alcohol brown above, whitish on belly and under surfaces.
Dorsal, pectoral, ventral, and anal with dusky on median terminal
portions. Maxillary barbel T)rownish, other barbels pale. Iris
brownish. One example, 267 mm.
The above diffei-s from the Sierra Leone specimens in its much
longer barbels, dei^ressed doreal If to adipose fin and longer pectoral,
which reaches near ventral.
TYLOSUKUS CHORAM (Forskil).
Head (damaged), 3i; depth, 12^ in trunk, excluding head and cau-
dal fin; D. II, 20?; A. ii, 20; P. i, 13; scales about 385 to caudal base,
counted in median lateral row from gill-opening; 18 scales above
lateral line to dorsal origin, 5 below; about 310 predorsal scales; eye,
2 J in postocular; interorbital, 1|.
Body moderately compressed. Caudal peduncle about wide as
least depth and keel slightly developed each side. Head convergent
below, broad above, width IJ in postocular region. Eye large,
ellipsoid. Jaws long, slender, not completely closing so base of upper
leaves a distinct open gape. Teeth of single row enlarged and erect
canines in each jaw, and surfaces all about externally with small
denticles or asperities. Tongue small, slender, end free. Maxillary
largely concealed, reaches firet third in eye. Nasal cavity large,
longest diameter equals pupil. Interorbital slightly depressed
medially. Cheek little wider than opercle. No rakers. Scales
small, narrowly imbricated, with basal and apical striae distinct, not
convergent or joined over median vertical axis. Head naked, except
22 rows of scales across cheek. Lateral line low, even over caudal
base. Dorsal inserted little behind anal origin, lobe about IJ in
postocular space, and hind rays at least twice depth of caudal pedun-
cle, though not longer than median rays. Anal lobe in front hke
dorsal, equals postocular, other rays lower than dorsal. Caudal
damaged, lower lobe evidently longer. Pectoral about equals post-
ocular, ventral 1^.
