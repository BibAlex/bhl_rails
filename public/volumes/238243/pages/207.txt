dorsal origin and caudal base; first branched ray 1 J in head, reaching
caudal base in smaller example. Anal inserted about midway be-
tween ventral origin and caudal base, nearer latter in smaller ex-
ample; 1\ to If in head. Caudal large; eye-diameter longer than
head, deeply forked, with lower lobe much longer in larger example;
pectoral, 1^ to 1^; ventral, If. Color in alcohol dull olive-brown
above, paler to whitish below. Fins all pale brown. Two examples,
110 to 146 mm.
CARANX HIPPOS (Linnaeus).
Head, 2| to 3^; depth, 2^ to 2f; D. VIII— I, 19 to 22; A. II—
I, 15 to 18; scutes in lateral line, 29 to 36; snout, 3§ to 4 in head
measured from upper jaw tip; eye. 3 to 3§; maxillary, 2^ to 2^;
interorbital, 3 to 3^; rakers, + 15 or U<. Five examples, 50 to
104 mm.
An examination and comj^arison with American examples from
Brazil, Santo Domingo, and Xew Jei^ey reveals no distinctions. The
cycloid scales of all are with similar circuli and no basal striae.
EPINEPHELUS AENEUS (Geoffrey St. Hilaire).
Head, 2^; depth, 3 J to 3^; D. X or XI. 15; A. Ill, 8; scales about
102 to lOS along and close above lateral line to caudal base and 15 to
18 more on latter; tubes, 71 to 73 in lateral line to caudal base and
13 to 20 on latter; 14 or 15 scales above lateral line to soft dorsal
origin, 28 to 34 below; snout, 4 to 4§ in head from upper jaw tip;
eye, 4; maxillary, 2 to 2J; interorbital, 7 to 7i. Well compressed,
back but little elevated. Caudal peduncle, length about | to | its
least depth; latter 3J to 3^ in total head length. Head width, 2f
its length. Snout conic; length thi-ee-fourths its width. Eye ad-
vanced little beyond middle in head length; less so with age, and
impinging on upper profile. Mouth large; loAver jaw well protruded.
Maxillary to or slightly beyond ])U])il, not quite to hind eye edge;
expansion 1| to 2 in eye. Teeth in rather narrow bands. Two rows
below in sides of mandible. Canines moderate, distinct pair in front
above and another depressible inner ];air. Moderate teeth in bands
on vomer and palatines, in about tlu-ee rows on latter. Interorbital
slightly convex, with little median depression. Hind })reopercIe edge
serrate, with cluster of fom- enlarged divergent spines at angle.
Rakers vi, 2 + 8 to 11 v or vi, lanceolate, about | of filaments and
latter about 2 in eye. Pseudobranchiae equal gill-filaments. Muz-
zle and maxiUai-y nailed. Scales on head small and cycloid, with
apical circuli coarser than marginal, and 2 or 3 short basal striae.
About 22 rows of scales on cheek. Scales on trunk small, crowded
or smaller along edges and over fin bases, mostly cycloid, circidi
mostly even and with 4 or 5 basal radu. Only few scales along lower
sides ctenoid, or with about 5 minute apical denticles. Tubes in
