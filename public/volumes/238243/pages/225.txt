on examples 280 to 290 mm. long, with the eye 4 in head, pectoral
1^ in body depth, and upper caudal lobe violet. Hemiramplius
guineensis, Bleeker,^ certainly to be referred to my African material,
is another synonym as long pointed out by Giinther. Bleeker's
figure is faulty in that it shows the lateral line contmuous to the
caudal base.
MUGIL CUREMA Valenciennes.
Head, 3|; depth 3f to 3^; D. IV-I, 8; A. Ill, 9; scales, 38 from
shoulder to caudal base; 12 scales transversely between soft dorsal
and anal origins; 28 to 30 predorsal scales; snout, 3ยง to 4 in head;
eye, 3ยง to 4; maxillary, 3^ to 4; interorbital, 2| to 2f. Body well
compressed, deepest at spinous dorsal origin. Least depth of caudal
peduncle l-f^ to 1^ its length, or 2^ to 2f in head. Head width, If
its length. Snout length half its width. Adipose eyelid broad,
and hind eye edge about midway in head length. Each lip with row
of fine or small cilliform teeth, and above inner imperfect row.
Maxillary to hind nostril, well exposed. Interorbital broadly convex.
Preorbital edge minutely serrate. Rakers 35 + 60, fine, lanceolate,
2 in filaments which about I of eye. Scales with about 10 basal
radii. Soft dorsal and anal densely scaly to edges, and caudal scaly
except hind edge. Spinous dorsal inserted about midway between
snout tip and caudal base, first spine If to 1| in head. Soft dorsal
inserted well behind anal origin, or about midway between spinous
dorsal origin and caudal base. Anal inserted behind depressed spin-
ous dorsal tip, first branched rays longest. Caudal deeply forked,
about 1^ to 1| in head, pectoral 1^ to 1|, ventral If to If. Color in
alcohol ohve-brown, paler below. Fins all pale brownish, pectoral
base slightly leaden and hind caudal edge dusky. Length of two
examples from Loando, 172 to 182 mm.
These specimens agree entirely with American. An example, 165
mm., from Santo Domingo, West Indies, has rakers 36 + 54. The
species is interesting as an addition to the fauna of West Africa.
LIZA SALIENS (Risso.)
Head, 3^ to 3 J; depth, 3^ to 3|; D. IV-I, 8; A. Ill, 9; scales,
34 to 38, from shoulder to median caudal base and 6 more on latter;
13 or 14 scales between soft dorsal and anal origins; 25 to 28 pre-
dorsal scales; snout, 3f to 3f in head; eye, 4| to 4ยง; maxillary, 31
to ^; interorbital, 2f to 2|. Body moderately long, weU com-
pressed, deepest about spinous dorsal origin. Caudal peduncle weU
compressed, least depth, 1| to H its length, or 2 1 to 2 J in head.
Head width. If to 2 in its length. Snout wide, length about three-
fifths its width. Eye advanced, hind edge about midway in head.
