Tribe MELANOMYmi.
PHASIOPHYTO, new genus.
Genotype. — PJiasiopliyto fumifera, new species.
General Melanomyine characters. Facialia about half as wide as
parafacialia. Arista rather thickly short-plumose. Eyes practically
bare. Frontals stopping at base of antennae. Parafacialia wide;
inner half bare, outer half thickly set with bristles. Cheeks over one-
fourth eye length. One lateral scuttelar; two sternopleurals, postin-
traalars, preacrostichals, and postacrostichals; three postsuturals;
long decussate apical scutellar pair. Third vein bristled only at base,
others bare. Apical cell nearly closed in tip. Hind crossvein nearer
to small crossvein. No median marginals on first segment, but a pair
on second, marginal row on last two segments.
PHASIOPHYTO FUMIFERA, new species.
Length, 5 mm. One male, Rio Charape, Jaen Province, Peru, 4,500
feet, September 13, 1911 (C. H. T. Townsend).
Soft blackish-brown. Frontalia and bare parts of face with testa-
ceous or lighter tinge. No distinct thoracic vittae. Abdomen largely
brownish-golden pollinose; the bases of last three segments silvery,

Tribe OEMITNI.
ORMIA BREVICORNIS, new species.
Length, 7.5 mm. One female, Texas (Belfrage).
Differs from punctata Robineau-Desvoidy as follows: Third anten-
nal joint no longer than second. Front almost equal to eye width.
Parafacialia wider. Vibrissae weak and indistinct. Cheek grooves
reaching half way up face. Facial plate narrowed on lower half.
Cheeks nearly two-fifths eye length.
The first-stage maggot has the cephalic spine-clusters, but the
spines are arranged in a longitudinal series; in punctata they are
arranged in a transverse series.
Type.— Cat. No. 22268, U.S.N.M.
ORMIA DOMINICANA, new species.
Length, 6 mm. Three females, San Francisco Mountains, Santo
Domingo, September, 1905 (A. Busck).
Differs from punctata Robineau-Desvoidy in the face widening
evenly from front, the inner border of eyes thus straight in front
view, the parafacialia thus noticeably widening above.
The first-stage maggot has one large talon or spine on each side of
head, instead of a cluster.
Type.— C&t. No. 22269, U.S.N.M.
