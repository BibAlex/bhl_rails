There are four rather typical specimens of this species mounted on
one of the slides.
TRILOCULINA LABIOSA d'Orbigny.
Triloculina labiosa d'Orbigny, in De La Sagra, Hist. Fis. Pol. Nat. Cuba, 1839,
"Foraminiferes, " p. 157, pi. 10, figs. 12-14.— Cushman, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat.
Mus., pt. 6, 1917, p. 70.
Miliolina labiosa H. B. Brady, Rep. Voy. Challenger, Zoology, vol. 9, 1884, p. 170,
pi. 6, figs. 3-5.
There are several rather small and typical specimens which should
be referred here. The specimens show about the same range of
variation as those figured by Brady.
TRILOCULINA ROTUNDA d'Orbigny.
Triloculina rotunda d'Orbigny, Ann. Sci. Nat., vol. 7, 1826, p. 299, No. 4. —
Schlumberger, M6m. Soc. Zool. France, vol. 6, 1893, p. 64, pi. 1, figs. 48-50;
figs. 11, 12 (in text).
Miliolina rotunda Millett, Journ. Roy. Micr. Soc, 1898, p. 267, pi. 5, figs. 15, 16. —
Heron-Allen and Earland, Trans. Zool. Soc. London, vol. 20, 1915, p. 568,
pi. 42, figs. 27-30.
There are numerous well-developed specimens of this species
which, according to the records, must be widely spread in the Indo-
Pacific, being recorded from the Kerimba Archipelago by Heron-
Allen and Earland, from the Malay Archipelago by Millett, and from
this material ofi New Zealand. It is also recorded from the Mediter-
ranean and the Atlantic.
Genus BILOCULINA d'Orbigny, 1826.
BILOCULINA ANOMALA Schlumberger.
Biloculina onomala Schlumberger, M6m. Soc. Zool. France, vol. 4, 1891, p.
182, pi. 11, figs. 84-86; pi. 12, fig. 101, text figs. 32-34.— Chapman, Trans. Ne^v
Zealand Instit., vol. 38, 1905, p. 80.— Cushman, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt.
6, 1917, p. 79, pi. 32, fig. 1.
Several specimens seem very close to the figures given by Schlum-
berger, and I have had the species from the Hawaiian Islands. Chap-
man records it from off Great Barrier Island. Schlumberger 's type
material is from the Mediterranean.
BILOCULINA PISUM Schlumberger.
Biloculina pisum Schlumberger, M^m. Soc. Zool. France, vol. 4, 1891, p. 569
pi. 11, figs. 81-83; fig. 31 (in text). — Chapman, Trans. New Zealand Instit.. vol.
38, 1905, p. 80.
There are several specimens, which, from their surface characters,
might belong to either this species or B. vespertilio Schlumberger.
