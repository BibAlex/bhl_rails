specimen. The carapace is evenly and broadly arched from side to
side.
The nuchal at the center is 19 millimeters long, with a greatest
breadth of 40 millimeters. There are only seven nem^als determin-
able, the seventh being the largest the sixth being octagonal. The
seventh, in all probability, is the coalesced seventh and eighth, but
no suture can be seen crossing it.
In the number of neurals the large size of the seventh and the
octagonal shape of the sixth this specimen closely resembles B. riparia
Hay. As in the type all of the neurals are longer than wide.

The pygal is unusually long, measuring 32 millimeters antero-
posteriorly, with a greatest transverse diameter of 44 millimeters.
On the free border it is 30 millimeters wide.
There are the usual eight pairs of costals. All except the fifth
pair have the distal end wider than the proximal — a peculiarity ap-
parently found in the type of the species as shoAvn by the converg-
ing sides of the proximal half, the distal part of which is missing.
At the junction of costals 2 and 3, and 3 and 4 with the peripherals,
there are two suboval openings through the carapace. The con-
traction of costal 3 to a broadly pointed end, which is received in a
pit largely within peripheral 5, separates these two apertures. The
anterior opening is the smaller of the two. These may possibly be
attributed to the immaturity of the individual, and in an aged
specimen it is not milikely that these openings would cease to exist.
The axillary buttress is directed upward and forward toward the
front of the first dorsal vertebra. Its upper end joins the first rib,
which is wide, and with the buttress forms the extended partition
bounding the body chamber. The inguinal buttress unites exclusively
with the fifth costal on its distal half (see fig. 1). In front of it
the body chamber extends far out toward the border of the cara-
pace. There are 11 peripheral bones, all of which are relatively low.
The first two are 17 millimeters high; the third, 21 millimeters;
the three succeeding increase from 12 to 14 millimeters; the seventh,
