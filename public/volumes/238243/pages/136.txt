Say's brief description of terminalis applies only to ohscurus Howard,
as the characters, "head yellowish, antennae blackish, terminal joint
white" effectually eliminate aU other North American species or
forms belonging to this group. The species seems to be fairly dis-
tinct horn. Jiaminius in the shape of the head, although merging with
it in coloration through the subspecies californicus Girault. This
considerably greater range in coloration of terminalis is characteristic
of many North American Hymenoptera as compared with the corre-
sponding species or genera of the Old World.
