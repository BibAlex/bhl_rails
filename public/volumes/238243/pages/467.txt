There are very numerous specimens of this species, most of which
are plastogamic — a condition which appears to be common in this
species. Most of the records for this species seem to be from the
Indian and South Pacific Oceans. There is one specimen which has
a border with a row of short spines which suggests a varietal char-
acter, but no name is given it as only one specimen occurs.

There are six specimens on one of the slides, which agree very
closely with the Challenger figures, Ahnost all the records for this
species are about Australia, except one from Siddall, from Great
Britain. This is recorded as a very small form, and it may be
questionable as to its really being identical with this species, espe-
cially since Sidebottom records a single small specimen from off
Australia. Heron-Allen and Earland in their Clare Island Paper do
not record this species.

In the material from this station there are six specimens of this
species. These show the early chambers to be spiral; the walls are
very thin and translucent, and distinctly perforated. Millett has
already remarked that this species has certain characteristics, making
it more like some of the Rotahidae than the other species of Textularia,
and Brady also observed this same resemblance. I have already
noted (pt. 2, p. 19) that it might belong to Discorhis, but that ''a
study of the apical charactei-s and the arrangement of the early
chambers should determine this." This material now can be used
for this study, and seems to determine definitely that it should be
placed among the Rotaliidae. In some of its markings it resembles
Patellina, and is here placed under Discorhis. It seems to be a
species in which the chambers each make a half coil as added, and
its resemblance to Textularia is only superficial. This seems to be
clearly an Indo-Pacific species. The localities given by Brady are
off Moncoeur Island, Bass Strait, 38 fathoms; Nares Harbor, Admi-
