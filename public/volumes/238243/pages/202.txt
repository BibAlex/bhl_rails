\o. 2294. FISHES FROM ^VEST AFRICA— FOMLER. 249
double convex behind; median rays longest or 1^ in head; pectoral,
2; ventral left, 2f. Color in alcohol dull brownish on left side,
with many well scattered pale spots, none larger than scale exposure.
Right side uniform white. Length, 395 mm. S.
A smaller example, 171 mm. long, from Sumatra, differs in the
scales having 18 to 20 basal striae, a condition doubtless due to
age. Its left or colored side is quite dark, also fins, and without
any pale spots.

6. ASHANTEE.
The lishes from this country were aU obtained by the Eclipse Expe-
dition in the Beyah River at Elmina, or the vicinity of the latter.
Though a number of scattered references to the fishes of the Gold
Coast occur, the only work of primary fauna! interest is Bleeker's
celebrated "Memoire sur ies Poissons de la cote de Guinee." ' Giin-
ther described a few species in his paper on "New fishes from the
Gaboon and Gold Coast." - Sauvage ^ and Pellegrin * have both
published papers on the fishes of the adjacent lA'ory Coast, useful in
this connection.
