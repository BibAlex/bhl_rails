NEW FOSSIL TURTLES, WITH NOTES ON TWO
DESCRIBED SPECIES.

INTRODUCTION.
During the summer of 1918 the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology
of the United States National Museum came into the possession
of a considerable number of well-preserved turtle specimens. Among
these are several that represent undescribed species and others that
contribute to a better understanding of the skeletal structure of
described forms.
It is the purpose of the present paper to present the facts concern-
ing these specimens, thus making this information available to stu-
dents of the extinct Chelonia.
Family PLEUROSTERNIDAE.
NEURANKYLUS WYOMINGENSIS, new species.
Plates 29 and 30.
Type. — No. 7581, U.S.N.M., consists of the posterior half of the
carapace and plastron.
Type locality. — Shoshone River, near Cody, Big Horn County,
Wyoming.
Horizon. — Colorado shale, Upper Cretaceous.
The specimen to be described was collected in the summer of 1912
by Mi\ D. F. Hewett, of the United States Geological Survey, from
the Colorado shale as exposed in the vicinity of Cody, Wyoming.
A comparison of this somewhat imperfect specimen with the type
of Neurankylus haueri also in the National Museum collection, leads
me to provisionally refer it to that genus. The large size and general
proportions of the vetebral and costal scutes, and the close resem-
blance in the general form of both the carapace and plastron appears
to show the correctness of the above determination. If, upon the
discovery of more perfect specimens, this provisional assignment
proves to be correct, it represents the most ancient member of the
