1878. (?)
A western species which is quite distinct from all other members
of the genus, although resembling odo-lineata Say in general appear-
ance. However, the anterior margin of the vertex is much thicker
and more broadly rounding than in odo-lineata Say and the elytra
is never reticulate. The female segment is much the same in both
species. It is a bright yellow to green species, sometimes nearly
white. Dried specimens appear yellow.
Its distribution includes the Rocky Mountain States westward to
the Pacific and north into Canada.
9. GYPONA NIXABUNDA, new species.
Vertex nearly one-half as long as width between the eyes, anterior
margin thin, prominently depressed beneath. Striations on vertex
oblique, transverse on pronotum. Ocelli comparatively small and
nearer the median line of vertex than eyes and midway between
anterior and posterior borders. A black spot on the pronotum
behind each eye. Scutellum about equal to pronotum in length.
Base of clavus black. Female segment with two small lobes at the
middle and shallowly sinuate on either side. Size, female, 10
mm. long.
Color, female, entirely green or yellowish green, with only other
color markings being the spots on pronotum and base of clavus
darkened. Female same as male with dorsal side of abdomen more
or less darkened in bands and apex of elytra smoky. Elytra trans-
parent in both sexes in dried specimens. Veins of the hind wings
of the male black.
