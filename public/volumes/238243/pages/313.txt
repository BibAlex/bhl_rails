broad and low and the sinus broad and shallow. Nine plications
occupy the lateral slopes. The hinge line generally equals the width
across the middle, but it may be somewhat less than the width.
Measurements. — 18 mm. along the hinge line, 18.5 mm. wide
across the middle, 12.5 mm. high, 8.5 mm. thick, 10 mm. sinal
width, 2.5 mm. fold height.
Occurrence. — Trenton group. Curdsville limestone: Mercer
County, Shyrock's Ferry and Bergen, Kentucky; and Crossville

Orthis lynx Chapman, Canadian Journ., new ser., vol. 8. 1863, p. 199, fig. 185.
This species is about the size of PJatystropJiia daytonensis, but it
always has a shorter hinge line and a greater number of plications
on the fold and sinus. After the one plication in the sinus has bi-
furcated a lateral plication is added on each of the sinal slopes,
while on the fold, the intercalation of the median plication is fol-
lowed by the bifurcation of the primary plications. Seven and
eight plications occupy the lateral slopes.
Measurements. — 17.3 mm. along the hinge; 20.4 mm. wide across
the middle; 14.5 mm. high; 11 mm. sinal width; 6 mm. sinal depth;
3.5 mm. fold height.

This was described by Foerste as follows:
Shell attaining a fair size, the dorsal valve a little larger; shell wider than long,
with a subquadrate outline; no very gibbous forms have as yet been found; hinge line
less than the greatest breadth of the valves; cardinal extremities obtusely angular;
lateral margins rather sinuous near the hinge-line, rounding to the front, where it is
