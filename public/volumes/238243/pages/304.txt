NO. 2297. BRACHIOPOD GENUS PLATYSTROPHIA—McEWAN.
397
It seems to the writer that the species of Platystrophia represent
the "ever-sporting varieties" of De Vries, and the different muta-
tions are marked by variation in the phcation pattern. The propa-
gation of these mutations is most prominent in the Low Fold and
Ponderosa subgroups and rare in the High Fold subgroup.
This development is so pronounced in PlatystropJiia elegantula,
new species, that it has become of specific value. Platystrophia
narrowensis also sliows a prolific development of these individuals.
ORTHOGENESIS.
In order to simplify the discussion of the life history it is thought
advisable to construct first a diagram as a guide to the discussion
which will follow. The purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the
common characters of the various groups and subgroups into which
the genus can be subdivided and the common order of appearance
of these characters. The line represents the ontogeny and it is
subdivided into the ontogenetic stages which are indicated by let-
ters. The early onto stages are so condensed as to make it impos-
sible to measure with accuracy their relative duration, but an effort
is made to indicate where a developmental stage is noticeably shorter
in one group than in another.
