Fig. 10. — TiLAPlA SAVAGEI.
Body elongately ellipsoid in contour, deepest at ventral spine tip;
edges all convex, well compressed. CTaudal peduncle well com-
pressed; length, about two-thirds of least depth.
Head compressed, flattened sides converging about evenly above
and below. Snout conic, surface convex, long as wide. Eye little
ellipsoid; center nearly midway in head length and but little ele-
vated. Mouth small, gape about two-thirds to eye, and lower jaw
very slightly shorter. Maxillary beyond nostril, but not to eye;
expansion 2^ in latter. Lips firm. Teeth in about five rows above
and three below, with outer row in each jaw largest, moderately
slender, expanded and notched at ends. Nostril simple pore at
last two-fifths in snout. Interorbital broad, slightly convex.
Preopercle and preorbital edges entire; width of latter, about 1^
in eye.
