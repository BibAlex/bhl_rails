Proboscis short, palpi club-shaped, sub compressed. Third antennal
joint about three and one-half times second. Arista thinly long-
plumose about two-thirds way. Frontals diverging one below base
of antennae. Two procHnate fronto-orbitals in female. Ocellars
present. Parafacialia irregularly set with several faint hairs down
middle. Cheeks over one-fifth eye length. Three sternopleurals
and postsuturals ; two postintraalars ; one preacrostichal and post-
acrostichal; three lateral scutellars, but no apical. Third vein
