Type.—Csit. No. 42342, U.S.N.M. Quanza River at Cunga, Angola".
William Harvey Brown. U. S. Eclipse Expedition, 1889.
Also Cat. No. 42341, same data, four paratypes. These show:
Head, 4^ to 4f ; depth 4|- to 5^; D. I, 6; X. ii, 50 to 54; snout 2| to
Z\ in head measured from upper jaw tip; eye, 3^ to 4f ; mouth width,
2 to 2-1; interorbital, 2\ to 2-| ; head width, If to 1§; length, 130 to
150 mm.
This species is allied with Eutropius ansorgii Boulenger, which I
have not seen. It appears to differ in the longer barbels, more slender
body, fewer anal rays, and lower position of the eye.
