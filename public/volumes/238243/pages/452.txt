No. 2302. FORAMINIFERA FROM NEW ZEALAND— CVSHMAN. 607
species found in the South Pacific and those in the North Atlantic.
All these New Zealand specimens are much compressed, and, except
that the adult ones are somewhat elongate, are of the type figured
by Brady .^ Sidebottom and Chapman both record this species,
and it is possible that the compressed Pacific form should be dis-
tinguished from the more inflated Atlantic one.
Genus EHRENBERGINA Reuss, 1850.
EHRENBERGINA SERRATA Reuss, variety.
There are several mounted specimens in the collection which are
uniform in character. They are much more compressed than is
generally the case in this species, and the center portion where the
angles of the sutures come together instead of being angled and pro-
jected is flattened. This is constant in all the specimens and may
represent a distinct variety of the species. Sidebottom records
this species from Australia, but makes no mention of any peculiarity
of this sort.

There are several specimens of this common species, showing
little variation except in the thickness of the test.

A single specimen, nearly spherical in shape, evidently belongs
here.

There are several specimens of this species, very close to the form
which I have figured.^
