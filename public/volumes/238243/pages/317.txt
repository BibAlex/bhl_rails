Orthis biforata Hall and Clarke, Pal. New York, vol. 8, pt. 1, 1892, pi. 5B, fig. 10.
This is a thin transverse species with subequally convex valves.
The hinge line is as long or nearly as long as the width across the
middle. The fold is low and spreading and the sinus is shallow. The
fold is occupied by four and the sinus by three plications. There are
nine plications on the lateral slopes.
This species resembles Platystrophia elegantula, new species, but it
lacks the curved plications on the lateral slopes, and it has a longer
hinge line than that species. A much thicker variety is found at
various localities associated with typical specimens. The thickness
may become as great as or greater than the height. Shells of this
type are abundant at Trenton Falls, New York, and for these the
name Platystrophia amoena rohusia (pi. 43, figs. 14-17, Cat. No. 66091,
U.S.N.M.) is suggested.
Measurements. — 13 mm. along the hinge line, 14 mm. wide across
the middle, 10 mm. high, 6.3 mm. thick, 5.5 mm. sinal width, 2 mm.
sinal depth, 0.7 mm. fold depth.

PLATYSTROPHIA AMOENA LONGICARDINALIS, new variety.
Plate 43, figs. 9-13.
The distinguishing characteristic of this variety is the great width
in reference to the height. The hinge line always forms the greatest
width and the cardinal extremes are acuminate and thin. The thin-
ness is due to the compression of the slopes of both valves.
Owing to the long hinge line this variety resembles Platystrophia
trentonensis, new species, but the plications of the latter species place
it with the biplicate group of shells, while this species belongs to the
triplicate group.
Measurements.— '\b mm. along the hinge, 12 mm. wide across the
middle, 8.2 mm. high, 7 mm. thick, 5.5 mm. sinal width, 3.8 mm.
sinal depth, 1 mm. fold height.
