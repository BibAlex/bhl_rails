xNO. 2293. PARASITIC CHALCIDOID FLIES— TIMBERLAKE. 183
Redescribed from the following material which had been compared
previously with Howard's type: Three females, two males, reared
from a Chrysopa cocoon, Pasadena, California, August 7, 1915 (E. J.
Branigan), California State Insectary No. 2011; one female collected
on Citrus, San Diego, California, September 14, 1911 (P. H. Timber-
lake) ; and one female, Washington City, January, 1898 (August
Busck). Howard^ also records this species from Kirkwood, Mis-
souri, and Amitilla, Florida, in both cases from CJirysopa cocoons.
Essig^ records the rearing of iceryae in California from the cocoons of
Sympherobius angustus Banks.
The type of /. pulcher Girault, a female reared from material of
Saissetia oleae (Bernard), Claremont, California, October, 1909
(C. F. Baker), is mounted on a slide and can not be studied to advan-
tage, but it appears to differ from iceryae only in the extension of the
yellow coloration. The scutellum is entirely yellow except for a
narrow blackish cross-band just before the apex, and the abdomen
has more yellow at the base, and the yellow spot at the tactile plates
is larger.
The type of Parataneostigrna nigriaxillae Girault, a female from
Mitla, Mexico (L. O. Howard) agrees with the type of pulclier except
that the cross-band near apex of the scutellum is less distinct.
Types. — Cat. No. 1491 (of iceryae Howard), 19339 (of nigriaxillae
Girault), and 19794 (of pulcher Girault), U.S.N.M.
3. ISODROMUS FLAVICEPS (Dalman).
Encyrtus Jlaviceps Dalman, Svensk. Vet.-Akad. Handl., vol. 41, 1820, p. 348.
Homalotyhis Jlaviceps Mayr, Verh. zool.-bot. Ges. Wien, vol. 25, 1876, p. 754.
Nobrimus flaviceps Thomson, Hym. Skand., vol. 4, 1876, p. 140.
This species has not been seen by the writer. It seems to be
rare, as the only recorded specimen is Dahrxan's type, collected by
Zetterstedt at Larketorp, Sweden, about 100 years ago. In colora-
tion, at least, it must be similar to the common North American
species, iceryae Howard.
4. ISODROMUS AXILLARIS, new species.
Female. — Head hardly longer than wide, not quite so thick fronto-
occipitally as in iceryae, but thicker than in niger, the planes of the
frontovertex and face meeting in an angle of considerably more
than 90°; frontovertex about two and a half times longer than wide,
the dorsal orbits of eyes perceptibly but not greatly diverging ante-
riorly; the ocelli in an equilateral triangle, the posterior pair almost
touching the eye margins, and removed twice then* o\vn diameter
from the occipital margin, the median ocellus considerably behind
