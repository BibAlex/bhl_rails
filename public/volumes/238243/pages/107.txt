serus Cope. It was found in a cave in the northern part of Bexar
County, Texas. The tooth belongs to the Scientific Society of San
Antonio. It was a far smaller tooth than that of figure 3,
From the close resemblance existing between the carnassial found
at Vero and here referred to Leidy's Machairodus jioridanus and that
of Trucifelis fatalis found at Natchez, it is certain that both belong
to the same genus. For this genus the writer accepts at present the
name Trucifelis. We shaU have, therefore, the two species, Truci-
felis atrox and T. jioridanus.
FELIS VERONIS, new species.

When the author was at Vero, in October, 1917, he found along the
drainage canal, a short distance above the railroad bridge, in the bed
of sand known as No. 2, an upper left fourth premolar of a large tiger-
like animal. Views of this tooth are here presented (pi. 28, figs.
5-7). On comparing it with the corresponding teeth of the tiger
and of the jaguar {F. imraguensis, No. 4128 U. S. Nat. Mus.), and
with those of the machairodonts, it can not be doubted that its pos-
sessor belonged to a species of Felis. In order to facilitate comparison
the following measurements are presented, being those of the speci-
men in question, the same tooth of Felis tigris, and of the large South
American jaguar, Felis paraguensis HoUister.

Various differences between the fossil tooth and that of the tiger
appear other than those shown in the table of measurements. The
protocone of the Vero tooth is considerably less reduced than in the
tiger, its height and anteroposterior diameter being greater by one-
third. Immediately behind the protocone the width of the tooth
is reduced more suddenly than in the tiger; the preanterior tubercle
is much more prominent than that in the tiger; and the buttress
which descends from the principal cone to the protocone is sharp,
instead of rounded. In the jaguar the preanterior tubercle is missing
and the protocone is relatively more reduced than in the fossil.
The height of the main cusp is relatively greater than in either the
