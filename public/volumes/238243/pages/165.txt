the base fine and uniform and but little coarser than those on the
scutum. Head with a very fine and not i:)rominent pubescence, the

Head auburn (R.), the occiput more blackish, the vertex sometim.es

margin suffused with yellowish: thorax and abdom.en nearly black,
the mesopleura, hovrever, v.'ith a distinct brown tinge; prepectal
plates transparent whitish, the collar of pronotum broadly v.'hitish
changing to yellowish on the propleura; posterior lateral corners of
the mesoscutum primuline yellow (K.) with the anterior margin o
the marldngs convex; tegulae white, with the apical, outer corner
