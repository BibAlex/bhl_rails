In the Trenton limestone occurs a long hinged form which has
the plication pattern of the Biplicate group. The hinge line is
equal to or greater than the width across the middle. The fold is
scarcely elevated above the convexity of the brachial valve, and it
bears four plications of equal strength. The sinus of the pedicle
valve is moderately deep and bears three plications of equal
strength. There are twelve to fifteen plications on the lateral
slopes.
This species has some resemblance to Platystrophia amoena longi-
cardinalis, new variety, but the latter species belongs to the tripli-
cate group.
Measurements. — 16.7 mm. along the hinge line, 16 mm. across the
middle, 12.3 mm. high, 11 mm. thick, 7.4 mm. sinal width, 4.7 mm.
sinal depth, 0.7 mm. fold height.
Occurrence. — Trenton group. Prosser limestone at Fountain and
Montorville, Minnesota, and at Decorah, Iowa. Cm-dsville lime-
stone at Troy, Kentucky. Trenton limestone at St. Joseph Island,
Lake Hm-on.

In the Trenton limestone of Lake Champlain is a small form which re-
sembles Platystrophia elegantula, new species in the shape of the shell
but the forms are easily distinguished by their plication patterns.
This variety differs from typical specimens of the species in pos-
sessing a much shorter hinge-line and in a tendency toward obsoles-
cence of plications next to the cardinal angles.
Occurrence. — Trenton limestone, near Lake Champlain, New York.
