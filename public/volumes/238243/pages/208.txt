third to three-fifths of eye. Rakers, v, 1+7 or 8, iv, lanceolate,
about seven-eighths of filaments; latter If in eye. Pseudobranchiae

Scales above lateral line parallel, below in horizontal rows. Small
scales on breast, more so on vertical fin bases. Cheek with 7 rows
of scales. Suprascapula denticulate marginally. Lateral line con-
current with back, tubes inconspicuous. Spinous dorsal begins
about over pectoral origin; fourth spine 2| in head. Soft dorsal
inserted about midway between spinous dorsal origin and caudal
base; eighth ray, 2f to 3 in head. Anal inserted slightly behind
soft dorsal origin; second spine longest, or 3 to 3^ in head. Soft anal
rounded; third ray longest, or 2| to 2^ in head. Hind caudal edge
slightly emarginate. Pectoral, If to If in head; ventral, 1^ to If,
but not quite to vent, which little nearer its tip than anal origin.
Ventral spine about two-fifths to three-fifths in fin; first ray fila-

Color in alcohol brown on back above, paler to whitish below. No
yellow spots on scales. From below hind nostril to lower eye edge
narrow pale bluish line, bordered above and below with brown and
