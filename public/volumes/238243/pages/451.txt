Genus BULIMINELLA Cushman, 1911.
BUUMINELLA ELEGANTISSIMA d'Orbigny.
Buliminella eleganfissima d'Orbigny, Foram. Amer. ]\Ierid., 1889, p. 51, pi. 7,
figs. 13, 14.— II. B. Brady, Rep. Voy. Challenger, Zoology, vol. 9, 1884, p. 402,
pi. 50, figs. 20-22.— SiDEBOTTOM, .Tourn. Roy. Micr. Soc, 1918, pt. 2, p. 122.
There are three specimens of this very definite species. Brady
mentions in the Challenger report this species from AustraHa and the
South Pacific and that it is widely scattered elsewhere. Chapman
does not record it from Great Barrier Island, but Sidebottom records
a single specimen from the east coast of Australia. All specimens
are typical rather than like the variety described by Sidebottom.
Genus VIRGULINA d'Orbigny, 1826.

There are four specimens on the slide which are very close to the
figures of this species given by Brady/ but not like the other figures
given. It may be possible that Brady has several species under
this one name. In the ClmJlenger report Brady mentions that the
finest specimens of this species occur amongst the islands of the
Pacific, and it is quite probable that these specimens from New
Zealand represent one of the species which Brady refers to. These
range from Tahiti to the south coast of Japan, vrhich is the range
of so many of these species found in the Philippines, and southward
to Australia.
Subfamily Cassidulininae.
Genus CASSIDULINA d'Orbigny, 1826.
CASSIDULINA SUBGLOBOSA H. B. Brady.
Cassidulina subglobosa H. B. Brady, Quart. Jourii. ?*Iifr. Sci., vol. 21, 1881, p.
60; Rep. Voy. Challenger, Zoology, vol. 9, 1884, p. 430, pi. 54, figs. 17, u-c—
Clshman, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt. 2, 1911, p. 98. fig. 152 (in text).
Characteristic specimens of this species are on the slides. It is
characteristic of deeper waters in most of the oceans, this being
rather less than the usual depth for its occurrence. Both Chapman
and Sidebottom record this species in their papers.
CASSIDULINA BRADYI Norman.
Cassidulina bradiji (Norman, MS.) Wright, Pro(.'. Belfast Nat. Field Club, App.,
1880, p. 152— H. B. Brady, Rep. Voy. Challenger, Zoology, vol. 9, 1884, p.
431, pi. 54, figs. 6 -10.— Cushman, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt. 2, 1911, p. 99,
fig. 153 (in text).
There are several fine specimens which can be referred to this
species. There seems, however, to be a distinction between the
» Challenger Report, pi. 62, fig. 9.
