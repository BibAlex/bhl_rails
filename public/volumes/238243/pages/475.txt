represents an irregular linear series in which the chambers are pyri-
form, the basal portion being broad and rounded, the apertural end
narrowed. These remind one very much of certain specimens of
Vitrewchlina. Both specimens are attached to shell fragments.

There are numerous specimens, very irregular in shape and
resembling in a general way those figured by Brady ^ and also
a specimen figured by Millett. In spite of the fact of the irregu-
larity of form, the general characters of this species seem to be
well defined. The surface is smooth and polished and clear white
in color.

There are two very typical specimens from this station. Heron-
Allen and Earland record it from the Kerimba Archipelago off the
eastern coast of Africa. Millett's specimens are from the Malay
Archipelago, and with this material from New Zealand, show that
the species has a wide range in the Indo-Pacific region. Heron-
Allen and Earland in the same paper (p. 592) record their species
F. helix from material collected by Mr. R. L. Mestayer from the
same dredging from which our material is mounted. This species
has not occurred on the series of slides I have had from the United
States National Museum.
