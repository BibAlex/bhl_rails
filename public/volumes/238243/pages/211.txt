7. Kamerun.
A small collection of fishes made by the Rev. R. H. Nassau, at
Great Batanga, and sent to Princeton University, has been studied
in this comiection. The collection is now in the museum of Princeton
University, and to the officers of the same I am indebted for the
opportunity of its examination. A list of the fishes was recently
given over my name.^ The first account of the Kamermi fishes is
Peters list of the Bucholz collection,^ though he describes the inter-
esting Pantodon about the same time.^ Since then the only accounts
are by Ehrenbaum * and Pietschmann,^ who note but few species.
