Brady's Challenger records are from the Philippines, 95 fathoms; oflF
Raine Island, Torres Strait, 155 fathoms, and off the west coast of
New Zealand, 150 fathoms. I have had this species from off Japan,
and it is evidently a species of the Indo-Pacific region. It may possi-
bly be that it is not the same as the fossil species described by Reuss
from the Cretaceous of Germany.
CRISTELLARIA TRICARINELLA Reuss, var. SPINIPES Cushman.
Cristellaria tricarinella Reuss, var. spinipes Cushman, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus.,
pt. 3, 1913, p. 72, pi. 33, fig. 2.
I described this variety from off Japan. That material differed
from the typical C, tricarinella only in the addition of a large spine
at the apical end of the test and with more limbate sutm-es. This
material from New Zealand, while in general appearance like that of
C. tricarinella, has several spines at the apical end; but the main
difference is that the early portion is completely involute and quite
different in appearance from that from Japan. The early stages are
not at all like that of the numerous specimens of C. tricarinella
which are mounted on the slide. It is an interesting form and may
prove to be distinct.
CRISTELLARIA DENTICULIFERA Cushman.
Cristellaria cuUrata H. B. Brady (part) (not C. cultrata Montfort), Rep. Voy.
Challenger, Zoology, vol. 9, 1884, p. 550, pi. 70, figs. 7, 8.
Cristellaria denticulifera Cushman, Bull. 71, U. S. Nat. Mus., pt. 3, 1913, p.
75, pi. 37, fig. 1.
There is a single large specimen which is ver}^ close to this species
as figured by Brady. The walls of the chambers are ornamented
with longitudinal curved costae, and the denticulate borders with the
raised sutures show it to be this species. The number of chambers
is also similar to that in the figured specimen. The material I have
had is from off Japan, but Brady's material is indefinite as to lo-
cality.

Brady figures a single specimen which he refers to this species.*
It is very close to tliis material. His records for this species in-
clude one station from this general region, off Raine Island, 155
fathoms. Chapman records a single specimen from off New Zealand.^
It is also recorded by MiUett from the Malay Archipelago. I have
had it in some numbers from the Phihppines. In the North Pacific
