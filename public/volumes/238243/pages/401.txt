after the fashion of the crocodile, though, quoting again from the
above author:
The strong limbs with longer foreleg than upper leg, with strong feet, with powerful
claws, ample evidence of an ability to run with some speed and perhaps even leap or
pounce upon prey. Abel, in hia Paleobiologie, points out that running and leaping
animals have the foreleg longer than the upper leg, and creeping animals have the pro-
portions reversed. It is not probable the Dimetrodon was ever capable of leaping any
distance, but it certainly was able to move swiftly for a short space. Probably it
lay hidden in the vegetation, and made short, scuttling rushes upon its prey, end-
ing, possibly, with a short

places were probably the regions most densely populated by these
lesser forms, and no doubt such places were the favorite haunts
of the Dimetrodon.
NOTES ON THE SKELETAL STRUCTURE OF DIMETRODON GIGAS COPE
STcuU. — Through the studies of Baur, Case, Williston, Broom, and
von Huene, the structure of the skull of Dimetrodon is now pretty
well known. There is still divergence of opinion regarding the extent
of the boundaries of some few of its elements, and of the homologies
of certain others. At this time it is the composition and extent of
the bones forming the posterior part of the cranium that appears to
be least understood, and while the skull of No. 8635, U.S.N.M.,
ojffers but little positive information for making clearer our under-
standing of the occipital region, it does offer suggestions which may
eventually be of help in arriving at the correct interpretation of these
parts.
The median bones of the occipital region were found articulated
as shown in figure 1. The sutures are entirely obliterated — a con-
