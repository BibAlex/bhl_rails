on trunk by upper lateral keel, tinge of dark greenish. Iris pale.
Fins all pale brownish, with dusky on outer portions.
Length, 450 mm.
Type.— Cat. No. 42150, U.S.N.M.
Also four other examples, showing: head, 3 to 3J; depth, 1^ to
1^ in postocular region; D. ii, 12, once 11, 14; A. ii, 17; scales about
212 to 223 in lateral line to caudal base; about 123 to 135 predorsal
scales to occiput; rakers, iii to vi+4 to 6 v to xi; eye 1§ to 2 in
postocular; interorbital If to 2; least width of caudal peduncle, 2
to 2f ; length, 379 to 429 mm.
My examples differ from the accounts by Valenciennes ^ and
Giinther ^ in the constantly fewer anal rays, or 19 instead of 20 to
21, partly pentagonal body, slightly more advanced ventral and
apparently larger scales. In structure the scales show the circuli
complete, very fine, or simply convergent,
SCOMBER COLIAS GmeUn.
' Head, 3| to 3|; depth, 5^ to 6i; D. X— ii, 10 + 5; A. in, 10 + 5;
snout, 2f to 3 in head measured from upper jaw tip; eye, 4| to 4J;
maxillary, 2f to 2f ; interorbital, 4 to 4^; second dorsal spine, 2 to
2iV; first branched dorsal ray, 4| to 4§; pectoral, 21 to 2J; ventral,
2f to 2 J; rakers, 16+30. Maxillary about to eye front. Front
nostril about three-fifths of eye-diameter before eye. Interorbital
flattened. Spinous dorsal inserted about midway between hind
nostril and soft dorsal origin. Pectoral about one-fourth to one-
third in depressed spinous dorsal. Ventral inserted near first third
of depressed pectoral. Two examples, 229 mm.
TRACHURUS PICTURATUS (Bowdich).
Head, 3^ to 3^; depth, ^ to 5^; D. VIII— I, 30 to 34; A. II— I,
25 to 29; scutes in lateral line, 49 to 56 + 45 to 52, and of latter usually
4 to 8 on caudal base; snout, 3 to 3^ in head measured from upper
jaw tip; eye, 3 to 3|; maxillary, 2| to 2^; interorbital, 3f to 4; rakers,
16 or 17+39 to 41; length, 132 to 205 mm. Fourteen examples.
Tracliurus traclmrus (Liimaeus), of the Mediterranean, is close
to the present species in the broad scutes in the first half of the
lateral line, apparently differing in their fewer number, 79 to 86,
compared with 94 to 108 in T. picturatus. Both species have far
more scutes than T. semispinosus (Nilsson) in which they are said
to be 70 to 75. Compared with examples from California (San
Pedro and Santa Catalina) of T. symmeiricus the present form shows
several strildng differences. It has the lateral line much wider, as
width of upper two-thirds and lower three-fifths of eye, compared
with width of upper one-half and lower two-thirds in eye in T.
