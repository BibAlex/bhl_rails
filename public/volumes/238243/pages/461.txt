This seems to be a common species from the number of mounted
specimens. They are close to the figures given by Brady for this
species.
Genus FRONDICULARIA Defrance, 1824.
FRONDICULARIA COMPTA H. B, Brady.
Frondicularia compta H. B. Brady, Quart. Journ. Micr. Sci., vol. 19, 1879, p.
57, pi. 8, fig. 6; Rep. Voy. Challenger, Zoology, vol. 9, 1884, p. 520, pi. 65, fig.

Brady figures and describes a very peculiar specimen under this
species name. It came from off East Moncoeur Island, Bass Strait,
depth 38 fathoms. He also figures ^ a specimen from off Kaine Is-
land which he refers to F. archiaciana d'Orbigny. In this material
from New Zealand there are four specimens which should be referred
to either one or the other of these figures given by Brady. These
have from three to five chambers. One of them has somewhat the
ornamentation shown in plate 114, figure 12. The others are more
hke the earlier chambers of F. comida, plate 65, figure 19. It seems
quite likely that both the specimens which Brady had may be one
species, in which case they probably should both be placed under
Brady's species. At any rate the New Zealand specimens which are
in this collection seem to belong to F. compta, which is evidently a
very rare species, and should be looked for elsewhere in the Indo-
Pacific region.

Both the typical form and two specimens of the fistulose form
occur on the slides. They are very close to the figures given by
Brady.
