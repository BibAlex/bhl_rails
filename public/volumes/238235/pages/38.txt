VENEZUELA.
BY OLUFIELl) THOMAS.

determination proves to differ from the previously described

Allied to P. trinitatiif, but less richly rufous in color.
Size rather less than in P. trinitatis . Spines evenly mixed with the
dorsal hair, and of about the same prominence on the back; an average
spine measures 23 mm. in length by aboiU, two-thirds of a millimeter in
breadth. General color above much paler than in the allied species,
more similar to that of the Ecuadorean P. decumanus Thos. ; pale rufous
heavily lined on the back with the black tips to the spines, laterally
clearer but still rufous, the hairs indistinctly annulated with brown.
Face greyer than back. Fine hairs of ear black, some longer black
hairs at its base anteriorly. Under surface white, pure on the chest and
belly, bufTy on the throat and along a narrow indistinctly defined line
edging the color of the flanks. Upper svirface of hands and feet white,
indistinctly browner along the outer edge of the metapodials. Tail well
haired, black above and white below.
Skull very like that of the smaller mainland form of P. trinitatis [P.

ness of muzzle that characterizes that animal. Supraorbital ridges heav-
