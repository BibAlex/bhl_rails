(Jharactern. — In winter pela.iie (svimmer coat not seen) externally simi-
lar to Lepus timidus Linmeus. Skull and teeth smaller and much less,
robust than in the Swedish animal.
Color. — The winter pelage is pure white Ihrouijhout, to base of hairs,
though visually with an inconspicuous si:)rinkling of black hairs on back
and tail. Ears faintly clouded with grayish brown along anterior mar-
gin, and conspicuously tipped with black. The black ai-ea is about 12
mm. in width, but its bovindaries are not clearly defined, and it is notice-
ably si^rinkled with white hairs. A very narrow line of short black
hairs borders the eyelids. "Whiskers mixed white and black. Soles of
feet yellowish brown. Claws rather dark horn-color.
Skr/ll. — The skull of Lepun r.arronix is readily distinguishable from
that of L. tiinidnx by its much smaller size. In fully adult males of the
alpine hare the skull is barely larger than in females from the Helsing-
land, Sweden, while as compared with males from the same locality the
basal length is about 12 mm. less. Aside from its size the skull shows
numerous differences in form. It is in general less robust and more
slender, particularly in the rostral portion. The supraorbital processes
are smaller and narrower than in the Swedish animal, a difference
which is especially noticeable when skulls of males are compared, but
which is also evident in the females. The audital bullH' are relatively
a trifle smaller than in Lepus tiinulux and the cribriform portion of the
tloor of the braincase immediately in front of each is less liattened.
Teeth. — The teeth are smaller than in Lepiix tiiiiidv!<, but I can detect
no tangible differences in form.

SpecimeiiK e.vdj/uned. — Five, all from the C-anton of tJraubiinden.
Jiema7'k.>(. — The Alpine haro differs from the varying hares of northern
Europe in the characters that would be expected to result from its rela-
tively limited range and the less favorable conditions under which it
doubt less exists.
■^Measurements in parenthesis are those of an adult male f.epus timi-
dus from Helsinghind. Sweden.
