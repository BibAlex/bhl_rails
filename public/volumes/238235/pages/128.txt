GENERAL NOTES.
The bat genus Pteronotus renamed Dermonotus.
In lsl.5, Rafinesqup, in his 'Analyse de la Nature' (p. 54), substituted
Pteronotus in place of Pteropvti, apparently simply because he did not
like the latter name. Of course there was no justification for such a
procedure and Pteronotiifi is a pure synonym of Ptrropus. Nevertheless,
the name was given and consequently its use for another genus pre-
cluded. However, (iray gave the same name in 1S:]8 to a genus of
Phyllostomoid bats, not knowing of its previous use by Rafinesque. As
no other has been given to exactly the same type, a new one must be
substituted and Dermonotus is appropriate, referring to the extension of
the skin of the wings and interfemoral membrane upon the back.
Those mammalogists who rank Pteronotus and f'hilont/rteris as sections
of one comprehensive genus for which the latter name has been used
will be more reconciled to the change when they consider that a less
serious one will be entailed. It has been generally overlooked that
Pteronotus was published a year earlier than f'/rilonyrteris (1838 instead
of 1839) and consetiuently that name would have to be used instead of
C/iiloni/rterts, generally employed for the genus. An examination of the
types of the two genera has led me to believe that the two groups should
be regarded as generically distinct, if current views as to generic differ-
entiation are to be adopted. — T/ieodore Gill.
An addition to the avifauna of the United States.
During the summers of 1892 and 1893, when accompanying the party
then engaged in surveying and re-marking the boundary line between
Mexico and the United States, Mr. Frank X. Ilolzner and I found the
