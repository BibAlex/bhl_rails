A NP:\V species of GALICTIS from MEXICO.
BY E. W. NELSON.
Galictis canaster new specios. Yucatan Grison.
Dutribiition. — Known only from Tunkas, northern Yucatan, Mexico.
Specif c rh((r(tet('rii. — Face and entire underparts includini;' feet and
jejis blacl<; black area of face limited posteriorly by a well defined pure
white stripe extending across forehead above eyes and reaching back
across each cheek, covering front of ears, and thence along sides of neck
becoming obsolete near shoulders; rest of upper side of head shading
gradually back from the pure white stripe into the general smoky gray
of upperparts, including tail: underfur on upperparts light gray: long
hairs same color at base with broad subterminal black bands and white
tips. The black bands on the long hairs produce the elTect of a thin
dark wash over the pale under color.
Size (tiid proportions. — Total length (estimated) between G50 and 700
millimeters. A powerfully built, short legged, heavy bodied animal
with short round ears like Galirtis rittoto, but exceeding it in size.
Bemorkii. — The species described above is closely related to GalictiK
vittdta, agreeing with it generally in proportions and in the charac-
teristic pattern of coloration. The most striking dilTerence between
the two animals is in the color of the upperparts. The hairs on the
back of (hdictu rittata from Guiana and Brazil are described as being-
dark brown or yellowish gray with white or yellowish tips. GaKctin
canaster has the underfvir and basal half of the long hairs of the back
light gray, the long hairs have broad subterminal bands of black and
small white tips.
The northermost references I have been able to find for Galictw vittata
(the only species commonly recognized in the restricted genus Gulictis)
