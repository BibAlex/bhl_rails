1077. Carex nigromarginata Schwein.
Ravine. Linnaean Hill road.
1030a. Carex conjuncta Hoott.
Potomac Hals, spriii;;- of li)00 and llMil.
*I030<\ Carex gravida Baile)-.
Monument ground in grass, May 23, 1898: also May, 1901, doubtless
introduced. Professor Wheeler observes: "While your plant is not quite
so robust as this spcjL^s from Illinois and Iowa, I cannot put it any-
where else."
*i030(/'. Carex xanthocarpa Hiclvnell.
Near Fourteenth street extended, May 28, 1900; South Arliugton. May
30, 1900; beyond Eckington, June 10, 1900. Seldom very yellow in
color. Grows both in wet and in comparatively dry ground, but more
vigorously in the former. Its discovery here extends the known ranj.'e.
Professor Wheeler thinks our plant may be var. (inurcte/i.s Hicknell.
*i040i. Carex setacea Dewey.
Slope above Canal road, .Tune 1.5, 1900; so determined by Professor
Wheeler. An extension of the known range.
1037a. Carex retroflexa Muhl.
Seven Locks, May 9, 1898, very young. Also, Little Falls on the Vir-
ginia side, in the woods above Georgetown, and on Linnaean Hill road.
1034. Carex Leavenworthii Dewey. {C. cephalopJiora angustifolia of
Ward's Flora).
Specimens thus named by Professor Wheeler w^ere collected near Kalo-
rama Heights, May 2(5, 1899. He notes that the perigynia surely indi-
cate this species, although the specimens are taller than usual and have
not the bracts which are commonly, though not always present. The
bracts are present in specimens retained by me. Since communicating
with Professor Wheeler I have re-collected this plant (Mount Vernon,
May 30, 1901; original locality, June 8), and have also collected the
species, of normal size, in the grass near the Monument, where it is well
established, having doubtless been introduced in grass seed, I can find
no material difference between the forms except in the length of the
culms, which in our possibly native plant is often 2, sometimes even 3,
feet, but in the Monument ground plant does not exceed 16 inches.
The narrow leaves and smaller heads set the species apart from our very
abundant ceflialopliora.
1035&. Carex Atlantica Hailey.
Common in boggy places. This is probably the C. xidluhda of Ward's
Flora.
*i035r. Carex interior Bailey.
Wet ground, Glen Echo Heights, May IG, 1897; Feeder Dam, May 21,
1898; Mount Vernon, May 30, 1901.
*I035(?. Carex interior capillacea Bailey.
Bog east of Anacostia road south of Beaver Dam Branch, June 3,
1900. An extension of the known range.
