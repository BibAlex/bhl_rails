FIFTH LIST OF ADDITIONS TO THE FLORA OF
WASHINGTON, D. C.
BY THEO. HOLM.
Five years have elapsed since the publication of my fourth
list of additions to the local flora,* and it will be seen from the
present paper that these five years of research have materially
added to the nv;mber of species hitherto known to occur in the
vicinity of Washington, in addition to which I have been able
to record an extended range of many of the rarer species, for-
merly known from only a very few localities.
Through Dr. E. L. Greene's painstaking studies of various
genera, more particularly of Antennaria, Viola, GerarcUa, etc.,
these genera now appear to contain a number of excellent
species, which formerly had been entirely overlooked or more
or less confused; some of these species have even proved to be
very common within the District of Columbia. In order to
facilitate the use of this additional list, I have, with only a very
few exceptions, followed the nomenclature and aiTangement of
the orders as in the previously published additions, these hav-
ing been arranged in conformity with the fundamental work on
the Flora, Lester F. Ward's "Guide to the Flora of Washing-
ton and Vicinity, "f
