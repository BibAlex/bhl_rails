THE GENERIC NAMES MYRMECOPHAGA AND
TAMANDUA, AND THE SPECIFIC NAMES
OF THE OPOSSUMS OF THE
GENUS DIDELPHIS.
BY J. A. ALLEN.
In the 'American Naturalist"' for February, 1901 (pp. 143-
145), Mr. Oldiield Thomas refers to recent articles by Mr. Rehn
and myself concerning the names Myrmecopliaga and iJufel-
p/tifi. Without going into the matter with sufficient care I as-
sented* to Mr. Rehn's contention f that the Linna'an Mi/rme-
c(ipli<i<j<i was not tenable for the (ireat Anteater, known as
Myntu^copliiiiia juhdta Linn., but I have to confess that I had
not access to Marcgrave, and gave the matter only passing at-
tention, as \\\y special question at the time was the status of the
genus Dideljilnx. As Mr. Thomas has shown, ^fi/rtiitroplKK/d
is perfectly tenable for the (rreat Anteater, and its proper
specific name is trl<l(icti/Iii Linn. J 7.38 {jnlxitu Linn. ITiUi). In
concluding his notice of ^li/nii<'C(>/)li<ui<i, he says: ''As a re-
sult I claim that Mtjnn(^<'(>j>/i(i<ja trhhirti/hi Linn, should be tlie
name for the Great Anteater, l^roleptes and Cyclopes remaining
as before for the other genera of the family.""
