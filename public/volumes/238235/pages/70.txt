At the rrquefst of Profeissor C V. Piper, of Pullman, Wash-
ington, I publish at this time a description of a Juncus from
the Columbia Plains, which belongs to the difficult and perplex-
ing group of which Watson's Jinirux /ifivtde/isis is the best
known representative.

much slenderer above, with 1 or 2 or rarely :{ leaves: basal leaves few,
sheaths with broad membranaceous margins, auricles conspicuous, 2 to IJ
mm. lony, and blades terete, sometimes 20 cm. in lenjith, inconspicu-
