TilP: EARLIEST GENERIC NAME OF THE NORTHERN
FUR SEAL.
HY T. S. PALMER.
Nine years ago I pfoposed CaUotdrid'^ as a substitute for Val-
lorhimis Gray, 1859, on the ground that the hitter name was
preoccupied by .6V//?>Am?/5 Blanchard, 1850, a genus of Coleop-
tera. Further investigation shows that Callorhimis was not,
as commonly supposed, the first generic name applied to the
northern fur seal, but that it was antedated more than forty
years by Otoes G. Fischer. The latter name appeared in ISlYf
in a publication which is not generally accessible, and the de-
scription of this genus is therefore repi'oduced in full below:
Ofix'-s. Fisch. ab cordjeic. auritus. Otaries Peron. Les phoques a
ureilles. Cuv. Regne an. I, p. 1(36.
Incisivi quatuor utrinque biacuminati, superiores exteriores simplices
et minores. inferiores furcati, molares coiiici. Auriculae distinctae.
Phot' a jubalii, ursina, Lin. Gmel.
Reference to the Regne Animal which also appeared in 1817,
the same year in which this description was published, shows
that Cuvier recognized a group of eared seals under the designa-
tion 'Les Phoques a oreilles exterieures', which he suggested
