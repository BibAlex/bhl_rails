are Guiana and northern Brazil. The captvire of a member of the
group in Yucatan adds greatly to its known range and no doubt indi-
cates that it is represented, although hitherto overlooked, in much of
the intervening region.
The interesting animal upon which the present description is based
was captured alive by the Indians near Tunkas, Yucatan, and sent to
General Canton, Governor of the Stale. While in Merida. Yucatan, I
heard of a strange animal in the Governor's possession and upon making
known my desire to see it was courteously invited to visit his house for
the purpose. There I found the animal living in a cage and made the
accompanying description of its size and color. Later, while working
at Tunkas, the Indians told me of its capture and said it was extremely
rare. They called it 'El Rey de hts ArdiUax,' or king of the squirrels,
but it appeared to have been previously unknown to nearly everyone
with whom I talked.
