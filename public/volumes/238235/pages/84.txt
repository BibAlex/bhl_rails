A NEW BROCKET FROM YUCATAN .MJI*- > 8 «♦ * '*
BY C. HART MERRIAM.
One of the most surprising- discoveries made by Nelson and
Goldman in their recent exj)lorations in Yucatan and Campeclie
is a new species of Brocket. The animal ditt'ers totally in
color from Mazumn sfirto)-ii, the only known species from Mex-
ico and Central America, being grayish or drab instead of red.
That so large an animal should remain so long unknown to nat-
uralists is probably due to its habit of living in dense under-
growth in the arid tropical forests, where it is rarely seen, even
by the natives. Two specimens were obtained: an adult male
from Tunkas, Yucatan, an<l an adult female from Apazote,
Campeche. The relationship of the sjtecies to J1/. jtituorivagus
of South America, T am unal)h" to determine froju lack of
specimens. The new animal, however, is decidedly larger than
ne)norir(i<ji(fi. It may be known l)y the following description:
