44 Miller — Five Neio Shrev^s from Europe.
Meatnirements. — External measurements of type specimen: total len.iilh,
131; head and body, 76: tail vertebras, 55; hind foot, IG (14). Average
and extremes of ten specimens from the type locality: total length, 12ri
(118-181); tail vertebrte, 52.5 (47-57): hind foot, 14.S (14-l(i): hind foot
without claws, 13.3 (13-14).
Specimens examined. — Seventy-live, from the following localities in
Switzerland: Andermatt, 48; Briinig, 9; Meiringen, 18.
Remarks. — On comparing the series of Swiss shrews with a somewhat
greater number of true Sore.i' arancus from Upsala, Sweden, taken by
the same collector, the differences between the two races are so apparent
as to call for no special comparisons beyond those already given.
Twenty shrews from eastern Norway collected by Miss Thora Stejne-
ger, mostly in the vicinity of Bergen, represent a large animal quite dis-
tinct from the Sorex araneus araneus of southeastern Sweden, and mxich
resembling *S. araneus alticola. Ten specimens give the following aver-
ages: total length, 127 (116)*; tail vertebrae, 49 (39); hind foot, 16.2 (14):
hind foot without claws, — (12.7). It will be seen that the Norwegian
shrew exceeds both true araneus and alticola in length of hind foot, but
that the tail, while longer than in the Swedish animal, is not quite
equal to that of the Swiss form. Unfortunately the Norwegian speci-
mens are all in the summer coat, and all are so old that the teeth are too
much worn to show the pigmentation. The status of the animal there-
fore cannot be satisfactorily determined.
Snrev araneus euronotus subsp. nov.
I'ype. — Adult male (skin and skull) No. 101,321 United States National
Museum. Collected at Montrejeau, Hautes Pyrenees, P'rance (in foot-
hills of Pyrenees), July S, 1899, by Robert T. Young. Original number,
Characters. — Size slightly less than that of true Sorer araneus; color
(in Slimmer pelage), more brown, particularly on underparts.
Color. — The colors are essentially as in the summer pelage of Sore.r
araneus araneus and jS. araneus alticola except that the browns are darker
and the belly is heavily washed with wood-brown. The tricolored pat-
tern though visible is less distinct than in the other races.
SJcvll and teeth. — Skull as in Sorex araneus araneus, but slightly though
constantly smaller, and with less inflated braincase. Teeth as in the
typical form but smaller and somewhat more heavily pigmented.
Measurements. — External measurements of type: total length, 122;
head and body, 78; tail vertebrw, 44; hind foot, 13.5 (12.5). Average
and extremes of nine specimens from the type locality: total length, 114
(107-117); tail vertebn«, 42(37-44); hind foot, 13.8 (13.5-15): hind foot
without claw.s, 12.8 (12.5-14).
Specimens examined. — Nine, all from the type locality.
*Measurements in parenthesis are those of a corresponding number of
Sorex araneus from T^psala, taken at random from the large number at
hand.
