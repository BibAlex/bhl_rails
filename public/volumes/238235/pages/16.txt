RIBES COLORADENSE, AN UNDESCRIBED CURRANT
FROM THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS OF
COLORADO.
BY FREDERICK V. COVILLE.
Several months ago in examining a collection of Ribes made
by Mr. C. L. Shear in Colorado in 1896 and 1897, I found a
fruiting specimen of the Rocky Mountain plant that has hith-
erto been identified by botanists with the species of the eastern
United States, Ji. prosfrafiwi L'Her. The specimen had, how-
ever, black instead of red fruit, and on a critical examination
other differences were developed. A search in the herbarium
brought to light a few other specimens of this plant, in flower
as well as in fruit, which have furnished excellent material for
description, but the surprising fact was developed that the
fruiting specimens on the type sheet of Bibes icolfii Rothr.,
which is in the National Herbarium, were identical with our
plant. It became necessary, therefore, to make a critical ex-
amination of Dr. Rothrock's species.
liihes loolfil* was described from specimens collected in Col-
orado, those in flower from Mosquito Pass, those in fruit from
*Rothrock, Am. Nat. 8 :358. 1874.
