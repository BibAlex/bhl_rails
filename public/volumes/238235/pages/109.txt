miglit prove to be generically distiiiet. In this group he placed
Phoca juhdiii Gmelin and P. iirsitui Graelin. Phvru jnhata
Gmelin is a composite species based in part on a southern fur
seal and in part on the northern sea lion, Leo marinns of Steller
= Kximetopias stelleri of recent authors. The name had been,
however, previously applied by Forster, in 17 75, and is now
generally restricted to the southern fur seal. Phoca nrsinH
Gmelin (= P. ursina Linn.), is the northern fur seal of Bering
Sea and, as the only identifiable species in the group, may be
considered the type of (Hoes.
It may be objected that Fischer did not name the northern
fur seal, but merely applied a generic name to the eared seals in
general or renamed Otaria of Peron. This, however, was not
the case. Peron's Otaria had appeared only the year previous,
and there is no evidence that Fischer had ever seen the descrip-
tion. What he did was simply to apply a generic name to
Cuvier's group which, as shown above, was based chietiy on
the northern and not on the southern fur seal.
Three different generic names are now applied to the northern
fur seal: Qdlotaria, Callorhiaus and Arctocejyhalas*. The
general adoption of Otoes would obviate this confusion, and the
species thus far described would stand Otoes arsi/itis (Linnams),
Otoes edascanxs (Jordan & Glark), and Otoes cari/ensis (Jordan
& Clark).

type of ArctocepJadux Cuvier. 182G, as PJioca ursina.
