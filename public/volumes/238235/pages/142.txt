A NEW WHITE-FOOTED MOL^SE FROM CALIFORNIA.
BY WILFRED H. OSGOOD.
The mouse here described is a slightly characterized form of the
'■axisterus-canadensis group' which is oue of several in the genus
Peromyscus well known to be very much in need of thorough
revision. Until such revision can be made it seems best to
treat this form as a subspecies of Peromyscus oreas*' which is
apparently its nearest relative. It occupies the humid coast
strip of northern California, having a range coinciding with
that of a number of mammals and birds belonging to groups
which reach their highest development farther north. It is
thus the only member of the a ifstenrs-canadensis group found
within the State of Californi;i.
