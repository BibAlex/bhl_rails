case, however, is different with CdUomijs D'Orbigny and Geof-
froy Saint-Hi laire mentioned above.
The authors of this genus included in it three species only,
namely, Callomys viscaccia, Callomys laniger, and Ccdlomys
aureus. The first had already been assigned to the genus Ms-
caccia by Schinz, and upon the second the name CldnchiUa had
been bestowed by Brooks. This leaves the Callomys aureus
only for consideration. Callomys aureus is based on furrier's
skins, lacking the feet, the ears and the tail, and, of course, the
skull; consequently the species may be treated as indetermina-
ble and consequently Callomys is indeterminable. Waterhouse
and others have considered Callomys aurexis as referable to the
genus Lagidium, but it would seem an unwarranted jjroceeding
to displace Lagidium with the name Callomys on the basis of a
species so imperfectly described as C. aureus. It hence seems
proper to recognize for the three genera of the Chinchillidm the
names Viscaccia., Chinchilla, and Lagidimn.
