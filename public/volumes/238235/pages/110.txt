The fonn of Peroynathits falla.r inhabiting the eastern or
desert slopes of the mountains of Riverside and San Diego
counties, California, and thence southward along the eastern
slope of the Coast Range into Lower California, is almost as
pallid as the j»ocketmouse of the Colorado Desert which Mr.
Osgood named Perognathns penicillahts (iiigKstirostrls. The
niixae fdllav, in a subspecific sense is here restricted to the ani-
mal of the coastal region, although the type and series of topo-
types, from Reche Canyon, three miles southeast of Colton, San
Bernardino County, California, are almost exactly intermediate
between it and the desert race. The darkest individuals ex-
amined are from Rose Canyon and San Pasqual Valley, on the
western border of San Diego County.
