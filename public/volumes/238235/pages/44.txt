A NEW DEER FROM COSTA RICA.* ^*
BY GERRIT S. MILLER, Jr. ' ^ ^
In the original description of his Cariactis clavatvs,\ the
Odocoileus truei of Merriam, from the Segovia River J, eastern
Hondui-as, Dr. F. W. True recorded seven Costa Rican deer
in the National Museum collection, which though of unusually
large size, he regarded as not separable from the Honduras ani-
mal. The differences between the deer of the two regions are
so constant, however, that it now seems preferable to recognize
the Costa Rican form as distinct. It may be known as:
Odocoileus costaricensis sp. nov.
Type. — Young adult male (skin and skull) No. y^fff United States
National Museum. § Collected in Talamanca, on the eastern side of Costa
Rica, between the coast and the foot of the Cordilleras, by .Tose C. Zele-
don, durinjj the latter part of 1872 or early in 1873.
Characters. — Considerably larger than Odocoileus truei Merriam, and
general color lighter and more grizzled, particularly on sides of body.
Skull and teeth vmiformly larger and more robust than in the Honduras
animal. Antlers heavier and more rugose.

|Mr. Chas. H. Townsend who collected the original specimens informs
me that they were taken in the open pine lands about .50 miles above
the mouth of the river.
^Permanent dentition in place, but teeth practically unworn.
