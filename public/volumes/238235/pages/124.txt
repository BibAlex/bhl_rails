Compiiriaon <nul i-nt/iial tinii!<iirf>i/nif.'<. —VAWoi's account ot the cranial
characters of Fidi« tifr<( Fischer,- based on specimen No. 1226, British
Museum Collection (locality not given), contains, besides nonessentials,
the foUowiuii': "nasals are broad, and on a line with the processes of the
maxillas at their articulation with the frontal bone. * * * Au<litory
bulhe prominent, oblong: mastoid foramen of a triangular shape. Zy-
goma well arched. Canines moderate." No cranial measurements are
given. The skull of the type and only specimen of Felix f(isx(( fa differs
from the above in having the nasals bones narrow, audital bulhe pointed,
mastoid foramen oval, zygoma slightly arched, canines large. The
skull of 7^<'^/.v '/;>'/'7/f' is readily distinguished from that of F. foxxata by
the absence of a frontal fossa, the marked lateral constriction of the au-
dital bulla', the narrowness of the posterior narial fossa, and the small
size of the teeth. It is also noted that the infraorbital foramina are
double. The two species are of similar size. The following dimensions
of the type skull of Fdixfuxxatu are followed by those of the type of F.
