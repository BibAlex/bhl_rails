Allen, â€” Oertaia Generic and Specific JVcimes. 93
Opossum, named D. virginiana by Kerr in IV 92. This leaves
of the identifiable forms included under the original D. tnai-
suplalis Linn, the large Opossum of Mexico, namely the Tla-
cuatzin of Hernandez, to which the name marsupialis must evi-
dently restricted. As I), karkinophar/a has obtained some cur-
rency for the large Opossums of northeastern South America,
and as D. inryiiiia.t i has been currently accepted for the Opos-
sum of the United States, the present ruling very little disturbs
the nomenclature of the groujt. The restriction of J). nHirmi-
piolift to the large Mexican Opossum simply takes the place of
DiilelpJiiK cdlifoDiIca of Bennett, which as a specific designa-
tion has never had much currency.*
