Both were obtained by Aureliiis Todd. The type specimen is a woolly
fulvous animal with a large hairy blafl<ish tail and dark Tore and hind
feet. The other specimen is jiale bulif'y fulvous and seems to be a par-
tial albino. Compared with the type of P. lonyicaiKJux, P. alhipix differs
strikiii<:ly. the body being coarsely grizzled brownish bister, like an
ordinary field mouse (Mirrotiis), instead of fulvous, the feet white in-
stead of dark brown, the tail slender, scantily haired, and wiiite under-
neath, instead of large, hairy and blackish all round.
The skull of the type of lonriiniiidux is reduced to I'ragments but the
parts that remain agree essentially with corresponding parts of the .skull
from Meadows, Lane County. ( )regon (No. 42,()21 9). Compared with
the latter the .skull of (dbipcx differs markedly in greater length and
narrowness, less spreading zygomata, narrower and longer braincase,
longer rostrum and nasals, larger bulla', and longer interplerygoid fos,sa,
which is square anteriorly instead of rounded or angular.
