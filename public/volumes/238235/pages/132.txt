THE PROPER GENERIC NAMES OF THE VISCACHA,
CHINCHILLAS, AND THEIR ALLIES.
BY J. A. ALLEN.
In ;i recent paper entitled, 'The Name of the Viseacha"',* Mr.
Oldtield Thomas leaves in doubt the proper allocation of the
genus Callomi/s D'Orbigny and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. As
the application of the generic names given to the different
species of the Chinchillida? is involved in some obscurity, a
brief history of the case may serve to throw a little light on
some of the intricate points.
The first distinctive generic name applied to any member of
the group appears to be Viscaccia Schinz, given in 1825 to the
Viscacha of the pampas of the La Plata. The next in order is
the name LagostomKs, given by Brooks in 1828 to the same
animal, which name thus becomes a synonym of Viscaccia
Schinz. In 1829 Bennett used the name ChinchiUa in a generic
sense for the Chinchillas of the Chilian Andes. In 1830 Lich-
tenstein gave the name Oi'iomys also to the sanre animals. The
other of the three generic groups of this family was named
LagkUiim by Meyen in March, 1833, and Lagotis by Bennett
a few months later in the same year. Regarding the appli-
cation of these names there is, apparently, no question. The
