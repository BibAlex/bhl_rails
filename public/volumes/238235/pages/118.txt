lend to completely encircle liirht areas, and, loyether with tiie other
black marking's, are disposed as in F. /n rniiii<Ji-nii, but are very much
increased in si/.e. There is no light spot at the upper margin of the
nasal pad. Ears whitish cream-buff within, i)lack wilhoul, edged an-
teriorly with lawny, and with a large tawny spot on middle of black ex-
ternal surface. Tail irregularly spotted and banded with black, which
color greatly predominates. At base of tail, the light areas are tawny
above and white or gri/.zled below: terminal four or fi\e light rings,
hoary grayish, becoming successively narrower until obsolete towards
the tip, which is all black. Underparts butfy while, heavily banded
with elongate (not quadrate) black spots.
Skull lUid teeth. — Decidedly larger than /VZ/.s- nidrnlis^ the largest skull
equalling the smallest adult male of Felis onrd from South America.
Teeth larger than those of V. eentrnlix, smaller than in F. onra. The
premolar teeth are narrower than in South American jaguai's. The
skull as a whole, aside from general size, is much more heavily ossified
than in Felis mttnillK, in this respect being comparable with the South
American F. ot/i-d. from which it is geographically separatetl by the
range of F. rent rails.

liemark-s. — In true hernandtsll, from the arid region of Mazatlan, in
the State of Sinaloa. not only is the ground color paler, but the light
areas are increased in size at the expense of the black, giving a decided
pallor. The pailern of the tail marking's becomes evident in /lenfiatde-sii
through reduction of black, and appears as interrupted longitudinal
stripes on basal three-tifths of tail: grovmd color buff at base, darkest
above and whitish below, and the subterminal hoary bands more plainly
marked than in fjotdmo/tl.
