tail indistinctly bicolor, browni.sh dusky above, pale yellowish or whitish

('/■toiii'l r/iiiriicfci'.s. — Skull of medium size, willi rather spreading zygo-
mata, strongly set out and angled anteriorly: nasals broad, flattened,
ending about on plane of premaxilhe: incisive foramina rather large and
open.
EeiiKirkx. — Peroti/t/.'o'fix ciiziiintlii' appears to have no very close relative.
E.x'terually it resembles F. affinis Allen, but is darker and has thinner
ears and shorter tail. Cranially, however, it differs materially from any
species known to me. Compared with affinix it may be distinguished by
the broader and more s(pu\rely elbowed zygomata. Hatler and broader
braincase. broader nasals, slightly larger bulhe, and heavier teeth. The
incisive foramina show^ considerable variation. In most specimens they
are long- and their outer borders are evenly convex. In others they are
much nu)re broadly open and the outer bonier forms an angle at the
maxillo-premaxillary suture. In some specimens they are rather short.
