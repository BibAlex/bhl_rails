Tlie jag-uars of South America are readily disting-uijiliable
from the forms to the northward hy cranial and dental charac-
ters, as shown beyond.
The materials from South America in tlie collection of the
United States National Museum, including those of the Biolog-
ical Survey of the United States Department of Agriculture,
aggregating ten skulls and one mounted specimen, are insuffi-
cient for elucidating the southern foi-ms which, collectively,
represent the ^Felh o/ica Linnauis' of niodcM-n authors. Con-
sideral)le variation is observed in tlie skulls of eight males from
Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Parana. The largest of these
(No. 4128, U. S. National Museum) is from Paraguay, and
measures 24*2 mm. in basilar length (Hensel). The audital
bulhe are much flattened, with the space between them and the
mastoid and paroccipit il processes comj)letely tilled. The teeth
give the following measurements: crown of upper carnassial,
29 by 1.3. G mm.; crown of middle upper premolar, 20.3 by 11;
length of upi)er canine, from gunis, 43; length of incisor
series, measured on alveoli, 35. Compared with the above
specimen, the skull of No. 43G1, also collected by Captain T.
J. Page, U. S. N., at San Jose, Parana, measures only 212
nmi. in Imsilar length, but has relatively heavy dentition, the
