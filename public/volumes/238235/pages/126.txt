ON THE MAINLAND FORMS OF THE EASTERN
DEERMOUSE, PEBOMYSCUS LEVCOPUS
(RAFINESQUE).
BY EDGAR A. MEARNS.
Peromyscus leacoj^ns was originally described by Raiinesque
from specimens taken during a journey through ''the lower
parts of the Ohio, the Wabash, Green River, Barrens, Prairies,
and the states of Indiana, Illinois, &e." Kentucky is genei-al-
ly considered to be the type locality.* Specimens from Lex-
ington, Kentucky, collected by the writer and assumed to be
typical, are found to agree with those from other |»arts of the
austral zone east of the Mississippi River; but, in the transi-
tion zone, fairly well-marked geographical races occur in New
York and New England in the East, and in Minnesota in the
West. The range of the species does not extend beyond the
northern boun<lary of the transition zone, but meets with that
of Peronn/xrns (•diuidensis at the lower vi.V^v of the boreal zone.
In these forms, which may be recognized by the following de-
scriptions, the under surfaces are white with more or less gi'ay
