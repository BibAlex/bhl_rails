UG MUUr — A JVeir Slrrev from Siritzerldiid.
Skull (tiid teeth. — Although scarcely larger than that of Sorex minutui^,
the skull of Crocidnra mimvln retains the general form characteristic of
C. ritsxulii. The rostral portion, however, is relatively shorter and wider
than in the larger animal. In the type specimen the antorbital foramina
are larger and more conspicvious, particularly when the skull is viewed
from above, than in any of the specimens of C. riisxula with which I
have compared it.
Teeth as in Grccidura rui^sula, except for their noticeably smaller size.
Measurements. — External measurements of type: total length, 105;
head and body, 72: tail vertebrje, P>8: hind foot, 12 (11).
Cranial measurements of type: greatest length (exclusive of incisors),
16 (21):* greatest postorbital breadth. 7.8 (10): greatest antorbital
breadth, o.G (7); least interorbital breadth, 3.8 (4.4): mandible, 8.4 (11):
entire maxillary toothrow, 7.4 (9.4): entire mandibular toothrow. (i.S (9).
Sperimeii. e.vaiitined. — One the type.
Remarks. — Crocidura mimula requires no special comparison with C.
russula, as its size and the form of its skull serve to distinguish it at a
glance.
*Measurements in parenthesis are those of the skull of an adult female
Crocidura runsida from St. Gallen.
