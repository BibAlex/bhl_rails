Specimens examined. —Two skins and four extra skulls, all from Costa
Rica.
Remarks. — In addition to its larger size this species differs from Odo-
eoileiis truei in the distinctly speckled back and sides. In the smaller
animal the light subterminal bands on the back are broader and less
strongly contrasted with the dark tips, while on the sides this element
of the marking is so extended as to cover practically all of the visible
part of the hair. As a result the sides are uniformly colored, without
trace of grizzle. This condition is repeated in Odocoileus ihomasi, the
only species equalling 0. costaricensis in size.
