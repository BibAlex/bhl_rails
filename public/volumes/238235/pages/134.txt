NOTE ON THE NAMES OF A FEW SOUTH
AMERICAN MAMMALS.
HY J. A. ALLEN.
A recent ex.amination of G. Fischer's 'Zoognosia' (VoL III,
1814), shows that a number of the names currently attributed to
later authors originated with Fischer; also that a few of Fisch-
er's names for South American mammals antedate those of Wied
and Schinz. Among the former may be mentioned Felis eyro,
JSFasua rit/a, and N'asua fusca, usually attributed to Desniarest,
1820, but all date from Fischer 1814; also Dasypus villosus,
attributed to Desmarest 1819, dates from Fischer 1814. N'asua
fioeiah's Wied, 1826, is antedated by JVasua sociabilis Schinz,
182L
JJasypus cil/iati(s Fischer, 1814, antedates DasyitKs patagon-
icKS Demarest 1819. This species will consequently stand as
Zaedyus cilliatiis (G. Fischer).
A comparison of Schinz's 'Thierreich', 1821, with Wied's
'Reise nach Brasilien', 1822, and Wied's Beitriige zur Natur-
geschicte von Brasilien' (II, 1826) shows that Schinz was the
first to publish a number of the names attributed by him to
Wied, and since thus generally accredited. Ap])arently not
only Schinz, Kuhl, and Temminck had access to Wied's col-
lections but in many cases adopted and published his manu-
script names several years befoi-e Wied published them himself,
