TWO NEW SUBTEERANEAN CRUSTACEANS FROM
THE UNITED STATES.
P.Y W. P. HAY.
During a recent visit to the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky,
and Nickajack Cave in Tennessee, the writer was fortunate
enough to obtain from the former twelve specimens of a small
eyeless shrimp, and from the latter about as many specimens of
an Isopod crustacean belonging to the genus Cmcidotea Pack-
ard.
The shrimp on examination proves to be so distinct from all
the PahemoindiB hitherto described as to necessitate the erec-
tion of a new genus. The Isopod, as it came from the type
locality of Cmcidotea nlckajackensis Packard was at first
thought to be that species, but a careful comparison with Dr.
Packard's description and figures and with specimens of C
/tickajaekensis from wells at Metcalf, Georgia, shows that it is
distinct.
The new genus and the two new species may be desci-ibed as
follows:
Palsemonias "-en. nov.
Similar to Pakemonetes in form and in the absence of a mandibular
palpus. Gills four and a rudiment on each side. Rostrum long, slender
