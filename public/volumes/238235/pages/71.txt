.Jiiiicii.^ (■<ijn\)il)'i<iiinx differs from tvpical Californiaii .JimcKx
nevadensis in the paler color of its flowers, conijtaratively
Hhorter anthers, less well-defined beak of tlie capsule, and much
])aler seeds with nearly tAviee as many rows of areolae, always
trans-lineolate. The recently described Jhih-hs xnkt^dorfii Ryd-
berg* is another plant of the same group, more closely resem-
bling nevadensis than rohnnhiaxxtt. It is distinguishable from
the latter by its greater size and robustness, its height commonly
60 to iOO cm. and the annual growth of its rootstocks o to 10
cm., usually larger inflorescence, and almost always dark brown
longer perianth 4 to 5 mm. in length, anthers much longer than
the filaments (commonly 2 to 3 times as long), and body of the
capsule not plainly visible at maturity at the mouth of the
perianth, as is usual in columbianns.
