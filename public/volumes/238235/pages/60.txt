I022. Scleria triglomerata Michx.
Terra Cotta swamp, June 29, 189G. Seen since in Kenilworth swamp,
on Fairfax road south of Four J\Iile Run, and at Lakeland.
*io24Z*. Scleria reticularis pubescens Britlon.
Paint Branch swamps and north of Kenilworth. t)ther material from
the Brightwood swamp (August 16 and September 22, 1897) with thicker
culms and broader lea\ e;; may be S. Torreyann "Walp. Thus far I find
it very difficult to separate these species.
1024. Scleria pauciflora Muhl.
Addison Heights, C'lievy Chase, Glen Echo Heights, Anacostia road
north of Kenilworth. Takoma Park, and Lakeland.
1090. Carex lupulina Muhl.
I have a form from the woods bordering the river marsh at l^ennings
determined by Professor Wheeler as "the variety near var. peduiiculata
Dewey". The peduncle of the sterile head is over 3 inches long.
1094. Carex bullata Schk.
Formerly in the Brightwood Park swamp: common in the swamps
around Hyatts\ille.

Very common. A form from the Potomac flats has some of the
staminate heads fertile at the summit.
1087. Carex hystricina Muhl.
Canal at District line, May 28, 1897. Not common.
1085. Carex comosa Boott.
I failed to distinguish this from C. pseudo-cyperus until last season,
but specimens from the Potomac flats seem decisive.

1900.

Margin of bay, foot of seventeenth street. May 18, 1898; also north of
Berwyn. This is not to be confounded with the C. angustata of Ward's
catalogue, which is doubtless the typical C. strkta.
