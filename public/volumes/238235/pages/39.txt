Hah. La Guaira, Venezuela.
Type. Male. U. S. N. M., No. 102,731. Original number 81. Col-
lected 8th July, 1900 by Messrs. Lyon and Robinson. A paratype in
British Museum, No. 1.1.5.3, presented by the United States National
Museum.
This species is evidently closely allied to P. trinitntu and its conti-
nental representatives of P. uridii and P. minco'. It differs from all
three by its much paler color, and from the first and second by its nearly
white feet.
From P. centralis and allies it is also separated by the absence of pa-
rietal ridges, in which respect it approaches the Peruvian P. simonsi.
The paratype is rather more brown and less rufous than the type, sug-
gesting a specimen in a rather more youthful state of pelage.
