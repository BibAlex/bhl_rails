to the toes, those of the arms ami thiirhs measuring :50 to (>() millimeters
in diameter. Claws, horn color. Tail spotted and banded with black,
the intervening areas bein^r clay color or somewhat hoary nearest the
tip, which is broadly black. The upper side of tail has more black
than li,<iht. the under side havin<i- the black and clay-colored areas about
equal in amount. In the median line, above, each li.srht rini.' has a black
spot, and the last pale rings are mixed with black hairs. There are
three subterminal bands of solid black above, the more proximal ones
being interrupted. On the under side of tail the pattern is confused
and the light areas whitish. Underparts buft'y white, heavily blotched
with black. Under side of body with a median chain of small black
spots, anil two rows of somewhat (luadrate black blotches on either side,
the spots averaging about fifty millimeters in diameter. On the under
side of neck and head, the black spots, which are much smaller than
those on the chest and abdomen, tend to form transverse chains, while
those of the cheeks and niu/.zle are arranged in longiludinal series.
The flat skin of a jaguar taken about 1(X) miles up the Segovia River,
which forms the boundary between Nicaragua and Honduras, killed by
Mr. Charles H. Townsend of the United States Fish Commission, closely
resembles the specimen from Costa Kica just described, differing in be-
ing slightly more intense in coloring, the vertebral spots coalescing so
that an interrupted median dorsal stripe is formed: and some spots in
the lateral rows are tilled with black, others having the rosettes elon-
gated and resembling llie outline of the animars hind foot, small blTick
spots suggesting the pads or tuberch^s. in general, the two may be con-
sidered to be identical.
