Oil t'()m))arisi)ii of the very distinct iieM' species of eyra cat
here described as TeUa fossato with the descriptions of Felis
eyra Fischer (1814, based on Azara), the former was found to
be a much larger animal, the bare skull measuring one-lialf inch
more in length than the entire head of FeltK fi/r<i, according to
the measurements given l)y Dr. J. R. Rengger,* an extremely
careful naturalist. Rengger's external measurements of eyra
cats from Paraguay are slightly greater than those given by
Azara. The animal described and figured by Baird as I'^lh
eyra,\ belonged to a species as large as Fdis fossata^ conse-
quently much larger than FeVis eyra Fischer. The Avater-color
drawing, taken from Dr. Berlandier's original, from which
Baird's colored figure was reproduced, depicts the animal "as a
uniform light reddish-brown, without any spots whatever, and
