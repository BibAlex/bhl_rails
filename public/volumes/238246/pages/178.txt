Fig. 4.
Only for rotation III ( — . — . — .) we find a combined reaction of
the obliqni and the two recti.
P'rom this we may safely conclnde that, at rotation 1 the labyrinths
influence almost exclusively the obliqni, at rotation II almost exclu-
sively the rectus superior and inferior and at rotation III all four
eye-muscles.
We cannot yet enter into details about the curves, but will do
so afterwards, when determining how far the tonic reflexes of
the labyrinth on the eye depend on definite parts of the labyrinth
special of the otolithes. Be it sufficient to indicate here that for the
oblique eye-muscles the curve of rotation I shows an asymmetric
course, whereas for the rectal eye-strings the same thing takes place
at rotation II.
The exactitude of the former definitions and the measurements
now performed, may be derived from the comparison of the corre-
sponding points on the different curves.
For the three different rotations namely, it occurred several times
that the same potition of the iiead was reached from different
directions. The curve shows that, notwithstanding this, the lengths
found for the eye-muscles agree wonderfully.
Corresponding points are among others:
Normal position. Rotation I No. L and 25. Rotation II No. 1
and 25.
Back position. Rotation I No. 13. Rotation II No. 13.
Side position (Left). Rotation II No. 19. Rotation III No. 1.
Side position (Right). Rotation II No. 7. Rotation III No. 13.
Muzzle upwards. Rotation I No. 19. Rotation III No. 19.
Muzzle downwards. Rotation I No. 7. Rotation III No. 7.
For all these positions the four eye-muscles measured have almost
exactly the same length.
Conclusions.
From this and the inquiiy published before we may conclnde
