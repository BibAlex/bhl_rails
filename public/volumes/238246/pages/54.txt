mixture is allowed to remain overnight, then it is poured into
water, taken up in ether and washed with a soda-solution. After
drying and evaporating the ether, the diaeetate amount can be
determined by saponilieation. This proved to be 40 7«- Then the oil
is saponified with ratlier more than the theoretical quantity of alco-
holic potassium and distilled in vacuum. By fractionation we can
separate into:

Both methylene ether and glycol are saturated as regards a solu-
tion of bromine in CCl^, but while the methylene ether does not
react with a solution of ethylmagnesiumbromide in ether at a normal
temperature, the glycol immediately reacts. If toluol is added, i-aising
the temperature to 100°, the methylene ether reacts exceedingly
violently with the Grignard solution. The fact that the glycol
yields a diacetate when boiled with acetic acidanhydride and sodium-
acetate is a proof of its two primary alcoholgroups, the isomeric-
glycol, which might arise from the reaction between formaldehyde and
the (/ = C-group of the styrol, wouhl be a secondary-primai'y glycol
with the phenylgroup attached to the secondary carbon atom and
in the above-mentioned circumstances it would certainly lose water
