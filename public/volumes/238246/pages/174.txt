Tlie first term for q = i ... 4 gives the inequalities of group II,
and for q^5 it represents tlie libration. The second term for
q = 1 ... 4c represents the equations of the centre.

For q = 5 this term is better written in the form
— è {<^i5 + C'i5 ) f 5 COS {li — If's)
+ (c/5 + c'ib) f 5 sin (li — if-5).
Tt then represents, like the third term for all values of q, small
periodic inequalities, v^^hose periods differ little from that of . the
equations of the centres.
It should be pointed out that the theory here given (intermediary
orbit and variations) covers the same ground as Souillart's, with the
exception of the small periodic perturbations and the terms of very
long period arising from the action of the sun, Saturn, etc. Souillart
does not give any term of the perturbative function, nor any inter-
action of two terms leading to a term of higher order, which is
not taken into account here too; and he omits many terms which
are included here. Tlie above theory is certainly complete up to the
numerical limit of accuracy which was fixed beforehand. This can
certainly not be said of Souillart's theory, though it generally gives
many more decimals. The new theory has proved eminently suitable
for numerical computation.
