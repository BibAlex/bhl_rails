Consider tlie determinant consisling- of the elements of tlie tirst
live rows and columns. This can he conceived to be the result of
tlie elimination of //( from the linear equations
^j i'^j Vj — i^' yi = (^./ = 1 • • . 5)
where Fi j is the element of the /^'' row and the /"''' column.
The new unknowns /// are connected with the original unknowns
c' i and c"i of the equations (27) bj the relations:
<•/ = yi - e/ y,, (« = 1 . . . 4)
^" = y. -f 2r/„
<^i' = yv
< = y.'
To each of the five roots |3\y corresponds a set ?/,y (f =r 1 . . . 5).
Then y^, y^ and y^ are determined by
^j J^'ij yj -^'yi = 0. (i = 1 . . . 5, / = 6 . . 8)
We now determine .j-, from
Fi5 + 2 J xj Fij - xi i^'55 = 0,
and we put
Fij = Fij-xiFr,j, (i,;=1...4)
and
yi = zi + Xi y,. (t = I . . . 4)
Then zi and ^^ are determined by the equations
(«) 2j F'ij zj - 13" Zi = 0, (i,i = 1 ... 4)
and y^ is given bj'
^J ^5,- ^i + (n5 - n y5 = 0. (i rr: 1 . . . 4)
This determines four roots ^^'. The fifth is given by
^.' = F\,.
and the corresponding values of Zi and y^ are
3/55— 1 , ^^5 = 0. (ir=l,..4)
To solve the equations {a) we take z^q^A. Since the coefïicients
of the diagonal F'a are much larger than the others, we can take
^\ = Fqq^-%q
— -^W I
i^ qq — t^ XI
Then the quantities tq and mq are small, and we easily find a
set of equations from which they can be conveniently determined.
