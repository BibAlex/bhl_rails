Chemistry. — ''On the Condensation of Formaldehyde loitk some
Unsaturated Compounds." By H. J. Prins. (Communicated by
Prof. J. Böeseken).
(^Communicated in the meeting of May 3, 1919).
Some time ago ^) the author discussed the mutual condensation of
unsaturated compounds, examining the condensation of formaldehyde
with sty rol, anethol, isosafrol, pinene, d. limonene, camphene and
cedrene. The condensation was effected either by warming the compo-
'nents in acetic acid solution, or by sulphuric acid in an aqueous or
acetic acid solution. For the aqueous solutions we availed ourselves
of the 407o solution as supplied by the trade, the acetic acid solution
was obtained by warming trioxymethylene in acetic acid with or
without the presence of sulphuric acid.
The aqueous and acetic acid solutions of sulphuric acid and formalde-
hyde behave differently as regards certain compounds, styrol, cam-
phene and cedrene react but extremely slowly or not at all with
the aqueous solution whereas anethol and isasofrol do react.
Contrary to isosafrol safrol does not affect an aqueous solution.
It many be assumed, that the reaction begins with an addition of
the CO group to the C = C group, so that primarily a four-ring
is formed.

The four-ring can now :
1. absorb water and form a 1.3 glycol: R.H.C— CHOH.R

2. absorb formaldehyde and form a methylene ether:
