f'{z) converges also. If 6' denotes a circle situated witliin z <^a,
with centre z^, then /'* (c,, z) converges quasi-iiniformij within C.
This function is continuous in C and for 2: ^ 2^, coincides with ƒ '(^).
In consequence of the quasi-uniform convergence the limiting function

is also continuous within 6'. Tljis limiting function is " '

Hence

whence it follows that ƒ ' (^rj does exist and ƒ' (^J =: /mj ƒ' (^J. Since

z^ may be chosen arbitrarily within \z\ <^ a the theorem is hereby
established.

In consequence of ƒ being convergent f^{x,y) converges to

converges to a function which, since ƒ is analytical, is also every-

10. The theorems of $ 8 and 9 may be resumed concisely as follows :
A necessary and sufficient condition that it should be permitted to
diferentiate terniwise a convergent series of analytical functions is
the quasi-uniform convergence of the series 2 f* {x,y).
