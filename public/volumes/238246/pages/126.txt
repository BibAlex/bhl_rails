12. In the null-sjstem (C,c) P has a null curve of order (5?i— 8)
with node P (§ 7). Of its intersections with the null curve with
respect to the system {F,f), 10 lie in P. They also have the uni-
cuspidal points U in common, for which the tangent u passes through
P. In each of the remaining (5;i— 8)'— 10— (10;z' — 25?^4-J2) inter-
sections G, a cuspidal curve has with its tangent g four points in
common. From this it ensues that t/ie four-point cuspidal tangents
envelop a curve of class (15?i' — 55;i-l-42).
If n is equal to three, the curves y' with four-point tangents are
replaced by conies, each with one of its tangents. The null-system
{F,f) then has the characteristic numbers 5 and 2 ; the null-curve
{Py of P is of class 22, consequently sends 12 tangents ƒ through
P, and each of these straight lines forms with the conic touching it
a y' with four-point tangent. In confoi'mity with this, the form
15n* — 55?2-|-42 produces for n^=^ the number 12.
13. In a quintuple infinite system 5*^5) each point D is node for
a net of nodal curves. A straight line (/ passing through D deter-
mines in it a pencil, of which all &' touch at d in D. There is
consequently one cuspidal y", which has a straight line c passing
through D as cuspidal tangent. The curves y", with cusp D, form
a system with index two, for the curves (i^, passing through any
point P, form a pencil, which contains two curves with cusp in D.
If every straight line c passing through D is made to intersect with
the cuspidal y", which it touches in D, there evidently arises a
curve of order {n-\-2), which has a quintuple point in D. From this
it ensues that jive cuspidal curves have in D a cusp, where the
cuspidal tangent has a four-point contact.
I shall now consider the nidl-systeni {G,g), in which to a point G
are associated the five straight lines g, which are four-point cuspidal
tangents for cuspidal cui-ves y" with cusp G.
14. In each point C of the straight line a I consider the cuspidal
curve y", which sends its tangent c through P, and determine the
locus of the points E, which y" has still in common with PC. If
E lies in P, y" belongs to a system aS^^). j^ j^ (5^ — g) curves y"
occur, which have their cusp on a (^ 7). So the curve {E) passes
(5/i — 8) times through P and is of order {'on — 11). In each of its
intersections G with a, a y" has four points in common with PG.
The null-curve of P is therefore of oixler (6;^ — 11). As it has a
quintuple point in P, a straight line g passing through P is null-
ray for (6/2 — 16) points G.
