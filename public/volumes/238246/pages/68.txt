Explanation of table I:
In this table 6(0,/) calculated for the values of cos i is given in the first column
for three different values of A by the aid of (3). In column 3 the found values of
6(0,/) have been multiplied by a factor in order to render a comparison with
Abbot's values, recorded in the fourth column, possible.
By tlie aid of (3) and Abbot's values, which 1 subjoin, Defant
tries to draw^ a conclusion on the effective temperature of the sun.

(Abbot's values).
His reasoning is as follows:
For z = we obtain h{0,0) i.e. formula (3) then gives for every wave-
length P. tlie intensity of radiation passing out in the centre of the sun's
disc, when that of the area of the photosphere for this ^. is put equal
to i. What we measure is, however, not the quantity 6(0,0), but
the radiation iy, actually passing out, which is in relation with 6(0,0)
through the formula:

(4)
Ix =
6(0,0)
in which 7; is the intensity of radiation in the spectrum of the
photosphere (considered as absolutely black body) for the wavelength P..
By the aid of (3) and (4) and Abbot's values the following table
can, therefore, be calculated for /; (table II). According to our
