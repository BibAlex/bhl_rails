h is to be expected, that the enzyme molecules will not all decay
at the same time. At the end of the hydrolysis, when the action on
the rest of the urea has become very slow, and on the other hand
the concentration of the reaction products has grown correspondingly,
it may happen, that a suflicient i)roportion of the enzyme particles
is in the decaying state to cause the synthetic action, having a higher
concentration of substrate at its disposal, to predominate over the
slow action of the unchanged enzyme on the relatively very diluted
urea solution. During such a period the total effect will be reversed,
returning to its normal course as soon as the unchanged enzyme
particles prevail over the decaying ones, which may be occasioned
by a further weakening or total decay.
Figure 11 shows the results of an experiment of Jan. 2"^^ 1916,
like that of Nov. 28^^ , 1915, which shows the same phenomenon
in a smaller degree. '
In the phosphate solutions of high p^ also the reversion sometimes
became manifest.
First a regular experiment of April Q^^ , 1917 may be recorded.

In this case little or no destruction had taken place during this
interval; for 10 cc. of the extract, left alone for 320 minutes in
the same bath at 27° and then mixed with 2 cc. urea (0.06 '/„)
gave in 80 minutes 0.3 cc. NHj ^ N, which makes m = 0.000026.
April 10^^^ 1917. The same arrangement as on April 6'*' but now
with longer time intervals. Part of the same mixture left in the
bath at 27° till the next day, when 10 cc with 2 cc. urea solu-
tion of 0.06 7o gave in 260 minutes only y = 0.1 (against y about
0.45 originally). Thus evidently a considerable decay of the enzyme
had taken place.
