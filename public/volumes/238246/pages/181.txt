With one labyrinth the size of these rotator^' moveirieiits is about
half of that of animals with intact labyrinths.
7. For the intact animal it is possible to calculate the changes
in the eye-positions by taking the sum of the influences, starting
from the right and left labyrinths, on the recti super, and infer,
and the obliqui supei'. and inf. of the two eyes.
8. After extirpation of the labyrinths on hotk sides all tonic
reflexes on the eyes, mentioned above, disa[)pear.
9. The minbnum number of central courses, necessary for the
explanation of the tonic reflexes of the labyrinths of the rabbit on
its eyes (so not of the rotations-reactions and caloric reactions), have
been drawn in a sketch, accompanying fig. 5.
The uninterrupted lines represent the courses of the recti super.
and inf., the dotted lines those of the obliqui.
Each of the four obliqui is influenced from both labyrinths, each
of the two recti (super, and infer,) from only one labyrinth.
One labyrinth influences the 4 obliqui, but only the rect. super.
of the same side and the rect. inf. of the crossed side. For these
tonic reflexes of the labyrinth for the m.m. externus and interims
no reliable data could be found.
