(10?i*- 32;i+26). To the straight lines f/', which pass through P,
belong the tangents of the <)", which has its node in P. Each of
the remaining (10?i' ~32;i-|-24) straight lines d' evidently coincides
with a raj d, and therefore contains a null-point D, for which the
two null-rajs have coincided. If such a straight line is called a
double null-ray, it ensues from the above that the double null-rays
envelop a curve of class 2{n — 2) {hn — 6) ^).
4. The null-rajs d, which have a nnll-ray D on the straight line
J), envelop a curve {p) of class (4?i — 5), which has p as (4?2 — 7)-
fold tangent. It, therefore, intersects /; in {hi — 5) (4?z— 6) — (4?i — 7)
{4?z — 6) points, which bear each two coinciding null-rays.
The locus of the points C, luhich bear a double null-ray, is,
therefore, of order 4(2?2 — 3).
The curve (C) is evidently the locus of the cusps of the complex.
As the order of (C) may also be determined in another way, it
appears at the same time that the curve [p) has no other multiple
tangents.
5. The case n = 2 deserves a separate treatment. In the first
place each line d has now only 07ie null-point; this is the node of
the conic, which is indicated by three points of d.
The locus (C) is now of the fourth order, and consists of four
straight lines Ck- For, if the two straight lines of a nodal c^ coincide,
Ck is a double line. The complex contains, therefore, four double
lines, and they are at the same time singular null-rays.
The vertices Su of the complete quadrilateral formed by them are
the singular points of the null-system.
The curves {p)^ and ((/),, cf. § 4, have, besides the null-rays of
the point pq, seven tangents in common, which have each a null-
point on p and a null-point on q, and are consequently singular
null-rays. To them belong the four straight lines ct- Each of the
remaining three singular null-rays s must belong to oo * nodal
conies. /S'jj bears as singular point, oo ' pairs of lines, which form
an involution of rays; so 612*^,4 belongs to two, and then to 00 \
pairs of lines and consequently must be singular. The diagonals of
the quadrilateral,' which is formed by the four straight lines c, are
consequently the three singular null-rays required.
I) In other words, the cuspidal tangents of the cuspidal curves of a complex
envelop a curve of class 2(w— 2){5w — 6). In my paper on the characteristic
numbers of a complex (These Proceedings, Vol. XVII, page 1055, § 13) the
influence of the critical points in the determination of the class has been overlooked.
