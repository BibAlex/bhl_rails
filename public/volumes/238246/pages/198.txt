Mathematics. — ''The Remainder in the Binomial-series." By
Prof. Fred. Schuh. (Communicated bj Prof. D. .1. Korteweg.)
(Gomniunicaied in the meeting of June :28, 1919).
1. We consider the binomial-series 2 u , in wFiich ?r"' =
i=o Ó J
xJ i-i
=: — n {m — k). We suppose ,c real and m not zero and not a
positive integral number (there otherwise the series is tinite).
2. The series is convergent if \ j;\ <^\, if ./;=rl,?>i^ — 1 and
if x = — J, m^O, divergent in the other cases.
3. U \ a; \ <^ 1 and if | ,t; =1, m ]> — 1 we have lirnu"^ = 0,
as appears from N'. 2.
4. According to Mac Laurin's series we have :
in which the remainder is given by :
hence:
Rn = ^ -^ zr^ n(m-k)i p > 0),

Bn = — ==....... (1)

5. The aim of this paper is to show that Urn R„ =z in all
cases in athich the series converges, that is to demonstrate for those
CO
cases the validity of (I -\- x)'" =- 2u"'\ e.vclusiveli/ froii the remainder
in the .series (which is done incorrectly in a great number of hand-
1) The numbers 9 occurring in these expressions are generally unequal, 6 depend-
ing on n and on p.
