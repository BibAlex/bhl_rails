much less light energy in order to obtain the same reaction, than
with light coming vertically from above. Therefore the intensity and
the energy numbers must be divided by a certain coefticient.
Now VoGT found that already after a few minutes the rate of growth
began to fall off. This led after about 25 minutes to a minimum,
while after 30â€”40 minutes the zero point was again passed. Then
an acceleration of growth occurred, leading to a maximum, so that
at about 60 minutes after the beginning of illumination the first
rate of growth had been reestablished. After that the growth oscil-
lated for a long time, at first with considerable but later with grad-
ually decreasing maxima and minima.
I have now calculated from Vogt's tables '), how many ft the
plants grew less during the first retardation period than if they had
continued their growth in the dark. The following figures therefore
give, in fi, the total retardation of growth nntil the zero-point is
again reached and the acceleration of growth begins. It should always
be remembered that the intensity numbers must be divided by a coef-
ficient before being comparable to those of horizontally incident light.

Since in unilateral illumination the front is always more strongly
illuminated than the back, the former is retarded more than the
latter, if the retardation of growth increases with increasing intensity.
Consequently a positive phototropic reaction occurs, provided the
difference in growth retardation is sufficient to give a visible cur-
vature. If the retardation of growth diminishes again with increasing
intensity, a negative reaction will occui-, for in this case the back
side is retarded more than the front. It is seen from the table that
the first and second columns will give positive cui-vatures. We cannot
