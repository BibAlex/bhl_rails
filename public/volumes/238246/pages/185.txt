Expansion of an affinor in alternations or mixings.
Thus we have especially for the sum of all classes J/^and for ^^ -.
_ i,..,h _
Mk = — :^ Yki Ai j
Ak =— 'Jè Yki Mi ]
By the application of Mk to the upper equation we learn that
y/;j.= l, so that when we consider Mje and Ak resp. as o-th general
alternation, A^ and as o-th general mixing M^ we have, / being
the identical operator, and because ^j = ili, = / :
0,2,.. ..t _ 0,2,... ,i _
/= 2 yjciAi= S Yki Mi (13)
J i
In the same way we can prove :
0,2,... ,k ^ 0,2 k SL
1 = S y'M Ai^ 2 y'ki Mi (14)
I J
For a permutation number s we have in these expansions ;
Yj,i = Y'j,i = (^l)s-i{p-s^l) (15)
and for a permutation number « . 2 :
v.=QQ a«)
Thus we have obtained the theorem :
Principal theorem A : Every non special affinor can be expanded in
one and only one way into general alternations, into general mixed
alternations, into general mixings and into general alternated mixings
with the indices 0,2,3,...,^-
So we deduce e.g. from table (10) for p = 6:
6 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - [^^^^
o=(*il/„-2»7W,,— 2*'»il^, + 3*ifg— '•«i¥y+6*''li,-4«i^/,+ «M/,— i
Decomposing the ordinary alternations and mixings into mixed
resp. alternated ones we can calculate :
