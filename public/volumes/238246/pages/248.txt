Of tliese 4 pentoses we were able (o investigate only the first
two; quite in accordance wiili what was to be expected there was
no question of any retention of d-arabinose.
It was different in the case of d-xylose of wliich again a part
was retained.
Let us add to this still that neither of the d-1-arabinose nor of
the d- and l-arabinose anything was retained.
The tetroses could not be examined ; if this had been the case it
was to be expected that

To simplify the survey we give here a table in which the results
of the experiments are summed up. J^et it be remarked here however
that with d-galactose and 1-xylose a much larger amount of experi-
ments have been make. These will find a place in the following article.
Summarising the results of the above described experiments
we mnst come to the conclntion that the hypothesis which makes
