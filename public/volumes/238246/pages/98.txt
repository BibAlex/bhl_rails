weakened by being dissolved for such a long time in an alkaline
medium and therefore a gi'adual displacement of the equilibrium to
the side of urea was to be expected.
These experiments show clearlj, that a small part of the ammonium
carbonate disappears through the action of urease and that this part
is proportional to the amount of urease present. Both facts are in
accordance with the above theorj^ of the synthesis of urea.
12. The determination of H- and OH-ion concentration.
Since the theory and results, communicated in this paper, will
both have emphasized the dominating importance of frequent and
therefore simple pn determinations in enzyme research, it may be
useful to give the following details of the apparatus used for this
purpose.
It was nearly the same as that, described by the author as "A
simple Hydrogen Electrode" in Biochem. J. 19J5, 66.
The accuracy was improved by the addition of a little cup with
saturated KCl solution, in which both the hydrogen-electrode and
the tube of the calomel-electrode dipped. The latter was changed,
as shown in Fig. 16 in order to avoid all capillaries and rubber
connections. After a measurement the small flask, containing the
calomel-electrode proper, was turned round and the dipping tube
enclosed in a small tube with saturated KCl solution, as will be
seen in the figure.
