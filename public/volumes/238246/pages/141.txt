MiCHELSON has pointed out tlie direction in which it should be
tried to find such a method '). He first considers two absohitely
monochromatic beams, which lie causes to interfere with a difference
of phase. If this takes place in (he interferometer of Michelson, in
which the plane of reference may lie at a distance / before the movable
mirror, the difference of phase of the rays that have struck the
2/
mirrors at right angles is — X ^t {or 4: -rim, when we work with the
A
number of waves 7/i, by which we understand the number of waves
in the unity of length). The ocular is adjusted foi- infinity, and in
the middle of the field of vision (for there the rays striking at right
angles interfere) an intensity J{1) is observed, which can be calculated
by the aid of the formula ') :
J (/) ---^ 2 J^ -f 2 J, cos 4jr Im ...... (1)
from the equal intensities ./j of the interfering beams. An arbitrary
beam of light may be thought to be divided into an infinite number
of absolutely monochromatic beams of the intensity :
Jj = ifj (;i) (fX or J^ = X (m) dm ..... (2)
when we use the number of waves m. As intensities which are due
to different frequencies join scalarly, this light admitted to the
interferometer of Michelson, will give rise in the point under consi-
deration to the intensity J{1), given by :
