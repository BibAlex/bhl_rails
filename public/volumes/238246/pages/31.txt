values of a '), if for the deriv^ative of any negative order the defini-
tion of RiKMANN is adopted, which in the present case, a neigii-
bourhood of infinity being regarded, can be expressed by the identity

Since as domain of t and ii the part of tlie plane outside a
certain circle with centre (1) is considered, it will be convenient to
assnnie for path of integration between u = t and u =z cp the half-
line which has the same direction as the vector from ii ^ 1 to
ti = t. The quantities u — t and ii — 1 then have the same argu-
ments and ('M — t)"- : {u — I)'' is real. With these agreements we
have the expansion

so that the derivative of negative order — « of the expression
(p {t} : (t — 1)=' is, as cp (t) itself, regular and zero at infinity. The
characteristic of the derivative is, however, a less and this makes
it possible, by means of (15), to express the coefficientfunction to (a-)
of a generating function (p {t) with characteristic A' <^ — 1 in terms
of another generating function (f^ {() whose characteristic is any small
amount less than — 1. The function ^i (0 is constructed in such a
way that the given function <p{i) is the derivative of a certain
negative order — «of ^Pi(t):{t — ly and the number « is selected
from an aggregate of positive values, whose upper limit is equal
to the difference between X' and — 1. In other words, if (p {t) is
given by (3), we take
