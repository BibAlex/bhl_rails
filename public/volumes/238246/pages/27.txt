taken round tlie just mentioned circle, and this integral is easily
seen to be equal to the binomial series (1) in (he half-plane of x
on the right of the imaginary axis, provided definite agreements as
to the value of if*~^ be made. It may, however, be difficult to
investigate whether the integral (6) is equal to the given function
to (a*). And in any case the investigation is intricate if A' ^ — 1,
especially wheu the difference between / ' and — 1 is rather great.
For the coefficient-function of q) {t) is then brought into relation with
that of another generating function, with ^■' <^ — 1, by means of a
polynomial consisting of a very large number of terms.
The question therefore naturally suggests itself, if it is possible,
to find simpler tests which are sufficient for a functioi] to be
expanded in a binomial series. This is, indeed, the case, and we
may, moreover, say that the obtained properties are about ?i(^c^,v5ary ^).
For we can prove the following theorem:
J f a function to [x] is i^egular in the finite part of the half-plane
R {ai)> y ') (y = real), and if, in that domain, it satisfies the inequality

1) For the sake of comparison we observe that for the expansion of a function
in a series of factorials
E
x{x + l) . . . {x + n)
there is a necessary and sufficient condition, stated by Nielsen and simplified by
PiNCHERLE, which has some similarity with the above condition for binomial series.
But it is not possible to find simple tests for the expansion of a function in a
series of factorials. The only simple sufficient condition which may be given in
this case, is that a function can be expanded in a series of factorials, if it is
regular and of zero value at infinity. But this condition is far from necessary.
