So far a deviating behaviour has, therefore, only been found for
iron, nickel, and chromium, hence for me(als that have ions of
different valencies, for this reason it was desirable to examine whether
the phenomenon would continue to exist when the ratio of concen-
tration between the different ions in the electrolyte is everywhere
so, that the metal can coexist in state of internal equilibrium with
this electi'olyte. This was investigated for iron by boiling a solution
of Ferro-chloride with iron-powder for a long time in the vessel
in which the definitive experiment was to be made, leading over
pure hydrogen at the same time. The solution thus obtained was 0.6 N.
The result obtained with this solution was convincing in a high
degree. As fig. 10 shows after anodic polarisation there was nothing
to be seen of a minimum, and at least qualitatively the iron behaved
like silver and copper.
It is now natural to assume that also for nickel and chromium
the phenomenon can be made to disappear in the same way, about
which experiments are now being in progress.
