that is <^ f, since {log n) -. n^ is zero for n = 00. By this the conver-
gence of the first part of the series of derivatives (47) has been
proved, together with the unifoiin convergence in S. The second
part need not be examined more closely, since this part forms a
series which, save as to the factor \Y{x) not depending on n, is
equal to the series of factorials itself.
On account of its uniform convergence in the domain S and the
continuity of its individual terms the series of derivatives in question
represents in S the derivative of the function determined by the
original series of factorials. The differential coefficient of this function
is therefore determined at any point of aS', and is independent of the
direction in which it is taken : thus the series of factorials represents
an analytic function in the domain S.
14., We now proceed to settle the question indicated at the
beginning of the preceding section, and we first consider the case
A' = 0, in which the upper limit of «„ for n ^ 00 is equivalent to
7^". We further assume the limit of convergence and divergence of
the series (6) to be given by R{._t:i)=z6, 6 being a positive number
less than unity. Since, as we showed, the number I is in any case
not greater than 6, we have
lim {l—t)^<p{t) = for R (r) > <9 .
From this it follows that the integral (1) converges absolutely
for R{x) > <9. At the same time tiiis convergence is uniform in any
domain S wholly included in the finite part of the half-plane
B{x) ^ G -\- Ó, where cf is a certain fixed, but for the rest arbitrarily
small positive number. The same holds for the integral

(p {t) (1—0^—1 log (1—0 dt,
which may be deduced from the integral (1) by differentiating the
latter under the integration-sign with regard to x. Hence this integral
represents in aS the derivative with regard to x of the integral (1),
so that the latter is an analytic function of .^■ in the domain 5. ^)

in his paper "Sur ^es /"o^ciio^s de/!ermma7?ies", Ann. de I'Ec. Norm. (3) XXII, 1905,
p. 13—17. Their analogy with those we proved in the preceding section is
manifest.
