from t^u to t=:(X, and one from / = x to /=:= 0. The latter gives
an amount wliicli is independent of n, and this amount gives zero
for the ifinal integration. Therefore, after ciianging the letters u and t,
we may write for the preceding expression

and this, if we take (2) and (5) into account, is just equal to the
first member of (7). The latter equation thus has been proved in
case g <^ Ü.
If g>0 and, to begin with, 0<g<^l, Pincherle defines the
coeflicientfunction of (/> (t) by means of an auxiliary function
(n + 1) («— l)«+i

The order of ^,(0 is lower by unity than that of rf{t) and thus
negative, so that w, {.r) = I (f, {t) is defined by (2). By (4) we have

equation

Now, the operation («) is commutative, as will appear in the
simplest manner from the expansion (6). Hence (fi^ :^q^i, if by
the latter expression the result is denoted, which is obtained, if
first the operation (1) and then («) is applied. But ff^ (t) is a
function for which the equality (7) has already been proved; if this
is taken into account, we may infer from (10), using the identity
