As is well known., in order to extract say glucosides from plants,
it is necessary first to destroy the enzymes by boiling the seeds or
the leaves, before the cells are broken up for extraction. The gluco-
side and its enzyme are, as demonstrated already by Guignard,
located in different adjoining cells. The hypothesis that enzymes
display their synthetic effect only at a certain distance, affords at
once an explanation of these facts. Through the cellwalls the radiation
