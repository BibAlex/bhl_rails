rajs c,c' (cuspidal tangents), and consider the correspondence between
the points L,L', wliich c,c' determine on the straight line /.
If c is made to revolve round L, the null-points of c describe a
curve of order (5/i — 8), which has a node in L (cf. § 7). To a point
L therefore belong (5?i — 8) points C and (5n — 8) points L' . The
point al represents two coincidencies L'^L'. The remaining coinci-
dencies arise from cuspidal tangents u of unicuspidal points Ü. The
locus of the unicuspidal points is therefore a curve of order 1{hn — 9).
This maj be confirmed in the following way. If C describes the
straight line p, the null-raj'S c,c' envelop a curve of order {on — 8)
which has p as (Sri — JO)-fold tangent. It therefore has, not counting
the points of contact, {hn — 8)(5n — 9) — (5/2 — 10){hn — 9), consequently
2{hn — 9) points in common with p. In each of these points the
null-rays c and c' have coincided.
11. The system «S^*^ produces in a still different way a null-
system. Any point F is fiecnodal point for five curves ^". In order
to find this out we have only to consider the curve that arises if
we make every d" that has i^ as node, to intersect its tangents (/,<i'.
This C"+2 namely, has in F a quintuple point ^).
I now associate to each point F as null-point the five null-rays f ,
which are inflectional tangents for the five flecnodal curves y".
Any point D of the straight line a is node for a ö", which
touches the ray PD in D. I now determine the order of the locus
of the groups of (n — 3) points E which each of the curves cf" has
moreover in common with P D. U E lies in P, d" belongs to a
complex S^). According to § 2 there are on a (4?i — 5) nodes of
curves <^^" of *S'(^) which send their tangent d through P. So P is
(471 — 5)-fold point of the curve {E) and the latter consequently of
order {on — 8). In each of its intersections F with a a curve r^" has
a flecnodal point, the inflectional tangent of which passes through P.
From this it ensues that the locus of the null-points F of the
rays ƒ out of a point P {null-curve of P) is a curve of order
(5?2 — 8). As it must have a quintuple point in P, an arbitrary
straight line ƒ therefore contains {on — 13) null-points. ')
1) In a point, S (§8) the c" with triple point replaces three of the curves
^»»; for the other two the inflectional tangent lies along one of the two fixed
tangents d, d'.
For a unicuspidal point (§ 9) one of the curves 9" has its inflectional tangent
along the fixed tangent d.
*) For n = 3 is 5w — 13 = 2. Each <J)' is then the combination of a straight
line f and a ^2. Each straight line f belongs in S(4i to a figure {f,^^)\ its
intersections with <p' are the two null-points F.
