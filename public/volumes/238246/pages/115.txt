Mathematics. — "Remark on Multiple Integrals.^' B}- Prof. L. E. J.
Brouwer.
(Communicated in the meeting of June 28, 1919).
The object of this communication is to make two remarks in
conjunction with the first |)art of my paper: '' Pohidimensional
Veciordistributions" ^) presented at the meeting of May 26, 1906.
^ 1-
I. The proof of the generalisation of Stokes's theorem given I.e.
pp. 66 — 70 provides this generalisation not only in the Euclidean
but also in the following ametric form :
Theorem, hi the n-dimensional space (j-, , . . . .r, J let the {p — \)-tuple
integral
J
^ Fo^,. .. « ,_i i-^v ■ ■ ^«) ^^«1 dx^ _^ . . . . (1)
be given, lohere the F's are continuous and finitely and continuously
differentiable ; consider also the p-tuple integral
where
ƒ

/a, ... a -^ ^— ^
{indicatrix j.^ «^ aeg. indicatrir «^ . . . «^,).
llien, if the two-sided p-dimensional fragment ') G is bounded by
the tiao-sided {p — 1)- dimensional closed space g, the indicatrices of
(x and g corresponding and both G and g possessing a continuously
varying plane tangent space, the value of (1) over g is equal to the
value of (2) over G.
1) See Vol. IX, pp. 66— 78; we take the definitions modified in accordance with
note^) on p. 116 i.e. 1 take this opportunity of pointing out that on p. 76 I.e.
lines 13 and 14 "finite souiceless cuiront system" should be read instead of
"system of finite closed currents".
