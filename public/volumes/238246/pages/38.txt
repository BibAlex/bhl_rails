Alcohol not only diminishes the dissociation constant of water by
diminishing the concentration Ch^o iÂ» ChCoh=^ ^Ch^o^ bnt, owing
to its ionising power being far less than that of water, it will also
diminish the dissociation constant of a dissolved electrolyte. Therefore
the dissociation constants of the amphoteric electrolyte urease must
be expected to be also diminished by alcohol.
The effects of the first influence of alcohol are, as shown in fig. 6,
a lowering of the curve and a displacement of the maximum to the
left; that of the second one, the diminishing of ha and kt at the
same rate, is evidently an increase of m, the undissociated fraction,
without changing the abscissa of the maximum.
