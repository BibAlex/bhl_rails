critical points, where the tops of the lines lie luithin the parabolic
curve y = -iz n^, at a distance less than unity from this curve.
We shall now shew that the upper limit for ii=z cc of \he second

s„i and "^7^ Sm

are arithmetical progressions consisting of terms of equal signs only;
their total value is easily verified to be exactly equal to ± (^4)"-
Thus we have, but for a certain constant, whose value is of no
importance for the asymptotic behaviour of these sums:
s,n = {n,r - (n.^r -f . . . ± {nk'Y

Since the terms of the sum in the right-hand member increase in
absolute value or remain constant over a certain number of ?z-values,
the sum itself is, in absolute value, less than the last and the first
term together. So we have

where e is a positive quantity which tends to zero for k = oo.
Further, for an ?2-value lying in the interval between Uk — ^4^^
= 7ik—i + n^,_ and 7ik -f- n^, the value of a-C^) lies between the two
values of 5'2) for these two limits, because .?„ remains of the same

for all n- values of the interval considered
For the part of the n- values greater than Uk we therefore have

For the remaining part we have

Now

where, again, e is arbitrarily small for sufficiently great A. Thus for
the latter n-values, too, we have
