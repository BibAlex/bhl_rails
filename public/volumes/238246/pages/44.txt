in fig. 12. As will be seen olearlj in the curves of April lOt^'^ and
27t'\ there is first a decline, after which the reaction proceeds nor-
mally again. As discussed above the inference of this is, that during
some time interval the decaying enzyme particles, which cause the
synthesis, may prevail, and that after their total decay (or perhaps
restoration) the normal enzyme action sets in again.
In order to test this conception more directly the following experi-
ment was carried out.
In one row of tubes the rate of hydrolysis of an 0.01 '/o "^'^a
solution in 8 Vo phosphate of />^=:8.13 was investigated as before.
Another row of tubes, each also with 10 c.c. of the same Soja-
extract-phosphate-solution had been placed with all the other tubes
at the same time in the same bath of 27Â°. Immediately after taking-
out a tube of the first row for analysis, 2 c.c. urea solution of
0.067o were introduced into a tube of the second row and the
reaction in this one allowed to proceed for 120 minutes. In this
way it was possible to get souie information about the rate of
decay of the enzyme.
From Fig. 13 it will be seen, that the nearly horizontal part of
