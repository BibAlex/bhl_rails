In those places where in majnmals scales occur, the Iiairs are inserted
generally in gronps behind them. In this point they therefore differ from
the thighorgans, which are placed in the middle of scales. It is trne, that
not too much value ought to be attached to this fact, but yet I want to
point out in the first place that the afore-mentioned dermal organs
of the crocodiles, described by Vokltzkow, are arranged between
the scales, and further, that the similarity in location of hairs and
femoral organs becomes greater, if the considerations of Pinkus ^) in
connection with the "hairdiscs" described by him, are right. If, as
he thinks, a "Haarbezirk". that is the whole complex of scale
rudiment, hair group and hairdisc, answers to the scale of reptiles,
then the hairs are placed in the middle of the region of the scale,
just the same as is the case with the thighorgans. Pinkus, who
derives the hairdiscs from tactile spots of reptiles, cannot find an
explanation for the origin of (he hairs: "Das Saugetierhaar hat
kein Homologen in dem Gebiet der Reptilienschuppe ; sein Platz
ist leer." By the hypothesis, developed before, this objection against
Pinkus' theory is done away with.
Mauhkh has directed the attention to another ai'rangement of the
hairs; still before the hairgroups are formed, in mammalian embryos
the placing of hairs in longitudinal rows may be stated. From this
fact Maurer deduces an argument for his befoi-e mentioned theory,
because epidermal sense organs generally show a similar arrange-
ment. This argument however becomes worthless by the observation
