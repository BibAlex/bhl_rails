Introduction.
In a few previous coinimmicalions 1 already discussed the un-
attackable electrodes and their efficiency as gas-electrodes. Only the
hydrogen electrode was, however, discussed in detail. It was pointed
out that the unattackable electrodes are among the most inert metals,
being so inert that even in contact with an electrolyte they do not
assume internal equilibrium, so that they are almost always in
disturbed condition, and we do not even know the potential of the
really unary metal.
When such a metal is immersed in the aqueous solution of an
acid, while hydrogen is passed through, the electron concentration
of the metal equilibrium in the electrolyte, which we represent by
the equation :
becomes equal to the electron concentration of the hydrogen equilibrium:
in agreement with the pressure of the hydrogen that is passed through,
which means that the hydrogen phase and the hydrogen-containing
metal-phase possess the same potential, the electromotive force of
the circuit metal-electrolyte-hydrogen being given by the equation:

Hence the hydrogen-electrode indicates the potential belonging to
the three-phase equilibrium metal phase -|- hydrogen phase -f- electrolyte
in accordance with the prevailing pressure, temperature, and total ion
concentration {H') -\- {M'"'). As, however, as was already stated in
the discussion of the E,X-£\g., the said electrolyte cojitains an entirely
negligible concentration of ions of the so-called unattackable electrode,
we may substitute the words: hydrogen-ion-concentration for "total-
ion-concentration"
