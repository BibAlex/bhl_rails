not arrived; but we may already perceive that the result could not
till up the gap which, as regards the domains of validity, exists as
yet between the necessary and the sufficient condition. First: if a
function w (.r) satisfies the equation of equivalence (24) for a fi,xed
value of a on the circle (1,1) and for a certain minimum-exponent
/„, then, on account of what has been remarked on the expression
a^-y, immediately after formula (10), that function satisfies the same
inequality, when the number a varies, in the specified mode, together
with the argument \p of .v. The index /„ cannot, however, be dimi-
nished, because it must at all events be taken for i|? = — c/, if «is
the argument of the original fixed number a. The statement belonging
to the inequality (9') informs us, however, that in this case expan-
sion of CD (.^•) in a binomial series is possible for R {w) ]> ï^. The
function
for which we have a ^2, /„ = 0, affords an illustration of this fact,
for the expansion is really valid for R (*•) ^ 0, and it is conditionally
convergent for R(.v)<l. Therefore we can never find /? (i») > /„ -|- 4
as a necessary condition whereas our theorem concerning the sufficient
condition only says tliat expansion is possible in the domain defined
by the last inequality.
Secondly the last condition only holds in case io{.v) has no singu-
larities in the finite part of the domain R{.v) > /„ -4- | ; for otherwise
for the latter domain the one must be substituted where oj{x) is
regular and that was defined by the inequality R {.v) ]> y.
Thus the proposition regarding the necessary condition states that
for points in the domain of absolute convergence of the given
binomial series we have R {x) ^ k -{- \, but conversely it is not
true that in the domain determined by this inequality there is
certainly absolute convergence. A simple example is furnished by
the function
1
(O (/c) = - —
X
For this function /„ = — oo, and yet the function can only in the
domain of regularity R (.«) > be expanded in a binomial series of
the form (1).
From these remarks it will be clear that in order to fill up the
gap existing as yet between the necessary and sufficient conditions
we must give more specified propositions for both conditiojis. In
