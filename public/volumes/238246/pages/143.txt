Accordingly the function (f{x) will he known, when we know C
and aS' as functions of /, hence when we can determine C and aS
experimentally for every value of /.
Data to attain this may be derived from "the curve of visibility"
of MiCHELSON, whose coordinates he defines as V =—_ — '- — - — '(in

which Jmnr. ^^'d Jmin. represent the intensities in the successive maxima
and minima of the system of interference fringes). It appears from
(4) that F is a function of C{1) and *S(/) ; when we assume V{1)
to be sufficiently accurately known fron) |)hotometric observations,
we have at our disposal a relation between 6'(/) and aS(/), but without
more data we cannot determine these quantities separately. Only
in a few simple cases which contained a second condition concerning
Cil) or S{1) has Michei.son derived the form oï (f{-v) from that of V{1).
The aim of our investigation is to find a means through which
it is possible to find a second relation between C{1) and *S(/) in
any given case, and which therefore enables us to solve (f{x).
In equation (4) we can think J{1) experimentally determined
for a given value of /. Also 1 cp{x)dx can be measured, this is viz.

the intensity that one of the beams causes in the middle of the
field of vision, when it is not brought to interference with the other.
In order to determine this quantity we have, therefore, only to cover
one of the mirrors. Hence equation (4) can be considered as an
equation with two unknown quantities C and *S', to be token for
that value of / for which ,/ has been measured.
We shall have to find a second equation between C and /S for
the same value of / to be able to solve both quantities. This
means will fail, however, when in the second equation C' and *S
appear combined in the same way as in equation (4), accordingly
when they are again derived from I r/ (.f) cos ^ jt I {m -\- x) tlv ,

the same physical meaning as just now.
