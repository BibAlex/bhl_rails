This solution should, however, be denied all signification, because
as jet free positive ions have not been met with^ and everything
points to the existence of only one kind of electrons, viz. the
negative ones.
Hence in spite of a desperate attempt, the difficulty remained un-
diminished of force.
The Chlorine- Electrode.
When considering tlie just-discussed difficulty, I have come to the
conclusion that we must necessarily assume that the chlorine atom
possesses the power to split off electrons and to absorb them, and
that these two processes take place side by side, which we can
represent by the following equations:')
XCl,^:^2XCV^ {2X6^ (1)
and
YCl, , +2Yd^,:^2YCl' (2)
G Or t7
in which X and Y indicate the fractions of the original number
CI, mol. which have undergone a positive resp. negative ionisation.
As the electrons, which are absorbed according to (2) proceed
from the electron-ion isation (1) it is clear that
In the limiting case }' = A' the chlorine would contain an equal
number of positive and negative ions, and no electrons at all. As
we have to do here with a non-metal. A' and Y will be exceedingly
small.
It is now the question how the positive charge of the chlorine
electrode is to be explained. It is clear that for this we should
have to assume that for the non-metal, chlorine, it is the negative
ions that go practically exclusively into solution, and possess, there-
fore, a much greater solubility than the positive ones.
Metals and Non- Metals.
These considerations about the non-metal, chlorine, which necessa-
rily result from the consistent application of the principles of the
theory of allotropy to the electromotive equilibria, lead us to the
point of view from which we can survey the metals and tl)e non-
metals in a very satisfactory way.
') For the sake of simplicity we assume liere that the positive ious are also
univalent.
