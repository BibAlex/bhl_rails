We find
F\, =: + 1025.13,
and the determinant of the four equations («) is
+ 30250.34— 15' - 263.42 — 214.29 — 1.41
— 235.83 +23296.87-/?' + 289.04 + 4.76
— 71.72 + 83.36 +21385.15-^9' — 25.51
+ 0.33 + 1.71 — 34.50 +21087.28-/9'
The five roots /?y', determined in this way, are (still expressed in
units of the 8^*^ decimal place) :
/?/ = + 30261.15
/?,'= + 23299.79
/?,'= + 21374.51
^/ = + 21084.19
/?,'=r+ 1025.13
We now put, for ^ = 1 . . . 4,
ifV = /^9 ^ + ^PvO = XT + tir,, -{-^qo ^ xr + y^ T + ttr^o + ^90,
where
^10 =^T^80 = -^<o = *^ ' JT,, =:180°.
Then 'nr,/ = y^r +■ 'üt^o are the longitudes of the "proper" perijoves,
and \pcj for 5- = 1 ... 4 are the arguments of the inequalities of
group II, and \p^ is the argument of the libration.
The mean motions of these arguments are, in degrees per day ^):
EI. and Masses,
y, i=0°148668 0°. 14407
y, = .039842 .039593
y, = .006949 .007046
y, = 0.001862 0.001864
/?, = 0.16347 0.16252
These values are not yet final, since we have neglected:
1. the effect of the periodic part Ei — [/?,] of the perturbative
function,
2. the squares and products of the quantities hi, ki,i'i , oji ,
3. the inclinations of the orbital planes of the satellites on the
plane of Jupiter's equator.
Apart from the corrections which must eventually be applied
1) The motions yi and /?5 are siderial ones, and do not contain precession.
Accordingly the precession has been subtracted from the values of yi as given in
El. and Masses.
