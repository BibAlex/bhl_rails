becomes of an order which is by less than one unity higher than
the first snraqnanlitj (35), i. e. of an order less tlian ?i^+i. We
proceed in the following way. For a certain value n = p we take
where by the notation p^ the same thing is meant as E{p^). Now
we make the following sums decrease as soon as possible by taking
a certain number of coefficients (in, for n^ p, all equal to — 1.
After p^ terms the sum ,?„ has in this way become equal (o zero.
And after ;/ terms more .s*,, has attained the value — ;>^ ; the value
of n is then equal to j> -\- 2pK It may happen that for this value
of n the quantity 7i^ is still equal to //^ ^). In this case we may say
that \sn\ has again reached the required upper limit and we assume
a certain number of next coefficients n,, all equal to -f-l. If, on
the contrary, n^ for n = p-\-2p^ is greater than p^, we go on taking
a-n equal to — 1 as long as .9,, has diminished to such an effect that
\sn\ is again equal to n^. Such an ?2-value must be reached, if
<^1, for I .s-„ I would become of order n, if we never stopped
taking a,, = — 1. Just as in the former case we assume, after this
?i-value, the next coefficients «„ equal to +1, until Sn has attained
the value n^ again. And so on. The upper limit for n := oo of the
sums Sn is then equivalent to n^ and that of the coetïicients a,, is
equivalent to n°. We call the values of n for which s„ is equal to
n^ critical values and we denote them by Uk for ^'^ 1, 2, . . . . If
we assume arbitrarily a certain value 7i = p as a critical value,
then it follows from the preceding construction that the following
critical values are uniquely determined. We might continue the
same construction towards the side of the smaller ?z-values, but this
is of no importance, since the asymptotic behaviour of the quantities
in question is solely effective. The graphical representation of the
coefficient an, considered as a function of n, consists of a number
of horizontal line-segments, which are alternately above and beneath
the ?i-axis, and are at a distance 1, the change taking place in the
critical points. The graphical representation of the sums s,^ consists
n
of joined line-segments including alternately angles of -j and
4
jr
with the ?i-axis; and the alternation again takes place in the
4
1) We may write (;; + 2^;^)^ =p^ + 2(9p29-i (i_£)^ where llmz=0. From this
it follows that for i5 < ^ and large p-values, E[p-\-2p^}^ is in general equal to
E (p9).
