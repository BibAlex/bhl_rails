the co-ordinates of a triple point have to satisfy the six equations

in which Aki etc. represent derivatives according to ,i'/; and .17.

According to a well-known rule we find for this
There are therefore 15(n — 2)' curves c„ with a triple point S^).
In such a point the nodal curves have the same tangents d,d' .
Any straight line passing through S is to be considered as a cuspidal
tangent c.
The null-system therefore has i5(?i — 2)" singular points.
9. I now take three points P, Q, R, arbitrarily, and consider (cf. § 7)
the curves {D)pq and (i))p/?. To begin with they have the point P
in common; for there is a d", which has P as a node, and PQ as
tangent and a tf", for which one of the tangents lies along PR.
Those curves have further in common the (^n — 9) points D, for
which QR is one of the tangents d. Another group of common
points consists of the singular points *S.
Let CT be one of the still remaining intersections. There is in
that case a cf" with tangents UP and Ü Q, and also a rf" with
tangents UP and U R. Prom this it ensues that all <f" with node
U have the straight line UP as tangent, consequently belong to a
pencil in which the tangents d,d' form a parabolic involution.
The double rays of this involution have then coincided in UP,
and U is cusp for only one cuspidal c". If such a point is called
imicuspidal point, it follows from (5?^ — 8)' — 1— (5?^ — 9)— 15(?i — 2)'
that (IOji" — 25/i -j- 12) unicuspidal curves send their tangent through
P. The cuspidal tangents of the unicuspidal points envelop a curve
of class {{On'—^^n + 12).
10. In any point C of the straight line a I draw the two null-
1) If w = 3, and the system has 5 base-points, the 15 triple points are easy to
indicate. One of them e.g. is the intersection of BiB^ with B^Bi-
