split up into different paths, each with a somewhat different energy
value, so that when jumping from and to tliese transformed paths
the electrons would emit a vibration with a somewhat changed
frequency ?
If this question should be answered in tho aftirmative, it would
follow from this that given the modes of splitting up of each of
the paths (/7. 2 etc.), the observed types of ZKEMAN-effect might be
found from this by simple subtraction, in other words, that the
anomalous ZEEMAN-effect would follow the so-called "Kombinations-
prinzip".
To answer the questions put I have done exactly the reverse. T
have namely tried to determine whether in the material of obser-
vation of the anomalous ZEEMAN-effect indications were to be found
of the validity or non-validity of the "Kombinationsprinzip".
In what follows 1 will communicate some of the results obtained
by me.
As material has served what I had collected in (I.e.). In order
to be able to treat a number of complexes as large as possible with
a number of sequences as small as possible I have confined myself
for my first investigation to the triple complexes, and added to this
some single complexes with strange asymptote.
These are collected in the following table:

For the types of ZEEMAN-effect that these complexes present, see (I.e.).
From this material some general conclusions may first of all be made.
When the electron jumps from an initial path to a 77-path, the
ZEEMAN-effect is more complicated than when from the same initial
path it jumps to a 77'-path, and this in its turns is again more com-
plicated than when from the same initial path it jumps to a 77"-path.
It is therefore natural to assume that in a magnetic field the
