behaviour between metals and noii-metals. In this il is iiotewortliy
that the diffei-ence in sokibility between the positive and tlie negative
ions for tiie elements with exchisively metaHic resp. exclnsively
non-metallic properties, is so great as to jnstifj ns in taking only
positive resp. negative ions into acconnt in the coexisting solntion.
F'or the intermediate amphibious elements as Iodine, Sulphur,
Seleninm, Tellurium, Arsenic, and Antimony the existence of posi-
tive and negative ions also in solntion, should certainly be taken
into acconnt to obtain a deeper insight, and here lies still an exten-
sive field to be studied more closely, led by the more recent views
about the electromotive equilibria.
FoInrisatio7i for non-metals.
Wiien we indicate the non-metal by A', we may represent the
formation of negative ions by the equation :
Nn 4- nv6:^nN'' (6)
Applying the well-known thermodynamic derivation for the poten-
tial difference, we get :
A = In—^ — . (7)
vF (iV£')
in which (iV'p) represents the concentration of the negative ions in the
phase of which the electrode consists, this may be either a gas, or
a liquid, or a solid phase. Starting from the electron formula:
A = ^.n^l^ (8)
F {Sl)
which is general, because the electron is the common constituent
part of all matter, we may substitute for {Oi) the value that follows
from (6) for the liquid phase, applying the law of the chemical mass
action; thus we arrive at the already known equation:
RT K'{N )
L=^^~ln ~ ....... (9)
nvF (^^O»
In order to study the polarisation phenomenon we cannot make
use of equation (9), but we can use the newer equation (7). To get
a good insight into this question it is desirable that we indicate the
equilibria in the electrode completely ; accordingly we must also
express the splitting off of electrons, and write therefore:
XNn^,:^XnN''^-^ Xnvd^ ..... (6a)
