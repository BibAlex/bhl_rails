Equilibria of n components in n -{- 1 phases.
We have seen in communication XVI, that the following equilibria
may occur on a bivariant region li = F^ -^ . . . F,]-
1. the limit-curve E,, when the quantity of one of the components
approaches to zero.
2. the turning-line Er, when a phase-reaction may occur between
the ?i phases.
3. the critical curve Ek, when critical phenomena occur between
2 phases.
In the communications XVII and XVIII we have discussed more
exactly the turning-line Er and the region in the proximity of this
line. Now we shall briefly consider the limit-line E,.
When in an equilibrium E = F^ -\- . . . -{- En the quantity of one
of the components becomes zero, it then passes into the equilibrium
E^ = F^ -\- . . . -\- Fn of n — 1 components in n phases, or, what
comes to the same thing, of n components in n-\-\ phases. Conse-
quently we consider this last equilibrium, viz.
^ = F, + i^, -f . . . -I- F.+i
of n compounds in n-\-l phases.
The conditions for equilibrium are:
