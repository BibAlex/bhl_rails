/ and /', the difference of (hese parameters, if they refer to tlie
same moment, being constant, viz. =: c/. For points of tiie Zm](\Z^
cnrves, which have thus simultaneonsly arisen, the two abscissae
c/ and cl' will, therefore, always differ by the same amount, viz. cc/.
The initial points of the cnrves are such points that have arisen
simultaneously'); we have, therefore, only to measure their abscissae
taken to the found zero points on the axes, and to lake the diffe-
rence between them to find cd.
When in the graphically found functions I and II we choose the
variables equal, i.e. when we measure equal portions cl and cI'
on the axes from the points N and N' (hence independently of
the earlier meaning of / and/'), we find from equations (21) and (22) :
"'1
2 I X (m) cos ijtlm dm —fl (cl) ..... (23)
r/ij
TBI
2 j'A{m) sin 4.t Im dm = —fll{cl) .... (24)
At first our intention was to solve C {I) and S{1) from equations
(4) and (13), and substitute them in (7). This would come to the
same thing as the introduction of 6'(/) and /S(/) into equations (23)
and (24), in order to determine them from this, and substitute them
in equation (7). The same result, the formula for (f {w), can be
reached more quickly by the consideration that according to Fourier's
integral theorem
CO +^ oo +<»
(p [x) r= x (m) = — I COS am da i'/^ (^) cos ^ad^-l | sin am da 1 7 (^) sin §« da.

When we now choose ui for g, and put a =z 4:jil, and when we
besides consider that i{77i)^=0 for m^<^in <^m^, the equation
reduces to :

Making use of equations (23) and (24), we may replace these by :
00 CO

As we only try to find the shape of the curve /, we may put
