causes synthesis in tlie neighbouring cells; as soon as enzyme and
substrate are brought togetlier, the liydrolytic action prevails almost
exclusively.
This conception of enzyme activity is borne out by experiment in
different ways.
The weakening of the radiation may be occasioned, as observed
above, not only by spreading, but also by other factors, e.g. by the
deteriorating action of temperature and acids or alcalis in a shorter
or longer time. As will be seen, in what follows, several times a
reversion of the hydrolysis of urea was observed, which could be
explained by a decay of the urease.
Nov. 18^^! 1915 an experiment was carried out with ammonium-
carbonate as a buffer, in which this reversion at the end of the
hydrolysis manifested itself clearly. See figure 10, p. 10.
