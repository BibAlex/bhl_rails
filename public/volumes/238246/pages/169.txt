We still i-estrict ourselves to the non-periodic part [7^,] of the
perturbative function, as in the delennination of the intermediary
orbit. ^) The quantities Jii, hi, r/, to,, which were zero in the inter-
mediary orbit, are now determined by the equations (23), *1 of
which the solution is given by (24). For the determination of the
five values of ^9" we have the determinant (28). Then c',-^ and 6*",V/
are deterinined from (27) and c,^ and c"V^ from the tirst and last of
(25). The expressions for the coefficients aij, a' ij, b-^ j, b' ij, dij, d'ij,
eij, e'ij are given in Vol. XII, Part 1, of the Annals of the Leiden
Observatory, page 31. Then we have
Aij = 2 1 {a'iiaij \- h'iidij).
Bij = ^ I {a' il bij 4- b'iieij),
Cij = 2 1 (d'iiaij + e'iidij),
Dij = 2 1 {d'iibij + e'iieij).
Tlie details of the computation of the quantities aij, a'ij, etc. and
Aij, Bij, etc. will be published in the Annals of the Observatory
at Leiden. Here we shall only give the results. The determinant
(28) is: (see formula A, next page).
The coefficients are given in units of the eighth decimal place.
Denoting the columns by roman, and the rows by arabic numerals,
we now perform the following operations:
add 4.(V) + 2.(VI) to (VII)
„ 3.(V)-e,.(I)-e,(II)-e,(IIl)-e,(IV) „ (VI)
„ -2.(7) „ (6)
,. 2 . (7) - 3 . (6) ., (5)
„ e/ [(6) - 2 . (7)] „ ii) {i = l..A).
The determinant then becomes: (see formula B, next page).

2) *' Outlines" p 1301. The defmilion of hi and ki is slightly different here, in
consequence of the introduction of ei instead of j?/. We now have
ei cos gi = e»" + hi
ei sin gi = ki.
