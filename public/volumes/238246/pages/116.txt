Of this theorem, which was enunciated by Poincaré ^) in 1899
already, without proof however, and in a form expressing the rule
of signs in a less simple manner, I shall here give the proof anew,
editing it somewhat more precisely than in my quoted paper.

and where, for different terms under I he ^ sign A may be chosen
differently ; and we sum ,fp over the different base simplexes of Q-
The upper and lower limit between which this latter sum varies
on account of the free choice of the points A, we call the upper
and lower value of (3) over Q.
If we now subject Q to a sequence of indetinitely condensing
simplicial divisions which give rise to a sequence Q' , Q", ... of
net fragments covering Q, then, as i' increases indefinitely, the upper
and lower value of (3) over Q''' converge to the same limit, which
we call the value of (3) over Q.
