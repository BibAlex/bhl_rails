/ (z) is- given, such that the limiting f iinction f {z) has a finite derivative,
at 0, and if moreover the series f* (0, z) -\- /',* (0, z) -\- . . . converges
quasi-uniformly at 0< l^j ^b<^a, then it is possible to assemble the
terms of the series in groups in such a ivaij that the neio series may
be diferentiated ternnvise at 0.
If we put ^ f {z) == Sn iz) and 1 /* (0, z) = S* {0,z), then S* (0, z)

is continuous for ^ | ^ | ^ ^ and aS* (0,0) = Sn (0).
Besides, for j z | > we have

By hypothesis this function tends to a tinite limit ƒ '(0) as 2 — ► 0.
Now let an arbitrary number «j > be given. We construct a
set of points z^, z,, . . . where li}nz^=^0. From a limited number
A;=ao
of indices an index can be chosen at each of these points such that
Hence an intinite number of points <j^ exists where one and the
same index can be used which we denote by ??,. As z^ tends to
zero .S; (0, 2^ tends to ,S",„ (0) and /*(0, 2^^ to ƒ '(0). Thence it follows
that I /S"„j(0) — f\0)\^s^. Let f,, f,, . . . be a decreasing sequence of
positive numbers, having zero as limit. It is again possible to choose
for every z out of a limited number of indices an index n^'^ii^
such that I aS'jT^^CO, 2^— /*(0, 2^)1 < e,, whence may be concluded, as
before, to the existence of an index n^'^n^ such that | *S'„^(0)— /'(0)| <f,.
Thus pursuing we find that there is a partial series of functions:
*S' (2), S' (2), . . . , such that liui S' (0) = /"(O), which establishes the
theorem ').
12. The theorem of the foregoing ^ may be reversed as follows:
] f within |2J<^r/ a convergent sequence of analytical functions f ^{z)
is given such that the limiting function f (z) is continuous for z ^
and has a finite derivative f' (0) at 0, and if moreover a partial
sequence f {z), f (2),... can be found ivhere limf'{0)=zf'{0), then
the sequence of functiom f* (0, z) converges quasi-uniformly for
0<[ I2I ^6, luhere b is an arbitrary number <^ a.
We denote by f and ^ two given positive numbers. Then a number
n^ ^ N can be determined such that
I /'(0)-/'(0)|<^.
