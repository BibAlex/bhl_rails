coincide or the polarization is incomplete. Between ( ) are placed
the so-called siiperfUions components, which have not been found
in the observation. The adjoined notes of interrogation will be dis-
cussed further on.
First a few words about the superfluous components. By far the
greater part are extreme outer components. As the outer components
that have been observed, are mostly very faint, it is possible that
the theoretically found components are so faint that they could not
be observed up to now. These components originate namely by
jumps from and to the most greatly deformed paths, and according
to SoMMERFELD these are less probable than the less deformed ones,
so that the number of jumps of the electron from these greatly
deformed paths is relatively much smaller, hence the pi'oduced
component much fainter.
This explanation, is however, not applicable to the question
whether the middle components of Tl' 2£ and Ud are superfluous.
It would, however, also be possible that the "Kombinationsprinzip"
was dependent on a restrictive condition. Prof. Bohr was namely
of opinion, as appeared to me from a conversation on this question,
that in its jumping the electron should also be bound to the condition
that the angular momentum in initial and final path maj^ not
