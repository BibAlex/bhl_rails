In tlie table the most violet component is marked by — , the most
red by -}-. In this case the splitting up is not = 2 cD-, as is given
in the heading of the colnmn, bnt =z dX; does not mean that the
line is at the place of the original unsplit one, bnt only that there
is a component there.
5. General results. When we compare the resnits in what
|)recedes, it strikes us at once that though the general course of
the results may be the same, (here yet occur a good many devia-
tions, which amount to more than the given probable error. Further
it occui-s occasionally that a quadruplet is mistaken for a triplet,
which is not astonishing with the middle components of these often
blurred lines, which ai-e so very close together. That something
similar may be the case with other lines which are given as triplet,
is not impossible.
An agreement as Purvis gives between the quadruplets Pb 3740,
Pb 2873, Sb 3723, Sb 3638, and possibly Sb 2668, Bi 2989, does
not exist according to my measurements, except perhajis that between
Sb 3638 and Bi 2989. When we examine whether there is perhaps
some connection between the resolutions of the lines for which
Kayskk and Rungk ^) find the known constant differences of frequency,
it appears that there is no such coiinecfion. Van Lohuizen ') has given
series in the spectra of tin and antimony. The correctness of this is,
however, donbted by Saundkks ') and Arnot.ds *). 1 have now examined
whether the laws of Preston were valid for these series. Of series
I, which V. LoHUiZEN gives for the tin spectrum, I have found the
resolutions (i.e. the values for dA : ;.'H, see table) 29,6 and 56,1 for
the lines 3656 and 2785; in this series 2408 has a resolution smaller
than 59. In series VII I find for the lines 380J , 2851, 2594,
2483, 2422 successively the splittings up 40,5, 42,5, 44,7 (56 and
46,8), 45,9. In this 2483 gives a quadruplet, the other lines give
triplets. Series VIII: 3175 and 2483 give successively 69,7 (56 and
46,8) as splitting up. Antimony. Series XIII : the lines 3268 and 2574
have successively a resolution of 40,9 and 45. Series XIV: 3505
has the splitting up 63,7 and 2719 has 51.5. Series XX : 3233, 2653,
2478 have the resolutions 60,0, 63, 68,7.
