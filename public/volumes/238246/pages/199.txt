8. If .r=— 1, in^O, it follows from (2) by taking p = ni:
«„ = -"1-," (3)
In connexion with N°. 3 it follows that /////- /i!„ = (the inequality
w — 1^—1 being salistied), a result that cannot be obtained
from Lagrange's or Cauchy's form of the remaindei- if vj <^ 1.
It can further be observed, that (3) leads to the identity

the identity can also easily be demonstrated by mathematical induction,
from which it appears that the identity also holds good for iw^O .
9. If we make use of Abel's theorem about the continuity of
power-series, the examination of the remainder in the case | .c | <^ 1
suffices. In order to demonstrate, without distinguishing various cases,
that then lim R„ = 0, in (2) we take p i= 1 (as in N". 7).
