4. We observe that in this theoiem nothing is supposed about
the convergence or divergence of the sequence ƒ'(()). Let this sequence
be convergent. Then the sequence of continuous functions /* (.?;) is
convergent for O^x^a and converges to f*{x) for .f > 0, to I
= limfl{0) for x = 0.
If ƒ '(0) r= lim fl (0) then

We now consider a set of points x^,x^,..., where Urn x =r 0.
By 8, X we denote two given positive Jiunibers. Then there exists
an index N ^ ^ N^ such that
l/'v (0)--^i<e (6)
Since ƒ' (0) == ƒ* (0) and /'* (.i') is continuous and because of (5),
there exists a certain number k\ such that for every k'^ l\
Since at each of the finite number of points wiiere k<k^ an
index Xk^ -N can be found such that
it appears that the sequence of functions /* [x) converges quasi-
uniformly at the points of tlje considei-ed set.
If this sequence of functions converges quasi-nniformlj* at the
points of every set of tlie above-considered kind, then it results from
an argument as held in ^ 2 that
/'(0)=:/*m/;(0).
We have therefore the following theorem:
If a series of functions f (.r) be given, each of ivhich is continuous
