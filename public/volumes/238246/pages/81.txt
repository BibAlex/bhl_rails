§ 1. Introduction. This paper is the continuation of a previous [pre-
liminary communication ^). The reduction of the neon-isotherraals
has now progressed so far, that what follows may be looked upon
as a pretty nearly completed whole. The measurements i-efer to
pressures up to about 90 atmospheres and as regards the temperatui-e
go from -j- 20° C. down to — 217° C. ; they therefore embrace the
region between the ordinary temperature down to the lowest tem-
perature to be reached with liquid oxygen. The legion tVom — 218° C.
to — 246° C, which can now also be covered by means of the hydrogen
vapour cryostat *), is here left out of account; we hope shortly to
be able to continue our measurements in this region. As regards the
importance of such determinations as will be communicated on this
occasion and the apparatus which have been used for the purpose
we may refer to previous communications on the isothermals ot
hydrogen and of argon. ')
For the sake of completeness and of a better sui-vey of the whole
work we have included in the table the material published in the
previous communications on neon, quoted above, viz. the series I, II,
III, IV, VI, VII, VIII and IX.
^ 2. The results of the measurements are given in table I, where
^ =: the temperature on the international ^)Om.^\\)^-^Q&\Q, i.e. the
temperature on the international KEi.viN-scale diminished by 273.09 ;
p ■= the pressure in international atmospheres (for Leiden i inter-
national atmosphere =:: 75.9488 cms mercury);
d.A = the density expressed in the normal density (0° C and 1 atm.) ;
va = the volume expressed in the normal volume (0° C. and 1 atm.).
