It is, indeed, clear that as the metallic and non-metallic properties
in the periodic system of the elements gradually pass into each
other, theorj' will have to make clear that between the metallic and
the non-metallic state there exist only quantitative differences, and
that there are therefore all kinds of intermediary states possible.
This demand can really be satisfied by an in every way plausible
extension.
For this purpose we must assume that the atoms of all the
elements, hence both metals and non-metals, can split off and absorb
electrons so that the following reactions take place side by side :
and

m„ m.
in which En denotes the molecule of an element and
EX and Em^ the ions.
As is known for metals m.-^ is mostly =1, and probably ?n, will
as a rule also be =1. For non-metals m has often been found
= 1, but several times also greater than 1. Of the factor m^ no
doubt the same thing may be expected.
With perfect certainty we may only say this that

from which follows that when
»'i = »',
and
r, = 1',
the number of positive ions will be greater than the number of
negative ones.
When now the question is put in what I'espects metals and non-
metals will differ, the answer is as follows:
In the first place the factor X is comparatively great for metals
and exceedingly small for non-metals, so that for non-metals also
the factor Y is exceedingly small.
This |s among other things in accordance with the great electric
conductivity of metals and the exceedingly slight coiiductivity of
non-metals.
In the second place for the metals the positive ions possess the
greatest solubility, and for the non-metals the negative ions. This
accounts among other things for the difference in electromotive
