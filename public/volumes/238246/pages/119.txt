Now let •/ be a category of simplicial divisions of G analogous
to ip. The resulting simplicial divisions of g belong to a category ip
of the kind just described. Let G' ,(r' , ... be a sequence of indefini-
tely condensing simplicial approximations of (j corresponding to /, then,
at the same time, there is hereby determined a sequence g', g", . . .
of indefinitely condensing simplicial approximations of 7 corresponding
to \p. Since, in virtue of III, the value of (1) over (/") is equal to
the value of (2) over G^''\ there exisU, just as there does a value
of (1) over g for xp, a value of (2) over G for ■/, both values being
equal, and not changing if some other category of the same kind is
chosen in the place of either i|? or /•
h 2.
In introducing I.e. p. 70 the notion of a second derivative, we have
omitted to give the definition of the underlying concept of 7iorjnality
of an Sp provided with an indicatrix and an Sn-/, provided with
an indicatrix which are perpendicular to each other in an S,, pro-
vided with an indicatrix. This detinition we shall here give.
Let T be the point of intersection of Sp and S„--p, «j . . . a^, T
the indicatrix of S/j and /:?,.../?„ ^, T the indicatrix of 8,,-^; we call
Sf, normal to Sn—p and Sn~p postnorm.al to S^,, if «1 . . . «y, Jii„_-^;. . . i?i
is an indicatrix of S,,-
Thus, for some values of ?i the concepts normal and postnormal
are equivalent, for other values not equivalent.
Furthermore we call a /^-dimensional vector system V normal to
an [n — />)-dimen8ional vector system \V at the same point, and
W postnormal to V, if, with respect to a rectangular system of
coordinates the components of V are respectively normal to and of
equal scalar values as the components of IF.
In this terminology, the second derivative of the vector distribution
A^ is the normal distribution of the first derivative ot' the postnor-
mal distribution of ^' X.
