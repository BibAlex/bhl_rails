In this Zmax 19 <l>e measured ordinate of tlie higiiest point of the
^-curve; the bottom point of this ordinate was the zero-point xY,
from which cl must therefore be measured along the axis of abscissae
of the ^-curve. When a line is drawn parallel this axis and at a
distance ^ Z,n„x from it, parts will remain of the ordinates the
lengtli of which will again be a function of cI, which function we
shall call 1 (cl).
According to (19) and (20) we now have :
"•1

I{cl) = Z {cl) — 4 ■^max. = — r I X ("0 COS 4:71 Im dm .
(21)
When the same line is drawn through the Z' curve, the remain-
ing parts of the ordinates will represent a function II {cl') so that:
"'i

ir {cl') ^ Z' {cl') — è Z,nax. = - y X ("^) sin 4.T I'rn dm . . (22)
The zero point JV' on the axis of abscissae of the Z' curve may
be determined on the following consideration. The function II {cl')
is zero for /' = 0, but has several zero points, so that it is not yet
known which of them is to be taken as N'; it appears, however,
from equation (22) that the fnnction is uneven in /'. When, therefore,
of the function II we determine the zero point with respect to which
the other zero points lie sj^ra metrically, we have found the point
c'/= 0, hence the zero point N' on the axis of abscissae. This is
the zero point, from which cl' must be measured on the axis of
the ^'-curve. Especially for multichromatic light this symmetry will
be very apparent. The reasoning involves that observations must
have been made also for negative values of /', i.e. that we must
start with putting the movable prism somewhat nearer than would
correspond with /' = 0, hence with /= — d. When we, therefore,
begin with placing the prism at a distance greater than d before
the plane of reference R, and moving it from there with uniform
velocity, we begin with a negative value both of / and of /', so
that the initial points of the bands have negative abscissae.
We may cursorily remark that the quantit} ?; = c/ can be accurately
determined from the situation of the zeio points JV and xV.
The photographic plate was namely every moment struck by two
beams of light, the intensities of which depended on two parameters
