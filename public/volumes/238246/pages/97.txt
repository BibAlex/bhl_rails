ammonia converted into urea by
3 g. of Soja 1,33 C.C. -ïVN
6 g. of Soja 2.02 C.C. tVN.
March 28''' 1916. In the large cylinders 11.572 g. of ammonium
carbonate and 100 c.c. of water. In the small cylinders 190 g. of
H,SO, of about 0,8 N (1 gram = 7,85 c.c. iV N).
In two of the six large cj^linders 6 g. of Soja-meal, in two others
12 grams.
After 24 hours' standing at room temperature 250 c.c. of saturated
potassium carbonate and a few drops of octjl-alcohol were introduced
into each and the ammonia blown over for 48 hours.

May 16^h 1916. A solution of about 95 g. of ammonium carbonate
in 1 Litre of water was prepared and saturated with carbonic acid.
Two large cylinders, each with 100 c.c. of this solution and 250 c.c.
of saturated potassium carbonate were connected with small cylinders
containing each 174 g. H,SO, 0,8 N and all the ammonia blown
over into the acid by passing an air current for 48 hours.
Four large cylinders {A) received each 100 c.c. of the same ammo-
nium carbonate solution and 6 g. of Soja-meal.
Four others (B) each 100 c.c. of ammonium carbonate solution
and 12 g. of Soja-meal.
After 2 days at room temperature one cylinder ^ and one cylinder
B were analysed by introducing 250 c.c. of saturated potassium
carbonate and blowing over the ammonia into 174 g. acid for two
days. In the same way one A and one B were treated after 3 days,
and two cylinders A and two cylinders S after 4 days. See Table 24.
Evidently the equilibrium is scarcely reached in about 3 days. If
the activity had remained unchanged, it might have been reached
much sooner, or probably no synthesis at all had been effected.
According to what we have seen above, the urease had been gradually
