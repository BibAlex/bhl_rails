Since now at every point of the plane lim^^u = 0, at each point
of V one of tlie two indices A\ and iVj satisfies tlie relation

Besides at the derivative of the limiting function is zero, and
lim ^„(0) = + 00^).
It follows from § 8 that the function P* {.v, y) cannot be quasi-
uniformly convergent at the points of every set F. For T^ we choose:
.r = 0, O'^y^a. Since the continuous function P* {x,y) for y 7^
converges to zero and for y = to +00, the convergence is not
quasi-uniform.
14. If in a region G a series of analytical functions converges to
an analytical function and if, besides, the series of derived f unctions
converges quasi-uniformly at tlie points of every closed set contained
in G, then it is permitted to differentiate the series termioise every-
where within G.
In the first place we observe that every region within G contains
another region where the convergence is uniform '^), so that the
term wise differentiation is permitted in this last region.
Since f' iz) converges to a function which is continuous within G
and coincides on an everywhere dense set of points with f\z), we
have everywhere f'{z) = limf'{z).
