10. Influence of the concentration of enzyme.
In continuing the investigations of part 4 with smaller enzj'me-
concentrations it was first observed, tliat in the same conditions the
same quantity of Soja-meal did not alwaj^s give the same result. In
preparing the necessary solutions the distilled water had been freed
from carbonic acid by boiling in a tin coated copper flask. After
this method of purifying the distilled water had been replaced by
distilling the water once more in a Jena flask and glass condenser,
rejecting the first part of the distillate, more regularity seemed to
be obtained. Still, weighed off in such small amounts, the Soja-meal
appeared to be not quite homogeneous. An explanation of this fact
will be brought forward farther on.
Nevertheless important new results could be obtained in this way.
For the sake of the necessary constancy of pn the urea-concen-
tration in these experiments was again 0,01 "/o-
Taking the same unit as before the concentration of the urease
was now -^.
