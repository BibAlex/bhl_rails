8. The influence of other substances on the urease activity.
The question was raised, whether in liiese concentrated solutions
of urea the H-ion concentration was perhaps lowered also through
the slightly alkaline substance urea itself.
The electrometric measurement of the p^f in the 87o phosphate
solution showed indeed a distinct increase after addition of 8"/, urea.
It was, however, soon established, that this increase was not due
to a shifting of the true reaction to the alkaline side, but to a
diminution of both H-ions and OH-ions, or, in other words, to a
decreased dissociation of H^O in these concentrated solutions of urea.
This conclusion was readily arrived at by the following experiments.
The Ph was determined again in 8"/o phosphate solutions. Then
a second time after addition of a small amount of ammonia (1 c.c.
of To ^)- For each of these estimations 10 c.c. of 9.6''/j phos-
phate was brought with water or diluted ammonia to 12 c.c.
The results obtained are summarised as follows:

As will be seen from Sörensen's determinations of p^ in standard
phosphate mixtures, the bulfer-value of these solutions becomes
considerably diminished, when p^ approaches 8. Therefore the same
