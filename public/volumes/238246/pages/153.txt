A diaphragm wirh two fine apertures at the place of the points
Q and Q' casts two beams of light of the above mentioned intensity
on a photographic plate. When the movable prism is slowly shifted, the
intensities of these beams change on account of the change in the para-
meters / and /' in (14). Tfie difference /' — / remains, however,
constant, namely equal to v, which quantity is an instrument con-
stant, as appears from (10), if ft does not appear in it. For that the
prisms must be made of different size and so, that q^^ p -\- d. A
small error in their size once for all can be neutralised by turning
the plate PL over a small angle. Now v becomes = d, iience an
instrument constant. When the photographic plate is shifted over
large distances and in its own plane with a slight movement ot
the prism through coupling, and when care is taken that the shifting
of the plate is always proportional to that of the prism, and further
that the shifting of the prism always takes place witli uniform
velocity ^), the two beams will leave behind two bands on the
photographic plate, where the blackening is different point for point,
and which, when they are afterwards measured photometricall}'
with the photometer and thermopile of Dr. MoU;, yield two curves,
which will be of great importance for the determination of the
desired function cf){a:).
We shall call the curves that arise when the bands are measured,
Z{cl) or Z' {cV), according as their ordinates i-epresent the course
of the blackening in the lower or the upper band, which is, therefore,
made in Q oi' in Q. When - denotes the ratio of the shifting of the
c
prism, and the corresponding displacement of the photographic plate,
and when in the upper band that point is assumed as zero point
N that was placed in Q when the prism passed through the position
/=:0, then light, the intensity of which corresponds to the position
/ of the prism, and is therefore indicated by equation (4), will have
fallen on that band in a point whose abscissa amounts to c/ measured
1) In order to keep the time of exposure the same for every position of the prism.
