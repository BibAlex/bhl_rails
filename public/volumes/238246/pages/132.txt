SUMMARY.
1. Tlie solnbilit^^-isotherm in the system Na^O-ZnO-H^O was com-
pletely determined at 30°.
2. We found that tlie following- substances appeared as stable,
solid phases: zinc-oxide ZnO, zincate of sodium Na,0-ZnO-4:ti,0, the
monohydrate of sodium hydroxide NaOH-H^O.
3. The sodium zincate forms very strongly incongruent solutions,
by solutions below a concentration of 1 part of NaOH to 2 parts
of water it is decomposed while separating out ZnO.
4. The amorphous, gelatinous zinchydroxide must be considered as
a phase of a varying water-percentage; it cannot possibly be cleaned
of adsorbed ions. It is melastable as regards crystallized zinchydroxide.
5. Under special circumstances zinchydroxide is obtainable as a
crystalline phase of the constant composition Zn(0Hj5.
6. This crystallized hydroxide is metastable at 30° as regards ZnO.
The cost of these investigations has been partly defrayed by a
subsidy from the Van 't Hofi' Fund which was put at my disposal.
I here beg to express my cordial thanks to the Board of Admini-
stration of this F'und.
