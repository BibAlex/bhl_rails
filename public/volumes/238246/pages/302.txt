we now proceeded as follows:
A certain number of loops were severed from the fresh small
intestine, which had been cautiously cleaned with Tyrode solution;
their movements were registered by Magnus's method. The vessels
containing (he loops were tilled with 75 c.c. Tyrode solution of 38°C.
When small quantities of atropiu (0,002 — 0,01) were added, the
pendulum movements of the loops got invariably smaller.
This is illustrated in Fig. 1.

Pendulum movements of the rabbit's small intestine suspended directly after
killing the animal. By administering 0,01 mgr. of atropin the magnitude of the
movement is reduced by half.
Fig. 2.
The loop whose movements are registered here is the same as in fig. 1. The
previous action of the atropin (0.01 mgr) is entirely eliminated through washing
three times with Tyrode solution. 15 mgr. of atropin now yields a strong inhibi-
tion on the movements while the tonus is only slightly lessened.

A loop of the same gut, standing for 3 X -"^ hrs. in the refrigerator in horse-
serum that was repeatedly refreshed. Subsequently the loop is washed out eight
times with warm Tyrode solution and no longer reacts on 0.01 mgr. of atropin.
After 15 mgr. of atropin a marked stimulation appears together with a conside-
rable increase of tonus.
After this the loops of intestine were washed out with fresh Tyrode
solution three times every 10 minutes, by which, as we know from
our own experience, the etfect brought about by the preceding small
atroi)in-dosis was again completely eliminated.
When thereupon a moderate dosis (15 n)gr.) of atropin was added,
the pendulum movements became considerably smaller in far and
