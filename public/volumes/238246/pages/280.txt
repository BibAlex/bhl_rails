The only |)ractical method for the preparation of the «-eulphopro-
pioiiic acid lias hithei-to heen the one fonnd by Franchimont ^) i. e,
the action of snl[)hnric acid with propionic acid anhydride.
Besides Franchimont's general method, an analogical method has
been nsed by Melsens*) for the preparation of the snlphonacelic
acid, the first term of the snlphocarbonic acids, namely the action
of snlphnric acid anhydride with acetic acid.
These two methods show much similarity. In both cases the
mixed aidiydride, the acetylsnlphnric acid, is formed as an interme-
diary prodnct, as Franx-himont ') had already supposed and Stiij.ich *)
afterwards established, and as V^\n Peski ') proved for the reaction
of Melsens.
With a view to comparing it with the method of Franchimont
we have applied Met.sens' method also to propionic acid, by treating
it with sidphnrtrioxide.
In both cases the reaction turned out, just as in the case of the
acetic acid, to be indirect, while the mixed anhydride, the pro-
pionylsiilphuric acid, must be taken to be the intermediary product.

When the substances are mixed carefully whilst cooling, a (.'olour-
less, very viscous licpiid is formed, which yields the sulphopiopionic
acid only at a higher temperature, with development of heat and
brown coloration.
We were able to follow the process of this reaction by titration,
