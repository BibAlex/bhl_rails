ansiuered by the theorem of Pincherle, at least not in a simple
manner, as will appear from what follows. In order to investigate
the question we should commence to deduce the series (2) from
the given function a)(.(;). Next we should examine whether the func-
tion (f{t) represented b}' it has the required properties: to be regular
without the circle (1,1), and on the circumference of it of fuiite
order. For this we should try to transform the above series into
another according to negative integral powers of t — 1

The relation between the coefficients of the two series is given
bj the equations
cn = to (« + 1) - r^ j to (n) + . . . + (-1)" to (1) = A" [Ui (1)] ') . (4)
and
co(n -f l) = c„ -f r^^'jc, + . . . +c„ . . . . (4')
Bj- means of (4) we must see if the series (3) converges without
the circle (1,1), and further if the characteristic /' of the coefficients

is not positive infinite; the latter being the condition that <f{t) shall
be -of non-positive infinite order on the circle (1,1).
But the relation (4) is rather intricate and so it may be very
difficult, if not impossible, to perform the just mentioned research.
Suppose this, however, possible, and let /.' differ from -}- oo. Then
we have to examine whether the given function ay{x) is really the
coefficientfunction of (f{t). For there are a great many functions ^{x)
giving rise to the same generating function (f{t), viz. all those
contained in the equation
o (.^•) = CO (..) -f F (.v)
where F (.v) is a function that vanishes for positive integral values
of X. It is therefore necessary to consult the definition of the coef-
ficient-function given by Pincherle and to apply it to the obtained
</ {t) in order to see if the original function to {.v) is the result. But
this is again not very easy. If the characteristic ).' defiued by (5)
is less than — 1, then (p (t) is finite and continuous along the circum-
