given by Montkl with tlio |>iii|»()se of refuting the assertion of
P0MPE.IU that it slioiild be iieces.saiy — in order to lender the limiting
function ƒ of a within (r convergcMit series of analytical functions
analytical in G — to suppose that it is permitted to integrate the
series termwise along every ciii've of integration in (V '). In fact
Montel's series converges lo zero throughout the whole plane whilst
the termwise integration along the. real axis from to J yields
not but 1, so a uniform convergence in evei-y limited region is
here altogether out of the question. We state, besides, that it is
neither permitted to differentiate Montki/s series termwise for ; =: 0,
as this would yield the result -\- 00 instead of zero. The example of
MoNTEL is embraced by none of the foregoing theorems. The want
is now felt of a necessary and sufticient condition that a sequence
of analytical fnnctions, convergent in the interior of G, should
have an analytical limiting function. Necessary it is that the con-
vergence of the sequence be (|uasi-uniform in every closed region
within G, because of the continuity of /' and f. If, conversely, this
quasi-uniform convergence is given, then it follows that f is conti-
nuous within G, but not that ƒ is analytical, as an example of
MoNTEii *) shows. In the following a necessary and sufticient con-
dition will be deduced among other things.
