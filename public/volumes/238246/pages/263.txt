large dosis of morpliin to some patients, after a few days a dosis
of soopolainin. and again some days later iialf the dosis of each
poison. In control-experiments, some patients were first given the
niorph. -\- scopol. and afterwards the two poisons separately. In all
cases the administi-ation of the niixtnre resnlted in a general narcosis,
which did not occur after morphin or scopolamin alone. This then
is a case of true "potentiation".
This finding does, however, not yield great profit for the clinic,
since this result is not always obtained and, as to sensitiveness to
scopolamin, patients differ too much to rendei- a correct dosage
possible.
Summary.
Morphin produces a narcotic effect in rabbits, in dogs (and also
in men), but the curve repi-esenting the relation between dosis and
effect is a parabola, which means that with the smaller doses
a small increase in the doses causes a considerable increase in
the narcotic effect, whereas with the larger doses a similar increase
of dosis brings about a much smaller increase of the Jiarcotic action.
Scopolamin narcotizes the rabbit. The concentration-effect curve
concurs with that of morphin. Its stimulating effect is obvious in
the dog, in man its action is evidently narcotic.
No "potentiation" is obtained in the rabbit with the scopolamin-
morphin mixture, either by our reflex-method or by Hauckold's
method. Neither was "potentiation" dedected in the dog.
According to Schneiderlin "potentiation" occurs in man, but it is
presumably not constant.
