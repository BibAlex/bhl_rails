within W, then we start from the known expansion with known
remainder of 1 : {z — .r) in such a series. In tlie same way we may
reach our present purpose, if we use the known expansion with
knoivn remainder of the just mentioned elementary function in a
binomial series, viz.
:=z 7 m 1- ■ • ■ ■ — ■ . .
z—x ^L^ (e_^). . .(e — |i-w) (2— /?). . .(^-/J— n+l) z—x
Substituting this expression for 1/^ — x in the integral (12) and
choosing the path of integration so as to include, besides the point
z = X, the points 2 = /5, /:? -f- 1, . . . , ^ -|- n — 1, we find ^)

Formula (13) is the ordinary formula of interpolation of Newton
with a remainder added to it and valid for all complex .«-values
lying within W.
If all points z=z ^3, /? -f- 1 , . . . , ^ -|- n — 1, are to lie within the
integration-curve IF, this curve will in general have to be modified
with increasing n. It is required to choose W as fit as possible, that
is to say: so that the remainder (13') tends to zero with indefinite
increase of n, and that yet the aggregate of functions to{x) for which
this takes place, is as extensive as possible. If, now, the form (7)
is taken as majorant-value of these functions, where the number a
is, as yet, left undetermined and the number y, in order to have a
definite case, is chosen zero (so that /? > 0), it is found after a
rather long but principally not difficult inquirement: 1. that the
most favourable integration-curve is a circle with z =i n as centre
and n as radius so that it passes through the origin ; 2. that for a
a complex number may be taken lying on the circumference of the
circle (1,1), with the specifications concerning the domains of validity
already mentioned in the Statement of the above theorem.
We may further observe that, in case the number c in formula
1) If a few points /?, /? + !,,.., are excluded from the closed curve W, we
obtain an expression the further examination of which leads to the so-called sero-
expansions, which are treated in an elementary way by Pincherle (Rendic. d.
R. Accad. d. Lincei, 1902. 2e Sem.)
