to be considered as an advanced potential.
Every fimction (f^ [x, i/, z, t), therefore, irhlck mtisjles the differential
equation (3), may be considered either as a delayed or as an advanced
potential, if only the contribution to the potential ivhich is due to
the boundary surface F {which may also be moved to injinity) is
taken into account.
It follows that every electro-magnetic field, i. e. every field for
which the Maxweij.-Lorentz equations hold, may be calculated for
a moment t either from the condition at the time t — — or from
c
that at the time / -j , if only the conti-ibution by the boundary

surface is taken into account. This contribution is necessarily diffe-
rent in the two cases.
If the surface F is made to move to infinity and if at the same
time the condition is laid down, that at the boundary the surface-
integral has the value zero, if the potential is considered as a delayed
potential, the ordinary solution is obtained of the problem to calcu-
late the field from the charges. Hut this solution is oidy one parti-
cular one: there are an infinite number of othei-s.
The author may be excused for having discussed this question
at some length: it seemed to him that it is not alvvays sufficiently
kept in view.
We shall now prove, that every periodical motion of electricity
allows the assumption of a field such that no energy is radiated.
The separate points of the electric charges will be identified by
means of 3 parameters %, ^i, ?. Every set of values |, ?;, C, therefore,
denotes a definite point in the electricity sharing the motion of the
latter. The motion is completely described by the equations

that is to say, for given values of I, ^i, b the coordinates x,y,z are
