functions of the time. Let iis consider the motion represented by
equations (7) as being completely given. This motion we shall call
motion 1. We therefore assume, that .i', //, c are known functions of
?, 7j, ?, t for all valnes of t from — oo {o -\- <x>. We then calculate
the electro-magnetic (ield by means of delayed potentials and choose
the boundary conditions in such a manner, that the surface-integral
in (6) becomes zero for each potential-component (fy,, when the
surface F moves to infinity. The tield is then singly determined by
the motion of the electricity. We shall call the field obtained /if/f/1 .
In this case we obviously have a ladiation of energy.
We shall further consider a different motion of the electricity,
motion 2, which is obtained from motion 1 by i-eversing the sign of ^
.r = ^ (5, % ?, — 0. I
y := y (,;, ï^, ?, — i), motioil 2.
Z — Z (i, 7^, ?, - t), '
In this system all paths are evidently described in a direction
opposite to that of motion 1. For motion 2 we again calculate the
electro-magnetic field by means of delayed potentials and with the
same boundary-conditions as before. We shall again obtain a field
with energy-radiation, which we shall call field 2.
If the motion 1 is periodical, this will also be the case for motion
2 and the radiation dnring one period is equal for field 1 and
field 2.' We now pass from field 2 to a new field 3, by reversing
the sign of t and at the same time the components of the magnetic
field ^x, ^i/, ^z- It is easily shown, that with this change of sign
the Maxwell-Lorkntz field-equations remain valid. As ;! changes sign,
the motion of the electricity is reversed. IVie motion of the electricity
is therefore /rrecisely the same in field 3 as in field 1. Owing to the
i-eversal of the sign of ^j;, ^y, 5B,, (lS\r, (5,^, Sri'etaining the same sign)
the direction of the energy-stream is reversed, so that in field 3 we
have a radiation of energy inwards. F'or a periodical motion of the
electric chaiges the amount of energy drawn in during a period is
the same as the radiation outwards in fields 1 and 2.
It is fnrther easily found that field 3 may be calcnlated from
advanced potentials, with a zero-contribution of infinity. If on the
other hand the |)Otentials are taken as delayed, the contribution of
infinity is not equal to zero.
We now superpose field J and 3, which is possible since the
field-equations are linear. In the two fields taken separately the
electricity has the same motion, which therefore remains the same
in the combined field. The density of the electricity on the other
