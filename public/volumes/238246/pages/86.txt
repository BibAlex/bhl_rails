§ 3. Virialcoefjicients.
Bj means of the above results some of the coefficients in tlie
empirical equation of state
pvA = Aa + BAdA + CAdA' 4- I>AdA'^- ^.1^^'+ ^AdA ' ')
could be computed. These calculations only embrace the coefficients
^A, Ca, Da and in one case Ea; for the densities which were
reached are not so high as would be necessary for the deduction
of Fa and in most cases of Ea also; these were therefore found
from the reduced equation of state VII. A. 3*) or VII. 1.'), in which
the coefficients ^ and A are identical. In some of the calculations,
