After leaving tlie six pairs of cylinders for 24 hours at room
temperature, shaking through the Soja-meal from time to time, the
connections with the absorbing cylinders were opened and 250 c.c.
of saturated potassium carbonate was run into each of the larger
cylinders through the long tubes. By then passing through for
24 hours vigorous currents of air, washed through sulphuric acid, all
the ammonia was blown over into the sulphuric acid.
A few drops of octyl-alcohol, run in at the same time with the
Soja-meal, prevented foaming.
The quantities of ammonium carbonate and sulphuric acid were
chosen such, that only a few c.c. of NaOH yo N were required to
titrate the free sulphuric acid, which was left.
The results of a preliminary experiment on March 14'^'., 1916
were as follows:

Afterwards, however, it became evident, that an appreciable quan-
tity of NHj was developed from the Soja-meal ^).
In order to estimate this, in each of two large cylinders 250 c.c.
of saturated potassium carbonate, 100 c.c. of water and 4 drops of
octyl-alcohol were introduced. Moreover in the one 6, in the other
12 g. of Soja-meal. Each was connected with one of the small
cylinders, into which 5 c.c. H^SO^ f N and some water had been
brought. After some 5 hours of blowing through the whole was
left at room temperature till the next day and the blowing was
started again and continued till the following day.
The 6 g. of »Soja-meal had given J,l c.c. of NH, -fV N.
The 12 g. of Soja-meal 1,65 c.c. of NH^ iV N.
Hence in the mean for 6 g. of Soja-meal 0,97 c.c. iV N.
1) Special experiments established that no NH3 was formed out of urea by the
'prolonged action of saturated potassium carbonate.
