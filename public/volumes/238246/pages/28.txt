the function to {,v) can be expanded as a binomial series

The special value — 1|' of the argument « of a is such that the
expression a^~'', x — y being given, has the greatest modulus com-
pared to those for other values of a on the circumference of the
circle (1,1)- // the inequality (7) holds for fixed a-value on the circle
(1,1), tlien expansion of ta (x) in the series (10) is possible in the domain
R{x)yi + ^-l . (9')

The sufficient condition for the expansion of a function in a
binomial-series contained in the above theorem seems, indeed, very
simple. If a function a> (.i') can be represented by the equality
oi (x) = (x + b)^ c^ (.1 (x) ...... (11)
where c is a fixed number ivithin the circle (1,1) and fi (.r) a function
remaining within finite limits in R (x) > y, then it satisfies the ine-
quality (7) for a value of / differing arbitrarily little from — oo,
and therefore it can be expanded in a binomial-series in the domain
R{x)>Y. For c =: 1 formula (11) gi\'es an expression which shows
that all functions regular in the finite part of the half-plane R (x) > y
and vanishing at infinity may be expanded as a binomial-series in
that domain; further all functions becoming infinitely large at
infinity of an order lower than a certain finite power of x; so all
irrational and logarithmic expressions.
The way in which we have arrived at our theorem is substanti-
ally the same as that followed in the ordinary theory of functions
of a complex variable, in order to obtain the expansion of a function
in a power-series; it is founded upon the fundamental theorem of
Cauchy. According to this we have
-f-
w
where the integral is taken round a closed curve W, within and
upon which to{x) is regular, and which contains the point z^x
in its interior. If we wish to deduce from this integral an expansion
according to positive integral powers of x — a, a being a number
