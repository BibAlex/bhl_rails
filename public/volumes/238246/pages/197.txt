tlieni an intact upper jaw as was the case with the raonstrura,
mentioned nnder 5.
Now and then the two local destroying processes are united. Then
comes a massive tissure and the monstrosities appear, as described
under 4 i.e. synotia with anophthalmia, aprosopia and agnatia.
The series of the dit√Øerent cyclopian deformities is joined to that
of the synotian deformities. In this series one case is most remark-
able, i.e. if the local destroying process, commencing at the first
branchial arch spreads so far proximal wards that the upper jaw
totally falls out.
Then the eyes are going to meet each other in the mid-line, while
the maxillar part of the orbit is lost. Then also two eyes are found
in a four eye-lid ring, but they are no longer placed in an orbit.
In that case there is found a cebocephalic form of cyclopia, with a
complete nose above the eyes, and a complete rhinencephalon.
To me it seems even {)ossible thai the local destroying process
may spare the first branchial arch, only destroying the upper jaw\
In such a case there results a cyclopia, perhaps always the cebo-
cephalic form, but without loss of the ethmoid bone, with a com-
plete rhinencephalon and without synotia.
