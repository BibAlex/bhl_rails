Unfortunately, however, a fatal error has slipped in. For to ^ = 0.6
does not correspond /; =: 350, hut — (intGr|)ola(ing graphically) —
7;, = 506, which yields 7'= 6600° instead of 8700°, so that agreement
is out of the question.
A serious objection to the whole method seems perfectly obvious
to me, namely this:
The assumption that all kinds of light come to us from one
photospheric surface, in other words that light of various wavelengths
should come from the same depth of the sun, appears more and
more untenable in the light of recent researches (see e.g. the thesis
for the doctorate of J. Spukkrboer "Verstrooiing van licht en iiitensi-
teitsverdeeling over de zonneschijf" (19J7j (Dispersion of light and
Distribution of Intensity over the Sun's Disc)). If, however, in reality
light of different wavelengths originates from different parts of the
sun, it becomes very questionable whether we shall be allowed to
apply Pj.anck's foi-mula, as we saw Dkfant do. For this would mean
that we supposed every kind of light to have, as it were, a, kind
of "photosphere of its own", which radiates as a black body, the
photosphere for the greater wavelengths lying deeper than that for the
smaller. It might then be expected that the temperature determined
with Planck's formula, becomes a function of /, i. e. T would be
the greater as X increases.
In this latter remark we have a means to investigate whether
the hypothesis that the photospheres overla[) each other like scales
can find a semblance of justification.
By grairhical interpolation from the values of table II I construed

require, as was already remarked before, always two values of P
