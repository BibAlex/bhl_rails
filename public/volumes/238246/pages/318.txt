As is evident, the number of karjokineses reaches its uiaximuni
between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. (solar time), which agrees with tiie
well-known fact that good cell-divisions in Hyacinth and Allinni are
found between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. From 11 a.m. the number of
cell-divisions decreases to 2.05 7o ^^ 3 p. m.
I found the greatest number of karyokineses with the onion in
the dark at 6 a.m., 4.46 7o- At 12 a.m. this had slightly decreased
to 4.287,, and at 6.30 p.m. the decrease was still greater. At 6 a.m.
and at 12 a.m. the maximum number of karyokineses in the dark
exceeded the maximum number of cell-divisions found in (he day-
light, while the maximum number of karyokineses in the light sur-
passed the minimum number of cell-divisions in the dark oidy by
a slight degree; so that the conclusion seems justified: The number
of karyokineses in the rootcells of Allium Oepa increases in the
dark, which is stated by Karstb:n') for Spirogyra and other plants.
When w^e compare in the tables III and IV the number of
spirema, loose chromosome stages with the number of monaster
stages, then we see in the first table from 11 till 3 o'clock an in-
crease of the number of spirema and loose chromosome stages and
a decrease of the monaster stages. This would point to an increase
in the number of cell-divisions and nevertheless the total number of
mitoses has diminished. We see the same phenomenon on table IV
from 6 a. m. to 12 a. m.
By considering spirema, loose chromosomes and monaster as one
stage (prophase) the number of nuclei in prophase, in (able III at
11 a.m. is 2.02 7o a'ld at 3 p.m. 1.74 7o> ^vhich points to a decrease.
The same can be applied to table IV. At 6 a. m. 4.59 7o and at
12 a.m. 3.98 7o ^''d at 6.30 p.m. 2.31 7o i^ i'^ prophase, so there
is a total decrease. In my opinion this fact is a confirmadon of the
general conception to consider spirema, loose chromosomes and
monaster as one stage. ')
