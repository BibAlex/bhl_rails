principal units, from which follows y^ = y, ^ . . . = i/j = 1. Therefore
the principal units may be arranged in such way

The same reasoning holding for the M the principal units may
be arranged in such a way

The coefficients of both expansions are equal, but for p ]> 5 the
operators / do not have both times the same order, e.g. for p = 6,
using both indices :
11 T 10 T dj- 7t 8r 6r 47- 5 J 3t 2r Ir
1^ ' 2-^ ' 3^ ' é-* ' 5^ ' 6^ ' T-* ' 8-^ ' 9^ ' 10^ ' 11^ • •
Furtheron we shall no longer use for the / the indices on the
right of p. 257.
From (26), (27) and (7) we find the relation:
m a
^,l=dlAiMj = ölAiMj (28)
As it is easily proved, that Ai Mj contains K^ just once, the
coefticients d'^ are identical with the coefficient {xn in (20) and the
6ij therefore equal to the group characters in the first row of
Frobenius. We need only know therefore this first row. P'or the
case that Ai = sAi we have
^>=f^_|) (29)
and for Ai = cc.2Ai

(fij = ->-^^— rf (30)
For more general formulae the cited papers of Frobenius and
BuRNSiDE may be referred to.
So we have obtained this theorem :
Principal theorem B. Every affinor of the p"' degree can be expanded
