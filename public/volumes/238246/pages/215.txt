occur. Hence in tlie search for series by the aid of equal resolutions
hardly any result can be obtained by means of these curves. I have
also tried it for tin and for antimony lines, which had a splitting
up between 60 and 65, but likewise with no success.
1 further examined whether there existed simple i-elations between
the distances of the componeids for more than triple resolutions,
which were rather accurately measured (weight 3 or 4). For Sb 3740,
Sb 267J, and Sb 2878 I did not find simple relations. For Sn 3331
the distances of the components ai-e in the ratio of 3 : 2, when the
values 59,3 and 39,5, which lie within the limit of errors, are taken
for them. For Pb 2802 the ratio is also as 3 : 2 with the values
49,1:32,7, Pb 2873 gives 54,7:41,0 = 4:3; Sb 3723 gives
72,6 : 36,3 = 2 : 1. There is, however, no mutual connection or a
simple relation to the normal resolution.
The results may be briefly summarized as follows :
The ZKKMAN-effect was measured of 35 tin lines, 23 lead lines,
27 antimony lines, and 16 bismuth lines. In this deviations were
found with Purvis' results which refer only to a few lines, probably
in consequence of his less accurate measurements. No relation was
found between the resolutions of those lines of the examined metals
for which it was proposed to arrange them in series or those which
are arranged according to the laws of the 2"^^ kind of Kayser and
RuNGE. The resolutions are pretty i-egularly distributed between
values which amount to about 1 and 1,5 times the normal resolution.
As an incidental result I found that a number of lines given by
Schippers for antimony, are not real.
