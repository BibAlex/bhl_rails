12. It is convenient to observe on this occasion that by means of
the proposition of N°. 10 we may infer from the tiist part of for-
mula (43) that never convergence of the series of factorials (6) takes
place for R{x) «^ ^, a truth already shewn in another way in W. 9
of the preceding communication.
For, if the upper limit of Sn for 7z = oo is equivalent to n^, then
the function represented by the series
00
is, for t = i, at most of order 1 : (1 — ty+^ and hence ff {t) is at
most of order 1 : (1 — tf, so that the number P. is not greater than (^>^,
whereas the limit between convergence and divergence of the series
of factorials according to the lemma mentioned, is afforded by R{j;) = 0.
13. At the end of the first communication we said that, if a
certain argument mentioned there and used by Nielsen were not
eri'oneous, then another very general case of the possibility of expand-
ing the integral
1
si{x)= ^<p{t){\-tY-^dt (1)
%J
in a series of factorials would be proved by it, viz. the case when
the series of factorials corresponding to that integral converges. We
shall now prove that this case, though not established by
Nielsen, is, indeed, exact. In order to do this we shall make use
of the following lemmas:
1. // the series of factorials converges for a certain value x := c,
then it converges for any value of x whose real part R{x) is greater
than that of c.
Let

r{c + m^ 1)

then we find on summation by parts
