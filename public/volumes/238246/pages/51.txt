correspond to a common element of I^^^ and V^^, we obtain
I Lii~L\ <C -g-^ + i^ 4" i^^=^ ^0^' every aggregate E corresponding
to an element of W^ .
6. Finally we prove, that the aggregate K [as regards the covering
by the parts of VW) likewise has the limit L. We obtain:
\E—L\ ^ \E—Lq\ 4- \Lg—L\,
E being an element of G. Owing to the nniform convergence the
positive number 6^ can be determined so, as to give \E — Lq\<^\s
if E be an element of Gd^ , i. e. coi-responds to an element of We^ . At
the same time we can ö^ determine so, as to obtain \Lg — L\<^^s
if G corresponds to an element of }\. If now rf be the smallest
of the numbers d^ and d,, then the inequality j^' — L\ <^{s -\- ^8=:s
is satisfied, if E corresponds to an element of Vö and to an element
of We (hence to an element of F<f W^ ), that is if E be an element
of Ks .
7. Summarizing we observe:
If the prodiictaggregate VW has been covered luith numbers and
if the aggregates G of those -numbers corresponding to a same element
of V converge uniforndy to their limits Lq {as regards the covering
of die positive numbers by the parts of W), the aggregates H of the
numbers corresponding to a same element of W having the limits
Ell i^^s regards the covering by the parts of V), then the aggregate
of the numbers Lq {as regards the covering by the f/arts of T) has
a limit, which is at the same time the limit of the 7iiimbers Lh {as
regards the coverinq by the parts of W) and is the limit of the
whole aggregate of numbers {as regards the covering by the parts
of VW).
The equality of the two first-mentioned \'\m\{B mesin^ commutatirity
of two limittransitions. One of the limittransitions relates to the
covering by the parts of W, the other to the covering by the paits
of F.
