PiNCHERLE has given a necessary and sufficient condition for the
expansion of a function in a binomial series {Binomialkoeffzienten-
reilie) ^). It runs thus :
The necessary and sufficient condition that an analytic function
ui{x) may be expanded in a series of the form
tt> (x) — 2» <^n\ I (1)
is that a)(,r) be co efficient- f unction {fonction coefficiente) of
another analytic funtion qit), lohich is regular and zero at infinity
and ivhose singidarities lie all within the circle (1,1), 2vith centre t=l
and radius r = 1, or on the circumference of it, provided that, in
the latter case, the order of (f{t) on the circumference, taken in the
sense defined by Haüamard, be finite or negative infuite^).
By a coefficient function lo{.v) of an analytic function rf{t) of the
kind mentioned P[NCHER1-e means a function which can be deduced
from q[t) in a more or less simple manner, acconling to the order
of <f{t). The relation between the two functions is, however, always
such that conversely (fit), called by Pincherle the (^^>2é?ra/m^ function
(fonction génératrice) of uj{x), follows from ixj{.c) by the equation
00
•t-^ CO (n -+- 1)
This means: the coefficients of the series of negative integral
powers of t, in which f/{t) may be expanded in a neighbourhood
of ^ ^ GO, are equal to the values of oj{.v) for positive integral values
of .^' ; the name coef f cientf unction for to(.c) is due to this circum-
stance.
The question now arises, how it must be discriminated if & given
function may ne expanded in a binomial series. This question is not
