it round the bitemporal axis (360°), it is principally the obliqui
which react, whereas the two eyes roll in the same direction. Starting
from the normal position a;id turning the head round the occipital-
caudal axis (360°), it is especially the recti superior and inferior
which react, and the eyes show opposed vertical deviations.
Starting from the side-position and turning the head round its
venter-dorsal position (360^), both groups of strings react and
the eye-positions are the combined results of opposed vertical devia-
tions and rotatory movements equally directed.
6. After extirpation of the labyrinth on one side the vertical
deviations of the eye and the rotatory movements continue for both
eyes. One labyrinth influences the obliqui of both eyes and the
rollings in the same sense; however the recti (sup. and inf.) of the
two eyes and the vertical deviations of the eyes are influenced in the
opposed sense.
For both eyes one labyrinth brings about the greatest vertical
deviation of the eye with respect to its normal positions when it
is lowest down, whereas the head is in side-position. Then the rectus
super, of the same side and the rectus inf. of the crossed side are
in a state of greatest contraction.
One labyrinth brings about, for both eyes, the greatest rotatory
movements by contraction of the obliq. infer., when the head stands
with its muzzle vertically downward.
On the other hand the gieatest rotatory movements of both eyes
by contraction of the obliqui superior are brought about by one
labyrinth, when the head stands with its muzzle vertically upwards.
