simplicial approximations P' , P", ... of F corresponding to a
category ip of simplicial divisions. If the values of (3) over /-*', P", . . .
converge to a limit which is independent of the choice of /' so far
as it is left free by xp, then we call ihis limit the value of (3) over
F for ip.
III. We shall now occupy ourselves with the value of (1) over
the boundary ^ of a /^-dimensional simplex o provided with an
indicatrix and situated in S. In doing so we take it that the indi-
catrices of ,'•? and o correspond, that is to say, the indicatrix of an
arbitrary (/> — l)-(limensional side of *> is obtained by placing the
vertex of n which does not belong to this side last in the indicatrix
of <'t and subsequently omitting it. We begin by confining ourselves
to the contribution of the single term

to the value of (1) over ^. By a suitable simplicial division i, of
the space (^Vi, ■ ■ • ^'a ) we determine a simplicial division of ji,
whose base simplexes correspond in pairs to those of {xu^, . . .Xr,, _^).
The family of those (?<(—/) -f- l)-dimensional spaces within which
Xy,^, . . . x._, are constant, cuts the plane /^-dimensional space in
which (1 is conrained, in a family of straight lines which connect
pairs of corresponding base simplexes of /•? into /^-dimensional trun-
cated simplicial prisms. If e^ and e^ are a pair of corresponding base
simplexes of /i, d the concomitant truncated simplicial prism, /aline
segment having components ;v. , . . . ?v. which leads from, a point
of e^ to the corresponding point of e^, then the contribution of the

e, becomes

where A denotes a point of 'X which may be different for the diffe-

respect to e^iu^ . . . y. for indefinite condensation of $.
Now let B^Bj. . . . B,, be a vertex indicatrix of ^, and -.^Vy the
