for {)<x<a (ind has <( fniite derivative /'{()) at 0, and if /{u) for

a necessary and snfficient condition that it should be permitted to
"differentiate term-wise at 0" i.e. that lim f' {0) should be /'' (0), is:
the quasi-uniform convergence of the sequence of functions

ip (.1', ?/) everywhere converges to a continuons function, i.e. quasi-
uniformly in every finite region so that the criterion given in ^ 3
is satisfied. Accordingly ƒ ' (0) is finite. However, if we choose
5 <;^ Y^ and the number of indices is finite, then for every x which
is small enough we have for each of these indices ƒ* (.«) ^ V»»
whilst for .1' ^ we have Urn ƒ* (x) = 0. Tiie criterion, enunciated
in this § is therefore not satisfied. Accordingly we have
lim/^^ (0)=r 1 7^/(0).

The foregoing theorems can be immediately extended to the
complex plane and are capable of analogous pi'oofs.

5. Let there be given a series of functions f^ {2),ft{z), ■ ■ ■ , each
of which is analytical in the interior of the cii'cle \z\<^a, and
convergent within this region. We shall now demonstrate the follow-
ing theorem :
A necessary and sufficient condition that the limiting function f
should be analytical nnthin \z\<^a is the quasi-uniform convergence
of the sequence of functions

in common with the sets {x == z, y -^ z) and ix ^ z, y =: z).
