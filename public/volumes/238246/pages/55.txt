and yield the acetate of cinnamic alcohol. Tlie latter could not be
found.
Anethol and formaldehyde.
One graniinol. anelliol is stirred with a solution of two grammol.
formaldehyde in 30 7o sulphuric acid for- three days, the product
separated in the usual way yields, when distilled in vacuum :
Methylene ether of p. methoxyplienylbutylglycol.
A colourless, viscous liquid, boiling-point 168° — 170° pressure

It does not react with a GRiGNARD-solution at a normal temperature
and does not decolorize a bromine-solution.
Various efforts made to saponify the methylene ether to the cor-
respondent glycol failed, resinification always set in or the ether
remained unaltered. By leaving the ether for a fortnight in contact
with 85 7o formic acid, an oil was obtained, in which such an
amount of formic acid was chemically bound as corresponded to
35 7o di-formiate; saponification and distillation however, yielded an
inconstantly boiling liquid.
Oxydation of the methylene ether.
In order to demonstrate, that with the anethol the formaldehyde
had really reacted with the C =C group from the side-chain, the methy-
lene ether was oxydized with potassium-permanganate. An acid was
obtained with a meltingpoint of 182° — 183°, and which revealed no
depression when mixed with anisic acid.
Hence it appears, that in these circumstances formaldehyde does
not react with the benzene nucleus.
