products were still nitritic. Yet 1 performed with the gelatinous zinc-
hjdroxide some measurements concei-iiing the solubility in NaOH,
not because the values determined caj» have an absolute significance,
but exclusively with the purpose to investigate whether this hydroxide
reveals a higher solubility than ZnO, and consequently must be
considered as metastable towards the latter. This proves indeed to
be so, as the subjoined numbers demonstrate; the points found lie
considerably above the curve of solubility (AB) of ZnO. At the
same time it appears that the solubility decreases in proportion as
the hydroxide is kept for a longer time. This too is in favour of
the statement, that these products must be considered as metastable
phases inclining to stabilisation to ZnO.

It may be concluded from the above that we must consider the
amorphous, gelatinous hydroxides as phases of varying water-percen-
tage, they besides being extremely difficult to purify. There now
