Since lim /'*((), z) ^ /''(O) and liinf* (0, 2) =,/" (0), it is possible to
determine a niiniber ^ such that
l/*(0.^)-/: (0,^ii <e for \z\<:<f.
Since at the points of the annular region (f^\Z\^l> the function
/'* (0, s) converges to the continuous function /*(0, 2). this convergence
is quasi-uniform there i.e.: from a unite number of indices > TV at
every point z of the annular region an index Uz may be chosen
which satisfies
|/*(0,^)-/T (0,^)|<€.
At every point <^ \z\ ^ b therefore from a finite number of indices
^ jV such a choice can be made, which establishes the theorem.
13. Some of the results here obtained we shall apply to Montei/s
example, which was cited in the introduction and is reproduced below :
The function w (z) = ?i'2<?-"'-' tends to zero as n -^ go for all real values
of z. Now consider the three rectangles /„ I — n ^ x^ n, — ^r-^y ^^ I,
llni— n< X ^n, — ^ y ^ ?i ) and /7/„ ( — u 5 '^' = ^^' — '* ~y = J •
There exists a polynomium Pn {z) which within /„ differs less
1 1
than — from 7,, (z) and within //„ and ///„ less than - from zero.

Evidently the function P„ (2) tends to zero for 71 -^cc thi-oughout
the whole plane. According to the theorem established in § 5 the
function if?,, {x,y,z) must converge quasi-uniformly at the points of
every set V: I\ {x^, y^, 0). P, (^•„ y,,0), . . . where x,, ^ 0, y^ ^ 0,
lim .Vk = a.Y]d limyk = 0. That this is really the case may be pro-
k= 00 k= 00
ved as follows: Choose an arbitrary pair of numbers t, iV. Let
1
JV, be ^N and at the same time ^ From a certain index k„
onwards a\ and y, are both internal to /., , so that
"^N, ^^i' ^k' ^' ^ ^^ ' ^ I ^ 4iV„ ^ 2
Hence a number (^ exists such that for j -«^ i ^ r5and| y^ | ^ ^' we
have
I IV. (^. y,- 0) i< '
This, we remind, is the case from a certain index ^, onwards.
