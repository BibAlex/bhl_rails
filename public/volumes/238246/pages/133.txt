Physics. — ''The Anomalous Zmuk^-Effect." By Dr T. van LoHUtzEN.
(Cominunicated by Prof. H. A. Lökkntz).
(Gommunicaled in the meeting of May 31, 1919).
DilTeienf attempts have alread}' been made to explain the Zkeman-
Effeot from the atom model of Bohk ^). As yet only the normal
LoRENTZ triplet has been explained, often with superfluous components,
which however have disappeared in the theory of Rubinowicz.
The theory of the anomalous Zi<:EMAN-effect has not yet advanced
much, nor is the explanation of the PASCHEN-BACK-effect much further.
It may, however, be tried to bring one of the parts of the problem
to a solution, so that possibly the results obtained in this way might
be serviceable for the complete solution of the |)roblem.
One of the questions that presents itself here, and which I have
set myself the task to answer, is this:
Does the magnetic splitting up exclusively depend on the initial
and the final path in which the electron moves, or does the transition
play a part in it?
In other words:
Is in the presence of a magnetic field the formula:
h
valid, or should it be replaced by a formula as e.g.
(•)
(2)
li 4.T: mc
as Bohr ") thinks he has to assume.
I will put the question into still another form, because expressed
in these words the solution is easiest to give.
It is known that the frequency of the vibrations of every spectrum
line may be represented* as the difference of two functions, so-called
"seq'uences", e.g.:
