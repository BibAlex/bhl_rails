It goes witliont saying that with stronger concentrations the
deflection diminishes in consequence of an increased viscosity.
As said, the inflnenee of the temperature on waterfall-electricity
is great.
Tapwater of 8° : 40
„ 35° : 100.
Rise of temperature, therefore, increases the positive charge of
water exceedijigly.
The influence of addition of a saltsolution is also a fact that
cannot be denied. Alcohol, which, without salt, increases the posi-
tive charge in water considerably, partly loses this faculty at first
in the presence of common salt, and even loses it altogether with
a concentrated salt-solution. Then the negative charge of the salt
predominates. Salt added to the negatively electrifying camphor
heightens this negative charge. Camphor and salt co-operate. It
should seem then that in the case of waterfall-electricity a simple
summation takes place of the effects of water, salt and the volatile
addition 7-
In endeavouring to account for these phenomena we might look
upon spray-electricity as well as upon waterfall-electricity as a form
of frictional electricity. In either case the friction, between the liquid and
the air in the outflow of the spi-ay, between liquid and zinc plate in the
waterfall, would set free electrons that are scattered about in the surround-
ing air. But then the liquid were invariably to be charged positively,
which turns out differently in a majority of cases, as shown by the experi-
ments. We presume, therefore, that a more intricate process is at
work, in which larger corpuscles arise as carriers of the electric
charge. Such formations might perhaps arise from the so-called ions,
an equal number") of positively- and negatively-charged ions, round
1) hi the case of spray- electricity the process is a much more complicate one.
