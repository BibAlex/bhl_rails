C— OH C— OH
group of atonif? was H — C — OH ; bnt not; OH— O— H (l-glucose,
d-inannose, d-arabiiiose) were allowed to pass through. Only the
d-xjlose which had to show the same was partially' retained.
The experiments have thus yielded two results:
1. Of all the investigated sugars (hexoses and pen-
toses) glucose alone is retained completely.
2. This exceplional jiroperty of glucose cannot be
C— OH
ascribed to the group of atoms H — C — OH and just
as little to a 1 a r g e i- group o f a t o m s in the molecule, it
seems to be inherejit in the whole atomic gi-onping of
the glucose molecule.
Still it will appear in the following article, in the light of partial
retention, of how uiuch impoitance the group H — C — OH is here.
The experiments described above were partly made by Mr. C. L.
Alons, Med. Cand. assistant in the laboratory.
