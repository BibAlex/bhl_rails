According to our interpretation of the rise of p^ of 0,10 by 5 "/,
alcohol, the k^, had increased 0,20, or the poH 0,10.
As demonstrated in part 5 of this paper m as a function of /^^ is :

The k,^ being diminished by the alcohol from 10-13,78 {q ;[()-13,98^
it was now possible to calculate a new curve II for m by means
of this formula. The difference between I and II may be due (at
