other words we should have to succeed in dividing the functional aggre-
gate of all functions satisfying the equation (24) by special charac-
terising properties; and so also the aggregate of binomial series, in
such a way that between the two kinds of sub-aggregates there
existed a complete correspondence, such that functions of some sub-
aggregate K could only be expanded in binomial series belonging
to the sub-aggi-egate K and in no others. But the pi-oblem to find
suchlike characterising properties will perhaps be very difficult, since
it is required for it to derive the chai-acter of a function from that
of the coefficients of the series representing it; a problem which
already causes the greatest difficulties when it regards the more
known power-series.
