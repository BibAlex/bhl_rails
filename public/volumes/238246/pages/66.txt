In a paper "Ueber Diffusion und Absorption in der Sonnenatmos-
phare" (Sitz. Ber. d. Berl. Akad. 1914j Schwarzschild treated the
problem of the radiation of a plain lajer, which must be imagined
as an absolutely black body, and above which there is an absorbing
and dispersive atmosphere. When on a layer (see figure 1) bounded
by the planes x =3 and x = H radiation of intensity *S', starting
from the black body ZZ' falls from all directions, Schwarzschild
denotes by b{a;,i) the radiation which passes through the plane x
in the same sense as the radiation S, and at an angle / with the
normal to the boundary layers, and then tries to find a formula
for b{0,i).

Black body.
Accordingly 6(0,/) is the total intensity of light that passes out at
an angle i at the boundary of the atmosphere, and is built up of
direct light and light that is dispersed once, twice etc.
Schwarzschild succeeds in solving this problem for two special
cases, and finds :
