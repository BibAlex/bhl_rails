I Iiave extensively set this fortli in mj treatise "Le Piiénomène
de Zeeman et les séries spectrales" ^), and will henceforth refer to this.
There I hare demonstrated among others that for every "complex"
of spectrnm lines, i.e. all the spectrnm lines whose freqnencies satisfy
eqnation (3) when the functions if' and (f are given, and i and k
each pass through the series of the whole positive values, a definite
type of anomalous ZEEMAN-effect holds, provided the influence of the
PASCHEN-BACK-effect be taken into account. Hence we may briefly
say that everj^ type of anomalous ZEEMAN-effect is determined by the
form of the functions xp and (p. When these functions have once been
determined, the difference of these functions for positive whole values
of the argument always yields a spectrum line with a definite type
of ZEEMAN-effect.
As has been shown more at length in my cited paper"), these
functions may be indicated as :
Single

Accordingly the symbol nn is the brief way of writing:
i' =r 1 . 2 . 3 . . .
k=2 .3.4:...
v= n{i) — 2 {k)
For the ZEEMAN-effects belonging to every complex I refer to (I.e.)-
The above question may, therefore, now also be worded as follows :
Is each of the above-mentioned functions ("sequences") separately
changed by a magnetic field, and is, therefore, the ZEEMAN-effect
that is observed the result of the change of the two sequences together?
Or could we ask when speaking of //-paths, ^-paths etc., by
which we therefore express that an electron that jumps from an
-^-path to a //-path gives rise to a spectrum line belonging to the
complex n^ :
Is every //-path, -^""-parth, etc. in a magnetic field each in itself
