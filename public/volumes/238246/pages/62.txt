We call the energy on the anterior and posterior sides respectively

M.C.S. the difference in growth retardation ?/« — y^ is smaller
according as Xa is larger (fig. 2).
Now Xa will become greater by omnilateral fore-illumination, for
a m — 1
Xa = - -\- b M.C.S. The absohite energy difference b M.C.S. or
rather the energy of 6 MC.S. applied unilaterally, will therefore give
a smaller difference of growl ii retardation i. e. a smaller curvature,
according as the energy of fore-ilhimination a is greater. In order
nevertheless to obtain a constant difference of growth retardation,
, »^ — 1
giving a just visible curvature, b and therefore also 6 will have
m
to be greater.
If the energy of fore-illumination becomes
greater, the threshold value will rise, as soon
as the curve of growth retardation is a curve
with decreasing slope. Here we need not yet
assert anything about the further relation be-
tween the magnitude of the slope and x.
