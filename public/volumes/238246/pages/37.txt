least partly), to the experimental errors, which were very large
with the old Soja-meal.
In an earlier stage of these researches the influence of neutral
substances like alcohol on nrease-action had been studied with the
aid of the ammonium-carbonate -|- carbonic acid as a buffer, in
experiments like those described in part 6.
B'or instance the experiment of May 25^'' 1916, in which 0,5 7o
of urea in ammonium carbonate (== 2 "/^ urea) with and without
5 7o of alcohol had been investigated, produced the results, represent-

ed in figure 7. The mean of m without alcohol was 0,00381, with
5 7, alcohol 0,00335. For the calculation of m it was assumed, that
the Ph had been elevated by 5 7o alcohol in this case by the same
value as found above in the phosphate solutions.
From figure 6 it will be seen, that between pf^=7 on the ori-
ginal curve and pfjz=z1,l on curve II, theory would predict a
decrease in m from 51,3 to 44,5, that is from 1 to 0,87.
i\ccording to the above results a decrease is found from 38,1 to
33,5, that is from 1 to 0,88.
Closer consideration as well as further experimental research
showed however, that the problem is more complicated than repre-
sented 80 far.
