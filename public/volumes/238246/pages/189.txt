in one and only one way in a series of k elementary affinors. An
elementary affinor with the lower index i and the upper j is a quantity
that is annihilated by all alternations A', l^ i, l^ 1 and by all mixings
m a
Mh, h^ Jj h^ 1. Such a quantity is also annihilated by all Ai and M^;
m a
it can arise from the application of U, Ai,Ai,Mj and Mj and it is
m a
invariant by application of \I, <^ij Ai , f^.y M,- and <^ij Mj. For a definite
value of n (number of fundamental elements Q) all elementary affinors,
for which the permutation number of the A contains permutation regions
}> n, are zero.
For p = Q e.g. the expansion is:

Theorem II. Every simple alternation or mixing that is annihilated
by all higher ones with the same number of permutation regions of
more than one factor, can be written as the sum of multiples of
ordered alternations or mixings with the same permutation number that
contain in each of their regions only factors from the corresponding
regions of the original alternation or mixing.
Let us prove this first for an affinor :
P P d ^' d ^
m=p,gA n = ^uo ^v = (u,....u^)o(v,...v^)
p
When the first factor of m is no u, we may apply a p^\A, the
permutation region of which contains this factor and ^,u. Then we
p
may write p^iAtn as the sum of /? + 1 terms, the first factor of
p p
only one of which (namely of m itself) is a v. Therefore m may
be written as a sum of terms the first factor of which is u. When
p
now in one of those terms m, the second factor v precedes the
second factor u, then we may apply a ^^lA, the permutation region
p
of which contains the two first v and the p â€” 1 last u. Then p^^Atni
may be written as a sum of p-{-l terms in only one of which
p
(namely in m, itself) the second and third factors are v and which
