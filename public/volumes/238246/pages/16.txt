for n = 00 of 5a,n is infinite, and is at least equivalent to ?2®~=^. For,
if this were not the case and if Sa,» vvere finite for n = x, or
equivalent to a lower positive power of n, say n^-«^-^^ then the first
term of the right-liand member would be of order n^^\ whereas
the terms of the series occnn-ing in that member would be of order
^^9-0-1^ and their sum therefore at most of order n^~°\ This is in
contradiction to the initial hypothesis that the left-hand member of
the equality is of order n'^.
The lemma has thus been proved. A corollary worthy of notice
is that the series (36) for a <^d diverges in such a way that the
upper limit of the sura (36') for ?2 == oo is exactly equivalent to
ii'^-"- (in the second part of our proof we found that it was at least
equivalent to tliis power of n). For, if that limit were equivalent to
a higher power of n, say n^-''-+^, then the limit between conveigence
and divergence of the series
would, by the proposition proved just now, be given by ^ = 6 -\- (f,
and not by ^=z6. The same consequence may, for the rest, be
deduced by observing that from the equality (37) it follows that
for a <^d the left-hand member is at most equivalent to n^^"^.
The same lemma as proved above holds for the series of factorials

as may be proved in exactly the same way. Both lemmas are
moi-eover a consequence of one anolher, because the series (36) and
(39) converge and diverge for the same values of «, at least if «
has not exactly the value 6, which is the limit between convergence
and divergence of the series.
11. We now construct a sequence of coefficients
«0' <^v ' • . (^m • (40)
whose upper limit for 7i = oo is equivalent to n°, whereas the upper
limit of the sum (35) is equivalent to n^ 6 now being a positive
number less than 1. It is not difficult to efi'ect this in different
manners; but we shall moreover try to secure that the second sum
