We cannot say, however, that this proposition is a substitute for
that of Nielsen, because a series of factorials sometimes converges
for R{x) <^ o)^. Take, for instance, (he function of Weierstrass
rp (0 = 1 + ^^ + ^^ f ^« + . . . + f* V . . .
This function has its circle of convergence as a natural limit,
because all parts of the circumference are equivalent, as appears
from the substitution
2n ih
where k and h are arbitrary integral numbers. The order to„ in the
point t = 1 cannot, therefore, differ from the order to along the
ivhole circumference, and this order is equal to 1, the characteristic
A' of the coefficients of the power-series being zero. The quantity X
is, however, also zero and the series of factorials converges for
i?(,i') ^ and is, for all these values of x, equal to the integral (1) ^).
1) The convergence of the series of factorials is, in this case, absolute, in the
strip of plane 0<Rix)<\^ owing to the large distance between the coefficients
of (pit) which differ from zero. If, therefore, we spoke continually in the preceding
investigations of conditional convergence for R (x) < A' + 1, we meant this in
general.
