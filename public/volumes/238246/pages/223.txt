sented by a curve in a coiu'entratioii diagram (e.g. a triangle), then
its point of uiaxiniinn tenipeiature is situated in the proximity of
its point of intersection with the line F^F^.
The same is true of course for the (piaterny equilibrium E=: F^ +
_j- //"^ _|_ /T^ -|_ /, -(- ^;. When we represent the solutions of this
equilibrium by a curve in a concentralion-diagram (e.g. a tetrahedron)
its point of nuiximiim temperature is then situated in the proximity
of its point of intersection with the i-egion b\F^F^.
