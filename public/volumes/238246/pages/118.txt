so that the t'oiitril)iiti()ii of the term ) Fy_, . . . .j dx^, . . . dxy, (
the value of (J) over e^ and (?, can be expressed as
n 1 Öi'^a, ... a , J
and the value of (1 1 over [i is obtained in the form:
{indicatrix j^ a,, acq. indicatrix <£,.., «^;),
where A repi-esents a point of n which may be different for different
terms under the 22 sign.
Hence it follows immediately, that, if Q is a two-sided />-dimen-
sional net fragment situated in S, and R denotes the boundarj- of
Q, while the indicatrices of Q and R correspond, then the value of
(i) over R is equal to the value of (2) over Q.
IV. To complete the |)roof of the theorem formulated in I, we
consider a category if' of simplicial divisions of g such that the
aggregate of the base sides possesses for if' uniformly continuously
varying plane tangent spaces, and the i-atio of the volume of a base
simplex to the {p — l)"^'' power of its greatest coordinate fluctuation
does not fall below a certaiji minimum for if?. Let g' , g" , . . . be a
sequence of indefinitely condensing simplicial approximations of g
corresponding to if'. If, on g^''-'^ we construct an approximating simplicial
representation ƒ/■"') of </^'), then, by choosing both n and r above a
suitable limit, we can, in virtue of III, see to it that the values of
(1) over g^y!^^ and ^'M differ from each other by as little as we please,
whilst ^^C/^O is covered by <7(^'^) with degree one, so that the values of (^1)
over g'!'-) and (/('•'"^ are equal. Thus there exists a value of (1) over
g for If' which, natui-ally, does not change if, instead of if.', some
other category of the same kind is chosen.
