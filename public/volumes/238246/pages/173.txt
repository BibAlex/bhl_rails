later on these three accounts, the values of /?! and y, as given here
are certainly exact and connplete to the last decimal place given.
The values added for comparison are those of mj theory of 1908 ^),
reduced to the masses adopted here. This theory is Souillart's
with some errors corrected. The computation of the motion of the
argument of the libration, however, was carried one order fuithcr
than was done by Souillart.

If we neglect the squares and products of Sq, (as well as products

of them, are 2, then the effect of the variations on the radius-
