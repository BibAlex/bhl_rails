Notations'^). A covariant affinor of degree p may be written as
the general product of p ideal fundamental elements ') :

The pf isomers of u, viz. the p! products of the ideal factors in
p
all possible orders are real rational covariants of u. Each isomer is
p
formed from u by one of the p! permutations P; of the ideal factors.
By a j)enetrating general product o of some aftinors u,v,... we
P 9
understand any isomer of the general product uv.... An affinor, the
different isomers of which are not connected by linear relations, is
called a non special one.
Classes of isomers *). It is well-known, that the p factors of an
isomer can be divided into groups of s^ , s, , . . . factors in one single
way, so that in each group the permutation is a cyclic one. The
groups are called the permutation regions and tlie complex of the
numbers ,y, , .s', , . . . in descending order and omitting all numbers
