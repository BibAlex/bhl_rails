when ƒ is a factor of proportionality, the following equation will
hold for the lower band :

reversal of the sign of the cosinus and the sinus, even when we
have only to integrate over a small interval with respect to m.
According to equation (17) the ordinate Z will reach the greatest
maximum for / = 0. This can be sharply determined from the course
of the Z curve, when we have to do with multichromatic light.
The bottom of this ordinate is the zero point N. This operation is
equivalent to the adjustment at the white point in the interferometer
of MicHELSON, when white light is used, and when we want to make
the movable mirror coincide with the plane of reference. The adjust-
ment can of course much more accuratel}'^ be effected graphically
than visually.
