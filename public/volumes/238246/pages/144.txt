jr, when h is the width of the glass plates. The other
fans are congruent with the first, the last ray of a fan always
forming the same angle mn with the first of the next; <[ «7>i is
namely the phase difference due to the difference of two paths of
light, one going from a point of the righthand edge of a plate to
Q, and the other from the lefthand edge of the following plate to
the same point Q. When \x and d are the index of refraction and
the thickness of every plate, then « is = fjc/ — dcos8, hence again a
constant, depending on measures of length and physical constants.
This constant distinguishes itself from the first, because it
depends on the wave length in consequence of the appearance of/ii.
However ii and hence a too, is an even function of m and for this
reason we may consider it as a constant in the following discussion.
Let us now return to the general case.
When the instrument is struck by light of a twice as small
wavelength, the fan will be drawn out twice as far, all the angles
with the time-direction being proportional to m. It appears parti-
cularly clearly with the echelon how in consequence of this the
resulting vector, and together with this the intensity in the point
of observation Q will change its value. The intensity is, therefore,
a function of the number of waves m, and in order to prove that
this is an even function of it, we shall reverse the sign of m. This
