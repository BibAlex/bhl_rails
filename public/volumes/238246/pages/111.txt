The dermal glands of Promammalia have thus developed in the
Mammalia in diverging direction : the hairs, as well as the dermal
glands of the mammals have arisen from them. The complex of
hair and sebaceous glands is to be derived either from a compound
gland, the follicles of which have taken a different direction of
development, or what seems more pi-obable to me, from the union
of a number of glands into one follicle, in the same way as hairs
may be united into a bundle. This last derivation may be
strengthened by the fact that a number of femoral organs too, some-
times form a bundle with a common follicle. I found this in Lacerta
agilis (see fig. p. 143).
