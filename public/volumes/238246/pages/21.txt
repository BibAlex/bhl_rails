On account of the supposed finiteness of Sn,cc, the limit of the
first ter-in of the last member is for /i'(./) > R{c) equal to zero, if /
increases indefinitely and the series in that member converges abso-
lutely. Hence the series in the first member converges also and
we have

by which the lemma is proved. It follows from it that the limit
betiüeen the doinain of convergence and the domain of divergence of
a series of factorials is formed by a straight line parallel to the
imaginary axis.
Moreover we may infer from the equality (45) the following
lemma:
II. 7n a7iy finite part S of the hal f -plane R{x) ]> R{c) + rf, () being
a fixed, but arbitrarily small real positive quantity, the series of
factorials converges u n if o v m ly.
For n may be chosen so large, corresponding to any arbitrarily
given e, that for all m > n
Sn,m r(c + m + 1)
r {x + m -h 2)

and thus

Sn,m r(c + m -^ 1)
r{x -h m + 2)

Since R{x — c) > «f , the right-hand member of this inequality is,
for a sufficiently large /rvalue, which is independent of the value of
X in the domain S, less than s. This was to be proved.
From the inequality (46j we may infer the corollary lla : If the
series of factorials (6) converges for a certain value x = c, then it
converges uniformly on the hal f line beginning at x = c and
having the direction of the positive part of the real axis.
For on this line R{x — c) =r x — c; hence the right-hand meml:)er
of (46) passes into s: n^'^^—'^) and this is less than s independently
of the place of x on that line. The corollary is an analogon of a
well-known proposition of Abel on the uniform convergence of a
power-series along the radius of a certain point of its circle of con-
vergence, if that power-series converges at that point.
From lemma II, in connection with the fact that the terms of the
series of factorials (6) are co/i^mMO?i.9 functions of .t-, it may be inferred
that such a series represents a continuous function of .ïmu the domain
