have onlj factors of ^.u in the region p. Therefore nii may be written
as a sum of terms which are all ordered with respect to the first
and second factors. Proceeding in this way we obtain a sum of
perfectly ordered terms. In each of these terms the region p contains
only factors u and the other region only factors v.
P
Now we consider the affinor m = ^u o ^v o ^w o . . . . with Q alter-
nating regions of p , q , r etc. factors, p^q^r^ . . . , which may be
annihilated by every alternation with Q alternating regions higher
p
than i,^c,r,...A. When e.g. the first factor of m is w, then we apply
a p-\-iA, the permutation region of which contains w and ^u. As
p p
this p-{.iA annihilates m, m is a sum of terms all beginning with a
u. Let now the second factor most to the left be e.g. a v, then we
apply a p-^-iA, the permutation region of which contains the two
first V and the p — 1 last u. Proceeding in this way we obtain a
sum of terms which are all ordeied as to the position of the u
with respect to the remaining factors. Now we continue with alter-
nations ^,^^_|_i^, the region p of which always contains the u that are
already ordered ; thus we obtain ordering of the v etc. until perfect
ordering is reached. At each passage and therefore also in the final
result the factors u of all terms remain in the region p, the v in
the region q etc.
We shall apply the theorem just proved to the elementary affinor

identical with

the summation being extended over all ordered alternations and
mixings, the number of which is just éy. For this purpose we use
the wellknown property that the numbersystem of the permutations
P is an associative system, which may be resolved into k "original"
systems with d?. units. The units of such an original system may
be chosen in such a way that

Such a system contains at the most öij idempotent principal units,
the sum of which is the modulus of the system J.l. Let now for a
definite value of / for any affinor v be ^Wif'^'v^^O where ^j^*'
