degree throughout the whole thermostat, which is amply sufficient,
was attained by electrical heating in the following way.
Under the perforated bottom A, like the side walls and cover of
the thermostat jnade of "eternite", a kind of concrete, some 130
metres of constantan wire of 0.4 m.m. diameter are spread out on
a light frame. The current from the main of 220 Volts can be
admitted to this wire by the relay R, an electrotechnical arrange-
ment obtainable everywhere. A shunt of the current is reduced to
some 8 Volts in the transformer T. This reduced current runs
through the electromagnet E and is broken or opened by the
regulator 6'. The latter is of the type, described by Clakk '), a spiral
of nickel securing contact always at the same point of the mercury
meniscus in a 2 m.m. wide capillary in pure hydrogen. To reduce
sparking the poles of this regulator are also connected with a
small condensor.
