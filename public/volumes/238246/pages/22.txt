S, even in case S lies wholly or partly in the domain of only
conditional convergence; of course it must be supposed ihat all points
of S lie at a distance greater than some /i.red arbitrarily small
quantity f) from the straight line parallel to the axis of imaginary
quantities which forms the limit between the domains of convergence
and divergence of the series. Finally we shall prove that this series
represents an. analytic function in S, and for this it will be suffi-
cient to show that the series of differential coefficients, with regard
to X, of the terms of the first series converges in the same domain
as this first series.
The series of derivatives may be represented by

cipal part of ip(.t-) is equal to log x, the first term of the second
member has, for R{^c — c)> tS, zero as a limit for /=:oo, and the
series in that member converges absolutely. Hence the series in the
first member converges also and we have

From this equality it may be easily deduced that, corresponding
to any 8, there is a number N such that for n > N and for all x
