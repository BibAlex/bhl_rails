From the equation (2) it is now easily derived that an analogous
inequality holds for the functions a,n occurring in the series (1), thai
is to say, that these functions, too, are less in value than the m*''
power of a certain number independent of m. For if (7) is valid
for m > riio, we have by (2), \.i\ being at most equal to a,

The first part of the second member of this inequality consists of
a fixed number of tei-ms, each of which is, for sufficiently large
771- values, less than {a -\- e)"\ so that the same holds for their sum.
The second part is greater than the latter quantity, hence we have
for sufficiently large ?/z-values at all points of the domain («)

Thus the upper limit in the left-hand member of this inequality
is finite, and this is (Vol. XIX, N'. 6) the very condition under which
the transmuting series (1) is complete in the domain (a); moi-eover
we infer that the correspojiding domain [,-i) has a radius ji, no greater
than G -\- 2«. For all functions u belonging to the circle ((J-|-2«) the
series P therefore produces a transmuted function Pu in the domain
(«), and this transmuted is equal to Tu, according to the functional
theorem of Mac Laurin we gave in the form (Vol. XX, N°. 3):
If the series P, ansioering to a normal additive transmutation T,
is complete in the circidar domain («) forming the ^V. F. 0. of T,
we have in this domain Tu =:: Pu f or such functions of the functional
field F {T) of T as belong to the circle (d) corresponding to («)•
