From the general principle of convergence (c.f. n". 4 of my previous
paper) it follows, that uniform convergence exists then and then
only, if corresponding to every positive number e a positive number
(f independent of G can be found, so that e\ery two elements E
and E' of Ge satisfy the inequality \E — E'\<^s.
4. Let it now be assumed, that the uniforii) co)ivergence mentioned
in n". 3 does exist and moreover, that every aggregate H has a. limit
Lh as regards the covering hy the parts of V; in consequence of
this there is a number Lfj corresponding to every element of W.
We now first demonstrate, that the aggregate [Lq] of the numbers
Lq possesses a limit L as regards the covering by the parts of V.
For this purpose we must prove, that corresponding to every posi-
tive number e such a Vs can be found, that every two elements
of Ve satisfy the inequality \L(j — Lq'\<^8, where L g Siud L q' ave
the numbers of \L(j\ corresponding to these elements. If E and E'
are, elements of G resp. G' , belonging to a same aggregate H,
we have :
\Lg — Lg'\^\Lg~E\ + j^-^'l + \E'-Lg'\.
On account of the uniform convergence of the aggregates G the
aggregate H can be chosen thus, that | Lg — E\ and j E' — Lg' \
are both <[ y ^ ■ As H possesses a limit, we can choose ö thus,
that every two elements E and E' of B^ satisfy the inequality
I E —E' I <^ ^ s. For the numbers Lg and Lg' corresponding to two
elements of Vo then | Lq — Z(j' | <^ ^g -|- |8 -|- è^ = ^ holds good.
5. We next prove, that the aggregate \ Lh \ of the numbers L^
{as regards the covering by the parts of W) likeioise has the limit L.
We therefore proceed from
\Lh—L\^\ Lh-E\ + \E-Lg\ + \Lg-L\,
in which E is the common element of the aggregates G and H.
On account of the uniform convergence mentioned in n°. 3 we can
determine the positive number 6 in such a way, that \E — Lg\<^^^
holds good if E be an element of Gs, i.e. if H corresponds to an
element of Ws; here 8 is an arbitrarily chosen positive number. If
we have now chosen a determinate element of W^ (by which also
H and L^ are determined), we can find the positive number ö^ in
such a way, that the inequality \Lh — E\<^~b is satisfied, if ^be
an element of H^^ , i. e. corresponds to an element of Vs^ . Further
we can determine (f^ thus, that we get \Lg — Lj\ <^^8, if G corre-
sponds to an element of Fj, . By making the aggregate G to
