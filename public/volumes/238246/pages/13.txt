Mathematics. — ''-On Mac Lauhin's Theorem in the Functional
Calculus''. By Dr. H. B. A. Bockwinkel. (Communicated by
Prof. L. E. J. Brouwer).
(Communicated in the meeting of March 29, 1919).
In the tiiird communication of my paper "Some observations on
complete transmutation"^) I proved a restricted validity of Ma(; Laurin's
theorem in the Fimctional Calculus for a normal additive trans-
mutaiiou. A normal transmutation was defined by me as follows:
1. There is a functional field F{T), the functions u of which
belong to") the very same circle (o), and for these ftmctions the
transmutation 7' produces functions belonging to the very same circle
(«). concentric with {(i).
2. All rational integral functions are included in the functional field.
3. The transmutation T is continuous in the pair of associated
fields F{T) and (u)').
From 2 it can be derived that to any such transmutation T another
transmutation 7^ formally corresponds, which is given by
a.u' a^u" , a,„i/("')
1 2 .' m I
where the quantities n'"0 are the derivatives of the subject of operation
u and the quantities a,n functions of the numerical variable .f, whi-ch
by means of the formula
a„. = i,n - m,.r5,„_i + . . . + (- l)'"^'"!, ").... (2)
can be derived from the functions

1) These Proc Vol. XIX N". 6 and 8 and Vol. XX N^. 3— 7, to be quoted as I.e.
2) A function belongs to a circle, if it is regular within and on it. The symbol
{(t) means a circle with ladius o".
5) See for the definition of continuity I.e. Vol. XIX N". 8, where also definitions
are given of the expressions fimctional field {F. F.). numerical field of operation
(N.F.O.) (here the circle (a)) and numerical field of functions (N. F. F.) (here
the circle (o-) ).
4) By mk the binomialcoefficient of order k of the number m is meant.
