handle A gently to and fro the equilibrium between platinum elec-
trode, liquid and hydrogen can be easily established. Dead space and
mistakes are avoided by the arrangements C and D on cock and
frame. The protruding piece D allows the turning out of the plunger
only, if the cock is shut and the quadrant 6' on the top of the cock
is then in the position, shown in the figure. The same arrangement
clearly helps to avoid the mistake of opening the cock and thus
admitting the hyd!-ogen, when the plunger is not turned home.
After shutting the cock, establishing equilibrium as described
above, and adjusting the liquid in the electrode tube (by slightly
turning the handle A) in such a way, that it just touches the point
of the platinum wire, the whole apparatus is lifted up and placed
on the wooden block of Fig. 16, the electrode tube dipping in the
KCl-cup.
Another improvement was the carrying out of all these operations
in an air-thermostat (Fig. 18), in which all the apparatus, -shown
