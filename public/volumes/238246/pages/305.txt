We have demonstrated in an eailiei- paper that the isolated small
intestine yields to salt-solutions (|iianlities of oliolin, which are
capable of stimulating Aukhbach's j)lexus.
This loss of cholin results in a changed behaviour of the gut
towards atropin.
The rabbit's small intestine that is inhibited previous to washing
bj small doses of atropin, no longer reacts on them; on the other
hand it is now stimulated by moderate doses.
The normal guinea-pig gut is invariably inhibited by atropin. This
effect also here disappears after washing and is substituted by a
stimulation through moderate quanta of atropin.
This is to be interpreted as follows: the real action of moderate
quanta of atropin on the gut is stimulation of Aukrbach's plexus;
if the gut contains much cholin, so that the plexus is readily
stimulated, this stimulation is arrested through the antagonism of a
small amount of atropin, occasionally weakened, and the result is
inhibition. Moderate quanta of atropin are also inhibitory when this
antagonism is strong enough, but in the presence of small quanta
of cholin in the gut the latter will be stimulated.
It is clear, therefore, that here we have to do with a case in
which the presence of a well known chemical substance (cholin) in
the tissue determines the manner in which this substance reacts on
a poison (antropin).
