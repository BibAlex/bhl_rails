also acts more intensely. Subject D. takes up a place between
R. and M. in that for sentences of an e\en number of syllables
assimilation gets the start of inhibition when the sentences get longer.
whereas for sentences of an odd number of syllables inhibition proves
the stronger. We are unable to account for this stiange phenomenon.

which index presumably also holds for whisj)ered sentences, we have
reduced in Table IV the whisper-values for sentences of various
length to ordinary-speech values. Both sorts of values in Table IV
constitute the average of the hearing distances, determined for the
subjects R., M., and D., with respect to the length of the various
sentences.

Be it observed by the way that owing to the more conspicuous
survey of the data in Table IV, our conclusions deduced from
Table II are shown here to a greater advantage viz, the great
difference between the hearing distances for sentences of 3 and for
those of 10 or more syllables floud speech nearly 30 m.); the com-
paratively slight difference for sentences of 4 to 9 syllables (loud
speech ± 3.5 m) ; the greater distance for sentences of an odd
number of syllables, owing to their most often symmetrical con-
struction ; etc.
We have already pointed out that symmetrical sentences are heard
at greater distance than asymmetrical sentences. Table V shows that
symmetry is highly favourable to our audition. Here also great
individual differences are observed ; for R., M. and D. they are resp.
0,61; 1.13; and 0.24 m.
