Mathematics. — '' Null systems determined by linear systems of plane
algebraic curves". By Prof. Jan de Vriks.
(Communicated in the meeting of January 25, 1919).
1. A triply infinite system (complex) 6^^^) of plane algebraic curves c"
contains a twofold infinity of nodal curves; for an arbitrarily chosen
point D is node of a nodal carve <^f" belonging to aS^^^X
I shall now consider the null system in which the tangents d, d'
of d" are associated as iiull rays with D as null point.
The nodal curves of a net belonging to S^^^ have their nodes on
the Jacobian, which is a curve of order S{7i — 1). It has in common
with the Jacobian of a second net the 3(?i — 1)" nodes, which occur
in the pencil common to the two nets. The remaining intersections
of the two loci are critical points, i.e. nodes for the curves of a
pencil. The null system, there/ore, has Q{n — 1)'' singular null points.
2. Let a be an arbitrary straight line, P an arbitrary point. The
Ö», which has its node D on a, intersects the ray PD, moreover,
in in — 2) points E. If E is to get into P, d» must belong to the
net that possesses a base-point in P; D lies then on the Jacobian
of that net. The locus {E) of the points ^passes, therefore, 3 (?z — 1)
times through P, and is consequently a curve of order (4?z — 5).
Each intersection of {E) with a is node of a d", of which one of
the tangents d passes through P.
There is therefore a curve {D)p of order (4?i — 5) which contains
the nodes of the nodal curves t^, which send one of their tangents
d through a given point P. It will be called the null-curve of P.
For a singular point S it has in S a triple point. As P evidently
is node of {D), there lie on a ray <:/ passing through P {4-n — 7) points
D, for which d is one of the tangents of the corresponding curve
d«. From which ensues: an arbitrary straight line d has (4?2 — 7)
null-points D.
3. The null-curves [D)p and (/))q have the 6(?i — 1)' singular
points in commoji ; for, a critical point bears oo^ pairs d, d' .
The two curves pass further through the (4;i — 7) null points
of the straight line PQ. Each of the remaining intersections is a
point 1), for which d passes through P, d' through Q. In other
words, if d revolves round P,d' will envelop a curve of class
