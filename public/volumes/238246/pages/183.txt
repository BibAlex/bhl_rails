1 t[ie permutation number. For tt regions of the same extension we
shall write here n . .s-^s- A permutation number is hie/her than an
other one, when its first region is greater or, in the case of equality,
when tfie second region is greater etc. Frobknius introduced the name
of permutation class for ail permutations with the same permutation
number. In the same way we sliall call the sum of all isomers
with the same permutation number divided by p! the isomer class
with that number. The number of classes is therefore equal to the
number k of the whole positive solutions of the equation
.r^ + 2.f, + 3^, + ... ^p . . . . . (3)
The classes are arranged in ascending order and written :
p I p p p
if, u= — u , K^u , .... .... , üTfc u
■p\
The permutation number may be added as index on the left side
e.g. for p z=z 6 :
A class is called even or odd according as it consists of even or
odd permutations.
p
Alternations and mixings. The affinor that is found from u by
replacing each of t definite groups of s^,...,St factors (without
displacing them) by the ideal factors of their alternating or symme-
p
trical product is called a simple alternation resp. mixing of u with
the permutation number a\ , St and is written as:
(A) p si,-,s, U- p
A u resp. M u
Tiie index (A) at the top on the right indicates the choice of the
permutation regions. The aflinor is called, locally alternating resp.
symmetrical in these regions and in general locally permutable.
The sura of all simple alternations resp. mixings with the same
permutation number divided by their number is called the general
alternation resp. mixing with that number. The general alternations
and mixings are arranged in ascending order and written as
— /• /' — - 7' — P
^, u = u , A^ u,... ..., A]e u
— p p —P — P
il/,u = u , M^vi,... ..., J/fc u,
eventually, when desirable, with the permutation number as index on
the left e.g. for p 1= 6 :
