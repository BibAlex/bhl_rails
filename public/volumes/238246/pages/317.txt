sodiiiiH chloride, Jiftec passing tlie different alcoliois, lliey were
enclosed in [Kii-aClin and then (hey were cnl into series of lOfi and
the sections were stained according to Hkidknhain's ironliaematoxylin
method. 1 counted the number of nuclei of some of these sections
over a length of I mm. from the ro(jttop and I fixed the number
of mitoses. 1 took care to count only in the central sections. Table
1 and II give my results.

In order to compare these tigures, Ï expressed them in percentages
in the following tables. Karsten takes the average of his countings.
In my opinion it is more exact to express these facts in percentages,
just as Mrs. Drooglever Fortuyn-van Lkyden does, for it is most
improbable that Karsten always examined the same number of cells.
