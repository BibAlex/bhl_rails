In our case we can liowever follow the course of the growth
retardation curve more closely by altempling to trace the relation-
ship between threshold value and fore-illumination. If we calculate
growth retardalion

from Arisz's tables, mentioned above, the ratio of unilateral after-
illumination to omnilateral fore-illumination, we find that, if after-
illumination : fore-illumination =1:11, there is no curvature;
with this ratio 1:10, 9.9 or 9.2 a few plants give a feeble positive
curvature,
with the ratio 1 : 7.2 all plants curve positively.
This applies, as was already said above, only to a fore-illumination
of less than 2000 M.C.S. given within 3 min. with an intensity
below 25 M.O. We must, however, recalculate this for the quantities,
which the anterior and posterior sides receive. Since we see, that
a feeble positive curvature occurs when the ratio after-illumination :
fore-illumination {b : a) has reached a definite magnitude 1 : 9.7, the
ratio of the energy difference b

to the energy of the anterior
side \- b must also be constant, whatever be the values of in and n.

In order to demonstrate this numerically, I propose to make certain
assumptions respecting m and n; in principle it does not matter,
what values we ascribe to in and n. For m I assume 4; the back
is then illuminated with V4 of the intensity of the front, receives
