we have finally
/ l\2m-l '
+ A^9-"'-M log-j ,
and again K^ is finite and independent of ,v.
From (7) we conclude that, if .r— *•!, the function L {.vOp) tends
to infinity in the same manner as
C — log log — - 2 log (/
qL (X9') "1^^ + I 9 ,
q log -
and that
UmlL(.v(9p) — qL{wr)\ = — l{q—l) — ^^ ^ hco\~^. (8)
3^1 2^ ^=1 q
Thus we have the rather remarkable result that it is only the
real part of L{xdi') that increases indefinitely in a manner (juite
independent of p.
2. If we only wish to shew that, when .r — » 1 , the function
L{,vO^) cannot remain finite for all non zero values of ^, an element-
k='i - 1
arv discussion of the sum ^ L{xd^') suffices to obtain this result.
4=0
We have at once
k—O n=l
and, denoting by D the greatest common measure of n and q, we
may substitute
thus obtaining
k—O dig \dj
Hence, making x tend to 1, we get
x-^1 J-i \X) ]c=(i dig a
where v (r/) denotes the number of integers less than d and prime
to d.
Supposing q to l)e equal to the product /?,''i /^/-^ . . . p**, we have
