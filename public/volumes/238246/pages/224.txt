{\—x''^+^ah) and (l—u,-"'/ e»/'/') always exceed a fixed value, hence
Th{^i\l)) remains finite as x tends to unity. Accordingly tlie difference
L{xOp) —qL{xi^)
is always finite, therefore the point Op must be a singular point of
L{z] and the continuation of L{z) across the circumference must be
regarded impossible.
To examine the behaviour of L{.i;8r) if x-^{, it will besufïicient
to deduce a suitable expansion of the function Th (r, p).
