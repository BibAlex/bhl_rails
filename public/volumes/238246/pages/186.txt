The numbersystem of the class operators.
Frobenius has shown, that the operators K are commutative both
mutually and with every permutation P; and that they form a
numbersystem with k units, which does not contain any nilpotent
numbers viz. numbers of which some power is equal to zero. As k
independend units we'may choose e.g. K,,. .. , Kk or A^ ,A,, . . . ,Aic or
Mo,Mt>- -y^k, which are thus all commutative both mutually and
with each operator P, A or M. According to the theory of the higher
complex number systems every system of this kind contains k
independent numbers Ti , i = ^ , • . . , k, the idempotent principal units
(Haupteinheiten) ^), which satisfy the equations

The sum of the operators 7,-, which will be called elementary
operators, is the identical operator /. When these units are expressed
in the class operators K:
