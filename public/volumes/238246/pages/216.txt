If we substitute in the second integral s=:zu:t, this expression
passes into

Since the argument of s was zero, the argument of 7i is equal to
that of t; thus tiie variable under the sign of integration goes along
the straight line from n=0 to u^t in the ?i-plane. But it maj
go as well from 76 = — u), on the circumference of the circle (1, J),
along that circumference in the positive direction to the point ?^, = ^
On this supposition we consider the system of two integrations, to
be performed in succession, as a double integral. Then in the corre-
sponding aggregate {iL,t) a definite value u^ of n has to be associated
with all those values of t lying, in the ^plane, on the circumference
of the circle (1,1) between t=Ui and the end-point t =z -\- if) of
that circle. Hence the double integral maj be replaced by the pair
of two successive integrations denoted in the expression

where the integration according to t has to be performed in the
positive direction from t =^ u to t^=-\-i()^). On account of the pro-
perties of fp it) the latter integration may be replaced by an integration
1) The here given argument is strong, in so far it is based upon A:«o?<w truths, if the
functions under consideration are finite in the whole domain of integration. This
is the case for R{x)>l and R(x)> i, but, since both e^jdforms are analytic
functions of x >nd of a for R{x)>0 and 7^(3;i>0, they must also be equal for
the latter values.
