On lenioval of the brains one is directly struck bv the presence
of the sack (fig-, 'lb) and the epiphjsis lying free, seeming to be its
point of origin. Behind it one does not find anything of a mesen-
ce|)halon or of a cerebellum. The sack continues in occipital direction
and the tela of the 4''' ventricle shines faintly through it (fig. 2c).
On the other hand both the hemispheres are well develo[)ed. There
is a deep sagittal fissure, in which the dural septum with its sinus
are found, and which has to be cut away from the crista galli in
order to make its removal [possible.

If we examine the basal surface of the brain (fig. 3), then we are
struck by the presence of two well-developed olfactory bulbs with
their tract, their lobus olfactorins anterior, posterior and cornu
Ammonis, in short of a completely developed rhinencephalon.
There are two N. optici (fig. 3, N. II). The corpus mammiliare
