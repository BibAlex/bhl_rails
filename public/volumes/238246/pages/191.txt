therefore according to theorem II we have :
AfKM'f^v=Af^Mf:SA[^^if^ (34)

where the w^g are elementarj' affinors, while the summation has to
be extended over all ordered alternations A^^'>. As A/'='M('-^>=:0 for
a ^ ^ we have :

Repeated application teaches thus that the operator ^(*' il^/W, never
can be nilpotent. According to a wellknown axiom from the theory
of the higher complex numbersystems we conclude from this, that
there exists an idempotent number of the form
«.. (4«) ii/j^^) + . . . + «.„ (4"' Mf^r .... (86)
For every ordered alternation there thus exists such an idem-
potent number and the products of these numbers being zero, they
form a series of idempotent principal units. The number of ordered
operators Ai and J/ is therefore rf,^ or less. It cannot be less, however,
as a repeated application of theorem II teaches that every elementary

affinor may be written in the form 2 A{^) M{^^ m. If w were 7^ 1, then

the powers of ^(*) il/W would belong to the first class of Pkirce
with respect to one of the idempotent principal units and to the fourth
class with respect to the other ones. As in an original number-
system such numbers (nilpotent by-units (Nebeneinheiten)) cannot
occur, (1 = 1 and the operators
^,I = eijA^Mf^ X=\,...,öij . . . (37)
are therefore idempotent principal units. In the same way
jJI=,'ijMfAl'^ X = h...,öij . . . (38)
form a similar system. These operators are called ordered elementary
operators of the first resp. second kind and the affinors which may
be derived from them, ordered elementary affinors of the first resp.
