The general formula for (his correspondence is :
^tm/ = 4'"' Xi'l\ (23)
from which follows for (i,n^ :
H„a = xf,"*'' (24)
From the tables given by Frobenius for the group characters we
thus tind directlj^ the equations expressing the / in the K e.g.
for p = 6:

*) The indices on the left of the operators / will be explained furtheron.
Thus we have found an expansion that is singly determined for
every affinor. In fact even for a special aftinor no linear relation
can exist between the operators / without each coefficient separately
being equal to zero, as is seen immediately by application of one
of the operators 1. This expansion is called the expansion in
elementary afjinors. Using tables as (10) and (25) we might now
m a
express the / in A, M, A or M &n& obtain thus a singly determined
expansion witli respect to alternations or mixings. The following
way however is more simple and more instructive.
T'he elementary operators as the products of two general operators.
When Mj^^ .... Ji/i are conjugate to A^, A„ . . ., Ak-, then A„ . . ., Ak
are annihilated by Mj^; therefore they cannot contain y^ ^1 of the
principal units 1. In the same way A^, . . ., Ak are annihilated by
Jij, and Ji},, so that they cannot contain y,^! further principal
