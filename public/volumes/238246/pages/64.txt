from wliieli appears that here the ordinary course is found. Also
after anodic polarisation the silver has at tirst a nioie positive
potential, which becomes smaller with continuall}' diminishing velocity.
After cathodic polarisation with the same current density at first
a too negative potential is found, which becomes less and less
negative, as is shown by the photo fig. 7.
Finally also a copper electrode with an area of 9 mm.' in a 0,d
NCuSO^-solution has been examined, and then the same thing was
found as for silver in 0.1 N. Ag NOj, as appears from the photos
fig. 8 and fig. 9. The current density amounted here to 0,666
