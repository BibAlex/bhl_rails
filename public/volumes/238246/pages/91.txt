When we now consider the case that an iinattackable electrode
is placed in an electrolyte, chlorine being led through, we get the
same thing in so far that the electron concentration of the metal
equilibrium in the electrolyte is entirely dominated by the electron
concentration of the chlorine equilibrium :
CI, + W-^ICV (2)
in agreement with the pressure of the chlorine that is led through,
from which follows tliat the chlorine-gas phase and the chlorine-
containing metal phase will possess the same potential with respect
to the electrolyte. Our more recent views about the electromotive
equilibria lead to the assumption of an electro-ionisation equilibrium
in chlorine gas, though the concentration of ions and electrons in
this gas-phase is exceedingly small. That there exists such an electro-
ionisation for chlorine, is proved by the exceedingly slight electrical
conductivit3^ Now, however, the above mentioned equilibrium (2)
does not suffice, for in electrically neutral chlorine this equilibrium
cannot occur alone, because here there is only question of particles
charged negatively electrically. Besides the chlorine electrode could
not assume a positive charge with respect to the electrolyte.
Undoubtedly this difficulty has also been felt in the former view
about the electromotive equilibrium. The negative charge which zinc
assumes on immersion into an electrolyte was explained as follows :
The zinc tends to go into solution as zinc-ion, and it has evidently
always been imagined that this happened through a simultaneous
splitting up of the ziijc-atom into zinc-ion -j- electrons, in which,
however, the zinc-ions only went into solution, and the negatively
charged electrons remained on the metal.
When we wish to account for the positive charge which the chlorine
electrode assumes with respect to an electrolyte in an analogous
way, we get into serious difficulties, which have led to the assumption
by some physicists that besides the free negatively charged electrons
there exist also free positively charged electrons, and that these could
render important services for the chlorine electrode and for the other
non-metal electrodes. For just as the splitting up
Zn^Zn" +26
was assumed when the zinc went into solution, the process
a, -^ 2Cl' -f- 2 Â©
was supposed to take place at the chlorine electrode when chlorine
went into solution. The chlorine ions formed go into solution and
the positive electi'ons would be left behind in the chlorine electrode
