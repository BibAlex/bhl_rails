find from (7):

We need not make this hypothesis; and it is exactly in this that
the great significance of the method lies. When in spite of this we
do submit to this restriction, we shall find that the curves I and II
become dependent on each other. According to equation (23) and
(24) we have namely :
2 cos 4ji Im C (l) — 2 dn 4.-T lmS{l) =fl {d)
2 si7i 4jr Im C (l) + 2 cos 4jt ImS (l) — — fll{cl)
SO that S=^0 would lead to:
— 11 {cl) - tg 4.-t ImX I {cl) ')
Further the quantity V was a quantity that was not easy to
estimate, and could, strictly speaking, only be determined from
photometrical observations; it appears from its intricate definition

be i-egistered, but must be determined point for point. Equation (26),
which is based on Michelson's visibility curve, holds therefore only
for a symmetrical distribution of the energy and is not quite exact
even in this case, while the F-curve is difficult to obtain, and then
only very faint.
Summing up we come to the conclusion that in the discussed
arrangement we have found a means to read the distribution of
energy, both over a narrow and over an extensive spectral region
') After neglecting some terms mentioned in footnote 2.
') Substituting this in equation (25), we should have expressed c:; {X} only by
the aid of the curve /, and in this special case the cylinder lenses seem not to
have been required; but in order to know m we must know II at least for one
value of cl; hence the use of the cylinder lenses is inevitable even in this simple
case, when we wish to work mathematically exactly. For the determination of
J max — J min MiCHHLsoN has Considered C {I) and S [1) as constants in the
differentiation with respect to l\ besides for S = we find C'(^) = PX l^C^) only
for those values of I that satisfy S{1) =■ — tg 4,7rlmy^C {I), hence for an infinite
number of values of I, but not for a continuously infinite number, which would,
however, be required by mathematics if equation (26) is to follow from equation (7).
