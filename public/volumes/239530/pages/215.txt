practice to obtain a ready facility in the discrimination of
flint fractures. It is commonly said that this peculiar form
of fracture may easily be seen by anyone who takes the
trouble to examine a locaHty where flints are abundant.
Believing, however, that this is not the case, I will endeavour
as briefly as possible to give you a reason for my behef.
Those who are unwilling to trace any design in the form of
these flints, attribute the fractures to natural causes. Now
these may be divided into causes arising from the action of
either water, frost, or heat.
First, let us consider the action of water ; taking the sea as
the most powerful agent, do we find " cores" and " flakes,"
similar to those exhibited this evening, on any flint pebble
beach of the existing period ? Look at the sea in its most
majestic and savage gtate, when the huge breakers, rolling on
with irresistible fury, lash the coast in one long line of boil-
ing foam. Tons of cliflf may fall before its undermining
power ; huge masses of limestone weighing from two to five
tons each may be carried along from one place to another
(as indeed actually occurred from the northern to the
southern slope of the Plymouth breakwater) by its trans-
porting power ; but neither of these agencies can form
a " flake," and it is doubted whether they could even
fracture a flint. The action of the breakers is that of
povMding or grinding. Witness the belts of gravel and
sand along the shore at low water mark. Look closely at
this gravel and sand â€” chips there may be, but the chips are
rounded and ground. The gravel has all its little roughnesses
and angles worn smooth, and the grains of sand, when viewed
through a good lens, present the same appearance. The
waves may hurl one pebble against another. Ekamine this
pebble closely ; you will see it studded over with little con-
centric circles, and possibly a small bit knocked off an angle
here and there ; but the general appearance is that of semi
