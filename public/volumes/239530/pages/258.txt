chimneys, which, instead of being an eye-sore, as is generally
the case, are by no means the least elegant feature in the
building. The Stafford knot, with the date 1514, attests
their antiquity, though the sharp moulding of the bricks by
no means indicate such a lapse of years.
The remaining part of the day was devoted to an exami-
nation of the weU-known Aust Cliff, with its " bone bed" so
full of traces of ancient life, to which the age of the Castle,
or even of those Romans who used the Augusti trajectus, is
but as yesterday compared with the ceons which have elapsed
since those deposits were laid down. Diligent use was made
of the waning day, and after a general view of the section had
been obtained from the end of the causeway, where the
three faults, and the succession of the different beds, from the
red marls to the lowest beds of the has which cap the top,
are best seen, some preliminary remarks were made as to the
conflicting views held by Dr. Wright and Mr. Charles Moore
respecting the true position of the Avicula contorta beds ;
the former being of opinion that these beds, which are here
represented by intervening bands of black shales, argillaceous
limestone, and calcareo -arenaceous beds, with the celebrated
bone-bed at the base, belong to the Keuper marls below ;
whilst the latter states that these shales, &c., are the only
representatives in this country of the Ehcetic formation, which
assumes so vast a thickness on the continent, thus placing
them on a higher horizon. Mr. ]\Ioore also states that these
Avicula contorta beds are almost invariably overlaid by the
White Lias, which latter bed he also includes in the Rlioetic
formation. The Members, however, in their walk along the
beach failed to trace a single specimen of the true White
Lias rock, although specimens of eveiy other bed which
exists in the section were found. Many specimens of fish
teeth, scales, and saurian bones, Ostrea liassica and other
shells were found in abundance.
