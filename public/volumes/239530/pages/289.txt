subsequently been filled by the infiltration of other matter,
and in horizontal faults we could hardly expect to find similar
effects; but although in them the lines of fracture are
differently composed they are not the less distinct.
In the under surface of the upper strata or the part thrust
forward the fractured ends of the beds are frequently bent
downwards, but the inequalities appear to have been rubbed
off, leaving a smooth and polished surface. The upper surface
of the strata beneath has also been worn smooth in places,
but on the whole it is more irregular, the ends of the veins
and beds having invariably been either turned up where
broken off, or forced into a succession of smaller overlaps by
the immense mass moving above. Between these clearly
defined lines there exists a thick layer of crushed materials
of every kind. Shale, generally much disintegrated, with
occasional fragmentary pieces of coal and sandstone, fill up
the intervening space, the whole being so loose and friable
that when a shaft has been sunk through the fault, ordinary
masonry is scarcely sufficient to hold the broken materials
back. In the two smaller dislocations, which I have associated
with the great overlap and shown on the section, the same
general features prevail, the only difiierence being that they
appear to affect only the two lower veins. In order to
show more clearly the effect of these disturbances, I have
had a section of part of the Bull Vein constructed on a
larger scale, and on examining it you will find many
evidences of the violent action to which the strata have
been subjected.
I would now in conclusion pass on to describe the
FOLDED AND CONTORTED STRATA OF THE
VOBSTER AND NETTLEBIDGE VALLEY,
and I hope afterwards to make it clear that the various
disturbances referred to are not so unconnected as may at
