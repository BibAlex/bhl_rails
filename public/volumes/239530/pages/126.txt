Now it is evident that in the case of Avater springs that liave a
moderate heat and are constant, that the usual effect of hydros-
tatic pressure might cause water first to descend and afterwards
come to the surface hot, by the short cut of a fault ; but in the
case of hot springs that are intermittent, or only the accompani-
ments of volcanoes, this could not be the case. For if the water
descends by its usual laws, it will only ascend again on the
prmciple of finding its own level, which it will do whether it has
been heated in its descent or not ; the heating will neither retard
nor accelerate its ascent ; if it were otherwise, it would follow that
the force of water descending generates force, or in other words,
that a certain height of water can at one time give a pressure
greater, at another time less. For if the heat were the cause of
the Avater rising to the surface, it would at the same time prevent
the supply (which only descends by its own Aveight) from coming
doAvn, it Avould be forced back. Therefore if a sjjring be inter-
mittent, the heat has arisen or accumulated after the Avater has
reached a low leA'el, the heat is also intermittent. A spring may
be intermittent Avitli the heat permanent under such circum-
stances as exist at the great Geyser of Iceland, Avhere the supply
seems to percolate into a deep hole, the sides of Av^hich are highly
heated. The effect of this is, that as the Avater flows in, it is
heated to boiling point, and the water continues just at the
boiling point until this fissure or hole is filled to the surfixce, and
runs over ; it then appears that from the Avant of heat conducting
poAver in Avater, the loAver part of the column is sui^er-heated, and
causes those intermittent explosions and the grand fountains of
hot Avater that are there. The same effect may be produced on a
small scale, by boiling AA'ater in a long narroAV tube in a vertical
position. This is peculiar and exceptional, depending on the
Avater's loss of aii*.
Therefore if Avater only rises to the surface by hydrostatic
pressure, which is, I think, proved, and that it rises in a boiling
state, and if the source of its heat is central, and only increases
