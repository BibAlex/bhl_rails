hood iu connection witli the subject of the distribution of the
[)lants of Great Britain generally, prefacing our lecture with just
so much on this latter head, as might serve to a certain extent to
explain the circumstances under which a given number of species
are found growing in any particular locality.
We may begin by observing that the far greater portion of
our British plants — not to say all— are identical with species
found on the Continent; and assuming that each species
originated — without saying anything as to the mod.c of its origin
— in one particular spot, or centre, as it is called, and not in
several places at once, this being the hypothesis best supported,
and the one most generally adopted, they have clearly come to
lis from thence in the first instance.
But when we set ourselves to consider the way in which they
have arrived on our shores, we find a difficulty. There is a wide
sea between us and the continent, and no natural transport,
such as often serves to disseminate plants and carry them from
one part of the country to another, is sufficient in all cases to
explain how they may have passed this barri(?r. The difficulty,
too, is greatly increased when we take the case of endemic, or
very local plants, which instead of being more or less generally
diff"used over the British Islands, are confined to particular
stations, or occupy very limited areas, being cut off by considerable
intervening spaces from any assemblages of the same species in
countries beyond Britain.
• It was with an especial view to these local plants, and to
shew how such assemblages of individuals, though now so far
asunder, may still have sprung originally from one and the same
centre, that the late Professor E. Forbes put forth, as is well
known, an ingenious theory. He supposed that the areas in
which they are found growing, though now disconnected, with
the sea rolling between them, were once united by lands that
have since gone down and been submerged through the agency
of those causes, by which the relative distribution of land and
