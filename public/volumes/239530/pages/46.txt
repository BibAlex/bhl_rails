In my address to the Club last year, I stated that it seemed to
me very desirable that any specimens of interest or value which
the Members should meet with in their excursions, relating
either to the Natural History or Antiquities of the neighbour-
hood, should be deposited, parties being willing, in the Museum
of the Bath Literary and Scientific Institution. I added,
however, that in connexion with this matter it would be fitting
to speak more at large upon the subject of Museums in general
than I had time for then, which, consequently, I deferred to
another occasion.
I propose now to treat of tliis subject, so far as it affects
ourselves, and the interests of the Local Museum with which we
are connected. In these days, in which Natural History pursuits
meet with so much more faA'our than formerly, and collectors
are so numerous, and almost every provincial town, nay, many
a small village; has its own Museum, â€” it cannot be without its
use to make more generally known the principles which have of
late years been suggested, with respect to the formation and
arrangement of Museums, by those who have had most
experience in the management of such institutions. These
principles have been adopted, and carried out with great success^
in a few cases, and they recommend themselves to the notice of
all persons wishing to establish Museums in their o\vn neigh-
bourhoods.
