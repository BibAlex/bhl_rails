The first Evening Meeting of the present season was held on
December 18th, when Mr Earle, the "Rector of Swainswick,
gave the result of his researches on "The Early History of
Bath and its Neighbourhood." There was a good attendance,
and Mr. Earle 's original remarks elicited an animated dis-
cussion amongst the Members. Mr. Irvine exhibited, in
illustration, some valuable pencil sketches of objects of anti-
quarian interest in the city and neighbourhood ; amongst
these, the houses of the old yeomen, which had nearly all
passed away, and in examples of which the Batheaston valley

Lecture, together with a translation of one of the British
legends, describing the battle between Arthur and Childric,
which, in his opinion, took place on Solsbury Hill and
Hampton Downs, will be published in the forthcoming
number of the Proceedings.
The Second Evening was divided between Dr. Bird and
Mr. McMurtrie. The former presented the Members with a
list of shells collected by himself in the Bath district during
the year 1867, specimens of which were exhibited. The
enumeration of the various shells found within a range of ten
miles round Bath was enlivened by a description of their
construction, habits, and haunts, and the important place
which they filled in the economy of nature. The Helix
cantiana, originally supposed to be restricted to Kent, was
abundant in this neighbourhood. The Helix virgata, too,
played a more important part than was generally supposed,
the flavour of the Lansdown mutton being attributed to the
sheep feeding on this small shell, which abounded in the
short grass of the Downs. Dr. Bird thought that all the
Helices were edible. After the Lecture the President made
remarks on some of the species. The Helix pomatia, often
supposed to have been introduced into this country — either
by the Romans or at some later period — he stated was now
