This unnatural summer is said to have been followed by a
severe winter, with " a frost of nine weeks' continuance." And
it is not improbable that the severity of the latter may have
been in some way connected with it. But if a season is hable
to be thus influenced by the character of the one going before,
so will the weather at all times be more or less determined by
the weather that precedes it, and not merely the weather in
that particular locality in which the observer is placed, but in
the countries generally around. No sooner has" a change
taken place, through the operation, it may be, of mere local
causes, in any of the phenomena of the atmosphere in one
place, than the change, or some effect traceable to it, is trans-
ferred by the agency of the ever- shifting Avinds to other
places, even to distant regions — this effect liable to be itself
modified by the local circumstances and conditions of each
tract of country along which it is conveyed ; and, lastly, the
whole disposition of things, such as would have naturally
followed if left to itself, subject to yet further interruption,
as in the instances above cited, from extraneous causes, which
no human foresight can well take in.
So complicated, indeed, are the conditions which unite to
make up the weather at particular times and seasons, that a
wise man may well pause before he confidently predicts what
the next season is to be. We may rest our guesses upon this
or that circumstance, but they are only guesses, which just as
often turn out wrong as right. Lord Bacon says, in his Essay
"Of Prophecies," — "Men mark when they hit, and never
mark when they miss," and this is especially true of weather
prophets. Some years, we might almost imagine — from the
great irregularity of the seasons, even to the entire dis-
