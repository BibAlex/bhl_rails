me as somewhat remarkable in reference to Bath. In a small
Latin chronicle — Oesta Stephani, Regis Anglorum — which
is a history of the events of the reign of Stephen, there is
a description of Bath and the baths of Bath, which seems to
have a very important bearing upon the romided baths, to
which Mr. Irvine has taken me down. The passage is as
follows : — " Quee civitas Batta vocatui', quod ex Anglicse
linguae proprietate trahens vocabulum. Balneum interpretatur,
80 qubd ad illam ex omni Anglia infirmi causa in salubribus
aquis diluendi, sani vero gratia mirabilcs calidse aquae
eruptiones videndi, et in eis balneandi concurrere solent."
The hot water is spoken of as being conveyed through
mysterious channels out of the depths of the earth, and as
being collected in a bath, which was splendidly arranged into
chambers, with bowed recesses — " ex abstrusis terrre visceribus
sursum in receptaculum per cameratas arcuationes gloriosb
dispositum" — and this description seems to apply to that
which is the actual formation of the Roman baths. The
period of Bath history here referred to was in the generation
immediately after the time of John de Villula, and it seems
from the wording of the passage absolutely certain that John
de Villula had built the baths in the splendid Norman style
in which you know he did rebuild the Abbey Church. It
appears also to be equally plain that at that time the hot
water came up in a large pond, from which pond there were
recesses covered over with circular arches in the Norman
style, and which formed the private baths. Those which
have been recently exposed may possibly be the old baths
preserved from Roman time, and John de Villula may have
only built arches over them.
Having made these few remarks, I shall now refer to
the other topic for consideration. The Sculpture of the
Sun, which is exhibited in the vestibule of the In-
stitution, is something so unique that I can only say,
