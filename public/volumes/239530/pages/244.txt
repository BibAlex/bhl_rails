May. The only other summers besides those just mentioned,
that I remember as particularly hot, were 1818, 1826, and
1858, the last less hot than the two former â€” of none of which
I have any note to say whether the previous winters were mild
or otherwise.
From what, however, has been above stated, there would
certainly seem to be some connection between mild winters
and hot summers, yet it would be very unsafe to argue in all
cases that, because the winter is mild, the next summer will
be hot ; for much depends also upon the character of the
spring, and this will depend mainly upon the prevalence or
not of north-easterly winds, the usual accompaniments of that
season, and which, if persisting very long, are likely to give
place at the commencement of summer to south-westerly,
and so lead to wet ; or if, on the contrary, deficient at that
time, may be expected to return later, causing the bright
cloudless skies and long run of dry weather such as we have
had this year.
But supposing we knew, and could calculate beforehand, all
the ordinary agencies at work to influence the seasons, there
are extraordinary occurrences, which sometimes step in to
defeat our conclusions, due to phenomena not dii-ectly con-
nected with meteorology. It would take up too much space
to go into details on this matter, but one or two such occur-
rences, resting on the experiences of back years, may be briefly
mentioned. Thus, most persons are aware how very much
the temperature of our springs, and sometimes of the early
summer, is lowered by the passage southwards in the Atlantic
oficebergs coming from the north in larger numbers than
usual, chilling the atmosphere for leagues round, and givino-
rise to dense mists by the condensation of vapour, which
through the induced cold can no longer be retained in a
transparent state. Some years, " large fields of floating ice are
said to have been encountered by ships in latitudes as low as
