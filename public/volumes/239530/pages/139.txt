it together, and adding chopped straw, makes a very tenacious
concrete. Among the Moors, large boxes are used for making
masses of this concrete. The ancient walls of Tangier
appear to have been thus built. (See " Urquhart's Pillars of
Hercules," vol. ii., ch. 6.)
3. — The form of the Cold Harbour Villa seems to have
been similar to that of other Villas found around Bath, and
was probably oblong, like that at North Wraxall. Not many,
however, of these Villas have been completely excavated,
some portions, as at Newton, having been previously destroyed.
The most perfect lately uncovered is that at North Wraxall,
described by Mr. Poulet Scrope, in the " Wilts Magazine,"
vol. vii., p. 59, where plans and drawings are given. This
appeared never to have been disturbed since the day of its
destruction. The Villa was an oblong building, containing
an ambulatory and 13 or 14 chambers, with the hypo-
causts and bath entire. A stone wall inclosed the garden or
compound within which the Villa stood, and the well was
found within it. Beyond this were out-buildings, probably
for farm purposes ; these also were encompassed by a wall,
and the burying place of the family was found a little
further removed from the dwelling. Much gratitude is due
to Mr. Scrope for the care he took in the excavation, and for
the careful record he has left of its results. During the time
the excavations were in progress, during the year 1859, this
Club paid several visits to the spot, and noted the particulars,
in which they were much assisted by the kindness of the
rector of the parish, the Kev. Mr. Christie.
A great many Roman Villas have been excavated in this
country, and careful plans made of their arrangement. They
are very varied in plan, but, I think, may be reduced to three
typical forms : —

court ; of this the one uncovered at Wellow is an example.
