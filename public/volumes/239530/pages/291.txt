alluded to they are so nearly upright that the northern dip
is hardly appreciable.
Proceeding stiU farther eastward we find this abnormal
state of things becomes more and more decided, until the
strata, having been folded back upon themselves, dip towards
the Mendips instead of from them.
At Barlake the southern inclination is 72 degrees, at
Holcombe 50 degrees, and when we reach the neighbourhood
of Newbury and Mells the distortion attains its maximum,
the southern dip being only 20 degrees. From this point
eastward there is a gradual increase of inclination, and at 700
yards east of the road leading from Kilmersdon to Vobster,
the strata, as proved at Mells New CoUiery, show an angle of
45 degrees — indicating, as it appears to me, an approach to
that point at which they wiU again become upright before
resuming their legitimate northern dip.
So long a continuation of this southern incHnation would,
were the facts not well established, be apt to mislead us, and
to induce the belief that some enormous fault had thrown the
coal measures down near the Mendips, making them appear
to dip beneath the limestone. But the fact that at Nettle-
bridge every yard of the ground has been proved, and the
gradation traced from the point at which the true northern
inclination exists to where the abnormal southern inclination
shows itself, precludes the possibility of mistake ; and did we
require additional proof, it is to be found in the order of
succession of the veins, which, at the point where the wrong
dip exists, has been completely reversed — those veins which
elsewhere lie deepest being found uppermost, and each indi-
vidual vein, judging from internal evidence, being undoubtedly
upside down.
That the strata must, as they are followed downwards,
resume their proper dip there can be no doubt, but to what
depth the abnormal inclination may hold good it is at present
