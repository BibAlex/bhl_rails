This is a greater number than is now known in the
district, and it is just possible that Dr. Buckland may
have been led into the error of multiplying the number,
from the same veins receiving different names at different
collieries ; but on the whole we may take his list as sub-
stantially correct.
He treats the division as a whole, but, like the upper
division, it has been sub-divided into two distinct series of
veins, known as the (third or) New Eock, and the (fourth
or) Vobster series.
There is not so distinct a line of demarkation between the
third and fourth series as between the two parts of the upper
division, but there is quite sufficient distinction to justify the
local classification.
The distinction lies rather in the character of the veins and
in the nature of the strata between them than in the in-
tervention of any unproductive stratum of rock. The
veins of the New Rock series chiefly produce house coal,
they are (like the veins of the upper division) free from fire-
damp, and the strata intervening between them is a hard
compact sandstone little removed fi-om pennant. Those of the
Vobster series, on the contrary, produce an iron-making coal
of great purity ; they are probably as fiery as any in England,
and they are separated from each other for the most part by
an exceedingly tender shale.
On the section I have dotted the probable line of separa-
tion between the two series, but as they merge gradually into
each other, it is difficult to say precisely where the one begins
and the other ends.
Of the 33 lower division veins enumerated by Dr Buck-
land, about seven are either thin, bad, or irregular ; so that
the division may be said to consist of about 2C workable
veins, of which 18 belong to the New Rock, and eight to the
Vobh^tcr scries.
