Of these only three or four are workable to profit.
The veins of the second series do not appear to main-
tain their distinctive character over the district with the
same persistency as those of the first series ; indeed, so
different are the sections at different parts of the basin,
that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to co-
relate the veins. Generally speaking, however, it consists
of six veins, one or more of which are unworkable. The
coal produced from it is best adapted for household use,
but it is inferior in quality to that produced from the first
series.
The strata of the second series consist, as in the upper
one, of alternations of sandstone and shale, in which the
latter, however, more decidedly predominates. Next in
descending order comes the
PENNANT ROCK.
There are few points at which the pennant can be examined
in the southern part of the coal-field, and until recently I had
an impression that it occupied only a portion of the dis-
tance between the upper and lower divisions. But in
Gloucestershire, where there are better opportunities of
investigating the subject, it clearly forms the entire mass of
the rock which separates the two divisions, and the few facts
we do know of it in the southern part of the field seem to
point to the same conclusion. At Grayfield Colliery, in the
parish of Glutton, the Farringdon series rests directly upon
the pennant, if its under vein may not be said to be in it ;
and in the parish of Downside the New Rock pit, before
reaching the first vein of the lower division, passed through
some 400 or 500 feet of a hard, gritty sandstone, which I
believe can have been no other than the under part of the
pennant. In the section exhibited I have showii the pennant
immediately under the lowest of the Farringdon veins,
