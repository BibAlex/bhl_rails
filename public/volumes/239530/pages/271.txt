regular excursions (four in number) fixed at the Anniversary.
It is to these latter alone that, so far as I am aware,
other Clubs restrict their operations as a body ; and very
good work, no doubt, many of them do, while the
Members receive a stimulus therefrom in furtherance of
the pursuits they carry on at other times each in his
individual capacity. Still, if there is any advantage to be
derived from a body of labourers working collectively in this
way — and what those advantages are I pointed out in the first
Address I read to the Club in 1864 — the same advantages
must attend upon any other occasions of their meeting to-
gether for scientific purposes, and with increased good results
the oftener such meetings take place. But there is another
circumstance which gives a great importance to these weekly
walks. In proportion as the field nearer home has been
repeatedly gone over on the regular excursion days, more and
more distant spots will be chosen for the Club's visits, until
the immediate object for which the Club was formed, viz., the
working out the Natural History and Antiquities of the Bath
District, may come to be quite lost sight of I do not com-
plain of this arrangement, though some limit, I think, should
be put to the distance to which the Club travels, if it were
only in consideration of the expense to which it puts some of
our Members, and the sacrifice of the time of two days, which
is inconvenient to many. In principle I think the arrange-

other ; but then it is only so long as the weekly walks are
kept up, to which, under such circumstances, we must mainly
look for the extending of our knowledge of the productions
of our own neighbourhood, and accumulating those facts in
Natural History, as well as details in matters of topographical
and antiquarian interest, which shall afford material for our
winter evening meetings at home.
And these home gatherings for papers and discussion on
