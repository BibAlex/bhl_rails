says, " Our high position often shows us the whole Bath valley
filled with vapour, while we are basking under a cloudless
sky. On one occasion the Avon valley and all its transverse
branches, together with a portion of Wilts, as far as the Devizes
chalk range, were all submerged beneath a dense superin-
cumbent stratus cloud, whose surface was characteristically
plain, with its edges very strongly defined.
" The elevated table lands of this district appeared to rise
up detached like so many islands, whose bases this silver sea
seemed calmly to wash, and the numerous deep transverse
valleys, reaching from the great oolite strata quite down to
the lias formation, were converted into so many Norwegian
Fiords, whose tortuous coast-line was strikingly brought out
to view. Farleigh and Kingsdown appeared like a more
important island of the group, and its Italian tower easily
assumed the character of a lighthouse, while Lansdown stood
up pre-eminently in the clear sky.
" A stranger might have thought that he was surveying
some sea coast, with its outlying islands ; and the geologist
might have envied the opportunity of exliibiting such a
graphic representation of the actual former state of this very
distl'ict. The beauty of these scenes is not to be described,
but cannot be forgotten."
This manifestly increased quantity of vapour in the valley
helps us to explain, in some measure, the depressing feel in
the air in the lower parts of the town of Bath in very hot
weather. The sensation is illustrated in an amusing way
by Mrs. Piozzi, in one of her letters to Miss W'illoughby.
Writing from Bath, June 15 th, 1818, a year as remarkable
for its very hot summer as the present year, 1868, she says, â€”
" You are fortunate in finding a cool place during the unlooked
for heats of a summer season long forgotten in our country.
My house is, as you know, on the hills side ; but down in
Green Park Buildings one can't help thinking how a fairy
