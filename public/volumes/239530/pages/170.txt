Although the whole of this belongs to the pennant formation,
there are, no doubt, occasional beds of shale, as well as thin
veins of coal intermixed with the sandstones. Dr. Buckland
mentions four veins as occurring above the Globe vein (which
is the highest of the lower division), and these must have
been in the pennant ; but they have not been worked within
the memory of man, and I apprehend they were of no great
value. At Temple Cloud a shaft was sunk many years ago
in the pennant, and a vein was met with, but it was not
sufficiently profitable to induce the owners to continue work-
ing it ; and this, I fear, is the general character of the veins
contained in the formation.
The character and economic uses of the pennant sand-
stones being so well known in Bath and the neighbourhood,
nothing need be said respecting them here, and we now pass
on to the
LOWER DIVISION.
In treating of this I have been greatly assisted by a paper
by " Buckland and Conybeare," published in the "Transactions
of the Geological Society" for 1824. At the time Dr. Buck-
land visited the district, the coal mines of the lower division
were more generally and extensively worked than they are
now, and he was thus enabled to procure and place on record
a great deal of valuable information, which would otherwise
have been for ever lost. In compiling his paper, he seems to
have consulted the best local authorities, and to this he has
evidently added a great deal of personal research, so that in
matters of fact his statements are generally correct.
He enumerates in all 87 veins as belonging to the lower
part of the coal measures, but from this number must be
deducted the four upper veins, which evidently belong to the
pennant, leaving 33 as the number contained in the lower
division.
