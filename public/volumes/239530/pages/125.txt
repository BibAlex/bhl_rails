rocks, granite, slate, or basic limestone, these are generally
sulphurous and salt, and moderately warm, and these, or many
of them, seem to have this curious characteristic, that they show
an inconstant temperature of their sources. Those at the Bagneres
de Luchon Avere cold springs until after an earthquake that took
place in the year 1755; those at Eigorre were by an earthquake
in the previous century, in 1660, temporarily rendered cool,
though they soon recovered their heat ; those hot springs such as
at Aix la Chapelle, and some of the German and other springs
that were known and used by the Eomans, would appear to have
become warmer since their times, for they apparently used them
for bathing direct from the source, without any cooling, which
could not now be done.
The last class of springs which we will now examine, appear to
have a very equable temperature, though not so high as those
that rise from near the granite.
The first general characteristic of this class is that they arise
from, or close above the Carboniferous limestone, the water appear-
ing to well up through some natural fissure or fault, which follows
the joint lines of the rock ; hence the water that has penetrated
from the surface following the planes of stratification, being the
lines of least resistance, again comes to the surface by natural
fissures acting like Artesian wells (presuming that the opening of
these fissures is below the level of the edges or out-crop of the
strata where the water enters), the water consequently may
traverse the lines of stratification for a long distance, taking the
short cut of the joint opening for its exit.
The usual manner of accounting for hot springs appearing above
the surface of the earth has })een thus : â€” It has been supposed
that the water from the surface has descended into the lower
regions, where it has come into contact with heated rock, the
consequence of the internal heat of the globe, and that this has
generated steam and gases Avhich have then forced the water thus
heated to the surface.
