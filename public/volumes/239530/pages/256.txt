fine avenue of oak and elm trees ; at Almondsbury, a few
minutes' halt gave an opportunity of enjoying, from the
quarry's edge, the extensive and well-known view across the
richly wooded alluvial plains which bound the golden Severn.
The long street which constitutes the ancient market town of
Thornbury was more than usually animated this morning,
and justified the accounts of its historical antiquity, as it was
then holding its annual " Mop " fair — a piece of benighted
