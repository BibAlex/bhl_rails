jaouse, a xme oid uuiiding of tlie 17th century, and one of
the class of which I have been speaking. In this house the
Earl of Lexington is said to have lived some time last century.
Inigo Jones's Guildhall, with all the rest, is gone ; and if we
want to re-construct in our minds the Bath of that day, we
must look to the old manor houses. How different the
thoroughfares must have looked then ! The houses were not
then built to front the streets ; that was a habit only intro-
duced in the last century. Previously the gable ends were

to get at the front, which was at right angles with the tho-
roughfare. Each house stood alone, and was a castle of itself.
All this points back to a veiy difierent state of society to that
which now prevails, when there was much less security than
that which is now enjoyed. In like manner, if we turn to
the country, the old manorial houses tell us of a different
class of society â€” a class which has vanished. These were the
independent houses of the lesser gentry, or yeomen, who have
become all but extinct in this country, with whose glory
they, more than any other class of the community, are so
greatly linke(L It was that class that won the historic battles
of the country, and which, stiU existing in America, has carried
the North successfully through its great conflict with the*
South.
We have thus seen how great have been the changes in the
architectural features of the city in the past ; but we can
hardly anticipate, looking at its present arrangements, any
such changes in the proximate future. Still we do see,
even now, veiy considerable buildings disappearing in a
comparatively short time after they have been built. Among
these are the old Blue Coat School, which was not older than
1712, and was built by a higlily respectable architect,
Killigrew ; and the fine mansion (known as Dr. Bave's house)
lately demolished for the New Wing of the Hospital ; and
