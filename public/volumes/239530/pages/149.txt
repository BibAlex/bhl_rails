British period — from the earliest dawn of history down to
the present day — represents at each stage something, and
something worth telHng, like the history of Bath.
But I am now going to confine myself to one particular set
of observations, and their leading idea may be found in
a page of Mr. Scarth's Aquce Solis. That gentleman
observes that the Roman pavements found outside were
better than those which have been found inside the city
walls ; and he accounted for this by the greater demolition
and reconstruction which took place within the inclosed
area, than on the outside. This seems a very simple ob-
servation, but it is one of very extensive application, and I
propose to apply it to other ages besides the Roman.
But before quitting the Roman period one observation
must be made about Roman coins The instruction got
from such coins is not from contemplating them as objects,
but from the circumstances and associations of their excava-
tion. It is desirable to know in each case in what spot they
were found, at what depth from the surface : and to have a
complete catalogue of all coins found from first to last mthin
a definite circuit. It is only by these data that any useful
results can be summed up from coins discovered. I fear
that the coins found in past years in this locality have been
very imperfectly recorded, and the consequence is we do not
know the total of each reign found. This is one of the
most important difficulties in reconstructing the Roman
history of Bath ; but the fact that these records were badly
kept in past times, is one reason why those who have the
opportunity should see that they are better kept in future.
Excavations, as you know, are going on at the White Hart,
and several things have been found there. It is of the
greatest importance that these should be kept together and
catalogued, that we might know in each case at what depth
and in what stratum they are found. Mr. Irvine, who is
