the moimtain summits of Britain were low islands, extending to
the area of Norway through a glacial sea, and clothed with an
arctic vegetation, which in the gradual upheaval of the land
and consequent change of climate, became limited to the summits
of the new-formed and still existing mountains." " 5thly. A
Germanic Flora, resulting from the upheaval of the bed of the
glacial sea and the consequent connexion of Ireland with
England, and of England with Germany, by great plains. This
Flora, which includes the great mass of our native plants,
extends over the greater part of Great Britain and Ireland,
mingling with the other Floras, and diminishing, though slightly,
as we proceed westward, indicating its easterly origin and
relation to the characteristic Flora of northern and western
Germany."*
I have given the above theory for the most part in Professor
E. Forbes's OAvn words, and shall not stop to say more respecting
it. Having got our plants, let us proceed now to consider what
influences they will be subject to after their arrival, to favour or
retard their spreading as the case may be, some gradually taking
root everywhere, others settling doAvn in a given spot, or
appearing perhaps in more localities than one, with wider or
narrower intervals between these localities in which they are
not fciund These influences are mainly soil and climate, and
the relative advantages possessed by certain ^species over others
growing beside them. Some plants grow only on particular
rocks, or on alluvial soils formed in great measure by the
disintegration of such rocks ; others are less fastidious, and will
grow almost anywhere. Such is the character of many weeds
which obtrude themselves on our notice go Avhere we will.
Where there is the greatest variety of soils, there will be,
<:(ekris paribus, the greatest variety of plants ; where one character
of soil prevails chiefly, there may be a strong and luxuriant
