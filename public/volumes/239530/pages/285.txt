From the foregoing it will be seen that at least two-thirds
of the faults recorded range parallel with the line of the
Mendips between Ashwick and Mells, and that a majority of
them are downthrows to the north, or traps down from that
range.
Passing on to describe more in detail those faults and
contortions which deserve special notice, I would begin
with the
FARMBOROUGH FAULT.
This, as already stated, has been met with 900 yards south
of the village of the same name, and it is an upthrow north
or otherwise a downthrow south of 600 feet. The remarkable
thing connected with it is that the upper or Radstock series
has not been found to the north of it, and that it has formed
in the Timsbury district an effectual barrier to the northern
extension of mining enterprise.
After the dislocation occurred, the strata on the "rise"
side must have been exposed to great denudation, and, as a
consequence, the upper strata have there been almost entirely
washed off. A pit was sunk many years ago to the north of
the fault and near the village of Farmborough, with the
expectation of winning the veins of the upper series, which
have been extensively worked at the adjoining Timsbury
collieries ; but only a mere trace of them was found in the
upper part of the pit, and on continuing the sinking it was
found that the veins of the second series, which are elsewhere
of considerable value, had there been sub -divided into so
many thin pieces as to be practically useless, so that after
expending .Â£'10,000 on the adventure the owners gave up the
attempt in despair. Although this trial terminated so
disastrously, it does not necessarily follow that the upper
series may not be found farther to the north. Dr. Buckland
has assigned to it certain veins which were worked a century
