are still other matters to which I -vvoukl have alluded had the
time pennitted, — especially the desirableness of having any
specimens of particular interest or value met with in the Bath
district, and relating either to its Natural History or Antiquities,
deposited in the museum of this Institution. But I have said
enougli already ; and to treat of this matter as it requires would
necessitate my dilating a little on the subject of museums in
general, which I reserve for another occasion, when I may
perhaps bring it under your notice. What I have stated now is
offered simply in the way of suggestions — so far as my sugges-
tions may be of any service, — tov;ards placing the Club upon a
good footing so as to insure its usefulness, and stimulating its
members to do what they can for promoting the objects for which
it was originally established.
And let us not be discouraged if, for a time at least, we reap
but little fruit :
" Est quadam prodire tenus si non datur ultra."
It is observed by the great Cu^aer, that the " natural sciences
are but collections of facts, and our theories only formulae for
embracing a large number of them : hence it follows, that the
smallest fact, if well-ascertained, ought to be preserved, — since,
if new, it may serve to modify our most approved theories ; the
most simple observation may overthrow the most ingeniously-
constructed system, and open our eyes to a long train of discoveries,
which had previously been concealed from view by received
formulae."*
With these words I conclude. We may not any of us attain to
that high position in the ranks of science which Cuvier occupied,
and which so many other distinguished men have earned by their
respective discoveries as well in our own day as in times past.
But we may do enough to entitle us to the thanks of those who
