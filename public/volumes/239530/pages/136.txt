Eoman Villas which once stood around Bath, and have
perished by fire. The traces of burnt matter, and the stones
reddened by fire, attest this fact ; and a population like the
Saxon, inured to living in the woods, and constructing their
own simple habitations of timber, saw little use in the
preservation of these Villas, which seem to have been given
up to plunder, and the cattle driven off the farm. 'Mr.
Kemble, in his " Saxons in England," vol. ii., page 296,
speaking of the Saxon conquest of Britain, observes, " They
had not the motive, the means, or perhaps the patience, to
unbuild what was solidly constructed. Where it suited their
purpose to save the old Roman work, they used it to their
own advantage ; where it did not suit their views of con-
venience or policy to establish themselves on or near old
sites, they quickly left them to decay. There is not even
a probability that they in general took the trouble to
dismantle walls or houses to assist in the construction of
their own rude dwellings. Boards and rafters, much more
easily accessible, and to them much more serviceable, much
more easy of transport than stones and hard tiles, they very
likely removed." There are certain features of this Villa
which remain yet to be noticed.
1. — The Rectangular Inclosure. The portion of this
boundary directly opposite to the part where excavations were
made, consisted of a broad wall of masonry, about 5 feet wide,
for several yards, which then ceased, and was continued in
a straight line at nearly the same width by an earthen
mound. The mound forming the inclosure was cut through
at different points, but did not indicate any masonry except
opposite to the Villa itself.
2. — The remains of walls of the Villa appear to have been
of a uniform height. The' surface, when uncovered, did not
present a jagged or broken appearance, but as if remaining
in their original condition ; and this is found to be the case
