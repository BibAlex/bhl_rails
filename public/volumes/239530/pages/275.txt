which these bold thinkers have arrived, let us not reject the
positive facts which science is continually bringing to light,
nor its theories, when based on facts for which the most
indisputable evidence can be adduced. The simple question
for us to determine is, are they true ? If we are not able,
from insufficient Icnowledge of the subject, to answer this
question for ourselves, we must lean on the authority of those
qualified to be judges. It then becomes a matter of faith ;
faith not only to believe what is told us respecting things we
have not ourselves attended to, but to believe that the
truths we receive from others in this way, if they be truths,
can never prejudice or affect any other truths, even of the
highest kind. We need not for a moment fear such a result
â€” it is simply impossible. We may be led to think differently
of these last truths, differently in respect of the witnesses we
had called in to speak to their character, to look at them
from a different point of view, or to separate from them what
does not essentially belong to them ; but the truths them-
selves will remain what they always were. For truth is one,
and immoveable as a rock.
We may even be brought, by the aid of science, by the
light of inductive philosophy, to a better understanding of
some portions of Scripture, the great source of Divine truth
itself All must allow the clearer insight it has already given
us into some questions connected with the early history of
man, and of this earth his dwelling place, as well as the
assistance it has afforded in the right interpretation of many
of the ancient records contained in the Bible. Nor can we
doubt that science wiU do yet more for that inestimable
volume, helping us to explain much that is obscure, yet
leaving utterly intact all that concerns the highest interests
of man, all that bears upon his moral and religious advance-
ment, and his hopes of an hereafter.
Gentlemen, I know that these are solemn thoughts, not per-
