such catalogues as that at Stourhead always existed, as the
valuable works shut up in private libraries in England would
then be known.
The Members visited the Museum of Antiquities in another
part of the building. This appeared not well attended to,
one of the cases had been forced open, in another the glass
was broken ; and the rare and curious objects which had been
obtained from the Barrows of Wilts, some of which are of
gold and others very rare, are thus insufficiently protected.
These objects are happily engraved in Hoare's "Ancient
Wilts." The collection is full of ancient urns, the more curious
and rare are put under cases. These have also been imitated
in modem pottery, and the imitations are placed on the floor
of the Museum.
The hall contains some Roman Funereal marble Cippi,
which have been brought from abroad. They are of the
heathen period. Two inscriptions were copied : â€”
