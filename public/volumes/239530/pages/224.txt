within a few (three or four) feet of the surface, where the EUza-
bethan pipes come in, with other and more modem refuse. The
finest and best "flakes" occur just where the black earth termi-
nates and the yellow band commences. These " cores " and
" flakes " somewhat puzzle me. Of what use were they to the
Romans? For that they were contemporaneous with that
people may be fairly assumed as reasonable from the fact that
they are found associated with pieces of Roman pottery, boars-
tusks, ox teeth, &c. Is it that we here find traces of a people
who had hardly passed from the stone to the iron age ? Were
iron implements a scarce article with the primitive inhabit-
ants of Aquae Solis ? or, were these flint implements the relics
of an ancient superstition, the saxum silex or lapis silex of the
" pater patratus"? "0 Jove, smite thou the Roman people, as I
here to-day shall smite this hog. And having said this, he
struck the hog with a flint stone." And thus were conse-
crated the solemn treaties of the Roman people. (Liv. i. 24 ;
XXX. 43.) That the Jews regarded flint knives with reverence
we know. Vide that remarkable passage on the death and
burial of Joshua. (LXX. Josh. xxiv. 29, 30.) "'Exr. eQnxav /aet'
ihiv a'uf rn! aV^fov V''f«f." (Vide Tylor's " Early History of
Mankind.")
But to whatever purposes these flint implements may have
been applied, it surely is not an idle curiosity that prompts one
to gather up every thread of a lost history, and thus to endea •
vour to " shadow out the period in the dim distance " when
a people of somewhat similar habits and of like wants with
ourselves lived, struggled, and perished in this land of ours.
At least this search for the missing links will give a zest to
our rambles on the wild sea- coast and the barren moor ; and
we shall not enjoy the beauties of nature the less for finding
that others have gone before us and have left their footsteps
behind.
