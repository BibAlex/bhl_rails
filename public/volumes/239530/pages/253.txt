sculpture of the t3mipanum over the south door. By the
kindness of Mr. Inman, I have a very small photograph of it,
but as there is a large porch in front of the door the tym-
panum is very little displayed. It is well known that
Norman architectm-e is only a modified form of Roman
architecture. In fact, the pictorial ornamentation which
belonged to the pediment of the Roman temple was trans-
ferred to the tympanum of the south door of the Norman
church. Now, on the one at Malmesbury you have the figure
of our Saviour, in the well known pointed oval (instead of the
circular wreath) which formed the medallion of Christian art.
Our Saviour is enthroned, and on each side is an angelical
figure, which strikingly brings to mind the part assigned
to the supporting Victorys. Besides, it is so like the
sculpture at Bath, that one can hardly help thinking that
there is a relationship or pedigree between one and the
other. The work at Malmesbury may have been of the
eleventh century ; that at Bath must be, I suppose, of the
third or very early in the fourth century, which makes you
realise what long gaps there are in the pedigree of the family
of art. In conclusion, I wish to draw attention to the owl
and helmet of Minerva, forming part of the bus relief, which
represents, with great propriety, the local associations of
Bath â€” the place were Sul-Minerva was worshipped.
The serpents also in the hair contain a double allusion to
Minerva. For in the first place they represent the snaky
hair of the Gorgo, whose head was borne on Minerva's segis ;
and in the second place, the serpent was no less than the owl
an ancient symbol of the goddess. Once when Demosthenes
was disgusted with the Athenians, he told them in a sort of
half-angry banter, that he wondered at their dear goddess ;
that she should have chosen to take under her protection
three such queer things as the snake, the owl, and the
democratic populace.
