Zonites alliarius. — Bathampton Down, Claverton, and Swains-

Z. radiatulus. — Under stones and in moss, Lans-

Z. crystallinus. — Under stones and in moss ; woods and

Z. fulvus. — Woods round Lansdown; wet moss, and
under decayed wood.
Helix aculeata. — Combwell, near Monkton Farleigh ; Bath-
ampton, under stones.
H — pomatia. — This species has not hitherto been found
nearer Bath than Cirencester, where it is common in
the long grass and woods near old Roman Villas and
Camps upon the Cotswold Hills. I have never seen
it in the valley, but only in old quarries in the ooHte
and woods growing on that formation. It is often
found nestled in the Brachypodium pinnatum, a
common grass on the hills round Cheltenham, though
it is said never to attack this grass, or to bite the
leaves. As old Roman works are common about
Bath, and the geological formation is of the same
character as near Cheltenham, there seems no reason
why the Helix pomatia should not be present here.
Wlien properly cooked, and the stomach removed
from the body of the snail, they have much the
flavour of veal.
E. — aspersa. — Common everywhere in gardens, &c.
H. — nemm^alis. — Very common, varying much in colour,
as also in the number and breadth of the bands ;
sometimes plain yellow, brown, pink, or white, with-
out any bands.
