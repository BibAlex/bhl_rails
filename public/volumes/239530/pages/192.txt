(Aqua3 Solis) ; thence to Bitton (Abona), six miles ; thence
ad Sabrinam (doubtful), six miles ; then gives three miles
for the transit across the Severn ; thence to Caerwent (Venta
Silurum), eight miles ; and on to Caerleon (Isca Colonia),
nine miles more ; and so on, marking particularly the sta-
tions and distances to St. David's, from whence he gives the
distance across to Ireland, thirty miles.
The XIV Iter of Antonine is carried along the Via Julia,
ab Isca Calleva, or from Caerleon to Silchester.
It begins — Item alio itinere, ab Isca Calleva, M.P. CIII.,
Sic. The former Iter, to which here allusion is made, is the
XIII, which is also ab Isca Calleva, but passes through Usk,
Monmouth, Ross, Gloucester, Cirencester, and Speen, to Sil-
chester. But the XIV Iter, commencing from Isca (Caerleon),
is as follows : —
Venta Silurum (Caerwent) M.P. IX.
f 2 Abona (Bitton) IX.

Aquis Solis (Bath) VI.
Verlucione (High Field, near Sandy Lane) XV.
Cunetione (Folly Farm, Marlborough) ... XX.
Spinis (Speen) ... .... .... .... XV.
Calleva (Silchester) XV.
This Iter therefore carries the Via Julia as far as Silchester,
and we may therefore apply the name to the whole line of
ancient Roman road between Silchester and St. David's.
But it extends beyond Silchester to London, and again from
London communicates with the sea at Dover. The Romans,
therefore, had a direct line of road from Dover to St. David's,
which passed through this city (Bath), and crossed the
Severn near the New Passage, as it is now called, not far fi-om
where the present line of railway from Bristol crosses to
Portskewett. Indeed, the old camp of Sudbrook, which
protected the passage, is still existing. General Roy, in his
