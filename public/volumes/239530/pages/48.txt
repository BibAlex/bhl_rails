without a thought or purpose beyond getting together every
thing uncommon or odd-looking that comes within their reach.
But the mere virtuoso, in the department of Natural History,

and they have felt a desire to know something more of nature's

Hence the formation of Museums on strictly scientific principles.

some useful or educational purpose, they become valuable
accessories to our knowledge, while they tempt men of inquiring
minds to enter upon a study, having great advantages to
recommend it, which otherwise they might never have been led
to take up.
The first person said to have " made any considerable collec-
tion of objects of Natural History in this country" was John
Tradescant, "by birth a Dutchman, who is supposed to have
