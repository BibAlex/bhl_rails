several months of the past season, we now take the summer
<is a whole, and compare Bath and Greenwich in the same
respects. Here, however, I confine myself as before — when
estimating the average summer temperatures from the four
years 1865, 1866, 1867, and 1868* — to the months of June,
July, and August.
The mean temperature of the whole summer of 1868 at
Bath was 63°.5, being 2^.2 higher than the average above
alluded to, and 0'.9 lower than the mean at Greenwich, which
last Mr. Glaisher states to have been 4°. 3 higher than the
average of the preceding 97 years.
The mean of all the highest at Bath was 7 3°. 5, being S^.O
higher than the average of the four years above alluded to ;
and 4°. 3 lower than the mean of all the highest, this last
summer, at Greenwich. So, while the difference between
Bath and Greenwich was under one degree in respect of the
Tnean temperature, it was nearly four and a half degrees in
respect of the mean of the highest.
Hot summers are almost necessarily dry ones, in accordance
with what has been already stated in the first part of this
paper. Fine settled weather in this country is, as a rule,
attended more or less by easterly winds, i.e., winds oscillating
chiefly between north-east and south-east, though they may
occasionally fall back to north or even to north-west. These
winds are dry and parching, and cause great evaporation,
bringing no moisture with them like the south-westerly and
westerly. The longer they blow the clearer becomes the
atmosphere, and the more open for the passage of the sun's
rays. If the south-east winds are moister than the north-
east in the first instance, they soon part with their moisture
in passing over the large tracts of land they have to traverse
before reaching the English shores.
We all know the drought of the past summer. We
