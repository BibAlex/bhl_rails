The English towns differ from continental towns in this,
that every continental town has its square or open area. In
England, we scarcely ever see such a thing ; but there is
reason to suppose that in the Roman period all the towns
must have had them. Therefore, in reconstructing in your
minds Roman Bath, you must look somewhere for an open
area ; and I imagine that nowhere could there be a better place
than just where the White Hart stood. The temple, certainly,

Having said thus much respecting the Roman period, I
wish to touch on some traces of antiquity outside Bath,
belonging to the time immediately following the Roman

somewhat mythical, and we hardly know what is true, and
what is legendary story ; but I have a growing conviction
in my own mind, that we have in these stories a piece of real

that was fought between Arthur and the Saxons upon the
ground of Solsbury and Hampton Down. The legend runs
thus : â€”

and pursued him to the wood and besieged him there. Then said
Colgrim to Childric, " Lord Childric, either we must go out into

peace. Here we cannot stay : it is better to he honorably on the
land than to perish -with hunger."
Childric heard this where he lay within the dyke, and answered
with sorrowful voice, " If Baldulf thy brother wills it, and our
comrades Avill it so, we will pray Arthur for peace. For Arthur
