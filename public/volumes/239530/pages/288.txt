In order to give a clear idea of this extraordinary disloca-
tion, I have constructed a cross section of the strata affected.
(See Section No. I. api^ended, which is a reduction from the
original.) The section begins a httle to the north of Tyning
pit, passes through the fault at right angles, and shows its
effect on the upper series. The extreme extent of the overlap
would be found in the centre of the village a httle farther to
the west, but I have selected the line indicated partly because
at present there are more particulars obtainable there than at
any other point in the manor, and partly to take in the two
smaller faults which I have already mentioned. You will
observe that the veins have been moved bodily forward, the
letters AA, BB, and so on indicating the fractured ends, now
far apart, but which were once united. The maximum amount
of overlap may be estimated as follows : —
On the Great Vein 120 yards
„ Top Little Vein uncertain
„ Middle Vein, not less than ... 1 60 yards
but the full extent not ascertained.
„ SlyvingVein 291 „
„ Under Little Vein 308 „
„ Bull Vein 330 „
Some may be disposed to ask whether there may not be
some mistake about this forward movement, and to inquire
whether the strata may not have been originally deposited as
we find them ; but in reply I would explain that each vein
possesses so many distinctive features of tliickness, sub-
division, and surrounding strata as to render its identifica-
tion easy and mistake impossible.
I have classed the overlap in the catalogue of true faults,
because it does not consist of a folding of the strata, but, hke
all dislocations properly so called, it possesses a clear, well-
defined line of fi-acture. In vertical faults the Hues of fi-acture
have originally formed chasms or crevices which have
