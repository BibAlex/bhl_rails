in niches, and sometimes the god or goddess held on the
flat hand that little goddess of Victory as here represented ;
for this goddess was one of the most common during the
imperial time of Rome. In the other representation (admir-
ably enlarged by Mr. Irvine after a woodcut in Mr. CoUingwood
Bruce's work on the Northern Wall) you have two " Victorys "
with one garland between them. It is taken from Mr. Bruce's
work, and is intended, in a splendid and exaggerated form,
to depict the glories of Legion XX. It would be a sign or
blazonry of the Legion, and probably occupied inside the
gates a pre-eminence on the walls. There the small garland
of Victory was transformed into a vast wreath, which took two
Victorys to present it to the view. The effect of these grace-
ful figures on either side is something like tlie " supporters"
in modem heraldry; only more pleasing. That is plainly what
you have represented in the fragments under consideration ;
but here you have the Sun — and Bath was known under the
name of Aquce Soils — depicted in the midst of a double
garland, which two Victorys are holding up, with the
globe for a foot-rest ; but it is much more highly per-
fect as a work of art than the other. The one Irom the
Roman wall was worthy a camp ; the one in the vestibule
was fit for a polished Roman city. In order to convey to
you who are present some idea of the importance of Victory
in the minds of the Romans of the first four centuries, I have
marked in the work of Bruce a half-dozen places in which
this symbolic figure (the single Victory), whole or in frag-
ment, is pictured after relics actually found along the line of
the wall.
The goddess also bears an important place in general
history. I have already stated that the hall in which
the Senate met at Rome was, in fact, a temple of Victory, and
that there was a statue of Victoria which had been brought
by Julius Caesar from Magna Grsecia and consecrated there.
