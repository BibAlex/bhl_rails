favourable, they re-appear year after year, occasionaUy becoming
quite naturalised. Several foreign grasses have found their way
into this country in this manner, as well as two or three species
of clover. It has even been conjectured that certain plants,
which are almost entirely confined to cultivated land, seldom
appearing elsewhere, such as the corn ranunculus and some of
our red poppies, however common and generally distributed they
may now be, owe their first origin to this circumstance ; or plants
which are truly indigenous in some parts of this country may be
carried accidentally to others where they were previously
unknown.
In the " Intellectual Observer " for IVIay last, a curious case
is recorded of Â« Floral Immigration at Mitcham, in Surrey," in
which more than forty species of new plants seem to have quite
recently sprung up in that neighbourhood, ''through the agency
of the foreign grain trade." Some of these are British plants,
though not before knoAvn in that locality ; many, however, are
foreign ; the Leguminosce, a family containing numerous species
groAvn for agricultural purposes, constituting a large proportion
of the whole.*
In the Bath Flora, we have about ten species that may be
considered as mere weeds of cultivation, some of them having
shown themselves in only a single instance. Of these the most
recently observed, so far as I am aware, are Camelim sativa,
Asperula arvensis, and Erysimura orkntah The first of these was
found by myself, last year, on waste ground at Weston. The
other two have occurred during the present year, as weeds in a
garden at Limpley Stoke, that was till quite lately an arable
field, the circumstance being kindly communicated to me by
;Mrs. Peacock of that place.
But many plants find their way into new localities fi-om other
causes than conveyance with seed. A large number are escapes
