Plants e$her extinct in the Bath district, or inserted in the
Bath Flora by mistake, or probably.
Cardamine bellidifolia. — Bab. Fl. Bath. p. 4. Said to have been
found formerly by Merrett. No one has found it since.
Dentaria bulbifera. — "In Prior Park, near the Upper Lodge,
abundant." Bev. B. Biclumlson Sole M.S. IMr. Flower
informs me that this plant has not been observed of late
years, and that possibly the locality may have been
destroyed by the building of the Eoman Catholic College.
Arenaria tenuifoUa. — "Probably a mistake." See Bab. Supp.
p. 71.
Mcsnchia ereda. — Bab., p. 8. Said to have been found by Dr.
Eeneage Gibbs. No one else seems to have met with it.
Erodium moschatum.—h&h Supp., p. 72. Mr. I'lower informs me
this species rests on the authority of the late Mr. J. Jelly,
in his M.S. Flora Bathonica, from whence it was copied by
Professor Babington. Possibly it may have been
confounded with the £. cicutarhim.
Ficia lutea. — Bab. p. 13. "Gathered on the road-side beyond
Midford, by the Eev. B. Richardson, and reported by him
to Dr. Davies. Not observed of late years, and possibly
