exhiljiting characters which sejjarate it from all birds known
hitherto, it having a long vertebrate tail, and apparently other
characters equally exceptional, but which are not at present
capable of being defined with accuracy, from the imperfect srate
of tlie remains of the only specimen hitherto examined.
The above remarks are in reference to the vertebrate division
of animals ; but they apply equally to the invertebrate, the several
classes of which seem in like manner to be all connected by
osculant forms, while there is a genus of fishes, — the Am})hioxiis
of Yarrel found on our own shores, — so low in its organisation,
and with the vertebral column so imperfectly developed, as to
present more the appearance of a moUusk than a fish, and actually
to have been 'classed with the moUusca by one naturalist (the
celebrated Pallas) ; thus showing that even the two great divisions
of Vertebrata and Invertebrata have no such clearly defined
boundary between them as might have been supposed.* We
know yet further the bold hypothesis of one of the most philo-
sophical naturalists of our day, — not entirely unsupported by
facts, nay, with a large body of fccts in its favour, though
certainly not proved, nor capable of being proved, — that all the
different forms of mineral and vegetable life may have sprung
originally from at most but a vevy few 2>rimitive germs, which,
hy continued development under constantly altering conditions of
life through a long succession of ages, have given rise to all the
different species and varieties we see at the present day, whether
in the fossil or living state. Into these speculations Ave will not
enter. I only mention them in connection Avith Avhat I j^reviously
stated, — to shoAV hoAv necessary it is for the student of any par-
ticular department of Natural History to be acquainted in a
general way with all the other departments. Whether the several
species of animals and plants have had an independent origin or
