this stage of activity ; and perhaps it may never get to it.
In the meantime, l" should suggest that members who read
papers which it is desirable to publish, be invited to send
them to one of the periodicals of the day treating of that
particular department of knowledge to which the papers relate,
while any others— at least those which respect our own
district— after being read to the Club, be carefully preserved
by it for future reference. Members of the Club who,
however they may like to join the excursions occasionally,
prefer carrying on their own pursuits quietly by themselves,
or who find they can do so best when unfettered by the move-
ments of a large body,— should be requested still to bring
their results forward, to go towards a general collection of
such materials as may, we hope, one day serve for a complete
illustration of the Natural History, &c., of this neighbourhood.
I think, however, instead of adopting the practice of the
Bervrirkshire Club, of reading papers at the end of each day's
excursion, it would be preferable, for several reasons, to have
independent meetings held for the purpose, as on this very
day, and at this Institution, or elsewhere, and as often as
thought desirable. We hardly know yet to what extent such
papers may come in. If, with an increasing number of
members, there should seem to be an increasing interest taken
in the objects of the Club, and communications made to it more
frequently, the Club might merge into a Bath Natural History
and Antiquarian Society, — still keeping up its field days, and
everything going on as it does now, with the simple addition
of a certain number of other days, fixed at the Anniversary or
at the quarterly meetings, for the purpose alluded to. I think, at
these sittings, preference should be given to papers relating to
the Bath district, but after these have been read, or in the event
of none such being brought forward, it might be left to
members to make any communication to the Club they
pleased, though not of a local character, or to exhibit any
specimens of Natural History or Antiquities, which they
thought might interest it, accompanied by remarks. With
regard to the excursion days — whether the excursions be in or
beyond the Bath neighbourhood — some notes should be kept
by the Secretary of what is seen or done by the party
collectively, and these might either be embodied into an
address by the retiring President, delivered at the end of his
year of office, as in the Berwickshire Club, — or they may
continue to be read by the Secretary from his Journal of
Proceedings each quarter, as done hitherto.
Gentlemen, I fear I have detained you rather long ; and there
are still other matters to which I would have alluded had the
time permitted, — especially the desirableness of having any
