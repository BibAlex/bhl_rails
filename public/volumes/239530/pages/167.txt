existed at all, it lay at enormous depth ; and this reflection
induces the hope that under 'many parts of the country now
belieyed to be barren, or in which coal is supposed to be
hopelessly buried beneath more recent strata, it may yet be
found at moderate depth.
THE COAL MEASUKES.
Between the secondary, formations, which we have hitherto
been considering, and the carboniferous strata, to which I
would now direct your attention, 'there are many points of
striking contrast,
The former bear little evidence of disturbance, they occupy
a nearly horizontal position, and they are all approximately
conformable to each other. The latter, on the contrary,
exhibit every possible mark of disturbance ; they generally lie
at a high angle, and they are consequently not in conformity
with the overlying rocks. A period of great denudation
would appear to have succeeded the disturbances to which I
have referred, for the irregularities have been washed off,
and the new red sandstone has been deposited on a com-
paratively level surface.
In treating of a formation so extensive within the limits of
so short a paper, it is obviously impossible to put before you
detail sections ; and I shall therefore confine myself to those
broader features which are likely to be of general interest.
The coal measures have been separated vertically into two
great divisions, by the intervention of an immense mass of
coal measure sandstone, well known in this and other
districts as the Pennant rock. The upper division includes
all the coal-bearing strata above the Pennant, the lower
division takes in all the strata intervening between the Pen-
nant rock and the Millstone grit.
The Upper Division embraces what are locally known as
the first, or Radstock, and the second, or Farringdon, series.
