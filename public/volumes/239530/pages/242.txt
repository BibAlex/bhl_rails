June the mean depression of the dew point below the dry-
bulb thermometer was more than 1 degrees ; while the
relative humidity of the air (saturation being 100) in May
was 69, in June 72, some days in the latter month as
low as 56. In July the mean depression of the dew point
was not quite so great, but the northerly winds were more
constant.
There had been two thunderstorms previously, in April ;
one on the 21st, the other on the 25th; but the weather
during the latter half of that month was very unsettled, with
an excess of rain, and the air generally in a much more
humid state than in any of the three following months. All
this seems to afford testimony to what has been above stated
with respect to the conditions under which thunderstorms
usually take place.
It may be added that the summer of 1835, which was very
hot and dry, like that of 1868, was also characterised by the
occurrence of very few thunderstorms.
Having now spoken of the principal features observable in
the summer of 1868, I proceed to notice a question which
some may be disposed to ask, and that is, whether we are
ever hkely to be able to predict the character of the coming
season, so as to foresee a hot summer like that we have just
experienced ? It would be presumptuous confidently to assert
what science, even so backward a science as meteorology,
compared with some others, may, or may not, be equal to in
years to come. Assuredly, however, we are not in a position
to do this at present. We may note some things as favour-
ing our expectations. But while even the ordinary causes
that combine to influence weather are so many and so com-
pHcated as not easily to be disentangled, there arise from
time to time contingencies, which no human sagacity can
foresee, to confound all our calculations.
I have no notes by me to refer to respecting all the
