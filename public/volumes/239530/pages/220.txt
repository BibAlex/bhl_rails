kangaroo skins to wear as mantles. These implements
generally assume a rounded form, they are usually shorter
than the " flakes," and more circular, one end being neatly
chipped all round to a cutting edge, by a series of careful
and gentle blows ; the other left plain for holding between
the finger and thumb (hence called "thumb flakes"), or for
insertion in a handle. In some cases a "flake " seems to
have been adapted to this purpose at one end, the other left
rough as it came from the core.
If, then, you have been able to follow my attempt to
describe the process by which these stone implements have
been adapted to various uses, you will readily perceive, in the
specimens exhibited this evening, evident traces of design,
and regard them as the stone records of a people long since
passed away. They are the result of my late wanderings, but
represent only a very small portion of my "finds." Being
last summer at the small but ambitious watering-place called
"Westward Ho ! " in the neighbourhood of Bideford, with
the fine coast-line extending from Braunton Burrows to
Baggy Head before my eyes, the classic ground of geologists,
and well known to me from former visits, I was induced by a
recent article in the " Popular Science Review," for 1867, to
revisit the old scenes. That article (it must be confessed)
had somewhat astonished me. Certain views were there
brought forward respecting the ancient " sea-beach," &c.,
described by Sir Roderick Murchison and others, which
seemed to me decidedly heretical. These views appeared to
me, j&'om my recollection of former visits to the spot, so
groundless, that the doubt crossed my mind as to whether the
writer had ever visited the place at all ; or if he had, that
he certainly had done so without any great amount of care-
ful observation. To verify this I crossed over to Barnstaple,
taking the Fremington gravel beds on my way â€” and here
I may mention that these beds rest upon the upturned
