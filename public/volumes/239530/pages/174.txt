67
times have been put upon it. Phillips and Conybeare state it
to be 600 feet, Buckland and Conybeare estimate it at from
1,500 to 2,100 feet, and in the "Memoirs of the Geological
Survey" its thickness on the Avon near Bristol has been
estimated at 2,340 feet ; but as far as I am able to judge, its
thickness on the Mendips opposite Mells and Vobster cannot
be far short of 3,600 feet.
