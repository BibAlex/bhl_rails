SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS
OF THE
BATH lATTJRAL HISTORY AID ANTIQUAEIAlf
FIELD CLTJB
FOR THE YEAR 1867—68.
Mr President and Gentlemen,
The printing and publishing during the past year of the
first number of the Club's Proceedings is an event which calls
for special remark. The preliminary difficulties which usually
attend all efforts of this kind have been happily overcome,
and it is hoped that the Members have been generally
satisfied with the result. Were an additional proof needed of
the continued vitality and prosperity of the Club, the Secretary
calls attention to the fact that the limit of seventy-five Mem-
bers has already been reached, and new candidates are waiting
until vacancies occur for their admission.
Taking the events of the past year in the order of their
importance, it is proposed to divide them under the headings
of Evening Meetings, Excursions, and Weekly Walks.
EVENING MEETINGS.
On March 2:Jrd, Mr. Charles Moore concluded the Evening
Meetings of the last Session by some remarks on "The
Geology of Bath and its Neighbourhood." The severity of
the weather — the snow falling continuously, and the drifts
being deep — prevented a large attendance of Members.
