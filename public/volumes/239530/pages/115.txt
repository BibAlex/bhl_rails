to the memory of a man and his wife (but the names were unfor-
tunately illegible), and was as follows : —
" HIC JACENT CATERINA UXOR EJUS, * * * CUJUS
ANIMIS PEOPITIETUR DEUS."
The device was that of an angel, with expanded wings, holding
a book with the letters I.H.S. on it ; a double cross ran down the
centre of tlie slab Avhich was of a very hard and close textured
Oolite. Several others may be seen cut up and used for coping
stones and steps of the new house, which a builder has erected
on the site.
The name of a chapel of St. Anne in the Wood constantly
occurs — are there any traces of this chapel existing 1 Amongst
other beautiful and choice remains was a stone book, with four
lines on each page, a quotation, probably from the Vulgate, of
the 15th century; and a finely cut draped figure of our Saviour
riding on an ass ; and several other delicately sculptured portions
of finials, capitals, &c., of Norman, Early English, Decorated,
and Perpendicular periods.
Several of the slabs had been used twice over, the under side
when removed being seen to have an inscription on it. The
capital of an Early English column has been kindly presented ta
the Institution by Mr. Cox, of Keynsham, and is now in the
Portico.
Beneath a large blue Purbeck marble slab, on whose upper
surface was the indentation of a fine brass, the skull and
bones of an aged man were found four feet beneath the surface
in a walled grave, his lower jaw containing two molars much
worn, the bones were very brittle and discoloured with time.
Report states that some Bladudian bad appropriated the skull for
his tobacco box.
It is to be much regretted that some competent person does-
not watch these interesting remains which are from time to time
discovered, and which the requirements of a needy speciUative
builder are turning into practical use for building purposes.
