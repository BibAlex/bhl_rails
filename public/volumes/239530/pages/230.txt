diately after. The wind, which had previously been north-
east, shifted on the 12th to south-west, the temperature rose
and passed above the average, and there were very few days
afterwards when it again fell below it. Mr. Glaisher states
that " the average excess of temperature in the 80 days ending
31st March was rather more than 3^" daily : the excess for
the 91 days ending SOth June was 3".l, and for the 171 days
(from January 12th to June SOth) the average daily tempera-
ture was more than 3^" in excess."* This, of course, was as
observed at Greenwich, and does not necessarily apply to
Bath, where we have not yet sufficient data for ascertaining
what the true average temperature of each month is. It may
be desirable, nevertheless, to give the general character of the
weather here, compared with Greenwich, from February to
July, when the hot weather culminated, and which month
will call for more detailed remarks.
The months of February and March were both very mild ;
February more Hke spring than winter, having a mean tem-
perature at Greenwich of more than 4^" above the average, and
March one of more than 3" above it.
At Bath, the mean temperature of February was about the
same as at Greenwich, but that of March nearly one degree
higher. As already observed, there was a great deficiency
during both these months of the ordinary east winds, and
winds compounded of easterly ; south to west and west to
north winds being greatly in preponderance, and serving to
account for the unusually high temperature for the time of
year, whereby all vegetation advanced with great rapidity,
the buds of many trees and shrubs swelling, and some putting
out their leaves, at a very early date.
April was warm, and the temperature above the average,
but owing to the wind being more often northerly, not so
