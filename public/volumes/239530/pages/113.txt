the section of Middle Lias at the base ; and the coralline nature
of the top beds of the Oolite on Hampton Down, were all succes-
sively visited and described. The Members of the two Clubs
then dined together on their return to Bath, and spent the
evening in a discussion on the age of the "Sutton stone" beds
at Southerndown.
Under the last head of Tuesday walks, your Secretary con-
gratulates the Club on the energy with which they have been
maintained through the year, and the various good results which
have flowed from them. In the first place, the excavations going
on at the site of the old Abbey of Keynsham, alluded to in the
last summary of proceedings, have been as carefully w^atched as
the circumstances of the case admitted, and two incised slabs
rescued from destruction, and placed in the portico of the Literary
and Scientific Institution. One is of an early date in Norman
French, and bears the following inscription round its edges : —
ISABEL DE PENDELESFOED
GIST ICI DEU DEL ALMI EIT MERCI. AMEN.
PATER ET AVE.
Probably to the memory of some benefactress of the Abbey.
The second slab which is of later date, with a decorated cross in
the centre, bears the following : —
HIC JACET WALTERUS JOCE
CANONICUS NUPER CUSTOS CAPELLE [SANC]TE
ANNE IN THE WODE
CUJUS ANIMA PROPICIETUR ALTISSIMUS
AMEN.
Five other incised slabs composed of oolite, and one of Purbeck
marble, were found ; one of the oolite slabs was highly calcareous,
probably from Portland. Another was broken in several pieces,
and had the following elegiac couplet : —
