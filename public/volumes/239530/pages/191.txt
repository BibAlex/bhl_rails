These were small, and had contained burnt bones. A
large full-sized marble sarcophagus has lately been found
near London, at Clapton, which is the first marble one
discovered in England, it contains a medallion on the front,
which is fluted ; the medallion is not decipherable, except the
last word, which seems to be "MARITIMIVS." A marble
sarcophagus is mentioned by Bede as being found at Gran-
chester, near Cambridge, and used for the interment of a
Saxon Abbess.
In the grounds at Stourhead is a temple designed
after the plan of the Pantheon at Rome, in which is a fine
marble statue of Livia A ugusta ; she bears wheat ears in

and was brought from Italy. The remaining statues are
copies, viz., " Diana," " Flora," " Hercules," " Faunus,"
" Meleager," and " Isis."
The head woodman, a very intelligent man, showed the
Members an ancient spear-head found at Hanley Wood, near
Bruton, in 1867. Length, 8^ in. ; breadth, If in. Also a
Roman horse-shoe found at the Pen Pitts, and a natural
war hatchet, formed by the root of a beech tree, spreading
itself over a portion of Split Basaltic rock so as completely
to embed it, and thus became a formidable weapon. It was
found by him inside the bed of the river Tweed, near Kelso.
Sketches were taken of the spear-head and horse-shoe by
a Member of the Club.
Another day, Bowood and Laycock Abbey were visited.

Marchioness, a view of the interior and the pictures was not
permitted, the gardens and pleasure grounds, with the
American Arboretum, being alone on view. From Bowood
