peace that lasted a long time ; insomuch that a man might travel
with rings of gold and fear no evil greeting.
But Arthur was gone back to Scotland to the aid of his kinsman
Howel.
This legend has, with all its wild, romantic air, and poeti-
cally coloured beauty, two important marks which indicate
that we have history here. In the first place, the description
of Arthur's armour was given before this battle, which shows
that a traditional importance was attached to the battle of
Bath. For the narrative is taken from a book of three
volumes of British story, a large part being occupied by
Arthur, and there were plenty of opportunities of giving the
particulars of his armour ; but it was given before the battle
of Bath, which shows that considerable importance was
attached to that very engagement. In the next place is the
very striking way in which the geography of the locality
corresponds to the description given in the legend. The two
hills — Solsbury on one side and Hampton Down on the
other — with their several fortifications facing each other, and
the river Avon flowing between — agree in a remarkable man-
ner with the description there given.
One of the most important periods in the history of Bath
is the Norman period of John de Villula, who built the
cathedral and re-edified the town. Of all the buildings which
he raised in Bath, there seems to be nothing i7i situ ; with
the exception of the basement of two pillars or piers, which
are to be seen in the Orange Grove, at the east end of the
present Cathedral. 'J'hese pillars indicate, it is supposed, the
crossing point between the chancel and the nave of the
Norman edifice, which must, in that case, have run out into
the Orange Grove. This is Mr. Irvine's interpretation of these
remains, and it appeai-s a natural and correct hypothesis.
There have been discovered in the late demolition of the
White Hart a corbel and some other carved fragments of the
