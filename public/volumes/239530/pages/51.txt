ment of Museums intended for public exhibition, so as tliat they
may yield the greatest possible amount of useful information, as
well as entertainment, to the spectators.
And here I shall for the most part confine myself to remarks
on Museums in country towns, which must be always more or
less limited as to funds and space, — being dependent on a
comparatively small number of persons for support and encourage-
ment. I distinguish them from such large national institutions
as the British Museum, in which more extensive collections can
be got together, though in some measure the ends and objects of
both are the same. These ends are — first, to assist those who
are already more or less students of nature ; secondly, to invite
to the study of Natural History those who have any inclination
to take it up, or who only need such an occasion as the sight of
a well-ordered Museum affords to have their attention dra^^■n to
it ; thirdly, to diffuse useful information on that branch of science
to the public generally. Now in National Museums we expect
to find, and we ought to find, everything known to exist in the
several classes of the Animal,Vegetable, and Mineral Kingdoms, so
far, ^s , they can be acquired. There ought to be one such estab-
lishment at least in the country to which scientific naturalists can
resort for examination and comparison of specimens illustrating
any particular researches in which they are engaged. It may be
a question, in the case of such large Museums, how far it is
desirable to have everything in full view properly arranged on
suitable shelves, or whether it may not be preferable, — as well
for the saving of room, as in respect of such plan serving equally
■well for scientific purposes,- — simply to display the more striking
and remarkable sijecimens, such as maj' be considered typical of
all the larger groups of species, down to the genera or sub-genera,
reserving for drawers and close cabinets all those closely-allied
species, sub-species and varieties, which are separated from each
other by such nice shades of difference as onlj'- the most practised
eye can estimate, and which to the public generally' must appear
