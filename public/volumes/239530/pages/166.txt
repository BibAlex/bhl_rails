eastern end of the section of the upper part of the has
which IS wanting at Paulton; but M'hether the increase is
altogether due to this, or in part to the thickening of the
other parts of the has, I must leave to those who have paid
more attention to the subject to decide. With respect to the
new red sandstone and its conglomerate, there would also
appear to be considerable variation in thickness. At Chewton
the total thickness appears to be about 200 feet, all or nearly
all of this being conglomerate. At Paulton the thickness has
decreased to 138 feet, and the conglomerate is represented
by a thm bed of 6 feet ; but proceeding eastward to Dunkerton
we find the thickness has again increased, the total beinc. 291
feet, of which 63 feet is conglomerate. At Batheaston the" divi-
sion is only thinly represented, the total thickness being only
54 feet, and this is probably due to the same cause which led
to so thm a deposit of new red sandstone on the Mendips viz
the existence of the Batheaston limestones as a land' area
during a great part of the period. If we might judge of past
conditions from the conglomerate, we would undoubtedly be
led to the conclusion that Paulton and Camerton were com-
paratively deep under water during its deposition, and that
the increased thickness westward towards Chewton and
eastwards towards Combe Down, is due to the limestone
ranges of Chewton and Batheaston, which, if they did not
exist as land, must have been low reefs of rock.
In reflecting on the variety of strata bv which the Somerset-
shire coal-fiel.l is overlaid, we are inclined to look more
hopefully on other districts, where the existence of coal is at
present altogether unknown.
Had the Northern, Central, and Southern parts of the
basin (which form only a small portion of the whole) been as
completely covered up by secondary strata as are those of the
i^st and West, we might now have been labouring under the
delusion that no coal-field existed in the county, or that if it
