are characterised by variable winds, oscillating from south-
west either to south-east or to north-west, combined with a
humid atmosphere, that thunderstorms are most frequent.
In such states of weather, and with such winds, which always
bring a good deal of moisture, thunderstorms often have a
kind of periodicity, recurring regularly at about the same
hour for several days in succession. This hour will be gene-
rally coincident with the hottest time of the day, it being then
" that the quantity of moisture evaporated from the ground,
and taken up by the ascending current into the region of the
clouds, attains its maximum, while there is a corresponding
accumulation of electricity arising from its 'condensation."*
That thunderstorms are not necessarily connected with hot
weather, but that they are more directly due to changed
conditions of the atmosphere, caused either by a shift of the
wind, or by the ascending current (though from the latter
cause they never occur except in summer), is shown by their
not unfrequently taking place in early spring, and occasionally
even in mid-winter.
In Bath, last summer, during the three hot months of May,
June, and July, there were only three heavy thunderstorms,
one in each of those months. The first occurred on the 29th
of May, — the same day on which there was one at Green mch,
as stated above from Mr. Glaisher ; the second on the 19th
of June ; and the third on the 15th of July. In the first case,
the storm was coincident with the passing of the wind from
south, through south-west, to north-west ; in each of the two
last cases with the passing of the same from north-east to
south-east and south. In all three months, irrespective of
the direction of the mnd, the atmosphere was in a very dry
state, some days — in May more particularly — remarkably so,
as noticed by observers in several places. Both in May and
