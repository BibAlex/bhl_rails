farming and gardening. He appears to have lived about the
same time as Seneca and Celsus, and to have resided at
Kome, though by birth a Spaniard. He treats upon every
subject connected with rural economy, and is the first to
recognise the importance of science to agriculture. I could
wish that some of our modern agriculturists knew more
of what had been done, and thought, and said in ancient
times on agriculture. We, who now profit by the experience
of near 2,000 years, have no cause to boast, if we excel in
certain modern inventions. The Romans seem to have
derived their first knowledge of scientific agriculture from
the Carthaginians, having caused the writings of Mago, a
Carthaginian, to be translated into Latin, and abridged.
This treatise, even in the abridgement, filled six volumes,
and seems to have been the text book for Roman study.
It was saved at the sack of Carthage, and translated in Rome
at the public expense.
The Carthaginians laid down a maxim which we hear
reiterated continually at the present day, viz., that capital
must be a primary consideration in letting or taking a farm,
and your farm must not be larger than you have capital to
stock and cultivate, — " imbecilliorem agrum, quam agricolam
esse debex'e." Virgil also well describes the attention that
must be paid to soil and climate in the mode of cultivation: —
" Ventos et proprium coeli praedicere morem
Cura sit, ac patrios cultusque habitusque locorum,
Et quid quseque ferat regio, et quid quoeque recuset "
Also, " great importance was attached to the position of the
country house, as well as to its size, with reference to the
extent of the property — not too large, so as to involve useless
expense ; nor yet too small, so as to be deficient in room for
storing away the produce of the farm." It was to be built
also with an eye to elegance and comfort, as well as utility.
