characters, from taking a too limited view of structure in
general, — or they have given their whole attention to little
matters of detail which, though having a certain value, if too
closely followed out, prevent their rising to those more general
views of the relations of things which should ever be the aim of
the philosophical student of nature.
I have spoken of the bond of union among the sciences in
general, and among the natural sciences in particular. But not
forgetting that this Club interests itself Avith the subject of
Antiquities, as well as Natural History, it may be serviceable to
show that even Antiquities, — though belonging more properly to
the domain of history than science, — are not entirely disconnected
from the researches of the naturalist. In all at least that relates
to the antiquity of man, considered in himself, and in connexion
with the rude dwellings and the rude implements which he
provided for the supply of his necessary wants, sooner or later
after his first appearance on this earth — one of the great
questions of our day — the subject is closely mixed up with that
of the relative ages of the beds in which remains of such occur, —
and it is necessary to have the geologist at hand in some cases
to determine the true position of these beds in the geological
series. It was but the other day, as we are aware, that a
discovery was made in the immediate vicinity of this city, which
might have been lost to science, or its value much lessened from
want of accurate knowledge of the facts of the case, but for
an immediate inquiry into the circumstances by those whom we
are accustomed to look up to as the first authorities in geology
and antiquities in this place. I allude to the finding of a very
ancient kyst containing portions of a human skeletoi?, buried at
the depth of between four and five feet in the middle lias, above
which there Avas a deposit of peat of the thickness of eighteen
inches, and over that six feet of gravel. It is difiicult, perhaps,
to fix the date of the interment of these remains with any accuracy,
but the long period of years required for the slow accumulation
