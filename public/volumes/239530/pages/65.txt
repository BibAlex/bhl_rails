"Coprolitic origin, but that it had since been satisfactorily
" shewn that tliey were detrital materials from the bed just
"mentioned. The Crag nodules (he states) only differ from
" those of the London clay in having been slightly rolled and
" somewhat modified by having had a portion of iron pyrites
*' converted to oxide of iron." Professor Henslow then goes on to
say, that the " Cetotolites described by Professor Owen, numerous
" fragments of bones, and many highly mineralized fossils found
" in the Crag, must he classed as detrital materials from the
''London clay. The genuine Crag fossils are readily separable
" from those of the Eocene period by their not being mineralized,
" and such is the case with fish bones, crustacean and other
"remains, as well as the testacean shells so abundant and well-
" known in the Crag."*
As I have no knowledge from any observations of my own
respecting the true origin of these nodules, I have thought it
better to state Avhat I have just mentioned, in Professor
Henslow's own Avords. The formation of the nodules themselves,
to whatever bed they rightly belong, is due to the aggregation
of earthy particles round the organic remains with which they
are mixed up, at the time the bed was deposited, these animal
remains serving as a nucleus (like the sponges, &c., in flints) and
favouring the aggregation by the chemical changes attending
decomposition. The Cetotolites alluded to in Professor Henslow's
paper just quoted, have a degree of interest in connection with
this subject, from the circumstance of their having been discovered
by him at the time that he was examining the Eed Crag in
search of these nodules. They are the petro-tympanic bones
of whales* ears in a fossil state, as the name signifies, and
specimens having been sent up by him to Professor Owen, the
latter gentleman pronounced them to have belonged to no less
