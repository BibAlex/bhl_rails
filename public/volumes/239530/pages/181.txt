Mr. McMurtrie concluded the Evening Meeting with a
paper on the " Carboniferous Strata of Somersetshire," accom-
panied with the exhibition of an elaborate plan of the coal-
pits in the neighbourhood. The chief feature of this paper —
which together with Dr. Bird's list of shells will be pubhshed
in the forthcoming number of the Proceedings — was the pro-
bability of coal extending under Bath, though at a great depth,
and the possibility of its being found some day to the east-
ward of Batheaston. Mr. McMurtrie suggested also that the
gradually increasing depth of our coal-fields might be one of
the arrangements of Providence, whereby the waste of so
valuable a mineral was prevented ; and that science may
eventually overcome the difficulty at present experienced in
working the coal-beds at a great depth, as it had triumphed
already over so many other obstacles which formerly wei*e
considered insuperable.
EXCURSIONS.
The 2nd of May shone brightly upon the Members for
their First Excursion, and there was a large muster at the
Railway Station in the morning for Uffington and the " Seven
Barrows." It will be remembered that during the Excursion
in 1865 to the same neighboui'hood, Mr. Wasbrough, of
Wantage, — who on that occasion so kindly conducted the
Club to Uffington Camp, the White Horse, &c., — suggested
that a visit should be paid another year to the " Seven
Barrows ; " it was, therefore, owing to this gentleman's
courteously renewed invitation, that one of the Excursions
was fixed in that direction for this year. Breaks were in
readiness at the Uffington Station, and conveyed the party
across the Berkshire Downs by the most primitive British
trackways a distance of six miles to the farmhouse of Mr.
Dawson, the Duke of Newcastle's trainer. Here, most unex-
pectedly, our kind host Mr. Wasbrough had provided a very
