guidance of the local antiquary, Mr. Lee, of the Priory, who
has so accurately recorded all the discoveries there made in
his interesting book, entitled " Isca Silurum." The museum
at Caerleon is one of the most interesting and instructive
local museums in the Idngdom.
The Roman road from Caerleon to Caerwent is well ascer-
tained. It was noted by Horsley, and is followed in much of
its course by the line of the present turnpike, and passes
straight through the station of Caerwent, the walls of which
partly remain, and also some of the towers, with the ditches.
Caerwent has also been visited by the Club. From Caerwent it
followed the direction of the Chepstow road for a short dis-
tance (about a mile), and then turned off in the direction of
Caldecot, and made for Sudbrook Camp. This spot has also
been visited by the Club, and near this camp appears to have
been the Roman landing place. For particulars of Sudbrook
Camp and the ruined church near it, I must refer to the pro-
ceedings of the Monmouthshire and Caerleon Antiquarian
Society for a.d. 1 858.
I suppose the passage to have been from hence to Sea
Mills, on the Avon, according to the Iter, though there pro-
bably was a landing place also on the Severn at Aust, and it
may be at the New Passage as well. From Sea Mills to Bitton,
which is about nine miles, we have not much certainty of the
road till we come to near Bitton, where it has been traced,
and, as I am informed by the Rev. Mr. Ellacomb, Senior, is
known as the "Aggis Way," and from thence to Bath by
Northstoke and Weston. My arrangement of the Iter
would therefore be, from Caerleon to Bath, as follows : â€”
Caerleon (Isca) to Caerwent (Venta) ... M.P. IX.
Caerwent (Venta) to Sudbrook (ad Sabrinam) III.
Sudbrook (ad Sabrinam) to Sea Mills (Trajectus) IX.
Sea Mills (Trajectus) to Bitton (Abona) ... IX.
Bitton (Abona) to Bath (Aquae Solis) , . VI.
