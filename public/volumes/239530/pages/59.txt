specimens, all chosen so as best to illustrate the order of strata,
and arranged according to age ; from these it passes on to the
vegetable and animal kingdoms, every group being represented
in its turn as far as practicable, and a model or drawing, or a
tracing from some liublished figure, being introduced as a
substitute in those cases in which no si:)ecimens of the required
typical species could be i^rocured." This was the work of
Professor Henslow, a labour of love to which he devoted much of
his time and attention ; and his master mind has left us tlie
Ipswich Museum as — itself a type 3fuscurii — a specimen of what
other Museums should be, or should at least aim at. For the
further guidance of those who assist in the formation or manage-
ment of provincial Museums, he " drew up, at the request of
the Natural History Section of the British Association, a Report
*on Typical Series of objects in Natural History adapted to
Local Museums,' in which a list is given of such species and
objects as form the best selection for such a purpose, the same
having been supplied to him by different naturalists who had
made different departments of the subject their particular study."*
The instruction to be derived from a Museum will depend
much, in addition to the arrangement, upon the proper labelling
of the specimens. This is a point not sufficiently attended to.
We generally see specimens with nothing more on the labels
than the bare name, or the country from which they come ;
whereas a few additional facts respecting their affinities, structure,
or uses, or a short statement of anything remarkable in their
history, would add greatly to their value, as well as to the
amount of information obtained respecting them by visitors to
the Museum. The Kew Museum of economic botany is an
excellent example of such teaching, as applied to the various
vegetable products available in the arts, and to the manufactures

British Association for 1855.
