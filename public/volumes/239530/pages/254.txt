SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS
OF THB
BATH NATURAL HISTORY AUD iUTIQUARIAN
EIELD CLUB
FOR THE YEAR 1868-69.
Mr. President and Gentlemen,
At the close, Sir, of your address to the Members of the
Club at their last Anniversary Dinner, you urged them to give
a good account of themselves, as occupying a place amongst
the many thousands in Great Britain devoted to the pursuit
of Archseology and Natural History. Whether, Sir, your
hearers have profited by those words and by your own
unwearied labours and bright example in the cause of
science, will be seen in the Summary of the Year's Proceed-
ings, which the Secretary now lays before you.
Dividing the Proceedings, as usual, under their respective
heads of Evening Meetings, Excursions, and Walks, I would
here thank those gentlemen who have so kindly responded to
my request, and have, at the expense of much time and
trouble, given us the benefit of their researches in the various
subjects with which they are famihar. It is a matter for
congratulation that the papers prepared with so great pains
will find a permanent place in the Proceedings, and will
serve to lessen somewhat the discoiu-agement which neces-
sarily ensues fi-om the frequently too meagre attendance of
the Members at the Evening Meetings when those papers
were read.
