The true aquatic plants, or those growing entirely in the
water, dicoteledonous and monocotyledonous together amount to
about thirty species, the greater number being found either
in the canal or the river.
The Equisetacece and Filices number together about twenty-five
species. The latter, the true ferns, are not very numerous about
Bath, and include few rare species.
With respect to the comparative rarity or frequency of
occurrence of the plants in the Bath Flora, about 480 species
may be considered as either for the most part very common, or
if not equally plentiful everywhere, at least generally distribut-ed
throughout England, and not calling for particular notice except
in certain cases to be hereafter specified. About 230 species are
more or less uncommon ; or, if locally jilentiful in some parts of
this country, are far from general. It is, however, very difficult
to draw an exact line between these two divisions. In both
cases the naturalized and other plants not really native, already
spoken of, are excluded.
A list of some of the rarer species, including others -which,
though hot very uncommon, are likely to interest botanists
visiting the neighbourhood, will be found in an Appendix at the
end of this lecture.* I have not given the localities in which
they are to be severally met with (except in the case of plants
found at Wick, and for the most part peculiar to that station), as
they may be seen in the "Flora Bathoniensis," to which the
reader is referred. At the same time it may be useful to state,
for the guidance of strangers, the best localities around Bath for
plants generally. Such are Prior Park woods, Smallcombe woods,
Claverton and Brass Knocker woods. Friary wood, near Hinton
Abbey; woods near Limpley Stoke, Warleigh woods, St.
Catharine's Valley and the woods bordering on Charmy Down,
* At the time of delivering the Lecture many of the most striking of
these species were exhibited, and commented on.
