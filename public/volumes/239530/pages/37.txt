not, they show mutual affinities often of the closest kind. It is
quite impossible to string them altogether in one straight line
reaching from the lowest to the highest as was formerly supposed :
they rather fonn a complicated network, radiating and branching
out in all directions, each species showing relationships more or
less striking to a multitude of others. They are all subject to
the same general laws of organisation ; and there are certain first
principles of life and structure, as well as of classification, which
apply to all alike, and which must be understood by him who
desires to investigate their natural history with any hope of
success.
A general knowledge of science in all its branches is advan-
tageous to the student in another way. It is calculated to remove
that narrow-mindedness which sometimes attaches to those who
confine themselves to one department of it exclusively. The
physicist has occasional!}' looked down upon the naturalist as
devoting his attention to objects of inferior consideration to those
which he himself studies. Even among naturalists, those who
have chosen for themselves the study of the higher animals have
sometimes underrated the labours of the conchologist and entomo-
logist, and yet more the researches of others, who, perhaps, give
all their time and attention to the investigation of the minute
infusoria, or of those most repulsive of all animated forms â€” the
entozoa.
It may be true that, at the present day, feelings such as these
are not entertained so much as formerly, and that men of
whatever rank who devote themselves to science at all, are
considered but as fellow-workers in a common field. But still
there is a narrow-mindedness, which, without reference to others,
may hinder us in our own studies, when too confined, in respect
of the method in which we conduct them and the judgments Ave
form. Xaturalists, especially, who are only acquainted with one
particular class of animals, have been frequently led to entertain
erroneous estimates of the importance of certain organs and
