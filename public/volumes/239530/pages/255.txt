EVENING MEETINGS.
On Febiniary ]2th, our Vice-President, the Rev. Pre-
bendary Scarth, gave us an account of the results of his
recent explorations in company with Sir John Lubbock,
Professor Tyndall, and Mr. Connington, in the neighbour-
hood of Silbury, whereby it has been clearly ascertained
that the Roman road had been deflected some thirty yards
to the south of the Mound. This account was prefaced
with some remarks respecting the general course of Roman
roads through Britain, and the accuracy with which the
" Itineraries " or road books described the various stations

regions beyond even the Pillars of Hercules to the Rhine
and the Danube. The course of the Via Julia from St
David's, in Pembrokeshire, crossing the Severn Passage to
Sea Mills and passing by Bath to Calleva or Silchester, was
also described.

Rev. H. H. Winwood for this evening's discussion were of a

of " Odds and Ends of Olden Time " — restricted his remarks
to the remains of the ancient races who inhabited tliis
country, as seen in the megalithic circles, the chambered
tumuli, or the long and round-headed skuUs which have
lately attracted so much attention ; the latter — giving the
results of " A Summer's Ramble amongst Flint Flakes " —
described the weapons and implements used by these long
or short-headed people. Dr. Bird having, by the aid of
photographs and drawings, pointed out the difference in the
shape of the various skulls, stated that in his opinion the
form of the barrows in which they were found corresponded
to the shape of the skulls ; e. g., as a general rule, the long-
headed race in Wiltshire was interred in the long barrows,
