locations in the neighbouring strata. The period at which it
occurred was approximately given as between the deposit of
the Coal Measures and that of the succeeding New Eed
Sandstone and other rocks which show no signs of such dis-
turbance. The great diminution in thickness of the Secondary
Deposits to the north of the Mendip range, compared with
the same Deposits to the south, may be accounted for by the
Mendips having formed a Carboniferous Island in the midst
of the ancient seas, thus making a barrier to the irruption of
the secondary seas, so that the formation of a deep sea deposit
withm this barrier to the north was prevented. Various sec-
tions in ascending order from the Keuper to the Lias were
described, and the wonderful dykes -and fissures runnin<.
generally east and west in the Carboniferous Limestone in the
Hotwell and Vallis quarries were dwelt upon. The peculiar
features of these dykes having puzzled even the savans of the
British Association during their visit in 1864, allowance may
be justly made for the surprise with which the Members
present this evening heard that the painstaking researches of
the speaker had revealed to him at the bottom of one of these
Limestone fissures (270 feet below the surface) not only
a Liassic sea fauna of 95 species, but also three genera* of
terrestrial shells of the same age. The conclusion naturally
arrived at from this extraordinary discovery was that the
portion of the Mendips in which this fissure existed was a
land area during the Liassic period. In conclusion, Mr.
Moore paid a fitting compliment to the President of the Club
a feUow-labourer in the field of science, by asking permission
to name after him a new species of gasteropod (Fusus
Jenynsii) which he had found in the Southerndown and
Brocastle beds, a short description of which was given in the
course of the evening, and specimens in illustration of the
remarks were exhibited.
