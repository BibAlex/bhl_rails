Tower and Stourhead. They went by rail to With am,
where the Church with its Norman walls and windows,
which have been restored within the last ten or fifteen
years, was examined. This was the site of the ancient
Priory, over which Hugh Grost^te (afterwards Bishop of
Lincoln) presided. No remains of the ancient Priory now
exist.
From Witham the Members walked direct for Alfred's
Tower, through lanes and field paths. The day was particu-
larly fine. Alfred's Tower forms the boundary of the grounds
at Stourhead, and is a triangular building erected by Sir R.
C. Hoare the antiquary. An inscription upon the front face
states that it was at that point Alfred the Great raised his
standard, A.D. 876, against the Danes, and became the
founder of English liberty. It is stated also that to him we
owe the English Trial by Jury, and that he organised the
militia, and also the naval service. Walking from Alfred's
Tower the Members passed an ancient mediteval cross, set
up at one of the sources of the river Stour, and said to have
been brought fi-om Bristol. There is another cross also stand-
ing in the grounds at Stourhead, not far from the Church,
which was brought from Bristol, and stood there in the
College Green. This latter contains figures of Edward IV.,
John, and other sovereigns, and a tier of more recent sove-
reigns of England â€” as Elizabeth, James I, and others.
The house contains some good paintings, especially that of
the raising of the widow's son by Elijah. There is also one
of Gainsborough's paintings worthy of remark. Ample time
was given to examine the very interesting library of Sir R. C.
Hoare, which has been carefully catalogued, and the catalogue
printed and placed in different libraries. The Literary and
Scientific Institution possesses a copy. This is not generally
the case with private libraries in England, and Professor
Hubner observes in his report of the ^Museums of England,
