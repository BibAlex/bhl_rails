which so brilliantly adorns our lawns in the early spring, was seen
by one of our countrymen in America sedulously cherished in a
pot, and greatly admired by its cultivator, who had never seen
it growing in its native soil. Indeed many of our common plants
would well deserve a place in our gardens were they not so
common, and we so accustomed from their very frequency to
pass them over.
But to keep to our own country. No doubt there are some
weeds, such as Shepherd's Purse, Groundsel, Chickweed,
Dandelion, certain Thistles, a few Grasses, &c., which are
universally distributed and everywhere plentiful thi-oughout
Great Britain. But this is not the case with all. And it is an
interesting question for the botanist to consider, as bearing upon
the important subject of the geographical distribution of our
native plants, why certain species which are so abundant in
most parts of the kingdom as to be accounted troublesome
weeds, should yet be totally deficient in some particular districts.
It is equally interesting to notice, as we journey on in our
botanical rambles, where these same weeds become scarce, and
where they finally disappear ; whilst, it may be, new weeds
which we had not seen before, spring up in their places, taking
the same possession of the soil as the old ones.
Now these inquiries can never get their right answer, unless,
when studying the Flora of any country, we give the same
attention to the commonest plants that we naturally give to the
rare ones. If we look into the "Flora Bathoniensis " we shall
find a few instances in which, clearly, there have been oversights
of the kind I am alluding to ; that is to say it has been
overlooked that certain weeds, common — some extremely
common — in most parts of England, seem to be almost or
entirely wanting at Bath. The circumstance is worth pointing
out, though it detracts little or nothing either from the general
usefulness of this book to Bath botanists, or from the reputation
of its author, who for so many years has ceased to reside in the
