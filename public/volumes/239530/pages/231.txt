48
much above the average as that of May, which Mr. Glaisher
states to have been exceeded in only two instances, the years
1848 and 1833, going as far back as 1771. " The mean
temperature of April at Greenwich was 48". 1, being 2". 2 higher
than the average of 97 years ; that of May, 57''.3, being 4".8
higher than the same average."
At Bath, the mean temperature of April was 47''.7, being
0''.4 lower than at Greenwich ; — the mean temperature of May
was t)6°.2, being also lower than that of Greenwich by rather
more than a degree. It is also observable that in no instance
at Bath * did the maximum temperature during May reach to
80", while at Greenwich it rose to above 80" on two, if not
more occasions. On the 19th of May, when in the Institution
Gardens the thermometer was never higher than 79", it rose to
87". 6 at Camden Town, 87" at Greenwich, Staplehurst, Boston,
and Gainsborough, 86" at Manchester, 85" at Selborne and
Bury St. Edmunds, and at some height between that and 80"
at various other places in England. At Wigston, in Leicester-
shire, it is recorded to have been even as high as 91".f
In Jime, the temperature continued advancing beyond the
average. The mean temperature of that month at Greenwich
was 62".0, being 3".9 higher than the average of 97 years. At
Bath, it was 61".5, half a degree less than Greenwich. A more
marked difference was observable between Bath and Green-
wich, as well as between Bath and several other places,
in respect of the maximum temperature attained on
particular days. At Bath, the maximum never got above
80".8, the mean maximum for the month, or the mean of the
highest, being 7l".5. At Greenwich the highest temperature
* Here and in other places, when speaking of the temperature of Bath, unless
otherwise mentioned, I speak in reference to the observations made in the
Institution Gardens.
