either in the roof or in the sides, as no traces of chimneys
have been found in the Roman houses ; but instructions are
given that the smoke should be carried into the Woodhouse,
for the purpose of drying the fuel for use, and this could
only be done by means of flues. The cells of the farm slaves
were to look toward the south, and the Villicus, or bailiff,
was to have his dwelling near the gate leading to the house,
that he might thus overlook the labourers. The cells of the
ploughmen and shepherds were to be near their respective
cattle. The pars Fruduaria contained the granary for
corn, the wine-press, oil-press, and wine cellar. I cannot
but think that in the arrangement of the Grange of the
Monastery of the middle ages, and even in the Monastery
itself, you have preserved much of the arrangement of the
Roman Villa. The Monastery was the dwelling of a
community, and therefore larger ; but the disposition of the
buildings probably had for their model the ancient Roman Villa.
The Romans are well known to have been great gardeners.
It is interesting to have found the traces of an ornamental
garden in the Villa at Cold Harbour Farm. In the earliest
period of Roman history, observes Dr. Daubeney, every
family had its garden. In the Laws of the Twelve Tables,
the term Hortus is synonymous to heredium, or inheritance.
Pliny remarks that men of the highest rank were willing to
borrow their names from its contents, as in the Valerian
family, where the Laduarii did not think themselves dis-
graced by taking their names from the Lettuce. The variety
of plants cultivated appears to liave been small, compared
with our own system of gardening, although the kitchen
garden was so important. Fi'om Marshall, we know that
flower pots were common in the windows of the houses
(Epis. xi., 19), and the central court of the Villa contained
a small garden, as we see from paintings on the walls of the
houses at Pompeii, and find traces still existing in the courts.
