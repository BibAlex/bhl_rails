-oiiig on a struggle for the mastery, or even for life itself, and
the weaker necessarily succumb. Some species no sooner spring
up than they are smothered or devoured ; others just manage
to live, but in a half-starved state ; or they may thrive sufficiently
to retain possession of certain spots, but not be able to extend
themselves to any distance. These circumstances -will in part
account for some plants being so very common and generally
distributed, whilst others are local and rare. Or it may happen
in the case of certain plants that, though they cannot spread far
Avhere they were first located, the seeds may be transported by
winds, or water, or birds, or some other means, to more distant
parts, where they are under fewer disadvantages. We then have
the case of local plants, growing perhaps in several different
localities, but these localities more or less for removed from each
other. Sometimes, as we know, seeds carried in one of the above
ways, will lie dormant for years, springing up, whenever, from
•some change in the circumstances under which they are placed,
growth becomes possible. I will not here dwell upon the various
means employed by nature for the dissemination of the seeds of
plants — sorr^e depending upon the structure of the seed itself— as
they are familiar to many of us, and it would take us too far from
our subject. But I will just state one fact recorded by Darwin
in his " Origin of Species," in connexion with the dispersal of
aquatic plants, which have generally wide ranges, and the seeds
of which he thinks are occasionally transported long distances
through the mud of ponds, &c., adhering, sometimes in considerable
quantities, to the feet and beaks of aquatic birds. He says, " I
do not believe that botanists are aware how charged the mud of
ponds is with seeds : I have tried several little experiments, but
will here give only the most striking case. I took in February
three table-spoonfuls of mud from three different points, beneath
water, on the edge of a little pond ; this mud when dry weighed
only 6| ounces ; I kept it covered up in my study for six months,
pulling up and counting each plant as it grew ; the plants were
