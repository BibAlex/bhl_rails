of structure in general, — or they have given their whole
attention to little matters of detail which, though having a
certain value, if too closely followed out, prevent their
rising to those more general views of the relations of things
which should ever be the aim of the philosophical student of
nature.
I have spoken of the bond of union among the sciences in
general, and among the natural sciences in particular. But
not forgetting that this Club interests itself with the subject
of Antiquities, as well as Natural History, it may be service-
able to show that even Antiquities, — though belonging more
properly to the domain of history than science, — are not
entirely disconnected from the researches of the naturalist.
In all at least that relates to the antiquity of man, considered
in himself, and in connexion with the rude dwellings and the
rude implements which he provided for the supply of his
necessary wants, sooner or later after his first appearance on
this earth — one of the great questions of our day — the subject
is closely mixed up with that of the relative ages of the beds
in which remains of such occur, — and it is necessary to have
the geologist at hand in some cases to determine the true
position of these beds in the geological series. It was but the
other day, as we are aware, that a discovery was made in the
immediate vicinity of this city, which might have been lost to
science, or its value much lessened from want of accurate
knowledge of the facts of the case, but for an immediate
inquiry into the circumstances by those whom we are
accustomed to look up to as the first authorities in geology
and antiquities in this place. I allude to the finding of a very
ancient kyst containing portions of a human skeleton, buried
at the depth of between four and five feet in the middle lias,
above which there was a deposit of peat of the thickness of
eighteen inches, and over that six feet of gravel. It is
difficult, perhaps, to fix the date of the interment of these
remains with any accuracy, but the long period of years
required for the slow accumulation of the peat and gravel
above the lias, which must have been the top soil when the
burial took place, throw it back to a very remote age, and give
it an interest that leads us to hope it may shortly be made the
subject of a separate communication to the Club.
And having, now, said thus much respecting the particular
researches which this Club should endeavour to caiTv on, with
a view to collecting materials for a complete Natural History
of Bath and the surrounding country, — having also made
some remarks on the sciences in general, and the advantages
of association in our respective pursuits, — it is time that I
should pass on to the consideration of the practical working
