family (date, 1398), paled in interest before certain attractions
of a more modern date. The curious flat grave stones in the

During another walk to Compton Dando the Wansdyke was
traced near the Turnpike gate between Burnet and Marksbury
through a ploughed field, and into a pasture land, where it is as
well or better developed than at Englishcombe. The line of the
Dyke was followed to Compton Dando, where it disappears at
the brook or river Chew. The church being visited discovery

the centre of the stone, now broken in two pieces, is considered
by Mr. Scarth to read as follows : â€”

One of the last walks of the Club was through Kelston Park,
by the kind permission of Colonel Jones, to the Railway cutting
immediately beneath his woods, where a section of the cutting

below, succeeded by red and light green marls : the black shales
being the representatives of the Rhsetic beds.
With reference to the " Ladies' Day " not having been repeated
this year, your Secretary wishes to state that notice was posted
in the Vestibule of the Literary and Scientific Institution, fixing
on Tuesday, 24:th June, for an excursion to Stourhead. Only
one or two Members however having signified their intention
of joining, it was deemed advisable to postpone the repetition of
this pleasant little occurrence to some future occasion.
