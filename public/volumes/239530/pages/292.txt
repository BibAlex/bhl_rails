impossible to say. Tlie deepest sinking bearing upon the
subject is at Lower Vobster, where, at a depth of 300 yards,
the prevailing inclination appears to be to the north at an
angle of 30 degrees ; but there has been so much confusion in
the upper part of the pit that it would be hazardous to assert
that the bottom of the fold has been reached and the true
northern dip discovered.
When we consider the amount of disturbance to which the
coal measures of this part of the district must have been
subjected, we cannot be surprised at the amount of confusion
and distortion which prevails. In this respect, however, there
is a very striking difference in the upper and lower parts of
the lower division. The New Rock series, being chiefly com-
posed of strong sandstones, has undergone the folding over
without sustaining material injury. If we could penetrate
deep enough, we should probably find that at the axis of the
fold the strata have been rudely fractured ; but where we have
an opportunity of examining them, the veins of the series
maintain their continuity with great persistency, their dip
is tolerably regular, and altogether there is less evidence of
the extraordinary action to which they have been exposed
than might have been expected.
The fourth or Vobster series, on the contrary, has been
contorted and disturbed to an indescribable extent. Being
composed of exceedingly tender shales, when it was rolled
back from the Mendips it seems to have been shattered and
broken up into fragments.
Speaking generally, I would remark that the mountain
limestone itself, although at this point nearly vertical, has
not as a rule been folded back. The extreme amount of fold
is to be met with in the New Rock series, which has fallen
completely over, as already described. A much greater space
has consequently been thrown in between the New Rock
series and the limestone than is commonly taken up by the
