The next formation to which I would call your attention
(and that very briefly) is the
MILLSTONE GRIT.
In the northern end of the basin its thickness has been
estimated at 950 feet ; but 1 am disposed to think that in
the southern end of the coal-field it is much less. Mr.
Saunders appears to have mapped its outcrop very carefully
between Coleford and Nettlebridge, and taking the average of
that outcrop in connection with the average of inclination, I
arrive at the conclusion that it cannot exceed 500 feet. It
would appear to be wanting altogether at one point in the
neighbourhood of Ashwick, but that is exceptional ; and in
the absence of direct evidence, I have shown it in its legitimate
position in the section from Chewton to Combe Down takino-
the outcrop between Coleford and Nettlebridge as the safest
guide to its thickness.
We now come to the lowest member of the carboniferous
strata, viz.,
THE MOUNTAIN LIMESTONE,
With its accompanying shales. Much remains to be done in
working out the individual beds of this formation in the
southern part of the district, but I will at present only
attempt to define its total thickness. I have been rather at
a loss to account for the low estimates which at different
