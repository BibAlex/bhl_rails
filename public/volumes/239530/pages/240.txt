As would naturally occur during long-continued northerly
and easterly winds, the barometer was high for many months
in succession. Mr. Glaisher remarks that the " five months
(February to June) were distinguished by having an almost
constant atmospheric pressure afeove the average."* It was
so also in Bath, and even to the end of July ; this last month,
February, March, and June, all having a mean pressure of
more than 30 inches.
To the same cause — the long-continued prevalence
of northerly winds — may perhaps be attributed another
circumstance, which has been the subject of much remark,
the infrequency of thunderstorms during the past summer.
Mr. Glaisher observes, f — " It is very remarkable that not-
withstanding the continuance of high temperatures, but one
thunderstorm occurred at Greenwich during the quarter end-
ing 30th of June, viz., on the 29th of May, . . . and
generally over the country there have been much less than
the usual number of thunderstorms." Mr. Lowe, too, of
Nottingham, in his letter to the Times, referred to above,^
states that " there has been much less thunder and lightning
than is usually the case during a continuance of hot weather."
This, it appears to me, may be explained by the conditions
of the atmosphere, however high the temperature, remaining
unchanged, so long as the wind keeps steady in the north
or north-east, or with only slight oscillations one way or the
other. Whenever the wind quits its northerly position for
the south-west, and especially in its passage through south-
east and south, an intermixture of dry and humid currents,
of different temperatures, and probably of different electric
conditions, takes place, and a thunderstorm then becomes
very probable. It is in summers which, besides being hot,
