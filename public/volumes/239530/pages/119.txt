Thermal Springs at Bath and elsewhere. By R. E. Crickitt.
(Read January ith, 1S67.^
The subject that I wish to bring before your notice — namely,
the various hot springs that are scattered over the globe, is one
which, in spite of the labours of Von Buch, Bischof, Henry,
Daubeny, Kallmann, and others, has not, I think, been sufficiently
considered, nor investigated ■with the patience that shoidd lead to
its own reward in the acquisition of a knowledge of the interior
changes which are now going on beneath the surface of the earth.
I believe that these springs, if properly questioned seriatim, will
give us an answer to many of the geological problems which have
been a puzzle, and the cause of the oscillation in men's miuds.
alternately making a Neptunian or Plutonian theory, to have the
pre-eminence for the time being.
I would suggest that an effect, such as the natural heating and
mineralization of a spring of water, should be considered, if
chemically questioned, to contain its own ans-v^er, to lead to its
own cause.
The theoretic generalization I would oppose is this.
According to the Astronomical theory, our world has probably
in its origin been struck off from the sun, or been condensed from
a nebulous state, that at any rate it has existed in time past, as a
molten mass, that it has gradually cooled down to a state of
solidity on the surface ; but that the interior is still in a state of
fusion, and that the solid exterior forms a mere crust over the
still molten interior. This theory has been supported, and con-
sidered proved by the oblate form of the earth's sphere, and for
some other reasons, which I shall hereafter more particularly
exaipine. Accordingly, this theory has been assumed to have
passed into the region of facts, and has been taken as an efficient
cause to explain the heating of springs of water, for you have
only to assume their source at a sufficient depth, to arrive at any
given degree of heat.
