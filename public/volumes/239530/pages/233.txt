Darlington Place, the maximum was 91°. At Greenwich,
however, there were foiu' days in July on which the tempe-
rature rose to 90° or upwards, and on that particular day (the
22nd) it rose to 96°.5, making a difference of six degrees.
That same day (the 22nd) it rose at Nottingham to 97°.3, and
at Wigston, in Leicestershire, to the extraordinary height of
98". Altogether there were, so far as I have been able to
ascertain, at least twenty places in England where the ther-
mometer rose on that day (probably the hottest of which we
have any record in this country) to a height varying from 90"
to 98°, the maxima at all the places, except one, being higher,
and most of them very much higher, than the maximum at
Bath.
From all this I adhere to the conclusion I came to in a
communication I made to the British Association, when it
met at Bath in 1864, on the Temperature and Rainfall of the
Bath District. I stated in that paper my belief that, though
there is no great difference between Bath and other places in
England, lying eastwards in about the same latitude, in
respect of temperature, in moderate seasons or during mode-
rate weather, there is a marked difference when the weather
becomes of an extreme character, the difference being greater
in proportion to the excess of heat, if summer, or the excess
of cold, if winter, and amounting on an average to 5" in favour
of Bath.*
The above results are all derived from the observations
made in the Institution Gardens. It has been sometimes
said that the locality is not a fair one, being low down by the
river, partially shut in by the Institution and other buildings
so as not to admit a free circulation of air, and tending unduly
to raise and depress the thermometer in times of extreme heat
and cold respectively. It is certainly not the best situation in
