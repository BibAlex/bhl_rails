companion of his sketcliing rambles. Corsham and Castle
Combe ; the Almshouse in the former village, built by the
Hungerfords, contains many things worthy of remark. In the
chapel (with its music gallery attached) is a black letter Bible,
date 1617, and a copy of the original foundation deed, with
many quaint rules and regulations for the six aged women who
