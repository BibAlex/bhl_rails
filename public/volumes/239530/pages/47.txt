It may be well to preface this subject -v^-itli a few remarks
respecting the beginning of Museums, at least in this country, so
far as history has handed it down to us, — the feelings and
motives which seem to have originally led to collecting objects
of Natural History, — and the changes which have gradually come
over Museums, due to the progress made in the Natural Sciences
in modern times. This of itself will assist in forming our ideas
respecting the best plan for a Museum, and the rules that should
guide us in the selection of objects to be exhibited in it.
I need hardly remind my hearers that the word Museum,

signify respositories of art, or any institutions, whether public or
private, in which were to be found collections of statuary,
paintings, antiquities, or other objects, serving to illustrate
different branches of knowledge and research. And it was
probably so used before any special collections of Natural
History had been yet fornied, or any taste for collecting in this
department of science had yet shown itself. Now, however, as
we are aware, the word is more commonly understood in reference
to assemblages of natural objects, though still occasionally
applied to collections in the fine arts, &c., as formerly. Indeed
nature and art have often been united to give interest and value
to some of our public institutions, as in the case of the British
Museum.*
