ADDRESS.
Gentlemen,
Having been requested to furnish some paper for to-day's
meeting of the Bath Natural History and Antiquarian Field
Club (the first occasion of its meeting for the reading of
papers) I thought I could not do better, as the Founder of
the Club, than addi'ess you on the objects and advantages
of such Institutions, at the same time suggesting any points
for your consideration which it seems to me may add to the
success of our own body, and lead to fruit of real value in
a scientific point of view.
Field clubs are now so numerous, there being one in
almost every county, — in some counties even more than
one, — and they are so well known to that part of the
public who take any interest in such gatherings, that it is
quite unnecessary to particularize them individually. Ours
is one of the last that has sprung up. The oldest of them,
if I am not mistaken, and the one which has, perhaps, most
to show in the way of results, — having published several
volumes of Transactions, — and therefore, we may fairly assume,
one of the best regulated, and deserving to be taken as a guide
for others, is the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club, instituted in
1831, and which has been now three- and-thirty years in the
field. Many years back I had the gratification of attending
one of its field days, and I was much impressed with the
advantages to be derived from such gatherings by naturalists
and others who interest themselves in scientific pursuits, or
who value opportunities of intercourse with men of inquiring
minds meeting together, — to say nothing of the bodily health
and exercise got by the excursion itself. I felt satisfied that
the example thus set would soon be taken up in other places,
and similar clubs instituted elsewhere, and such has been the
event as already stated.
But though the Berwickshire Club is the oldest of our
modern Clubs, it is interesting to find that the idea of thus
enlisting men of the same taste for out-of-door natural
history purposes is of more ancient date. In the life of the
illustrious Swedish naturalist, Linnseus, there is an amusing
account of his getting together " a cai'avan of naturalists" —
students who had offered their services — to accompany him
on a tour through Dalecarlia in the year 1734, with a view to
explore its natural productions, and whom he marshalled
under " certain laws and regulations, for the due observance
