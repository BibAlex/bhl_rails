allusion to the name Cordius. The figure on the shoulder of
Venus in the coin found in Bath can scarcely be discerned,
owing to the coin being injured. It is happily now in the
possession of a member of our Club. This is undoubtedly the
earliest coin yet found in Bath, being older than that lately
dug up on the site of the New Pump Room Hotel, formerly
the Old White Hart. From hence the Roman road followed
the course of the present turnpike road to Batheaston and
Bathford, where it ascended the hill a little to the south of
the chm'ch, and having gained the summit, went in a direct
line, as marked in the ordnance survey, llr. Leman, in his
MS. notes to " Horsley's Essay" on the Itin. of Antonine, has
carefully described the whole course of this road to the
station of Verlucio, or High Field, near Sandy Lane, which

north-east of Sandy Lane lies Bowood Park, in which also
pavements and Roman coins have been found, and nearer to
Calne a Roman bath was discovered." (See " Reynold's
Itinerary," p. 364.) The mileage, XV, here corresponds to that

The next station was at Folly Farm, beyond Marlborough,

This has been ascertained. Roman remains are also found at
Mildenhall. The station at Folly Farm is clearly defined on
two sides, and has been rectangular. The farm buildings
at present stand on the east side of the station, and have
obhterated the rampart. The situation is very fme, over-
looking the Kennet and the town of Marlborough. The
