Probably, if the pieces of plaster found at the present Villa
had been more carefully examined, some such traces would
have appeared, although the fragments were so small that it
was difficult to infer much except the colouring and indi-
cations of patterns. It is not improbable that the Romans
introduced into Britain the style of building which we find
preserved in barns, out-houses, and cottages in Devonshire,
Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, and other counties.
If the walls of the Villas were thus constructed, it will fully
account for the mass of earth and burnt matter which has
been found to cover the floors, and which has tended to
preserve the pavements below, though in a broken condition.
In most instances where the pavements have been found
entire, they are indented and crushed by the fall of the
timbers, and are strewed with roofing tiles. Thus, the same
correspondent tells me, that " in Wilts he uncovered a con-
siderable extent of ground, but met with no hj^pocausts, and
the mosaic pavements were fairly entire ; " but in Yorkshire
the falling in of the roofs had destroyed the pavements,
which he " found in fragments at the feet of the pillars, and
amonsf the debris were found also two human skulls." Here
was an evidence of the house being burnt, the heavy roof
falling in after the rafters had given way, and the whole
remaining a smouldering mass, till it burnt itself out, and
then became the ground-work for further accumulations of
vegetable matter, until the whole was coated with green-
sward and brushwood. The quantities of burnt matter found
within the walls upon the floors of the rooms at Cold Harbour,
seem to have indicated a sudden destruction. With respect
to the formation of earth walls, or cob walls, as they are called
in Devonshire, I am fully aware that they appear to have been
derived from the East, and are found among many different
people ; not only are they common in India, but in Africa, as
well as in Europe. Mixing the earth with lime and pounding
