dary Wilkinson. Mr. James Furgusson had in an article in the
" Quarterly Review," July, 1860, onStonehenge and Avebury,
attempted to show that Silbury Hill, a part of the arrangement
of Avebury, was situated on the Roman road, and proved
that the whole belonged to a period subsequent to the depar-
ture of the Romans, and regarded the monument at Avebury
as intended to commemorate Arthur's twelfth and last battle
of Baden Hill, fought A.D.516or520. He regarded the arrange-
ment of the stones as marking out the line or place of the battle,
and Silbury Hill as marking the place where the leader fell.
This was disputed by Sir J. Lubbock and Professor Tyndall,
and the discussion turned upon the exact course of the
Roman road. Mr. Fergusson maintained that the hill was on
it. Sir J. Lubbock and Professor Tyndall agreed with Sir R-
C. Hoare, Mr. Long, and others that the road swerved to the
south, and did not pass under the hill. To settle this point
it was arranged that the Wilts Archaeological Society should
investigate it, by digging into the hill and by opening the
course of the Roman road at certain intervals. Through the
courtesy and kindness of Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Cunnington,
I was invited to take part in this investigation, which was
fixed for Tuesday, 22nd Oct. of last year, 1867. The weather
was fortunately most favourable, and having met Mr,
Wilkinson at Calne, I proceeded on the line to Abury, and
took up my abode with Mr. Cunnington, at the Wagon and
Horses Inn, Beckhampton. Having at the request of the
Archaeological Institute made a report to them upon what
was then done, I shall now lay it before this meeting, only
supplying firom Mr. Wilkinson's account any circumstance
that is better stated than in my own.
