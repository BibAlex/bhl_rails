because, although not so proved, any intervening strata which
exist must be of trifling thickness.
I have had some difficulty in arriving at the thickness of
the pennant in constructing the present section. Buckland
has estimated it at from 400 to 500 feet, and another writer
puts it at 600 feet ; but both seem to be far short of the
truth. Even in the Gloucestershire end of the basin its
thickness has been clearly ascertained to be not less than
1,840 feet, and every circumstance which has come to my
knowledge seems to go to prove that in the southern or
Somersetshire end of the field its thickness is much greater.
In the vicinity of Pensford 2,000 yards of its outcrop may
be seen, exhibiting an average inclination of J 8 degrees,
which is equal to a vertical depth of 1,880 feet ; and even
there the under part of it is covered by the overlying strata.
At Temple Cloud its outcrop may be traced fi-om Highbuiy
Hill to a point nearly a mile to the west, the dip varjang from
10 to 25 degrees, equal to a vertical depth of 1,700 feet ; but
here again we do not see the under part of it, as it is covered
by the new red sandstone. At Holcombe church its outcrop
is traceable for upwards of 1,000 yards, at an angle of 50
degrees, equal to a vertical thickness of 2,500 feet ; but
there also we only see part of it.
In deciding the depth for the purpose of this section, I
have chiefly been guided by another section, which I have had
occasion to construct across the parishes of Stratton and
Midsomer Norton ; which, by taking the lowest vein of the
upper division and its inclination in connection with the
upper vein of the under di-\dsion and its inclination, has led
me to the conclusion that the thickness cannot be less than
3,000 feet. This you must bear in mind is only an estimate,
and a margin of 500 feet must be allowed either way for
error ; but it is the nearest approach I have been enabled to
make to the truth.
