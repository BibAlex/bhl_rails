But leaving the subject of Antiquities, I pass on to other
matters of which I think the Club might take cognisance. I
conceive everything connected with topography (taking a hint-
from the caravan of Dalecarlian naturalists before spoken of) —
everything whicli throws light upon the manners of the people
and their mode of life, either now cr at any former period, —
provincial words — etymology of the names of places — local sayings-
— obsolete customs — superstitions and so forth, — all this might
be followed out as a legitimate object of inquiry, — in additipn ta
Avhat relates to the physical features of the district, its geology,
or its natural history. And there is yet another subject I would
recommend to the notice of any members of this Club, who are
inclined to take it up, — and that is the climate of Bath and its
meteorology. When we consider how much Bath is resorted to
by invalids — availing themselves, in the winter especially, of its
undoubtedly milder climate at that season — it is of much import-
ance that we should know on far better data than any we possess
at present, or which at least have been made public, what is the
exact difference between its mean temperature and that of other
places lying farther either to the E. or W. — not merely in winter,
but at each respective season of the year — taken in connection
with its mean rainfall and humidity, nor overlooking the position
of the city, situated as it in a bason surrounded nearly on all
sides by lofty hills, Avhich must have some effect upon the circu-
lation of the air and the state of the atmosphere, in a sanatory
point of view. It would take me too much awiiy from the imme-
diate purpose of this address to go into details on this subject : —
I will simply remark that very erroneous notions are entertained
respecting the climate of Bath, persons often imagining that
because it is milder than many other places in winter, it must
necessarily be very hot in summer, attributing its relaxing
character at that time to a higher temperature than it really
possesses — instead of to other causes, which, in my opinion,
exercise a more decided influence that way.
