This is the finest yet uncovei-ed in this neighbourhood.
Sometimes there were two or three of these courts, as at
Woodchester.

covered at Colerne is an example.
3. — A plain oblong, like that found at North Wraxall, and
which I am inclined to believe was the form of the Villa at
Cold Harbour.
Further excavations would probably have brought to light
the ambulatories, which would be in the south side of the
building, and probably near to the edge of the field where
the Villa stood.
5. — The position of this Villa must not be overlooked.
Roman Villas were generally placed not far from great
Eoman roads. The present one stood midway between two

and the other is full five miles from the Villa. Some \dcinal
road, which traversed the north skirts of Lansdown, probably

any distinct trace of one. It is not improbable that a
Roman road passed straight over Lansdown, diverging from
the Via Julia near the village of Weston, and making for
a Camp a little west of the Grand Stand on the Race Course,
and thence over the Down direct for this Villa, from whence
it continued on in the direction of the Aust passage.

the only traces of it are the inequalities of the ground fi-om
whence the materials have been taken, which is strewed
with pieces of brick and pottery, and the crumbling remains
of the concrete floors, which serve to enrich the land. The

vestige of the Villa. Already the earthen inclosure is
