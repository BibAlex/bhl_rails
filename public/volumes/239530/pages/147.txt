The fashion of cuttiag trees into the figures of auimals
appears to have been much in favour, and the cypress and
the box had to undergo tortures of this kind â€” as we some-
times see in cottage and farmhouse gardens at the present
day ; a fashion which is happily dying out, but which was very
prevalent at one time. Flowers and vegetables appear to
have been planted side by side in Roman gardens.
Plutarch sj)eaks of the practice of planting roses and
violets side by side with leeks and onions, which seems
to imply, as Dr. Daubeney observes, "that in his time
the ornamental part of the garden was not kept distinct from
the useful." We still see in the farmhouse gardens of this
county the same tendency to mingle flowers with pot-herbs
and kitchen plants. The pot-herbs which Columella directed
to be cultivated in his garden comprehended the greater part
of those in use at present, except the potatoe, and a few
others, which we owe to the discovery of America. It is
rather remarkable that the exploration of a new conti-
nent, and the continued demand for fresh luxuries and
conveniences, should have added so little to the articles
of human sustenance obtained from the vegetable king-
dom; so that while the Eastern world has furnished us
chiefly with tea and coffee, to the Western Hemisphere we
should be indebted for little more than the potatoe and
tobacco." ("Lectures on Roman Husbandry," p. 256). (See
Columella, Book 10; Virgil " Geor.," iv., 116.) Having now
briefly touched upon what may have been the accompaniments
of this Villa, we may draw our observations to a close by
expressing a hope that the labours of this Club in disintening
these ancient remains, may not have been altogether without
profit, and that some knowledge has been derived of the
nature and extent of Roman industry, and interest imparted
to a subject, which, if followed out, might also lead to not
unimportant results.
