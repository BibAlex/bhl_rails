first sight appear, but that they owe their origin to one and
the same great cause.
The contortion to which I refer stretches along the northern
flank of the Mendips, and has been traced from the hamlet
of Nettlebridge on the west to the village of Mells on the
east, but whether it may ultimately be found to extend still
farther to the eastward we can at present only surmise.
At Nettlebridge the strata have their natural inclination,
dipping from the Mendips at an angle of 35 degrees, but
becoming less highly inchned as they recede from the
influence of that anticlinal The section of strata at Old Eock
Collieries exhibited will explain better than mere verbal
description the state of affairs at this point, and it will be
seen that beyond the high angle of elevation there is nothing
unnatural in the position of the strata. But proceeding
eastward we find an amount of confusion and distortion which
hterally baffles description. It would be impossible to
construct a section which would give any tiling like a fair
representation of the disturbances which exist, and I have
abstained from attempting it ; but the series of small cross
sections exliibited, which are the work of an ingenious but
unfortunate local man, will throw some hght on the subject
It is only necessary I should warn you that while in each case
they correctly represent the prevaihng inchnations, and while
the appearance of regularity and continuity which they
exhibit in the New Eock series may be approximately correct,
they would give a very erroneous impression of the state of
things existing in the fourth or lowest series of the district.
You will observe that on leaving the Old Eock (or present
Nettlebridge) Colhery, where, as I have already said, the strata
occupy their natural position, we pass on to Old Nettlebridge,
where they are very nearly vertical. This has been accom-
plished without any break in the beds. The strata gradually
become steeper as we proceed eastward, imtil at the point
