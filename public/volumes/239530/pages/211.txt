The illustrated series serve to show the correspondence, in
many respects, between the implements found in tumuli,
caves and pits, and those in use at the present day, and also
the manner of attaching the stone or other implement to the
wooden handle. The resemblance between the objects from
the French caves and those still made and used by the
Esquimaux, is very striking.
Among many other objects of interest, one specially deserv-
ing notice is the cast of a portion of the tusk of a Mammoth,
found in the Eock Shelter of Madeleine, Dordogne, upon
which is traced in outline the animal (Mammoth) itself The
specimen from which this cast has been taken was discovered
in May, 1864, by M. Lartet, M. de Verneuil, and the late
Dr. Falconer.
The " Squire and Davis" collection, which was formed by
those gentlemen from excavations made in barrows and huge
mounds in the valley of the Mississippi, and which have been
recorded in the Transactions of the Smithsonian Institution of
Washington, U.S., was purchased by Wm. Blackmore, Esq.,
and is now lodged in tins Museum at Salisbury, an acquisition
of which any country may be proud.
