making the new line of railway on tlie eastern bank of the
Avon to the mouth of that river.
Sea Mills is 16 miles from Bath, but in the " Itinerary" of
Antonine the distance of Abona from Aquae Solis is VI. It
may be that an X has been omitted in transcribing, but then
no mention is made of Bitton.
The same Iter, makes the distance from Caerwent to
Abona IX miles, which, if Abona is Sea Mills, ought to be
XIX ; and we have again to add X, and suppose the numbers
corrupt in the original. In this Iter, "ad Sabrinam " is omitted
altogether, which Seyer would fix at Aust (ch. ii., p. 1 38) ; but
others fix it at the New Passage, as this would avoid the
embouchure of the Wye.
Abel Wantner, in his " Natural History of Gloucestershire,"
says : â€” " At Pollbury, where Trim goeth into Avon, much
coin has been found, conjectured to be the ancient station of
the Romans." The fields within the area are now called
Portburies. Roman coins have been found all around. (See
Seyer 's "Bristol," pp. 155, 156.)
The passage from Aust across the Severn is one mile wide
at high water, but it was probably in Roman times much
narrower. The tradition is that anciently voices could be
distinguished across the passage. Within three miles of
Aust, on the Gloucester side, is a station at Elburton, un-
doubtedly Roman. It is rectangular, containing two acres.
From Sea Mills a road can be traced to Trajectus, if
Trajectus is the Aust ferry. It is marked by the stony way
on the west side of the Trim, and continued on to Henbury.
(See Seyer, ch. ii.)
Mr. Reynolds, in his commentary on that part of the
" Itinerary" of Antoninus which relates to Britain, in treating
of the XIV Iter and the stations on it, proposes to fix
Trajectus at Bristol. (See "Iter. Britan.," p. 361 ; Cam-
bridge, 1799.) After considering the reasons given
