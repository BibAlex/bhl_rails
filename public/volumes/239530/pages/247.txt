placement of the ordinary weather we naturally look for as each
season returns — that the machinery of the heavens was all out
of gear, and no longer to be depended upon. I have known
the thermometer on Christmas Day higher than it had been
the midsummer day preceding. I remember one year in
which, for three consecutive days in June, the maximum
temperature did not exceed 52*, 54", and 55", respectively —
other years in which it got up, in December, as high as 60".
I have seen the thermometer again, in the middle of March,
as low as 7°, at another time near 70°. To take yet another
instance. The first half of October, 1 834, was characterised
by hot summer weather, with a temperature some days as
high as 75" ; during the same month in ] 836, at the
time of the Newmarket races, there was so heavy a fall
of snow that the course had to be swept before the horses
could run.
The spring months, however, perhaps present the greatest
irregularity. Thus, April is not unfrequently as cold as
March, and one particular year (1837) March was the coldest
month of all. Yet April is sometimes warmer than May, and
I remember one year (1833) when Maj' was as hot as, if not
hotter than, any other month. It is singular that one month
should thus stand between two others, characterised respec-
tively as being occasionally, however rarely, one the coldest
the other the hottest month (though probably never both in
the same year), that intermediate month, April, partaking
sometimes of the character of the one extreme, sometimes of
the other.
And, further, in April itself, what sudden and extraordinary
changes not unfrequently take place, even from one week to
another. On the 7th of April, 1859, the thermometer at
Swainswick rose to 78°, while in some parts of England,
according to the papers, it was as high as 80^ Only a week
previous it had been down to 26° — six degrees below the
