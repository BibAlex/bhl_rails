uncovered, wliicb liad contained within it a small garden,
probably a flower or ornamental garden. On the north side
of the larger hypocaust was found a solid block of masonry,
which seemed to have been the basement of an elevated part
of the building, as we find represented in the wall paintings
of Villas preserved at Pompeii. They seem to have had a
square turret, from which the whole of the farm buildings
could be overlooked. This arrangement is followed to the
present day in Italian Villas, and we find the same in
mediaeval buildings, as in the Abbot's House at Wenlock,
Salop, and the Deanery at Wells. Many tiles were dug up in
the course of excavating, some of which were flanged, and
one or more were found pierced with square apertures ; por-
tions also of wall-plaster were dug up with the pattern still
fresh upon it, and stone roofing tiles quite perfect, of the
usual elongated hexagonal shape, with the hole at one ex-
tremity, in which sometimes the iron nail was found which
fastened the shingle to the woodwork of the roof Many of
these roofing nails were found perfect, as well as remains of
iron clamps and fastenings for timbers, one very perfect, six
or eight inches long, with a head to it.
A portion of the leg of a marble statue of small size was
dug up, about three inches in length, which appears to have
been mended by a rivet. This marble statue was probably
one of the Lares or Penates, which presided over the welfare
of the family, and were supposed to take charge of the house.
The Penates were regarded as divinities, the Lares as guardian
spirits, whose altar was the domestic hearth in the atrium or
hall of the house, upon which each individual made offerings
of incense to them in his own home. (See " Plaut. AuL
Prol.," 2, and Rich's " Com. to the Latin Dictionary and
Greek Lexicon.") I am inclined to think that this fragment
of marble was a portion of the Lar. Similar fragments of
statuary were found in excavating the Eoraan Villa at Wood-
