From Bath the Via Julia passed out by the East Gate in
the direction of Walcot. An interesting discovery near the
Cleveland Bridge seems to mark the line of its course. In
digging the foundations of a house at one end of Cleveland
Place, and directly opposite the Eastern Dispensary, three
interments were found, one in a stone coffin, where the skele-
ton was perfect, and two small cists of stone, containing
burnt bones. These lay a few yards apart, but in a direct
line. The two cists were covered with one large stone. Tliis
covering had slipped oflf one cist, which was found to
contain only soil, the bones having perished, but the other
was full of calcined bones. In a line with these was found also
what appeared to be a stone hearth, surrounded by burned clay.
These interments were found within the space occupied by
the new house, built by Mr. Sweetland, and appear to
have bordered the ancient Roman road which passed
that way between the present street and the river.
Roman pottery of various kinds was found near these
interments, and some fragments of very nice Samian.
But the most interesting part of the discovery is a
coin of silver, small in size, having on the obverse the
heads of the Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux, with two stars
over them. On the side of them are the words RVFVS
IIIVIR, on the reverse is a female figure holding a balance,
with the word CONCORDIA under it. Unhappily, the
reverse has been injured by rubbing, and the figure and
lettering can with difficulty be traced. But the size and
description of coin coincides with one given in Cohen, as
a coin of Gordia, on which he makes the following remarks : â€”
" Manius Cordius Rufus was Monetary Triumvir of JuHus
Caesar, and this coin may be presumed to have been struck
about 50 years B.C." Cavedoni thinks that the Venus with
Cupid on her back has reference to Venus " Verticordia "
(who changes hearts), according to Ovid, and which also has
