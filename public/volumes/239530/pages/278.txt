PAPER
ON THE
PAULTS and COUTOUTIONS of the SOMEESETSHIEE
COAL EIELD,
ST
J. MCMURTRIE, RADSTOCK.
(Read February 2ith, 1869.)
At one of the Evening Meetings during last winter, I had the
pleasure of submitting to the Members of this Society a
general and typical section of the Somersetshire Coal Field.
It was my intention to have supplemented that paper by
another, treating of the geographical distribution of the
diflferent veins and sub-divisions of the formation ; but
circumstances having induced me to postpone this, I would
instead direct attention to another branch of the same subject,
viz., the faults and contortions through the agency of which
the coal field has assumed its present form. As the question
of faults generally has probably been often under considera-
tion, it is, I presume, unnecessary that it should now be
treated in an elementary way ; and I propose, therefore, to
describe only the distinctive characteristics of those of our
own neighbourhood, which it will be found opens out a
sufficiently wide field.
