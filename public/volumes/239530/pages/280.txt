stances connected with the upheaval of the Mendips anticlinal,
and none can have failed to be deeply impressed with the
extraordinary physical phenomena there brought under
notice ; but when we pass from that range of hills to the coal
field adjoining, we find a state of things still more remarkable.
We seek in vain for anything analagous to it or approaching
it in interest amongst the other coal fields of this country,
and to find its counterpart we must cross the channel to the
mining districts of Belgium and France.
The coal measures of this neighbourhood having been
divided by the Kingswood anticlinal into two separate basins,
I propose to-night to omit the more northern of these, with
which I have had few opportunities of becoming acquainted,
and to confine my remarks to the southern or Somerset basin,
respecting which I have had better means of obtaining infor-
mation. In a district which has been subjected to so many
alternations of upheaval and depression, in which faults
are so numerous that there is hardly an enclosure in the
length and breadth of the county which does not contain
several — in a district too in which so small a portion of the
whole area has been proved — any attempt to enumerate the
faults must be necessarily very incomplete ; but omitting
all under fifty feet, the following tabular list embraces most
of those at present known. It briefly describes in each
case the course of the fault, its size, and any other par-
ticulars connected mth it ; the more extraordinary faidts
and contortions being reserved for individual treatment
afterwards.
