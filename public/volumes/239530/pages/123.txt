sun's rays. According to the theory that the centre of the earth
is hot, and that you increase your warmth as you approach that
centre, this depth of 7 miles should reach a heat more than suffi-
cient to melt lead. No doubt from the mobility of water it would
convey away and lose this heat to a great extent ; but it is a bad
conductor of heat, and therefore it would only convey it away,
not allow it to radiate away, and consequently we ought to find
that the water was still being heated from below, whereas it
never seems to have been so heated — for if in a time past the
cause of the higher temperature was central heat, we find a
previous era existed when the waters were evidently icy cold,
instead of being always as they should have been cooling slower
than the earth.
But lastly, if it be granted that the heat increases in the pro-
portion to .descent, then, as I before mentioned, the interior of
the earth must be in a molten state, and the solid crust must be
a mere shell of not more than 100 miles thick or one eightieth of
the diameter of the earth. Now it is a well ascertained fact that
our globe in its diurnal revolution, spins upon an axis Avhich does
not always point to the same spot in the heavens, but like a top
slowly works its axis round in a circle. Now the caiise of this
motion which causes the precession of the equinoxes may be
shortly explained thus : — If a ring of satellites be supposed to
revolve in the plane of the equator round the earth, at the
summer solstice, when the north axis of the earth is inclined
towards the sun, this ring of satellites would, on the side nearest
to the sun, where its attraction was gi-eatest, be below the plane
of the earth's annual orbit, consequently the sun's attraction
would tend to alter this, and incline them upward as they came
on the side nearest to the sun, and if this ring of satellites be
supposed to be a rigid ring in contact with, and adhering to this
earth, it would tend to bend the axis of revolution upwards, or
at right angles to the path of annual revolution. Of course the
reverse motion would be produced at the winter solstice, this
