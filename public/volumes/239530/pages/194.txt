well to allude to this city, as, according to the Itineraries,
marking one point of its course.
Before giving an account of the recent examination of its
course by Silbury, and the clear evidences of it that there
exist, I ought to mention that one of the chief difficulties in
its line is the direction which it took between Bath, or rather
between Bitton, and the point where it must have crossed
the Severn. Its course can be traced satisfactorily to Bitton,
and probably beyond, and the distances up to this point
agree with those marked in the Antonine " Itinerary " (Iter
XIV), but at Bitton we are .in doubt about the name, as the
Iter appears to be corrupted in the reading Abone must
surely be on the Avon, as Bitton is. Trajectus must sm-ely
be the passage of the Severn, where a ferry is required over
the estuary, not the mere crossing by a bridge.
Sir R. C. Hoare traced the course of this road over
Durdham Down (near Clifton, where it is visible) to the great
station of Sea Mills, which he supposes to be Abona. At Sea
Mills there is a Roman station, and Roman remains have
been found. These are recorded in Seyer's " History of
Bristol," where a plan of the station is given (ch. ii.) ; and it
is very probable that the Romans had a port there, from
whence they could sail into Wales. Sea Mills being on the
Avon, might claim, as well as Bitton, the name Abona, but it
seems to have a better right than Bitton to that of Trajectus.
It probably was a point from whence the passage was often
made into Wales, although the road passed on from thence
to the shores of the Severn, near Aust. Sea Mills would cer-
tainly be a more sheltered station and a safer anchorage for
vessels than any creek near Aust. I wish to call the attention
of the Club to this point, and suggest to them that some
examination of this station should be made, as well as the line
of road from Sea Mills to the Severn. Between Clifton
Down and Sea Mills many Roman remains were found in
