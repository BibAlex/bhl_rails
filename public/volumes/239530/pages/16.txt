several classes of animals, as also between the several
families of plants, — and what is yet more between plants and
animals themselves, — it is enough to say that the species,
and even the higher assemblages of forms, often pass so in-
sensibly into each other, that it is hardly possible to determine
where one group ends and another begins ; and when we come
down to the lowest forms of all, we find the two kingdoms so
closely connected, that there are instances of the same forms
having been regarded, first as animals, and afterwards as
vegetables, or the contrary. There are some mammals allied
to reptiles in certain parts of their internal organization, others
taking much after the form of fish and allied to them in habits ;
— there are birds possessing some of the characters of mammals,
and departing considerably from the ordinary type of the
ornithic structure; — there is the Lepidosiren, so completely
intermediate between reptile and fish, as to have led to a con-
troversy among naturalists as to the class to which it really
belongs, and, joined with other considerations, to have induced
one of our first authorities. Professor Owen, to propose the
actual uniting of these two classes, on the ground of their
having so many characters in common. Lastly, there is that
most extraordinary fossil form, only recently discovered — the
Archceopteryx, from the Solenhofen beds of Pappenheim — at
first considered by Wagner as a feathered reptile, but now
thought by Professor Owen to be a bird, though exhibiting
characters which separate it from all birds known hitherto, it
having a long vertebrate tail, and apparently other characters
equally exceptional, but which are not at present capable of
being defined with accuracy, from the imperfect state of the
remains of the only specimen hitherto examined.
The above remarks are in reference to the vertebrate division
of animals; but they apply equally to the invertebrate, the
several classes of which seem in like manner to be all con-
nected by osculant forms, while there is a genus of fishes, —
the Amphioxus of Yarrel found on our own shores, — so low in its
organization, and with the vertebral column so imperfectly
developed, as to present more the appearance of a mollusk
than a fish, and actually to have been classed with the
mollusca by one naturalist (the celebrated Pallas) ; thus
shewing that even the two great divisions of Vertebrata and
Invertebratahave no such clearly-defined boundary between them
as might have been supposed.* We know yet further the bold
hypothesis of one of the most philosophical naturalists of our
day, — not entirely unsupported by facts, nay with a large
body of facts in its favour, though certainly not proved, nor
* The above remark applies to outward form alone, for there is no doubt
as to the Amphioxus, in internal structui'e, being a true Vertebrate.
