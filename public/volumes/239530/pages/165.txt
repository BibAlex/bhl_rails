of the surface made by myself, the position of the veins has
been ascertained by pits, borings, or by underground level-
lings ; and as the section embodies the results of every
exploration up to the present time, it is probably as near an
approximation to the truth as can be made until the district
has been more fully developed.
I purpose taking the strata in their descending order, and
I would call your attention first of all to the
OVERLYING FORMATIONS.
These, strictly speaking, form no part of the subject of this
paper, but it has been necessary for completeness to show
them in the section, and I will, in passing, briefly notice
them. The scale being too small to admit of more minute
sub -division, I have adopted as nearly as possible the
arrangement of Mr. Saunders's geological map.
Commencing at the eastern end of the section and pro-
ceeding westward, we find the leading di-vdsions of secondary
strata appearing at the surface in steadily descending order â€”
at the top the Bath oolite, then the fuller's earth rock and
fuller's earth, the inferior oolite, the lias, and lastly the new
red sandstone, with its associated conglomerate. With regard
to the upper four of these divisions there is nothing which,
in a paper of this kind, need call for special remark ; but in
working out the thickness of the liassic strata for the purpose
of this section, 1 was struck with the great increase in their
thickness in proceeding eastward.
While at Paulton the total thickness of liassic strata is
only 160 feet, at Dunkerton, where a boring was formerly
put down, their thickness was proved to be 198 feet ; and in
the trial pit sunk at Batheaston many years ago (for par-
ticulars of which I am indebted to Mr. Moore), their tliickness
is said to have been 277 feet. Mr. Moore informs me that
this increase in thickness is owing to the presence in the
