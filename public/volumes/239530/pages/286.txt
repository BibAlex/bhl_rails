ago in the neighbourhood of Pensford, and there is every
probability that an outlying basin of the series may exist
there, but as there is a decided tendency to deterioration in
proceeding northwards, it is a question whether at so great a
distance it may be of much practical value. We now pass
on to the
GREAT FAULT (OR 100 FATHOM FAULT).
This is the largest fault of the district, and it has been
proved from Timsbury to Bramhill Farm, not far from the
village of Kilmersdon, south of which it has not been
traced. It is a downthrow west, varying from 120 feet at
Timsbury to 384 feet at Kilmersdon, and reaching its fullest
development at Clandown, where it has been proved to be
720 feet.
Of many faults it is difficult to say whether they are
" downthrows" or " upthrows," whether the strata on one side
have dropped into some chasm far down in the earth's crust,
or whether they have been upheaved by some force from
beneath on the other ; but as to the Great Fault there is little
room for doubt. Taking the average inclination of the strata
and their levels on its eastern side in connection with the
levels of the strata and their inclination at a point half a mile
to the west of it, we are led to infer that they originally formed
one uniform gradient. The beds have evidently dropped
down on the west side of the fault, the veins rising at a high
angle for the first hundred yards as they recede from it,
and then resuming the usual inclination.
The fault is interesting, inasmuch as on the deep side of it
at Clandown we find the greatest development of the coal
measures to be met with in the district, a greater thickness
of strata above the upper series having been preserved fi-om
denudation than is to be met with at any other j^art of the
coaJ field. The only cause for regret is that in the additional
