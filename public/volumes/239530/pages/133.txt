of fine white lias, and polished so as to form a slightly conical
surface, with a rim or margin round it. The appearance is
that of the under stone of a fine quern, or hand grinding
mill ; but the material is finer, and the stone more polished
than any I have yet seen. The portions of this stone that
were found have been put together, and are now in the
Museum of the Bath Literary and Scientific Institution.
There are marks of this stone having been mended by means
of a rivet in former times, which indicates that it was an
implement of some importance and value. A variety of coins
were found, but all small bronze, and of* little value, except
one silver one, not rare or of any particular interest.
By the kindness of John Bettington, Esq., who has
paid some attention to the subject of Roman coinage,
I am enabled to give the following list of coins found in
excavating the Villa : —
The earliest coin found was one of Claudius Gothicus,
which could not be later than A.D. 270, the date of that
Emperor. The latest coin is of the date of Valentinian, which
could not be struck later than A.D. 455. The numismatic
record, therefore, extends over a period of 185 years, but as
coins have been found in this locality more than a century
ago, as we learn from Rudder's " History of Gloucestershire,"
we are not to take the results of the late excavations as a
perfect chronicle. The late diggings have yielded —
1 Claudius Gothicus
A.D. 270
Date of Emperor's death.
2 Victorinus
A.D. 267
Date of death.
4 Tetricus Senior
