19
portion of the Frieze of the Temple, now placed in the Vestibule
of the Bath Literary and Scientific Institution, has been discovered.
You will find with the sketches of the funereal interments the
drawing of a fragment of a memorial cross, found on the site of
the same building. Tliis, probably, had stood either in the old
Abbey Churchyard, or in that belonging to Stall's Church, which
once stood directly opposite the White Hart, but the only vestige
of it wliich now remains is a vault in the cellar below Mr. Arnold's
wine stores.
I have written to the Society of Antiquaries an account of two
memorial slabs (incised) which were found in taking down the
White Hart. They had each been turned to the purpose of a
chimney piece, and commemorated two ecclesiastics.
I remain.
Yours very truly,

And now having occupied so much time in tracing this
road, and in endeavouring to settle the stations on it, the
question arises â€” Why take all this trouble and occupy time in
minutely describing what is now no longer of use ? If present
utility were the only object, an investigation would be useful,
if carried only to the point of confirming the authority of a
written document of ancient date, and setthng history upon a
solid and stable basis. But there are still further uses, and
there are deep reflections to be drawn from investigating any-
thing that has been achieved in ancient times.
The Roman roads are, perhaps, the most wonderful and
most enduring record of the power of that great people. The
examination of them gives us probably a larger and clearer
conception of the range of their power and influence than any
other of their works which yet remain. We trace these lines
