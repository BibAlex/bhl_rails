hot summers that I remember to have occurred in back
years ; but I have notes of some, and I find one circumstance
worth mentioning that attended most of them, viz., that
of their having been preceded by a mild winter. Such
was the case with the hot summers of 1822, 1825, 1834,
J 835, 1846, and 1859. The winter preceding that of 1822
was, perhaps, the mildest on record, as the summer itself
was one of the most extraordinary, dry weather continuing
for some months, the harvest beginning in many parts of
England on 25th June, and corn being brought to market
on the 30th.* The summer of 1825 was very hot and
dry, the thermometer, according to Howard,*!* rising on the
18th July to 97°, and being above 90° for six days in succes-
sion : the previous winter was mild, though much less so
than in the last case. The two consecutive summers of 1834
and 1835 were both of them hot and dry, and were very much
of the same character, and of about the same mean tempera-
ture, having been both likewise preceded by a very mild
winter, though the spring in each case was cold and un-
genial. The summer of 1846 was extremely fine and hot
throughout, one of the hottest of which I have any record of
my own. It had a mean temperature in Cambridgeshire,
where I was at that time resident, of nearly 66°, more than
5° above the average, and nearly 2°. 5 hotter than the last
summer of 1868. This also was preceded, like last summer
(1 868), by a very mild winter, and a spring likewise unusually
mild and forward. The same was the case, as regards the
character of the winter, with the very hot summer of 1859.
The summer of 1842, which was particularly hot in the month
of August, was preceded by a winter of moderate character,
the early part mild ; spring seasonable, with a dry April and
