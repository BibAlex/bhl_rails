Lathyrus hirsnkis.—Bah. Supp. p. 75. Inserted by error in the
Flora Bathoniensis, as well as in many of the British
Floras, as regards the Pcnsford locality, the Ficia
hUhynica having apparently been mistaken for it. The
true Lathyrus hirsutus is not known to grow anywhere in
this country except in Essex.
I, latifolm.—A mistake. See Babb. Supp., p. 75.
Z. 2^aZws<ri5.— Bab., p. 14. Said to have been found by Dr.
Davies "in moist hedges about Smallcombe Wood."
Either a mistake or nov/ lost by drainage.
acuta w-osa.— Bab., p. 21. "A single plant only observed in the
Canal, by Dr. Heneage Gibbs. Has long smce
disappeared." T. B. Flower.
Senecio sylvatkus.—Bah., p. 21. Said in the Fl. Bathon., to be
"frequent on dry banks and pastures," but neither Mr.
Broome, nor Mr. Flower, nor myself ever met with it. It
grows at Hanham, but must be considered a very doubtful
native of the Bath district.
Cardtius temiiflorus.—B&b., p. 27. Said to have been found on
the "banks of the Canal" by Dr. Davies; but Mr.
Flower remarks that Dr. Davies, a few years since, could
<Tive him no information about this species, and he
considers it as " probably an error."
Geniiana campestris.—Bah. Supp., p. 83. Dr. R. C. Alexander,
on whose authority this species rests, informs Mr. Flower,
the plant in question should be referred to the G.
amarella. The G. caminstris must therefore be erased
from the Bath Flora.
Aspenigo procumbens.—B?kh., p. 33— " The locality for this rare
species rests on the authority of Mr. Hill, in Blackst. Sp.
Bot. p. 5. It is possible he meant Lycopsis arvensis, which
was occasionally mistaken for it by the older Botanists."
—T. B. Flower
