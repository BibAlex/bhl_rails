strata thus thrown in we have as yet failed to discover workable
veins of coal.
Hitherto we have been considering dislocations, which,
although of great extent, present nothing that is unusual or
abnormal. We will now take an example of another kind, viz.,
THE 8i FATHOM FAULT,
situated 275 yards to the north of Tyning Pit, Radstock,
which exhibits an extraordinary peculiarity, for which it is
extremely difficult to account.
It has commonly been regarded as a fixed principle in
practical geology that a fault may exist in the lower part of a
formation without the upper strata showing any trace of the
disturbance, but that the reverse of this cannot occur. It has
been considered certain that a dislocation met with in the upper
part of a formation must, as a matter of necessity, affect the
strata immediately beneath it, and that it must affect them to
the same extent and in precisely the same way. In the 8^
' fathom fault, however, we have a very extraordinaiy exception
to the rule, inasmuch as in the "great" or upper vein of the
first series it is an upthrow of 51 feet, while in the lowest
veins of the same series it has been proved to be a dowTithrow
of 21 feet. How this can have arisen it is difficult to say, but
of the fact itself there is no room for doubt.
It may have originated in the fault having occurred as a
downthrow of 72 feet shortly after the lower vein had been
formed, and the upper veins having in the meantime been
deposited without disturbance by the strata being upheaved
in the old line of fractm-e to the extent of 51 feet. Or it
might be accounted for were we to suppose some extraor-
dinary perpendicular pressure applied to the strata on the
south side of the fault while they were in a semi-plastic state,
causing the remarkable thinning of the stratification which
exists at that point. But it is impossible to imagine a cause
