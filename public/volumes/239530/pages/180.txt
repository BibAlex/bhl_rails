considered by the best English conchologists as a true native,
being found in many different localities where the chalk or
oolite prevailed, though not hitherto met with in the imme-
diate neighbourhood of Bath. The -ttw/a*, or lid, which gives
this species its name, was said not to be an opercle, properly
so called, having no organic connection with the animal, but
being merely a calcareous covering, secreted by the mantle
at the approach of winter, in order to close the aperture of
the shell against cold and wet, and cast off on the return of
spring : beneath this calcareous lid might be found two or
more other membranous coverings, easily separable, occupy-
ing lower and lower positions in the cavity of the mouth
as the animal retreated further into the interior. This snail,
like some other helices, retains its vitality for a long time if
kept shut up in a dry place, and may often be revived after
lying dormant for a whole year or more.
The Dreissena polymorpha, said to have been imported
with timber from the Baltic in 1824, but like the Helix
pomatia, probably indigenous, was mentioned as occur-
ring in great quantities in the locks of the canal at Bath,
where it had been seen on one occasion, when the water had
been drawn off for the purpose of repairs, so thickly coating
the sides of the lock as scarcely to leave any unoccupied
space.
The President, after making remarks on some species of
mollusca which, though outwardly very similar in the form of
the shell, differ much in the structure and habits of the ani-
mal — as also on other species, in which the shell itself varies
greatly, according to age and the peculiar conditions of the
locality in which it is found — cautioned geologists as to how
they established new species in their palaeontological re-
searches, in which they had nothing but the shell to guide
them, and the charactei-s of the same often ill-defined from
the ages elapsed since being tenanted by its inhabitant
