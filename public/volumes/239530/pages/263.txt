Westminster Abbey. Thomas Moore, the poet, lies buried
with other members of his family in a vault in the church-
yard, and Sloperton Cottage, where he lived for 40 years and
died, is only a short distance from the Church. A curious
old timber house exists in the village, the floors of which are
said to have been made out of the timbers of the ancient
church roof The Members having partaken of lunch, at the
kind invitation of the Vicar, the Rev. E. B. Edgell, were
conducted to Spy Pai-k, and saw the new house in course
of erection by Colonel Spicer ; the old house of which
Dingley gives a sketch is stiU standing. Exit from the
Park to the church built by Capt. Gladstone was made
through a very fine gateway, defaced by some modern
constructions added for strength ; thence over the brow
of the hill, which commands a noble view with Lacock
Abbey in the foreground, to Corsham, and by train to
Bath.
On September 9th the Members joined the Geological
Section of the Bristol Naturalists' Society in a Walk from
Tiimpley Stoke to examine the now overgrown section of
upper lias opposite Dundas. A single bed of upper lias
about one foot thick, with an intervening band of gray clay,
immediately underlies the sands of the inferior oolite, which
here thin out to some 20 feet merely. Some very good
specimens of the characteristic fossil, the Lingula Beanii,
were found in the marlstones below, portions of a crustacean,
together with the Ammonites Walcotii.
On the 23rd of the same month another pleasant Walk was
taken with the same Society from Bathford to the oolitic
quarries on Farley Down, and many good specimens
collected. A curious recent conglomerate containing flints
in a matrix of lime was pointed out by the Secretary, This
recent deposit was evidently caused by an infiltration of
carbonate of lime forming a cementing matrix for the flints.
