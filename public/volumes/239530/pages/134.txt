At Boxmoor, Herts, in excavating a Roman Villa, window
glass was found (see "Archaeol.," vol. xxxv., p. 63), also the
bottom of a vessel of brown glass, with a spiral of bluish white
running over it. It exhibits marks of the glass blower's rod.
The coins there found range from Nero to Arcadius.
Window glass is found at Uriconium (Wroxeter). This is to
be seen in the Museum at Shrewsbury, and to some fragments
the mortar is still adhering. (For account of glass manu-
factories, see Pliny, "Natural Histoi-y," Ixxxv., c. 66.) In an
" Account of the Roman Villa and Discoveries made on the
Borough Hill, the ancient Benna Venna, by Beriah Botfield,
Esq , F.R.S." ("Archteol," vol. xxxv., p. 383), various speci-
mens of window glass are mentioned, and fragments of a
beautiful specimen of fine glass belonging to a Thuribu-
lum. These articles were found near the Baths. The
objects found at this Villa were deposited in the British
Museum, and the drawings have been placed in the Library
of the Society of Antiquaries.
In Sir Robt. Atkins's "History of Gloucestershire," mention
is made'of the^discovery of a Roman Villa in the locality of
Tracy Park, and a fuller detail given by Rudder ("History
of Gloucestershire," p. 211). The latter describes certain
Roman antiquities found in a field called Beach, and
then goes on to give some account of the Cromlech, and
offers conjectures respecting it. The farmhouse, on the
other side of the deep hollow, a quarter of a mile to the
south-east of the field in which the Roman Villa now
described was situated, is noted on the Ordnance map as
Beach Farm, and the fields adjoining seem to have the name
of Beach, but the name of the farm where the Villa lately
uncovered once actually stood is called Cold Harbour
Farm. This is a name commonly given to places where
Roman remains are found. The spot described by Rudder,
and known by him under the name of Beach, is now Ciilled
