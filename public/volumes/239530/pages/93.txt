luxuriating in damp woods, rotten timber, rotten fruit, dead
leaves, and what not, have any real beauty or claims to your
regard ; let me briefly draw your attention to another large
group of cryptogamous plants, — the Mosses — which I trust you
will allow are free from anything to render them obnoxious in
your eyes. Ferns, which are the highest order of Cryptogams,
find, at the present day, admirers everywhere ; indeed they are
so much sought after by cultivators and collectors, that the mania
for them, we fear, is fast leading to the extinction of some of our
rarer native kinds. But the Mosses, though small, are quite as
graceful and beautiful as the Ferns, more generally to be met Avith,
and with the farther advantage — an advantage, however, shared
equally with them by the Fungi — of presenting themselves in the
greatest abundance and perfection at that season of the year,
when the botanist finds little else to do out of doors.
Lord Bacon says that "In the royal ordering of gardens,
there ought to be gardens for all the months of the year,
in which, severally, things of beauty may be then in season ; "■
and the selecting of such flowers and fruits as are suitable to each
month, he describes as the way to have " ver perpetuum." He
who steps out from his own to walk in nature's garden, will find
that she, too, has so for provided a "ver perpetuum" as to
exhibit a constant succession of forms throughout the year
to adorn and beautify her beds. There are few more
beautiful objects under the microscope than the leaves and
fructification of some of our native mosses, which grow on almost
every wall, and tree, and Sank, and which spring up in their
greatest freshness and luxuriance in the fall of the year, when
almost all other vegetation is passing into decay. If any of my
hearers can be induced to attend to these interesting little plants,
they may be of much service in helping us to a better knowledge
of the Mosses of this district, of which we have not a complete
list even of the commonest species. And the study of them is
