in most, if not in all, the Roman Villas uncovered in this
country, and leads to the supposition that the stonework
remains much at its original height, and that upon it was
erected a wooden framework ; and the remainder of the wall
was constructed of clay and straw -bands, as barns and cot-
tages are still constructed in counties where stone is scarce.
An antiquary (the Rev. W. C. Lukis) who has given some
attention to the construction of Roman Villas, having exca-
vated two in different counties, writes me word to the follow-
ing effect : — '■ I have been fortunate in discovering the
remains of Roman Villas in two parts of England where
they were not known to exist previously : one was at Great
Bedwyn, Wilts, and the other was in Yorkshire. In both
these cases I am sure that the only masonry of the houses
consisted of foundations, which originally were raised to the
height of one or two feet above the level of the soil." In the
account given of the excavation of a Roman Villa at Keston,
near Bromley, in Kent, by George R. Comer, Esq., F.S.A.
(" Archacol," vol. xxxvi., p. 120), a drawing is given of the
general plan of that Villa as it appeared when uncovered ;
here also, it is observable that the walls appear perfectly level
on the upper surface, and though the fact is not noticed,, yet
had the walls been jagged or broken, the artist would no
doubt have so represented them in his effective drawings.
The superstructure was of wood, and the interstices were
filled with straw and rubble.
" I observed in Yorkshire (says Mr. Lukis) what I did
not so distinctly trace in Wilts, that the wooden walls had
been internally covered with straw reeds, bound together at
intervals with straw-bands, in long lengths, nailed to the
wood frame, and the plaster was thickly laid on ; some
fragments which I have collected are from three to four
inches thick, and show the fresco colouring on' the face,
and the reed impressions on the back.'
