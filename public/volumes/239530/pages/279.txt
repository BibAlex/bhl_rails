GENERAL FEATURES OF THE COAL FIELD.
In order that the bearing of the present paper may be the
better understood, it may be well that I should at the outset
refer again to the section of last year, and that I should in a
word or two explain the general features of the district. The
carboniferous rocks of Somersetshire, you will observe, rest
upon the old red sandstone with which they are probably
approximately conformable. They are well represented in
this district ; the mountain limestone, the millstone grit, and
the true coal measures being all present. The latter, with
which we have principally to deal to-night, are composed of
two great divisions, separated by an immense thickness of
sandstone known as the pennant rock. The upper division
consists of the first, or Radstock, and the second, or Farring-
don series, these being divided by a thick intervening stratum
of red shale. The lower division contains the third, or New
Rock, and the fourth, or Vobster series ; the veins of the
former being contained in hard sandstones, while those of the
latter are usually associated with exceedingly tender shales.
Above the coal measures, and resting unconformably upon
them, are the secondary rocks ; but the disturbances which
we have now to describe were mostly formed before the
deposition of these strata, and rarely aflfeet them.
FAULTS AND CONTORTIONS.
Whatever may have been the conditions under which the
coal measures were originally deposited, there can be no
doubt that they have subsequently been exposed to an
amount of disturbance and dislocation so tremendous that
when we try to realise the state of things then existing, we
seem to pass into the region of romance rather than reality.
In a paper recently contributed to the Geological Society,
Mr. Moore has described in a striking manner the circum-
