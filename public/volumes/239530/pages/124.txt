would have a tendency to cause the axis of the earth to describe
two small circles in the year amongst the stars.
Now as the earth is an oblate spheroid, having its polar axis
26 miles shorter than its equatorial axis, or as it were a sphere of
8,000 miles diameter, with a belt of 1 3 miles thick at the equator,
sloping off to nothing North and South, the amount of such
motion caused by the impulse of a ring of 13 miles thick upon
the earth can be accurately calculated, it being proportional to
the relative weight of the belt and of the globe. The motion
calculated from the data of the average weight of the earth, and
its rigidity agrees with the observed amount of this motion.
But if the earth were a liquid mass with only a solid shell, the
effect would be that the shell would, as it were, slide over the
liquid interior, and would not retard the oscillation caused by the
band to the same extent ; in other words, if the interior of the
earth were liquid, its precession would no longer be the same
that it is observed to be. But it may be said that under the
great pressure of the superincumbent rock, the interior might be
heated to any extent without becoming fluid. Experiments have
been made to test this (by, I think, Fairbairn, the Engineer) ; but
so far from confirming this idea, he found that granite, slate, and
other rocks which can be only melted at an intense white heat,
without pressure ; became fluid at a red heat when inclosed in
iron tubes and subjected to as much pressure as he could obtain
with a screAv. Therefore I conclude the earth is not liquid in its
interior, with a solid shell, and therefore the heat does not regu-
larly increase as you descend into it.
If we observe the relations in which the thermal springs occiu',
we shall see at once that they seem to be divided into three
classes or varieties.
We find springs that are evidently connected with active
existing volcanoes, and these are generally sulphurous, very hot,
and contain plenty of silica.
We then have those that are closely connected with the basic
