from old gardens ; others have got about from having been
themselves formerly cultivated as crops. Garden species, some
now out of date, but others still kept up for their beauty, or
scent, or culinary uses, or supposed medical properties, that have
run wild are very numerous.
Again some species are known to have been planted in the
spots in which they are now met with. Such, I believe, has been
the case with the sweet-smelling flag (Acorns calamus) growing
freely on the banks of the Avon in two or three places.
Several trees and shrubs have in like manner been probably
planted by the hand of man originally, though they may have
since spread of themselves in some instances. Such are the
Lime, Maple, Box, and the Berberry, this last being often cultivated
for its fruit.
To such causes we may add the introduction of new plants by
ballast. A considerable number of foreign species have found
their way to our shores in this manner, and are now frequent in
places, especially about sea-port towns.
It has been thought, and not without reason, that the SeneUera
d'uhjma, which grows in some plenty under walls by the side of
the Avon, between Norfolk Crescent and the Gas Works, was
originally brought with ballast into the neighbourhood of Bath.
Occasionally accident brings plants to this country from much
further distances even than the Continent. As an instance in
point, we may mention the Elodea canadensis, imported from
Canada, nobody knows how, first observed in the north of
England and Scotland in 1847, but now so abundant as to prove
one of the greatest pests, choking up our rivers and canals to
such a degree as to impede navigation. During the summer
months our own canal at Bath is full of it in many places,
almost to the exclusion of other weeds.
Thus we see how many causes are at work, chiefly through the
agency of man, to swell the number of plants growing in a
particular district, as also to leave us in doubt what exact
