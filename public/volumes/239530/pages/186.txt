of veiy fine elongated diamond-sliapeJ amber plates, con-
sidered unique ; and a rare example of an ancient British
mould for casting bronze celts, made of syenite. A short ride
over the Normanton do\vn, in and out amongst the tumuli,
brought the party within sight of Stonehenge ; dwarfed, as it
appeared, in size by the vast expanse of downland which
stretches far away on either hand, some little time was
required to appreciate the grandeur of its dimensions. Theory
upon theory of its age, form, and the object of its erection
was propounded by various Members ; but perhaps the most
original was that brought forward by the so-called custodian,
a Mr. Brown, viz., that it was erected by the Antediluvians,
and that its partial overthrow was effected by the " flood "
which came from the south-west. The principal and most
important fact was that communicated by Mr. Stevens, who
accompanied the Members from Salisbury, viz , that the letters
" L. Y." enclosed in a kind of double sickle, which caused
such a learned discussion at the recent visit of the British
Association, as to their Koman or Phoenician character, are
now known to have been cut by a mason, and are of a
recent date.
After sufficient time had been allowed, the Members
separated, some \vit\\ their friends remaining for the sunrise
on the morrow, the rest returning to Wiley and Sahsbury,
A lunch had been provided both at the Blackmore Museum
and Lake House by the hospitality of Dr. Blackmore and Mr.
Duke, which mark of attention was duly appreciated. Those
who remained for the sunrise, slept at the George Inn at
Amesbmy, and the quiet Uttle village must have been some-
what distm-bed in its first sleep as four enthusiastic antiquaries
passed through it between two and three am., bent on the
important errand of ascertaining whether the sun did actually
rise over the " Friar's Heel " at the summer solstice. With
admirable patience, as the long looked for moment arrived.
