where known, not unfrequently made the subject of satire and
ridicule.
It was not till after more than a century from the time of
the commencement of the Koyal Society's labours that any
other society sprung up; and even in the year 1788, when the
late Sir J. E. Smith, on the occasion of the death of the
celebrated naturalist Linnseus, started the Linnean Society —
the Royal Society's first offspring* — -so narrow was the range
of science, as then conceived, and so limited the number
of its followers, that I have heard it said formerly, by those
who could remember the circumstance, that some remon-
strated at the step, thinking it would affect the interests
and success of the Royal Society, and be likely to lead
to still further separations, leaving it in the end little or
nothing to do.
Such other divisions and sub-divisions of the field of science
have, indeed, taken place, and corresponding institutions
sprung up, beyond anything that could have been looked for at
that time, without, however, in the slightest degree lessening
the work, or dimming the lustre, of the Royal Society, whose
world-wide reputation stands as high as ever. And all these
new societies have come into being since the beginning of
the present century, most of them within the recollection of
some among us. In 1804 arose the Horticultm-al Society ; in
1807, the Geological Society ; in 1826, the Zoological Society ;
these being followed in quick succession by the Entomological,
Botanical, Ornithological, Microscopical, Ethnological, Palaeon-
tographical, and Meteorological Societies, the latest being the
Anthropological Society, established only a very few years back.
• " In 1788 the Linnean Society was founded This event
merits more than a mere passing record, as presenting the first instance of a
sub-division of scientific labour in the metropolis, by the establishment of a
distinct association under Royal Charter." — Weld's Hist, of Boy. 5oc.,vol. ii.,
p. 198.
