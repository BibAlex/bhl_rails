helps to illustrate the history of the more remarkable animals,
those especially which are serviceable to man in any way, or on the
contrary destructive to himself, his crops, or some other of his
possessions. Many such cases arc to be seen in some of our
Museums relating however chiefly to the class of insects ; cases
for instance, exhibiting the silk-worm moth in its stages of growth
and transformation, along with other allied species likewise
yielding silk of different qualities ; cases of insects injurious to
corn or timber, showing every part of their history, side by side
w4th tliat of other insects appointed to keep them in check ;
insects forming the different kinds of galls, with specimens of the
galls annexed ; a seriea of the different species of moths that attack
woollens ; other cases got up in illustration of the habits of
peculiar species, their mode of building their nests, &c. These
cases, and others that might be suggested relating to the higher
animals as well, would fall under the head of " special purpose"
cases before alluded to. If, in addition to such cases, the student
could see a general systematic arrangement of the productions of
nature, not in all their details, but as represented by those type-
forms which serve best to characterise respectively the chief groups,
— so as to see the place which any particular species as above
illustrated occupies in the system, — he would have Nature's book
laid open before him in such a way as that he could hardly fail to
read a large portion of its contents.
Reference has been made above to the Ipswich Museum ; and
if we would see a Museum in which the ijrtnciples here advocated
are carried out, perhaps more admirably than in any other
existing similar institution, we should go there and inspect the
well-chosen series of natural objects to sene for the instruction
of beginners in Natural History, and the excellent arrangement
of the whole estabUshment. "Beginning witli the elements, so
far as these are capable of exhibition in a IMuseum, the collection
proceeds with the most important and cliaracteristic simple
minerals, models of crystals, rocks, fossils, and other geological
