wroiaght iron, and at 100 miles from the surface all will be fluid ;
" the rocks will be as water." Hence it would appear that our
Globe, of 8,000 miles in diameter, is only a liquid mass contained
within a thin shell of 100 miles in thickness. That is to say, a
globe of 10 feet in diameter would have a crust of only one-eighth
of an inch in thickness. Hence it has been said that the varying
pressure of the atmosphere may be sufficient by weighing un-
equally on this thin shell to cause an oscillation of the crust, and
so give rise to earthquakes ; and, in proof of this • hypothesis,' it
has been adduced, that an earthquake is always preceded by a
fall in the barometer. Calculations have been made, to show
that the alteration in the atmospheric pressure indicated by two
inches lise or fall in the barometer, represents a pressure sufficient
to account for this, viz., 8 tons on the square yard, or 25 million
tons on the square mile. But when we think, that an increase of
pressure as shown by a rise of three inches, amounts to an increase
of weight on the crust of the earth equal to only one two hundred
and ninety-five thousandth part of its own weight (supposing it
to be only 100 miles thick), this would seem inadequate to pro-
duce any effect, on even so frail a bridge as this.
This central heat theory is said to be a question particularly
interesting to Bathonians, as, according to tradition, we are to be
one day the victims of a want of balance in nature, and to sink
down into these subterranean fires. But I think we may re-assure
ourselves. In the first place, the increase of heat in proportion
to depth has been too hastily assumed, as a law, for it is clear
that local circumstances have a great effect in at least modifying
this increase ; at Wheal Clifford the increase of heat being 1° in
22 feet of descent, whereas at the mine of Dolbrouth 75 feet of
descent is requisite to give a similar increase, and in some mines
even 90 feet is requisite, while at the Lago di Monte Rotondo at
60 feet depth a temperature of 212° is reached. Theory would
say that the difierance would depend on the conductibility of heat
of the various rocks, and would be in an inverse ratio in propor-
