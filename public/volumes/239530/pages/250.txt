for my own part — having all my life taken an interest in
these things — that I have never seen anything like it, nor
hardly anything which has thrown a large amount of illus-
tration upon it ; but in the course of last year, whilst reading
over Collingwood Bruce's " Roman Wall" — a book in which
there is a great variety of materials, considering it is limited
to one line of country, which is the northern Roman wall — I
found two or three facts which seem to throw an interesting
light upon your own peculiar piece of sculpture, which I will
now bring forward. It is, I suppose, generally known that
you have in the vestibule a large circular stone figure of the
face of the Sun ; this face of the Sun is surrounded with a
variety of designs, which have a mythological meaning,
and it is enveloped in a wreath of oak and laurel. You
have likewise other stones suflBcient to demonstrate that
there was a female figure supporting the circle on one side,
and a female figure on the other. Now, under the Emperors,
one of the most favourite representations was that of Victory,
which, like the figure before you (a drawing by Mr. Irvine),
was delineated as a winged female standing on a globe,
evidently meaning the world, holding a chaplet in the right
hand, and sometimes a palm in the left. This idea of the
figure of Victory is very old, as it was set forth in Hesiod,
700 years before the Christian era, so that the " Victoria" of
the Romans is really a borrowed Greek idea, and the most
famous of her monuments was imported from a Greek city.

Rome was actually brought from Magna Graecia — from the
Greek colonies in the South of Italy. Following out the idea
conveyed by the drawing, you will observe that the figure is
carrying a wreath in her right hand, ready to place it on the
head of the victor. It is not at all an uncommon thing for
that figure to be placed in the right hand of statues. For
instance, in a temple there would be a variety of gods placed
