oolite coral, the Isastraea, were found lately dug out from a
recently made drain. A lean-to on the west of the old
Manor House, which once sheltered Monmouth on his
way to Philip's Norton, and is now a pubhc-house, having
been blown down, exposed several windows of the original
house.
On Tuesday, 31st March, 1868, the Camp on Clifton Down,
and the two camps on the opposite side of the River Avon on
each side of Stokesleigh Slade, commonly called Nightingale
Valley, were visited. The new road made to the bridge has
cut through the three ramparts of the camp, called Bower
Walls, nearest the bridge on the Somerset side. These three
defensive works are still marked by a corresponding number
of undulations in the wall bounding the road, which has here
obliterated the defences. The area of the Camp being required
for villas, another road carried round the north side of the
precipice overhanging Nightingale Valley has also destroyed
the traces of the rampart on the north side, and the earth
works between these two roads to the west are being carried
away for the lime and stone they contain, and will soon be
totally destroyed. The interior of the innermost and highest
of these defences is very interesting, the core of the earth
work being composed of lime and stones, with the remains of
burned faggots, the whole being formed into a compact mass
in the heart of the rampart, which is made of loose stones,
overgi'own in places with vegetation. The defence was thus
rendered very strong and could not easily be cut through,
and the manner of constructing these defensive works by the
aid of fire and slaking the burned hme, which was again
covered with stones, gives a good idea of the rough and ready
defensive works of an early age, and somewhat resembles the
construction of the vitrified forts found in Scotland and in
Brittany. These defences were carefully examined by the
Club, and sketches made of the core of the rampart. The
