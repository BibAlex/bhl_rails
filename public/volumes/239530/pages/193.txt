" Military Antiquities,"' book iv., c. ii., speaks of this road
where it passes through Monmouthshire and Glamorganshire,
and says it is found to be continued as far as St. Davids in
Pembrokeshire ; and on this road he supposes the traces of
Koman milestones to exist, particularly upon Stalling Down,
eastward of Cowbridge, and again westward of that town ; on
Newton Down, " the vestige of the Roman way," says he, " are
very visible."
Higden describes two of the great Roman roads as
beginning at St. David's. It is not my purpose in this paper
to consider the whole length of this way, or to mark the exact
site of every station. This would almost be impossible,
though mucli has been done through the efforts of Sir R. C.
Hoare, Mr. Leman, and others, yet, as Mr. Ormerod has
observed (in tracing the course of this road between Bath
and the passage on the Severn), " Where numerals are
corrupted, and the very ruins and vestiges of former roads
have disappeared, precise confirmation is hopeless."*
I have endeavoured, in my work on Roman Bath, to point
out its course from Silchester to this city,f and since that was
written have had the opportunity of examining one portion
of that course more carefully, viz., that by Silbury and Marl-
borough. Over the chalk downs the hne of the road can be
clearly traced ; it is only when it comes into the valleys and
traverses the low ploughed lands, that we lose its track.
Even then tokens of it may be found, or traditions of its
course are still existing. I shall not touch upon its track
from Silchester to Speen, or from thence to Marlborough.
To the members of the Wilts Archaeological Society more
properly belongs this portion of its route, but as this Club
has visited Silchester, and seen the interesting excavations
there, and examined the collections made by Mr. Joyce, it is
