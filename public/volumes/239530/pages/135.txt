Villa Field, and a Roman Villa may also have existed there,
" Since the publication of Sir R. Atkins's History (says
Rudder), other antiquities hare been found in a field called
Beach, in the hundred of Wick, by people at plough,
in the year 1743, who turned up with the soil a quantity
of brick, very hard and ponderous, and much superior
in fineness to what we make. Mr Haynes, the proprie-
tor of the ground, caused the surface to be opened, and
presently found that these were parts of a brick pillar.
There were three foundations of such pillars standing in
aline, each 21 inches square; the intervals were 13 inches.
The three pillars stood against the middle of an abutment
in the foundation of rough stonework, measuiing 5 J feet
in front, which being carried on in the same direction
with the pillars about 22 inches, then spread itself outwards
on each side in a circular sweep."
It seems plain from this description that they had come
upon the hypocaust, the floor of which had been torn up,
and that it had, like many other Roman rooms, a circular
apse as a termination. The account goes on to state that,
" between the pillars, in beds of mortar, were parts of several
urns of fine red pottery, but of different shapes and
dimensions, some pieces of wood burnt to a coal, a crooked
sacrificing knife, about 6 inches long, and the jaw bone of a
sheep or a goat. And some time afterwards the capital of a
pillar of freestone, about 2 foot square in the cornice, was
turned up by the plough in the same field. From these
remains, and from a gi-eat number of Roman coins found
there, which are in Mr. Haynes's possession, there can be no
doubt of this having been a Roman work." Mr. EUacombe,
the rector of Clyst St. George, writes me word through his son,
that he has always considered Mr. Haynes's V^illa, hei'e
described, to be the one near the Cromlech, viz , that which
this Club has uncovered.
