Owing to his time having been much occupied in pre-
paring a paper for the Geological Society in London, Mr.
Moore apologised for his inability on the present occasion
to give a detailed description of the geology of the
immediate neighbourhood (this he promised to give at some
fixture time) ; his present remarks would be restricted to
the physical geology of the ilendip Hills, and their former
continuation into South Wales. These hills formed a
very important feature in, and had influenced the geology
of, a very wide tract of country. The whole of Somerset,
even a large portion of the district across the Channel,
to say nothing of the physical features of the district around
Bath, had been more or less affected by the great disturb-
ing force which had caused their present form and eleva-
tion. Proceeding to describe their structure, Mr. Moore
said that the " backbone " of the Mendips, corresponding to
what is now called the " Ridgeway," consisted of old red sand-
stone, and extended from Shepton Mallet on the east to
Whatley on the west. Against this " saddle back " rested the
Carboniferous Limestone at a great angle, in some places
almost vertical, and to this latter formation succeeded
the Coal Measures, at the same angle, with numerous " faults "
running throucrh them ; the New Red Sandstone, the Rhoetic
and Liassic beds, having been successively deposited horizon-
tally upon the upturned edges of the Limestone. The mighty
agent which had been the cause of this disturbance, uplifting
these formations some 20,000 feet, and in one place upheaving
and doubling back the Coal Measures upon themselves, so
that the coal is worked beneath the Carboniferous Limestone,
Mr. Moore had the pleasure of discovering and pointing out
to the Members of the Club daring one of their late Excur-
sions. In a field near Stoke Lane, a volcanic dyke crops
up, and can be traced immediately beneath the turf in several
localities; to this he attributed the disturbances and dis-
