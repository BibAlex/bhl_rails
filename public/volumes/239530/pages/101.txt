Vei'hascum hjchnUis. — Bab. p. 33 — Found by Dr. Davies many
years since, and by no one else. Possibly an escape.
Mr. Flower informs me that "Mr. Haviland had formerly
a botanic garden at Batheaston," which may have given
origin to it.
Salvia prafensis. — Bab. 38. — Said in the " Botanist's Guide," to
have been found at " Wyck by Mr. Swayne," but surely
a mistake for the S. verbenacea.
Ophrys aranifera. — Bab, Supp. p. 94. — No one appears to have
found this species except the late Mr. Jelly. If not a
mistake, probably extinct.
Narcissus hiflonis. — A mistake. See Bab. Supp. p. 95.
Carex davalliana. — Bab. p. 54. Not found for many years.
Bentham considers it as only a variety of C dioica.
Briza minor. — Bab. p. 59. — An error ; a variety of the B. media
having been mistaken for it. C C. BaUnglon.
Poa hulbosa. — Bab. p. 59. — On the authority of Mr. Dyer, in the
" Botanist's Guide." Supposed to be an error, some other
species having been mistaken for it.
Eqiiisetum hyemale. — " Not found for many years." Bab. Supp.,
p. 103. — Probably extinct.
Polypodium dryopteris. — " Not now to be found," where Mr. Sole
met with it ; and Prof. Babington thinks that perhaps
the P. calcareum had been mistaken for it. See Supp. p.
103.
If the above plants be withdrawn from the Bath List, it will
reduce the entire number of species to 747.
