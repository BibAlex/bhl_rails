With the Physical Sciences this Chib has nothing to do. But
confining ourselves to the Natural Sciences, all who attend much
to them must be struck with the mutual bearing they have on
each other. From Mineralogy, already spoken of, there is an easy
passage to Geology. But Geology is entirely dependent upon
zoology for ascertaining the true characters and structure of those
fossil organic forms, which abound more or less in all rocks and
strata from the highest nearly to the lowest, and which lielp
mainly to determine the relative ages of that succession of beds
which form the crust of our earth. With respect to the affinities
existing between the several classes of animals, as also between
the several families of plants, — and what is yet more between
plants and animals themselves, — it is enough to say that tlie
species, and even the higher assemblages of forms, often pass so
insensibly into each other, that it is hardly possible to determine
where one group ends and another begins ; and when we come
down to the lowest forms of all, Ave find the two kingdoms so
closely connected, that there are instances of the same forms
having been regarded, first as animals, and afterwards as veget-
ables, or the contrary. There are some mammals allied to
reptiles in certain parts of their internal organisation, others
taking much after the form of fish and allied to them in habits ;
— there are birds possessing some of the characters of mammals,
and departing considerably from the ordinary type of tiie ornithic
structure ; — there is the Lepldodren, so completely intermediate
between reptile and fish, as to have led to a controversy among
naturalists as to the class to which it really belongs, and, joined
with other considerations, to have induced one of our first
authorities, Professor Owen, to propose the actual uniting of these
two classes, on the ground of their having so many characters in
common. Lastly, there is that most extraordinary fossil form,
«nly recently discovered — tl.'e Ardueoptcryx, from the Solenhofen
beds of Pappenheim — at first considered by Wagner as a feathered
reptile, but now thought by Professor Owen to be a bird, though
