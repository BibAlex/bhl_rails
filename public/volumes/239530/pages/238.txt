On the 1 0th it was again above 80°, standing at 82°, making
six days altogether in August on which it rose to or above
that point (80°).
The mean temperature of the week ending August 8th, at
Greenwich, was 69°.8, being 7°.6 above the average of fifty
years. The mean temperature of the same week at Bath was
70°. 0, being a trifle higher.
The mean temperature of the whole month at Greenwich
was 63°. 6, being 2°.9 higher than the average of 97 years ;
at Btith it was 62°. 6, exactly one degree lower than at
Greenwich.
The mean of the highest for the whole month at Greenwich
was 75°.l ; at Bath, it was only 70°. 5, or more than 4i degrees
less. So that here again we see the chief difference between
Bath and Greenwich, in very hot weather, to be not so much
in the mean temperature as in the mean of all the highest.
In September there was a return of hot weather during the
first week, the thermometer rising at Bath considerably above
80° on three consecutive days (5th, 6th, and 7th), standing on
the 7th at 87°.5, on which same day at Greenwich it rose as
high as 92°.l. At six other places in England it is stated to
have been above 90° that day (the 7th), though nowhere
higher than at Greenwich. Probably there is no former
instance on record, in which the thermometer rose so high
in September.
The mean temperature of September at Greenwich was
60°.5, being 4°.0 above the average of 94 years ; at Bath it
was 59°.7 or 0°.8 lower.
The mean of all the highest for September at Greenwich
was 7r.7 ; at Bath 69°.l, or more than 2 J degrees lower.
Here, again, we observe the difference between Bath and
Greenwich to be chiefly in respect of the high day tem-
peratures.
And this further appears if, having gone over each of the
