and into Scotland — and see how complete was that system of
communication, how carefully guarded, and how sldlfiilly
planned — but we find these roads extending throughout every
country which had been brought under the sway of Koman
rule. We trace them from the banks of the Euphrates, and
from the borders of the Ethiopian and Lybian deserts, to the
extremities of our own island, and from the Rhine and the
Danube to the extreme limits of Spain, and even into
Maritania. Wherever the power of Rome penetrated, there
