intervening Vobster series and millstone grit, and this un-
usual space seems to be occupied by fragmentary portions of
the Vobster series, the more valuable parts of which are com-
monly to be found in their natural position closely adjoining
the Mendip range.
In the case of the mountain limestone there is a remark-
able exception to what I have stated to be the general rule.
In looking over geological maps of the neighbourhood, many
may have observed near to Upper Vobster, two isolated patches
of it which are entirely surrounded by coal measures. In the
earlier ordnance maps these were represented as having been
faulted up through the coal measures, and comparatively re-
cently the same view has been taken in another quarter ; but
I am in a position to prove that the workings of at least one
colliery have been extended beneath the limestone, and that
several wells have been sunk through it, so that the fault
theory of the Government geologists must have been a mis-
take. If, then, the limestone has not been thrust up through
coal measures, but on the contrary rests upon them, we are
bound to infer that the same disturbance which folded the
coal measures back upon themselves carried with them these
enormous masses of limestone, which are thus found half a
mile from the parent rock.
Before closing I would ofier a few remarks on
THE APPROXIMATE DATE AND PROBABLE ORIGIN
OF THE FAULTS AND CONTORTIONS
described, and it is necessary that these should be connected,
because they have a direct bearing on each other.
According to the testimony of the best authorities, the up-
heaval of the Mendips must have occurred towards the close
of the carboniferous period, and prior to the deposition of the
triassic beds, and it is a circumstance worth noting, that
with hardly an exception the dislocations which have broken
