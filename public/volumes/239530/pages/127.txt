1* for each 45 feet of descent, it follows that boiling springs must
come from a depth of 7;290 feet, and at its starting point has
been subject to a pressure of 214 atmospheres, or 3,200 lbs. on
the square inch â€” a pressure sufficient, one would think, to force
it through the rocks in its ascent, and so drain it a^vay and
prevent its arrival at the surface.
Now it Avould seem that by an analysis of the waters them-
selves, you might gather from whence they had come, through
what strata they had passed.
The principal salts found in the Bath waters are Sulphate of
Lime, Chloride of Sodium, Chloride of JMagnesium, and Sulphate
of Soda.
From whence then come these salts 1 lime, soda, and magnesia
are to be found in the Granite, and in the oldest rocks of the
earth ; but then they are in the form of silicates ; for the solution
of those silicates, water charged with carbonic acid gas, or even
super-heated water would be sufficient, but in the one case the
solution would be carbonates of lime, soda, or magnesia, with
silica pure, or in the other, silicate of lime, soda, or magnesia,
which, as it cooled, would gradually deposit the silica, and carry
off the lime, soda, and magnesia, ultimately to become carbonates.
It is even possible, if we can imagine sulphuric acid to be evolved
at the same time into the solutions formed by the carbonated
water, or the super-heated Avater, that we might have sulphates
of lime, soda, and magnesia, but we should never get the chlorides-
of sodium and magnesium. And, moreover, it is quite impossible
that all these four different salts could be formed at the same
time from the same source, the sulphuric acid would decompose
the chlorides, even if they could be formed. Hence we must
conclude that these salts are not derived from the solution of any
igneous rock, in which the bases exist in the form of silicates,
that they cannot have been brought from any one common source,
and therefore Ave must conclude that they have been in existence
previous to their solution as sulphates and chlorides, or at least
some of them.
