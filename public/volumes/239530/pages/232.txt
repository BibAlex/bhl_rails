consequently the averages given are those of four years only.
The Greenwich averages are those of the same four years,

It will be at once seen, judging from these few years, that
while the onean temperature of spring at Bath differs by only
two-tenths of a degree from that of Greenwich, the mean
temperature of summer being actually the same at both places,
the mean maximum, or the mean of all the highest, at Bath,
is very nearly 2° lower in spring, and more than 3° lower in
summer, than it is at Greenwich.
Let us now see how the case stands with respect to the mean
maxunum this last July. At Bath, the mean of all the highest
during that month was 78°.5, while at Greenwich it was 82°.0,
or 3°.5 higher. This accords with what is stated above ; but
let us pass on to inquire how it was on particular days.
At Bath, in the Institution Gardens, the temperature rose
to 80° or upwards on 13 days. Taking the mean of the
maximum temperatures that occurred on the eleven hottest of
these days, I find it 83°. At Greenwich, the mean of the
maxima for the same eleven days* was 88°. 4, being 5°.4! higher
than Bath.
At Bath, the only day on which the temperature rose as
high as 90°, was the 22nd, when the maximum was 90°.5, and
this was the hottest day in the month. In my garden in
* In making this comparison, my reason for confining myself to eleven of the
above thirteen hot days was simply that I had no means of ascertaining what
the highest temperature had been at Greenwich on the other two days.
