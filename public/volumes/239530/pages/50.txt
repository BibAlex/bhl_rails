have given £4,000, thereby showing its great value ; to this he
afterwards added those rich collections which he had amassed in
every department of Natural History, besides artificial curiosities,
all which, being bequeathed by him to the public, along Avith his
extensive library of Ijooks and manuscripts, formed the basis of
our great national establishment, — the British Museum.
But it is not my intention to enumerate the various Museums
got together for private use, or for the advantage of the public,
since the time we have been speaking of to the present day.
The principal among those existing during the latter part of the
last century, or the early part of this, were that of the Duchess
of Portland, an " eminent patroness of Natural History,"
among whose treasures of art was the celebrated Barberiui vase,
now in the British Museum, and more generally known by the
name of the Portland Vase, — Sir Ashton Lever's Museum in
London, which some still living may remember as one of the
largest assemblages of natural objects ever before exhibited in
this country, — William Hunter's "formed between 1770 and
1800, and now at Glasgow, the not less celebrated Museum of
his brother, John Hunter, now at the College of Surgeons,
Lincoln's Inn Fields," — a Museum of British Zoology, collected
by Donovan, author of several illustrated works on our native
animals, — another by Sowerby, consisting of shells, minerals,
iind other objects, — Brookes's Museum of the skeletons of
animals, birds, &c., in addition to stuffed specimens, — and lastly,
Bullock's, comprising a large collection of natural and foreign
curiosities, and especially rich in the birds and animals of South
America. Of late years, as we are aware, Museums have become
so general that there is scarce a provincial town in this country
or abroad, entirely without one, whilst almost every working
naturalist has his own private collection in illustration of that
particular department of Natiu-al History which he chiefly studies.
It is time then to pass from this part of our subject to the
principles which should guide us in the formation and arrange-
