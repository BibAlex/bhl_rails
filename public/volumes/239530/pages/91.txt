in our local Flora I know not. I have endeavoured to do so ;
and it is much to be wished that more of the members of our
club would enter upon a field, in which there are so few
labourers, but in which there is as much to be done, as much
deserving our attention, and as much to afford rational occupation
and amusement to those who follow it up, as in the fields so
industriously turned over by the Geologists and Antiquarians.
Lord Bacon has pronounced a garden to be "the purest of
human pleasures, the greatest refreshment to the spirits of man."
If this be true of the gardens which man plants, it is not less
true of those gardens which nature has planted, and to which
man is indebted, in the first instance, for all the choice flowers
he so highly values. There is, indeed, a diff"erence between the
two, but not one surely to depreciate the latter in our estimation.
Our gardens are set out and arranged according to conventional

Where, too (in reference to Bacon's remark), is to be attained
more evenness of mind, or more unalloyed satisfaction, than iu
the country rambles, not of the botanist alone, but of all who
take the smallest interest in the unnumbered productions of the
veget?ible kingdom — we might add of all true lovers of the
picturesque t For myself, I can truly say that some of the
happiest hours pf my life, when the mind was most free from the
distracting cares of the world, and I might add most out of
