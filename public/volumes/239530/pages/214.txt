together for the same purposes." (Vide " Eeliq. Aquit./"
pL ii., p. 11.) Accepting then these four divisions, it is to
the later stone age, as traced in our own country, that my
remarks will especially refer, and to that sub- division which
is distinguished by implements known as the " surface type."
These mute but, to the practised eye, undoubted evidences
of man's presence are to be found in the greatest abundance,
not only in our own country, but all over the world. The
eastern borders of the Atlantic, the Steppes of Russia, the

with what surprise must the truth gradually flash upon him,
that the spot whereon he stands, at present far removed fi'om
the crowded haunts of men, has been peopled — aye, and thickly
peopled — by the busy tribes of ancient times !
Before, however, describing the numerous traces of the old
folk found during my summer rambles, it will be necessary
to initiate those who may not yet be acquainted with the

astonishing how easily the distinction can be traced Like
all other subjects and studies, it requires but education and
