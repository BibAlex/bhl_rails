almost like mere rei>etitions of tlie same form, serving only to
distract the attention by their multitiide. No doubt it is of
great imjjortance to collect and preserve the latter, however
numerous they may be, for study and comparison ; indeed we
shall never otherwise be able to approach the solution of that
vexed cjuestion as to what is really a species and what is not.
But such a collection is only of use to naturalists who go into all
the details of the science ; and by them it can be consulted much
better, when stored away in drawers as above alluded to, than
when all the specimens are mounted in glass case^, conveying ta
the minds of ordinary spectators no definite ideas profitable for
their instruction.
But it is unnecessary to jnirsue this inquiry, as also to speak
of the method of arrangement of such select specimens, as it may
be thought desirable to expose to the public view ; — whether it
be better to have them all on separate stands in large wall-cases
with glass fronts, as in the Bird Gallery of the British Museum,
— or in cases of a more limited size, each case containing a
particular group, or adapted to the special purpose of illustrating
certain species having a particular interest, from circumstances
connected with their history, mode of life, the country to which
they belong, or in some instances from their economic uses.
The whole of this subject was considered in- full detail by Dr.
Gray in an excellent address delivered by him as President of
the Natural History Section of the British Association at its late
meeting in Bath, and to it* I would refer all who interest
themselves in the management of large public Museums, having
for their object a general display of the animals of all countries,
the onlj- selection being that of the specimens to be brought
forward, or kept back from o\wa view, as it may happen, upon
the plan suggested above.
