It is not always easy to get at the truth. It calls for much
patience, much perseverance, along with fixed habits of close
observation and thought, to separate what is true from the
many deceptive appearances that present themselves to the
student of nature ; and when we have oft succeeded and
found what we were searching for, let me add, it needs
not a little humility of mind to believe that it is not
by any methods of science that we can get possession of
every truth which it is desirable for man to know in his
present state.
Very necessary is it to remember this. For so grasping a
hold does modern science take of all the operations of the
human mind, whether directed to the phenomena of the
external world, or to its o^YD. inward reasonings, that some
would seem to think there can be no real knowledge
elsewhere than in the structure science has raised, none
which must not submit to her guidance, and be bound by
her laws.
To this we do not assent. We believe that there are
higher tniths than any science can attain to — the truths of
Revelation — made known to us neither by the evidence of
our senses, nor by experience, nor by the mere exercise of our
reasoning faculties ; truths which are only spiritually dis-
cerned, and from which spring our best and surest hopes
of the improvement of our race.
Men may argue as they will ; but by no words or logic can
they dislodge — I would say from our hearts, rather than our
minds — the confident assurance we feel of the reality of these
truths. They can never prove their non-existence, however
improbable to their own thinking. Science stops short of the
discovery of them, and we are in no way bound to listen to
her voice when she steps beyond the limits of the field
legitimately assigned to her.
But while we repudiate the unwarranted conclusions at
