would feel if held down at the bottom of a bowl from which
the hot punch had just been poured away." *
She refers here, and most truly, to the combined effects of
heat and a moist atmosphere, well known to be the ordinary
conditions of a relaxing climate. Bath lies at the bottom of
a basin, a river passing through it, from which there is going
on constant evaporation, this evaporation increasing with the
temperature of the air, at the same time that the temperature
is itself augmented in the streets by reflection from heated
walls. Under these circumstances the air becomes both
moist and rarified, as well as to a certain degree stagnant,
from the surrounding hills keeping off free circulation. In a
locality thus circumstanced, any exertion in very hot weather
is attended by more or less of exhaustion and languor, in
consequence of the amount of moisture in the air checking
evaporation from the sm-face of the human body. The air is
what we call sultry. But the lassitude experienced is clearly
not due to high temperature alone, for most persons would
allow that at such times the air on the downs is more invigo-
rating and salubrious than in the streets below ; though we
see that during last July the heat generally was scarcely less
on the downs than in Bath itself, while on some days of that
month it was actually greater.
To return to the late summer : the hot weather culminated
in July, but did not terminate with that month. The begin-
ning of August was still very hot, and the temperature
generally high, with a continuance of fine settled weather
during the first week ; after which the heat moderated, and
there was a change. The thermometer in the Institution
Gardens was above 80째 every one of the first five days of the
month, standing on the 4th at 87째, but falling on the 5th to
83째, though on this last day it rose to 90째.5 at Greenwich.
