sinking into the level of the surrounding land, and the whole
will become as though no building had ever existed.
A. wall, ] 28 paces long, has been built out of the stone
foundations dug up, and this wall runs in the direction of the
old earthen boundary of the Villa, though not upon it It is
calculated that the wail contains about 2,400 cubic feet of
masonry, mostly obtained from the Villa. The spring of water
which had supplied the Villa is just beyond this wall, and
outside the Villa boundary, at the N.W. angle of the inclose,
some vestiges of a road appear. The compound in which the
Villa stood runs W. by South, and E. by North, so that the
asnect of the building was South West.

quarter of a mile of the Roman Camp, through which the
Turnpike Road passes, and on a point of the Down looking
towards Swainswick and Woolley. The very slight excavations
which the Field Club, under the guidance of the Rev. John
Bond, caused to be made in that spot, indicated that under-
neath remains would be found which would amply repay
further investigation. "We may hope that the success
which has attended the excavations on Cold Harbour Farm
will encourage the Club to proceed, as each successive
disinterment produces fresh information, and by careful
comparison of results we arrive at just conclusions. No
doubt permission would be obtained to excavate, and by a
good system of supeiTision being organised, very interesting
discoveries might be made. But it is important in all these
diggings that some one be on the spot to note each object
found, as well as to watch and direct the labourers.
7 — The number of Villas, amounting to 20, which have
been found around Bath, is a very instructive and suggestive
fact ; and from it we may infer the security of the country, as
well as the state of civilisation and comfort under the Roman
rule. These Villas appear to have been comfortable country
