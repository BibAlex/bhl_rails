regular earthen enclosure, rectangular in form, and comprising
within it about two acres, contained remains which would be
worth investigation. At the suggestion of the Secretary of
the Club, the Rev. H. H. Winwood, and through the kind
co-operation of the Rev. Mr. EUacombe, vicar of Bitton, per-
mission to excavate was obtained both from Mr. Davy, the
owner of the property, and from the occupier of the farm,
Mr. Mathews, both of whom contributed every assistance to
render the work complete. .A ccordingly, on the 1 2th October,
1865, excavations were begun, and foundation walls were
immediately come upon within the rectangular earthen
boundary. The walls were found to run at right angles, and
as the excavations proceeded, disclosed no fewer than 13 or
14 rooms upon the same level, two of the floors of which had
been provided with hypocausts, a larger and a smaller one,
with the heating apparatus adjoining. The floors, which
were once supported by the pilse of these hypocausts, were
found to have been broken up, but fragments of the suspen-
sura were found, and a few tesserae ; but the plough, and
former depredations for the sake of material or supposed
concealed wealth, were found to have destroyed both floors.
The pilse were of brick, of the usual height and form, but
older materials had also been worked up, and the portion of
a pilaster or small column was found used as one of the
supports.
This leads to the inference that the Villa had been rebuilt
or enlarged, and as one side of the pilaster was weather-worn,
it is evident that the first building must have been of an
earlier date. The pilaster had been turned in a stone lathe,
which is the case with all the Roman pilasters found in this
and other neighbourhoods. At the south-east angle of the
Villa, where the walls had been traced to their limit, a stone
water-course was laid bare, and followed until its outlet was
ascertained. At the south-western end, the paved court was
