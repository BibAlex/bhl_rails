Resolutely refuse to contend with larger communities, to adopt
less definite objects. "Kave the courage to decline to accept any
specimens whatever that do not actually belong to your own
district. There is surely no reason why the British Museum
should swallow up all the provincial institutions, and a district
so exceedingly rich as Malvern ought to have a Musuem of
its own."*
More recently, on the occasion of the Cambridge meeting of
the British Association in 1862, Professor Huxley introduced
the same topic, in his address from the chair as President of the
Natural History Section, referring at the same time to the
Ipswich Museum, which he designated as one of the best
Museums in the world, from its carrying out the right principles
upon which provincial Museums should be formed, and from its
having avoided the errors of almost all similar establishments.
It wiUbe noticed that the ^rea^rpptpf-v^h^t has been said
above is in reference to the formation of new Museums just
rising into existence. It will generally be difficult to apply the
same principles to Museums of long standing, where we already
find large collections not in strict keeping with the rules laid
down, and the building perhaps nearly full. AH that we can do
here is to make the best of the circumstances of the case, and to
regulate what shall and what shall not be admitted into the
Museum hereafter. Such is in great measure the case with the
Museum of the Bath Literary and Scientific Institution, into
which I invited the Members of this Club to bring the
specimens they obtained in their field excursions. At the same
time that Museum is not without some very valuable collections
in illustration of certain departments of Natural History. I need
but mention Mr. Moore's extensive series of palaeontological
.specimens, acquired, for the most part, I believe, either In the
