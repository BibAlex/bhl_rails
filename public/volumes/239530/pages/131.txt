Chester. (See Wright's "Celt, Rom. and Saxon," ch.vi., p. 195.)
Many bones of animals were found, as is usually the case in
the course of excavating Roman Villas. These are, for the
most part, tips of the antlers of the fallow and the red deer.
Some have the marks of the cutting tool upon them, and
seem to have been prepared as handles for knives and other
implements. Bone hair-pins also were found, and many
oyster shells, in different parts of the Villa. Specimens of
different kinds of pottery were found, from the coarse black
to the finer red and Samian ; also some good specimens of
glass, some of which had undergone the action of great heat.
All these were brought from the Villa, carefully ticketed,
and have been placed in a case in the Museum of the Literary
and Scientific Institution, by the care of i\lr. Winwood.
The following is a list of the chief articles found in
excavating : —
Iron. — An iron celt, exactly like the head of a modern spud,
into which has been fixed a wooden handle ; two
large clamps ; three large flat-headed nails ; many
rooting nails; clamps and fastenings of various
kinds ; part of a singular horse shoe, twisted at the
sides (a similar piece of iron was found at Silchester,
and is said to be an implement connected with
farriery) ; also fused metal.
Bronze. — Small portions of fine plates, probably pieces of
mirrors ; and small bronze vessels.
Stone. — Six different parts of columns of various sizes ; a
hand-stone for grinding or pounding, and top
stone of a quern ; curious quern, or hand-mill ;
large quartz crystal ; Roman weight of stone, pierced,
and probably used as a spindle ; part of a stone
water-course, 3ft. long, 10|in. wide, and 6in. deep ;
stone pinnacle, or the terminal ornament of the roof,
similar in form and ornament to that found at
