had occasion to construct for the purposes of the Royal Coal
Commission, which may be regarded as a typical section of
the southern portion of the Somersetshire and Gloucester-
shire Coal Basin.

the accompanying map.
It commences near the Priory at Chewton Mendip, passes
through Farringdon, Paulton, Camerton, and Dunkerton, and
terminates at Combe Down Church, near Bath.

range, showing the eastern side of that anticlinal, crosses
nearly at right angles the best proved and least disturbed
portion of the coal basin, and it attempts to define the
probable point at which the limestone will again emerge
from beneath the coal measures on the eastern side of
the basin.
The surface line is from an accurate levelling and survey
