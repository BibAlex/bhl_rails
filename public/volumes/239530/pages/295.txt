of the strata immediately adjoining ; and to go a step further,
we arrive at the conclusion that the folding back of this
immense mass of rock and the consequent lateral pressure pro-
duced have caused that remarkable overlapping of the strata
in the interior of the basin which I have already described.
The view here advanced will be greatly strengthened, and
we shall be led to certain useful practical deductions from it,
by a consideration of the following circumstances. If we ex-
amine Mr. Saunders' geological map of the neighbourhood we
shall find that where, as at Ashwick, the angle of inclination
in the limestone is not more than from 40 to 50 degrees, the
coal measures opposite have their true northern dip ; but that
when we proceed a little farther eastward to Stoke Lane, where
tbe inclination of the limestone has increased to 70 or 80
degrees we find simultaneously mth it the abnormal southern
dip. It will also be observed that if at the point where the
contrary dip sets in, a line at right angles with the range of
the Mendips is extended into the interior of the coal basin, it
will intersect the western termination of the overlap fault so
far as at present known. If, then, the western termination of
the overlap, the folded coal measures, and the highly inclined
limestones so nearly coincide, is it not a strong argument in
favour of one common origin, and is it not fair to assume that
by observing the inclination of the limestone to the eastward
we may ascertain approximately the eastern termination of
the overlap and the folded strata of which we are at present
in ignorance ? High angles prevail in the Mendips until we
reach the eastern side of Mells Park, and it is to be expected
that to that point the disturbances alluded to will hold good,
but after passing the village of Mells the inclination rapidly
decreases to 50 degrees. Near that point therefore we may
expect the strata to recover their legitimate dip, and at right
angles to it in the interior of the basin we may hope to dis-
cover the eastern termination of the overlap fault.
