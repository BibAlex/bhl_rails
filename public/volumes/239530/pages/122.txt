were warmer, it may be equally said that formerly these regions
were much colder, for we find signs of extensive ice action down
as low as latitude 40'=' north, and clear proofs that, at any rate in
the Pliocene and upper Miocene strata, an arctic degree of cold
once existed. In fact that the surface of the globe, at least
between the pole and latitude 40° north, has not gradually and
steadily become cooler, but that it has alternately been hot and
cold.
Now bearing in mind that cold is a negative quality merely,
that it is an absence of heat ; what does this prove ? Clearly that
tlie heat or the want of it was due to causes, exterior to the
earth, and not from within. For if the heat were from within,
it follows that, if the earth were gradually cooling down, it would
cool most rapidly where the radiation was greatest, and where it
was less supplied with fresh heat from without, as at the poles,
and if it had once cooled down in those parts to a great degree,
although the cooling might be afterwards checked by an increase
of solar heat from without, yet that there would exist a great
degree of diiference between the intrinsic heat of the earth below
its surface, in the trojjics which have never 1)cen subject to the
extremes of surface cold, and a latitude of, say 45°, which has
been so subject to arctic cold. Now this is just what we do not
find to be the case, for at a distance from the surface of the earth
to which the sun's rays do not penetrate, we find that the earth's
heat is the same in both latitudes, viz., 50°, and the difference of
depth to reach that heat is nearly the same in both latitudes or
within a depth of about 20 feet — that is to say, that at about 100
feet deep at the equator, or 80 feet in latitude 45^* the tempera-
ture is constant at 50"^.
Again, how is it that at the bottom of the deep seas, where
you may ajiproach 7 miles nearer to the earth's centre, we find
the temperature is under 40°, and does not show any signs of
being heated from below — in fact is exactly the temperature it
should be, assuming that it is only heated from without, by the
