greenish-white, wilh minute vertical lenticels, 2 mm. thick; blaze
greenish; wood white; leaves decussate-opposite; petioles 0.8--2.5
cm. long, viscid-pubescent; leaf-blades membranous, oblong or ellip-
tic to elliptic-lanceolate or lanceolate, 7.5~-20 cm. long, 2.5--6
cm. wide, apically acuminate or caudate-acuminate, marginally en-
tire or very obscurely and remotely toothed, basally obtuse to
rounded or cuneate, glabrous or glabrate above when mature, minutely
pubescent beneath, more densely so on the venation; secondaries 7 or
8 per side; inflorescence terminal or subterminal in the axils of
the uppermost leaves, composed of lax, corymbiform-thyrsoid, com-
pound, viscid-pubescent, few-flowered cymes; peduncles penultimate
from the axils of stipitate leaf-like bracts; bractlets filiform, a-
bout 1.2 cm. long; pedicels filiform, 6--12 mm. long; calyx campanu-
late, red, about 2.5 cm. long and 12 mm. wide, externally minutely
pubescent, deeply 5-lobed, the tube short, the segments or lobes
triangular-lanceolate, more or less reddish, 1.5 cm. long, apically
acuminate; corolla white or yellow, hypocrateriform, glabrate or
glabrescent, the tube 2.5--3.7 cm. long, slender, the lobes oblong,
8--9 mm. long; fruiting-calyx much enlarged, almost or quite enclos-
ing the drupe, the segments triangular, incrassate, erect, about 12
mm. long, overtopping the drupe; fruit drupaceous, ovoid, about 1.2
cm. long and 1.8 cm. wide.
The species is based on GfU{i^iXh 6054 from Assam, India, depos-
ited in the Kew herbarium. Clarke (1885) states that the species
is also known from Aca in upper Burma. Rao & Joseph (1965) describe
it as fairly common at 300 m. altitude in the Northeast Frontier re-
gion of India. Kanjilal and his associates (1939) list it from Lak-
himpur and Sibsagar in Assam, where, they say, it flowers from Janu-
ary to March and fruits in the "Hot season". Actually the species
is native from Assam to Burma and north into YUnnan.
Collectors have encountered this plant in mixed evergreen and de-
ciduous forests and subtropical hill forests, as well as along river-
sides, at 300--2600 m. altitude, in flower in November to March. On
the label accompanying UoAd 155 it is stated that the plant was "in
bud for second flowering". The corollas are said to have been
"white" on Kztm.n i ail. 5634 & 3635 and WoAd 109 and "golden-yellow"
on Rock 7844. Ward reports the plant "scattered but not rare in
half-shade in gullies at the edge of jungles" in Burma. Merrill
(1941) cites Wafid Ve^finay-CvutUng Ex.pe.d. 109 & 155 from Upper Burma.
A key for distinguishing C. g>U{i{iitklainu}n from other taxa in this
genus growing in Assam is given by Kanjilal and his associates (1939)
and this is reproduced here (with modifications and nomenclature
updating by me) :
1, Inflorescence subterminal C. QUiif^AXhJjinim.
la. Inflorescence terminal.
2. Corolla-tube more than 7.5 cm. long.
3. Corolla glabrous; leaf-blades lanceolate, glabrate. C. ^ndicwn,
3a. Corolla pubescent; leaf-blades hastate, pubescent or vil-
lous C. hcu>Xjautum.
2a. Corolla-tube less than 7.5 cm. long.
4, Inflorescence corymbiform or capitate.
