2. Cymes axillary.
3. Leaf-blades glabrous or subglabrous C. Inejmz.
3a. Leaf-blades pubescent C. pktomicLa,.
2a. Inflorescence terminal.
4. Inflorescence corymbiform or capitate.
5. Corolla-tube less than 2 cm. long.
6. Leaf-blades marginally entire.
7. Corolla-tube 2--3 times as long as the calyx.
C. ^nffOlXarnXum.
7a. Corolla-tube as long as or only slightly longer than
the calyx C. vUlo6um.
