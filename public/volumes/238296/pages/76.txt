In fact, I have not found any collections of Phaedranassa from Loja
province among loans from numerous herbaria. In my own field studies, I
have observed that Phaedranassa becomes increasingly rare as one travels
south in Ecuador, and I have not encountered any populations in Loja.
Eucrosia stricklandii var. montana , however, occurs in the same
vicinity that Hartweg supposedly collected in Loja province (Fig. 1).
The variety also inhabits elevations more characteristic of Phaedranassa
species than of most Eucrosia (Meerow, 1985). Moreover, the species has
historically been treated incorrectly as a species of Phaedranassa
(Bentham and Hooker, 1883; Ravenna, 1969). The pink coloration of the
perianth of var. montana would add to the confusion; most Phaedranassa
are pink-f lowered"] Thus there appears to be a strong liklihood that the
Hartweg collection to which Lindley (1845) refered actually represented
E^. stricklandii var. montana . Unfortunately, specimens of this Hartweg
collection have not been found.
