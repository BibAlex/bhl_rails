A small bush, subshrub, or shrub, or even small shrubby tree,
0.6--10 m, tall, often branched from the base, sometimes with a
strong disagreeable odor; crown bushy; stems to 20 cm. in diameter
at breast height; branches terete, more or less pilose-pubescent
when young with a dense, light-gray, velvety tomentum, especially at
the nodes, finally glabrous; bark light-gray, tough, irregularly
ridged, flaky, with prominent lenticels; nodes conspicuously thick-
ened; branchlets woody, slender, subterete, stramineous, pilose-
pubescent; twigs tinged mauve-brown; wood hard, cross-grained; sap
colorless; leaf-scars on old branches very large, prominent, mostly
ternate, corky; leaves decussate-opposite or ternate, often short-
petiolate, deciduous; petioles very slender, 0.4--2 cm. long, dense-
ly pubescent or hirsurulous; leaf-blades subcoriaceous to subcharta-
ceous or membranous, ovate or ovate-lanceolate to oval -ell iptic ,
elliptic-oblong, or oblong, 2.5--8.5 cm. long, 1--5 cm. wide, api-
cally acute or acuminate to obtuse, marginally entire, basally
rounded or cuneate and acute, dark-green and sparsely pilose or soft-
ly puberulent-pubescent above, especially on the venation, finally
glabrescent except for the venation, lighter and more densely pilose-
pubescent to velvety-pubescent and glandular-impressed-punctate be-
neath; midrib slender, impressed above, prominent or prominulent be-
neath, pubescent on both surfaces; secondaries 4--7 per side, ob-
scure above, arcuate-ascending, often irregularly branched, looping
near the margins, prominent or only slightly prominulent beneath;
vein and veinlet reticulation fine, rather sparse; inflorescence ax-
illary and terminal, abbreviated, 3--5 cm. long, 2.5--3 cm. wide,
densely canescent-villous or vil lous-tomentose throughout, the cymes
compound, dense or loose, densely bracteolate, few- to many-flowered;
peduncles slender, 0.5--1 cm. long; pedicels 2--5 mm. long, puberu-
lent or finely pubescent; bracts lanceolate, as long as or longer
than the pedicels, pubescent or villous; bractlets and prophylla
linear or linear-subulate, 4--8 mm. long, tomentose or villous;
flowers regular, unpleasantly (skunk-like) aromatic or fragrant, much
frequented by insects; calyx tubular or subtubular to campanulate,
2--6 mm. long, externally villous or tomentose, the rim 5-toothed,
the teeth narrow, about 2 mm. long, not spreading, apically acumin-
ate; corolla hypocrateri form, white or pinkish to yellow or mauve,
about 3 times as long as the calyx, the tube cylindric, straight,
0.8--1.3 cm. long, the upper portion glandular-pubescent, the lobes
oblong or suborbicular , subequal , about 4 mm. long, apically sub-
acute, dorsally glandular-pubescent, ventrally glabrous; stamens
longer than the corolla-tube, exserted; filaments and style tinged
mauve, purple, or pink to pale-violet; ovary oblong, 2-celled, ex-
ternally glabrous; ovules 2 per cell; fruiting-calyx shallowly cupu-
liform, about 5 mm. long and 1 cm. wide, externally more or less pi-
lose or glabrate, very laxly spreading, the rim irregularly lobed;
fruit drupaceous, oblong, about 9 mm. long and 6 mm. wide, fleshy,
wrinkled in drying, externally glabrous.
