ABSTRACT
Two hundred fifty-eight Illinois vascular plant species county
distribution additions are reported. Additionally are also
included some collections of fifteen varieties, seventeen forms
and thirteen non-nomenclatural variants.
INTRODUCTION
As part of a continuing effort to update the spontaneous Illinois
vascular plant flora, we report 258 county species distribution
additions as determined mainly from Mohlenbrock and Ladd fl978),
Mohlenbrock (1985) and Ladd and Mohlenbrock (1983) . Nomenclature
mainly follows Mohlenbrock (1975) and the taxa are listed alpha-
betically. Each plant is annotated with the county collected in,
the collection number(s) of Henry and Scott or if another
collector their name and collection number and in a few cases a
brief remark concerning the plant. Voucher specimens are
deposited in the R. M. Myers Herbarium of Western Illinois
University (MWI) .
Also, in addition, are included in this report collections of 15
varieties, 17 forms and 13 non-nomenclatural variants of which
eight are flower color, one flower morphology, one vivipary, one
leaf morphology and two gigantism.
We would like to gratefully acknowledge the Western Illinois
University Institute for Environmental Management, the W.I.U.
Research Council, the Central Illinois Light Company and the
Illinois Department of Transportation for financial support during
the course of this project.
