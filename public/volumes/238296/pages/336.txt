1986 Silba, Notes on some conifers 499
helicopter. This forester said some of the trees reportedly
seen by aerial view resembled the shape or form of a Conifer.
However, to date no more information has been obtained and I have
not been able to locate the forester who made the original report.
Interestingly De Laubenfels (pers. comm., 4-11-86) also states that
he has heard reports of Conifers occuring in inaccessible areas in
E. Samoa (American Samoa) which have not been confirmed.
It seems possible that an Agathis , Dacrydium or Podocarpus
species may very well occur on the higher inaccessible parts of the
Samoan Islands. Perhaps the original sighting was on the island
of Savaii on Mount Elietoga or Mount Te'elagi which seem rather
less known than the island of Upolu. Though it may be possible
that one or more species of Conifers occur throughout the higher
inaccessible areas of both Western and Eastern Samoa. Botanical
exploration of these areas should be encouraged, even if these areas
can only be reached by means of a helicopter.
