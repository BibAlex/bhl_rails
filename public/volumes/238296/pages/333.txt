Moore reports its use in medicine in the Society Islands, and Lopez-
Palacios (1984) reports its use against asthma in Venezuela. Subra-
manian and his associates (1973) report the presence of a sterol,
(24S)-ethylcholesta-5, 22, 25-triene-3-beta-ol , in the leaves, based
on their voucher no. 14/72 in the Jipmer herbarium at Pondicherry.
Regarding the cultivation of CleAodzndfiwm Indicum, Woodrow (1910)
tells us to "use a rich garden soil with occasional irrigation".
Wurzlow asserts that the plant "will take care of itself provided it
is not exposed to too much cold." Firminger (1918) says that in
India it "blossoms in May, with a great profusion of white tubular
flowers, three or four inches long, when the plant, with its long
strap-like leaves, has a very chaste, handsome appearance".
It may be mentioned here that the VvutlvLt &.n. [Mustafabad, 11-5-
98J collection, cited below, exhibits very short and extremely nar-
row leaves, and may well represent the form of the species described
by Willdenow as Slphom-nthiu anpoi^jjo^^. It may be worthy of sep-
arate form designation.
It is worth recording that Balakrishnan carefully tells us that
the calyx was "green" on his no. 939, but was "pink" on no. 940.
Among numerous errors in the literature of this species may be
mentioned the following: In Burman's work (1768) figure "2" on plate
41 is said in the te^t ■'"o represent "V-Utej> [ sic ] p>inncUa" [=AgtaMi
odoicuta Lour, in the MeXuiceae], but the figure "2" was placed by
the engraver under the righthand portion of the illustration of
Ovltda. rruXii [=C£eAodend^um -indicwn] while the illustration of Agla-
ia odoiaXa is left unnumbered. Both Burman and Poiret (1819) mis-
represent the corolla-limb in their illustration of Ovi-dda rrUJJ.6 as
3-lobed
Howes (1974) says that the name, "Turk's turban", is applied to
"Clejiodtndfium spp.", but, actually, as far as I am aware, it is ac-
tually applied only to C. indA.am. Roxburgh (1832), Watt (1889),
Prain (1953), and many other botanists refer to the fruits of this
plant as "berries", but, of course, they actually are drupes. Du-
rand & Jackson (1901) mis-cite the Kuntze (1891) reference as page
"585" instead of 505 and this mistake has been widely copied by la-
ter authors like Alston (1931), Maheshwari (1953), and Varma (1981).
The Steudel (1840) reference is often mis-cited as "1841", the
titlepage date; similarly, the Hooker & Arnott reference to C. indA.-
cum is often cited as published in "1841", while actually pages
|yj--288 were issued in 1836. Willdenow's comments on this plant
are often cited as published in "1797", but, actually, part 2 of
volume 1, in which they occur, was not published until 1798.
Jackson (1894) credits 0\)A.zdci Inejunu to Burman f., Fl . Indica,
page 136, plate 43, figure 1, but the plant is named Ovitda. nuM.6
there; he also mis-cites 0- m-ctci L. to page "888" in Linnaeus'
Species Plantarum instead of to page 889. The name, Ovlnda. rruXii
Burm. seems to begin with Scopoli's Introd. Hist. Nat. 171 (1777)
rather than in Burm. f., Fl . Indica, pi. 43, fig. 1 & 2 (1768) where
the binomial is plainly accredited to Linnaeus.
Persaud and his associates describe Cl&Aode.ndfLuu:n indicum as an
