der; stigma shortly bifid; ovary subglobose, externally glabrous;
fruiting-calyx accrescent, red; fruit drupaceous, subglobose, 1--2
cm. long, 1--3 cm. wide, black when mature; pyrenes two.
This species is based on an unnumbered Hahn collection from Cam-
bodia and is known thus far (to me) only from the original collec-
tion. Dop (1930) says of it "Cette esp^ce est voisine des CI. Gode.-
i'K'yi 0. Ktze et C/. Ltoydiximm Craib. Elle s'en distingue par le
port, les feuilles arquees et la pilosite"; in his 1935 work he dis-
tinguishes it from the other Indochinese taxa known to him by the
following key (modified and nomencl atural ly updated by me):
1. Corolla-tube to 10 cm. long C. IyuLLcjum,
la. Corolla-tube only to about 5 cm. long.
2. Calyx-rim truncate, entire or very shortly denticulate.
3. Cymes axillary, simple, 3-flowered; leaf-blades marginally
entire C. /.ntnmz.
3a. Cymes terminal, paniculate, many-flowered; leaf-blades mar-
ginally dentate or denticulate.
4. Ovary externally velutinous; floriferous stems separate,
leafless, 50 cm. long C. huhtcjupohum.
4a. Ovary externally glabrous; floriferous stems not separate
from the others, leafy C. 6eA^aX^m.
2a. Calyx distinctly dentate or lobed.
5. Inflorescence terminal, dense, capitate, umbellate, or in
many-flowered panicles.
6. Inflorescence dense, capitate, umbellate, or globular;
bracts foliaceous
7. Calyx with round peltate glands.
8. Calyx glabrous, puberulent, or pubescent, with only 3--
5 peltate glands.
9. Peltate glands irregularly disposed.
10. Calyx-lobes triangular, apically acute.
11. Bracts persistent, longer than the calyx; corol-
la white or pale-rose C. pkltipp-inum.
11a. Bracts caducous, equaling the calyx; corollas
red C. bangeJ..
10a. Calyx-lobes large, oval, fol iaceous. .C. \jAj)C06im.
9a. One peltate gland at the base of each calyx-tooth...
C. cotabiokJjjLnum.
8a. Calyx sil ky-velutinous, with a large number of pel-
tate glands C. v-iLio6um,
7a. Calyx without peltate glands C. cainuce.nl,.
6a. Inflorescence loosely paniculate, racemiform, or corymbi-
form; bracts generally small.
12. Leaf-blades with rounded glands beneath
13. Leaf-blades marginally entire or simply dentate
C. kaejnp^eAA..
13a. Leaf-blades 3--7-lobed.
14. Lobes triangular, not deeply separated; corolla 2--
2.5 cm. long C. panyicuutcutim .
14a. Lobes linear-oblong, deeply separated; corollas
1.2--1.5 cm. long C. paJbrKLtitobaUum.
