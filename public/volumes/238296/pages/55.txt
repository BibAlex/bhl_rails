Collectors have encountered CttfiodtndAum gldblum var. vagum on
anthills, on granite or limestone outcrops and ko pjes , among
granite boulders in rocky places, along roadsides, on riverbanks, in
sand-pits, in bushveld , sandveld , lowveld , and sourveld , in red,
sandy, or granitic soil, among large rocks and stones in gritty
soil, on bush savannas, on steep rocky hillsides and slopes, in
grassland with scattered Acacca, Conmiphoia., CombieXim, and clumps
of shrubs, on the banks of seasonal streams with lizyphwi, Achcam.,
GKejAJicL, etc., clustered in coppices on hillsides, on open-forested,
flat, sandy plains, and in open Bxa.chy6tzgAja. woodlands and Colopho-
tpojimum forests, at altitudes of 10--2300 meters, in flower from No-
vember to August, and in fruit in May and July.
In Transvaal this plant is reported to be "rare" by Story, "quite
common along the range" by Repton, and "a fairly frequent spreading
shrub" by Acocks; in Zimbabwe Nornby calls it "occasional". In
South Africa it was found by Rodin "on sandy hills with Syzyglim
cofLdaUwn intermingled in swamps with Fx.cu4 and other trees".
Greenway describes it as "a stiffly branched shrub to 15 feet tall
with heads of white flowers and aromatic leaves, very locally common
in open grasslands with kpodyt<Li> dunidlauta., VcLfUna. e-dtutii , Rk(U,
HttfuM., Cioton ma.cA06iacky6 , Euclzxi spp., Oiyfoii a.by66lnica, and
Tka^pejiia. gcLKckejum. on the lower slopes of mountains in a dark brown
loam of volcanic origin" in Tanganyika.
Coates & Palgrave (1957) describe this plant as "a medium-sized
tree, reaching 25 to 30 feet in height, with a trunk 4 to 10 inches
in diameter and brown in colour [with] A one- or two-seeded
drupe turning dark brown or black when fully mature" and occurring
in Southern Rhodesia [=Zimbabwe]. Northern Rhodesia [=Zambia] and
Nyasaland [=Malawi].
Hiern (1900) describes his two varieties of S-LpkotuLntkuui glabKo.
as follows: "Var . ^nca/ino^. A shrub, 2 to 5 ft. high; branches short-
ly and softly pubescent, erect or spreading; leaves coriaceous,
herbaceous green, somewhat fleshy, 1 to 2 in. long by % to 1 in
broad, mostly ternate; petiole % to % in. long; flowers flesh-
coloured; stamens 4. Mossamedes. -- In thickets at the mouth of the
river Bero, in sandy somewhat salt places; f 1 . July 1859. No. 5753.
This variety has the habit of S. [CltfiodtndKon] Rdhmannxyi (GUrke in
PI. Wilm. n. 501) from the Transvaal, but the foliage of our speci-
mens is nearly glabrous and the corolla-tube is shorter.
"Mar. vaga. A shrub, 2 to 3 ft. high, sparingly branched; branches
pallid, tomentel lous , rambling; branchlets hoary-tomentose; leaves
mostly ternate or quaternate, '-5 to 1 in. long by '3 to % in. broad.
