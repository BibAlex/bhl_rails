Lindley (1844) describes this plant as follows: "There is also in
English gardens a CleAodzndAon, absurdly called C. 6pe.CA.06'i66Ajnum,
which must not be omitted in noticing these plants. It has ovate
leaves, not at all cordate, but rather truncate at the base, with few
hairs on either side, and no glands; its flowers are in dense heads
like those of C. ^Kaig^a.n6, about the size of C. iquamautum, and are
surrounded by long narrow permanent bracts, which usually have one
or more oval glandular spaces on their surfaces; the calyx is not
enlarged but its teeth are extended into long narrow tongues. In
foliage it resembles C. tfUchotomum, but its inflorescence and calyx
are quite dissimilar. It may be called C. QlainduJio6am, and thus de-
fined. C. glancLiio6uin: foliis subrotundo-ovati s basi truncatis v.
parim cordatis pi losiuscul i s esquamatis subdentatis, panicula densa
capitata, bracteis 1 ineari-lanceolati s calyce longioribus dorso
glandula una alterave pellucida immersa notatis, calycis 5-fidi
laciniis acuminatis, corollas laciniis oblongis reflexis staminibus
brevioribus, stylo longissimo".
Schauer (1847) regarded it as a valid species, but Bakhuizen
(1921) regarded it as a synonym of what we now call C. phUyipplnum
Schau. -- obviously unlikely since both Lindley and Schauer kept
the two taxa apart.
It is possible, as I indicated in my discussion of C. aotabKokyia.-
Yuim "JAr. ^oKbt^-U King & Gamble [58: 462], that this trinomial may
belong in the synonymy of C. Qla.ndalo6um Lindl. It is also possible
that C. glcLnduloiujn may be conspecific with C. tindltyi Oecaisne,
which see. It has also quite naturally been confused with the C.
glandaloium of Colebrook, which is now known as C. colzbfiokAM.num
Walp., but which it does not appear to be. It has also been regar-
ded as C. ipzcA-Oi-iiiimum Van Geert, but Lindley definitely states
that this is "absurd". The true identity of what Lindley described
as C. InioituywutLm L. on pi. 19 of the Botanical Register seems to
be C. kaijnpf^zAA. (Jacq.) Sieb. It most certainly is not the white-
flowered C. in{,o>vtancutum of Linnaeus.
Nothing is known to me of C. glandalo^um beyond what is stated
in its bibliography (above).

A shrub or small tree, 3--4 m. tall, apparently quite twiggy;
branches and branchlets very slender, gray, glabrous, sometimes ter-
nate; twigs of the same diameter as the branchlets, stramineous,
glabrous; nodes usually not annulate; principal internodes often ab-
breviated and 4--15 mm. long, or elongate to 7 cm. even on the young
