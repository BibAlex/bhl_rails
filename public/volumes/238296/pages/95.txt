When first encountered I thought the plants concerned belonged
to the ccamnon i^^amg dentgta Llave. In living plants the habital
resemblance is remarkable. The heads are also remarkably similar,
being about the same size with similar involucral bracts, including
texture and dark striations which are so characteristic of A^
deatata . The achenal characters, etc., are like those of Wedglia
except that the achenes of both ray and disc florets are alike,
both lacking any sign of wings and those of the ray not at all 3-
angled. Except for its neck structure and basal elaisome, the body
of the achene is surprisingly like that of yiguj..^a d^tata.
Wajelia a^qrscptt^ L pji a was rare at the site concerned, only two
plants having been observed, both growing in the leafy-litter of an
oak-dominated low forest. It occurs with a bevy of yet other local
composite endemics including Age^atipa gQl_lJLn§ii Turner, Aj^
ViburnQldgs (DC.) K. & R.^ EJlYrLella legnengj-.s (B. L. Rob.) K. & R.,
V;Lcietfrla Ee^agana Wats., etc.
The species is named for my two field companions, both in the
terminal year of their doctoral and both in love with botany and
each other. I have taken liberty to perpetuate these facts, at
least in name, if not spirit.
