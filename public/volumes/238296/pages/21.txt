Examination of specimens from throughout Central
America (Hammel, unpubl. data) indicates that bract
size and shape are useful for distinguishing among the
three species of Pleigstachya but bract pubescence,
which traditionally has been used to separate two of the
species (Croat, 1978; Schumann, 1902; Standley, 1937;
Woodson & Schery, 1945), is misleading. On the basis of
this revised taxonomy and the type descriptions, P.
mgrlae (Eggers) Schum. appears to be a later synonym of
P- BEyi09§§ (Regel) Schum. These observations lead to
the conclusion that the species with the largest bracts
is without a name.
A little known variety of P. mQCiit fits the concept
of the large-bracted entity and is here elevated to
species. This move is necessitated by the impending
publication of the Marantaceae for the Flora of La Selva
(Hammel, 1986) where both P. pruingsa and the newly
recognized species occur.
