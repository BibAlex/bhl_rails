Subg. DeidamiGides and Apodogyne Killip are in cur
oppinion very likely to be included in Plectostemma as
v;ell, but no material has been studied and no decision is
made .
The species P. graci 1 lima and P_^ tryphostemmatoides
were, as indica'ted by Knapp & Mallet ( 1984) , wrongly
equated in Woodson & Schery (1958). On the basis of this
and the insufficient key characters in Killip' s monograph
(1938), plus the description of P_^ arbelaezii L.Uribe, we
have felt that a key, short description and a
distribution map for the Section were needed.
