Spbaeradenla pendula Hanunel sp. nov. Figures 3 fc 4.
TYPE: Hammel 9528 (holotype: DUKE; isotypes; CR, MO).
Sphaeradeniae ensiformis (Hook.) Harl. affinis sed
plantae pendulae; laminae longiores (65-95 cm) et
angustissimae (1.5-2.5 cm); petioli longiores (40-70
cm); f lores masculini breviores (2.5 mm) et angustiores
(1.5 mm), tepalis paucioribus (4-6); fructus virides a
flavidus, indehiscentes.
More or less acaulescent pendent epiphytes. Leaf
blades very thick, coriaceous, divided nearly to the
base, the divisions 65-95 cm long, 1.5-2.5 cm wide;
petiole 40-70 cm long. Spathes 3-4, the lowermost one
to 14 cm long, 1 cm wide, acuminate. Flowering spadix
3 cm long, 1 cm thick, in fruit to 8 cm long, 2.5 cm
thick, green. Starainate flowers asymmetrical, 2.5 mm
long, 1.6 mm wide, stamens 20-25; anthers 0.6-1.0 mm
long, 0.4 mm wide, provided with a small secretion
globule; basal bulbs same diameter as the anthers.
Pistillate flowers separate to the base; tepals connate
at base in fruit; style about the same height as the
tepals; ovary distinctly protruding from the spadix at
maturity, the separate fruits indehiscent. Seeds
elliptic, funiculus end blunt and mucilaginous,
chalazal end with an acuminate appendage.

PHENOLOGY. Flowering from August probably through
December, fruits maturing January through April.
DISTRIBUTION AND HABITAT. This species is known from
primary forest in the Caribbean lowlands of
northeastern Costa Rica to wet hills and lowlands of
central Panama. It is one of the most common and
distinctive of all the canopy epiphytes in the areas
where it grows. Very few other species of Sphaeradenia
occur at low elevations.
RELATIONSHIPS. Although S. pendula resembles S.
ensiformis even in many details of the flowers, it
is nevertheless a quite different species. The leaves
of S. pendula are much longer than and never as wide as
those of S. ensiformis . Sphaeradenia pendula occurs at
lower elevations than S. ensiformis but the two can be
found sympatric at elevations of about 300-500 m.
The male flowers are about half the size of those of
S.. ensiformis and they have fewer perianth lobes.
