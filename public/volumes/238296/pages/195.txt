Why this book was sent to this botanical journal, I cannot guess,
but with its many clear line-routed maps, its historically important
figures, fine photographs and succintly written and clearly legible

has no separate phenotype Life would have been a later gradual
emergence (spontaneous generation) of secondary organisms "through a
gradual replacement of a genetic takeover." This carefully worked
out theory just seems to go back earlier in the 1 i fe -out of -si imy -
ooze concept. Very interesting-
