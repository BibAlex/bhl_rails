Elaborate vocabularies for subjects of supposedly
limited amplitude are well known to anthropologists,
linguists, botanists and computer engineers, among
others. The more than 20 words for snow in the
languages of the Eskimo tribes (Whorf, 1940) and the
490 terms for various kinds of plant trichomes and
indumenta (Payne, 1978) are merely two examples, among
many, that come to mind.
Through the diverse regions of Latin America a
relatively rich terminology has evolved to refer to
substrates of animal origin, be they excrement, bones,
regurgitated stomach contents or carcasses. Dung,
particularly that of domestic herd animals, has long
been of interest to anthropologists and students of
human ecology intent on analyzing the energy equations
of rural or pre-industrial cultures { Winterhalder ,
Larsen & Thomas, 1974). The use of dung among such
peoples as a fertilizer, fuel or insect repellent (when
dried and burned) is well documented in the
anthropological literature.
Little formal attention has been paid to the
terminology of use in Latin America that refers to
substrates of animal origin, yet the subject cannot
fail to hold interest for botanists who study
coprophilous floras and who inevitably encounter the
subject, either in the field, when talking to local
inhabitants, or on herbarium labels where such terms
appear. While many of the terms are of wide currency
and can be found in any reasonably complete dictionary,
others are of restricted use, limited to certain
regions, or are orthographic or phonic variants of
French (Creole), Portuguese or Spanish words and
normally do not figure even in unabridged dictionaries.
Unfamiliar words for such substrates are the source of
some confusion when taken from field notes, or other
original sources, and translated into English onto
specimen labels. The author has come across several
