In spite of a recent monographic study of Tetrachyron , a small
Mexican genus with obscure relationships (Wussow and Urbatscth,
1979), two very distinct species have been discovered within the
last two years (Turner, 1985; present paper), both from the
Tehuantepec region of southwestern Oaxaca. This emphasizes the
great need for additional botanical exploraticai of the more remote
montane regions of Mexico.

nervia. Capitula 15-20, pedunculi 1-4 mm longi. Involucrum

Shrub to 1.5 m high. Stems terete, glabrous, reddish. Leaves
opposite, glcibrous, 6-8 cm long, 3-4 cm wide; petioles, 2.0-2.5 cm
long, narrowly tapered (winged) from the blade; blade rhombic-ovate
to rhombic-deltoid, minutely glandular-punctate, palmately 3-5
nerved, abruptly constricted below then gradually tapering along
the petiole, the margins irregularly serrate, the apices acuminate.
Heads 15-20 in terminal cymules 2-3 cm high, 2-3 cm wide, over-
topped by the leaves, the ultimate peduncles 1-4 mm long.
Involucre cylindric, 5-6 seriate, imbricate, 8-9 mm long, 3-4 mm
wide; bracts scarious, yellowish, glabrous, 5-7 striate, ovate to
elliptical with rounded or obtuse apices. Receptacular pales

the apices somewhat 3-lobed and lacerate. Ray florets 1-3
pistillate, fertile; corollas yellow, the tube glabrous, ca 3 mm
long, the ligule 3-lobed, ca 4 mm long, ca 2 mm wide. Disk florets
5-6; corollas yellow, glabrous, ca 6 mm long, the tube ca 1.6 mm
long, the lobes ca 1 mm long, prominently margined with orange oil-
ducts. Anthers yellow, ca 2.5 mm long. Style branches obtuse or
rounded, hispid on the undersurface just below the apex. Achenes
(+ immature) of the ray and dj.s)< florets similcur, 4-sided, ca 3 mm
long, 0.7 mm wide, flec)ced with blackened cells; pappus of ca 12
lacerate scales 0.6-1.0 mm long.
