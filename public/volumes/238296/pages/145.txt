Group II-B and Group II-D is meaningful in terms of chromosome counts.
Thus, while members of the former Group (Colchiceae among others)
have chromosomes predominantly in multiples of 9 or 17, those of the
latter (Lilioideae-Tulipeae among others) have chromosomes mostly
in multiples of 8. Similarly within GROUP Ml, the multiples of 8 chromo-
some counts are strictly confined to members of Group III-F, while
those of Group III-E have chromosomes mainly in multiples of 7. Within
GROUP IV, there is an apparent tendency in Group IV-G for the chromo-
somes to be in multiples of 7, 10, 11 and 13; while in Group IV-H the
chromosomes are mainly in multiples of 8, 9 and 10.
Conclusion
From Tables (1 & 2), it is clear that some of the proposed groupings
are "better" than others (viz based on manifest correlations among charac-
ters). The correlation reflected among members of GROUP IV is so
evident, however, GROUP III reflects slight correlations between charac-
ters but this may be merely due to its large size. However, at lower
reaches of the hierarchy, some groups are well defined. The recognized
taxa, other than genera which appear intact in the present analysis
at 25 groups level (and consequently at higher levels) are; Veratreae
(Engler, Hutchinson) in group 1., Colchiceae (Engier, Hutchinson) in
group 4, Tulipeae (Hutchinson, Engler, Melchoir, 1964) in group 7; Hutchi-
nson's Aloineae - Melchoir's Aloeae in group 11, Aletroideae (Engler,
Melchoir) in group 18, Engler's Pariideae = Hutchinson's Trilliaceae
in group 19, Herrerieae (Hutchinson, Melchoir) in group 22.
