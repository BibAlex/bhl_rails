described as "white" by Sivarajan. It is said by Clemens to be a
common hedge plant in Queensland, Australia, and it is possible that
all her material cited below from that country was actually from
cultivated material. Her no, 44239 is a mixture with VufuxnXa Ke.pe.nl>
L. and the term "treelet" on her accompanying label may refer to
either part of the material. She also refers to the corollas as
"white" and found the plant in anthesis in April.
This form, as well as C. heXeAopkyllam itself, is certainly close-
ly related to C. a.nQu^ti{^olA.im (Poir.) Spreng. Material has been
misidentif ied and distributed in some herbaria as typical C. keXeJio-
pkylium (Poir.) Spreng., C. commeAhOYVui Spreng., C. neJuJ.{^otUm
Wall., and Manafaea sp.

This variety differs from the typical form of the species in hav-
ing the calyx-rim distinctly toothed, the teeth short and triangular.
The variety is based on a series of drawings made from living
plants at Keppel Bay, Queensland, Australia, by Ferdinand Lucas
Bauer between 1801 and 1803 and deposited in the herbarium of the
Naturhistori sches Museum in Vienna, drawing 968a being regarded by
me as the actual, type (holotype). One of the drawings was submitted
to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew where Dr. R. Melville studied
it. His report to me is that it does not match any material in the
Kew herbarium of any known Australian species. He thinks that the
plant depicted by Bauer may have been a hybrid between "C. kejru.de.fi-
ma" [now known as Glo66ocafiya kemidejvma. (F. Muell.) Benth.] and C.
ilofUbundum R. Br. It seems more likely to me that it represents a
variety of the very variable C. keteAopkylZum (Vent.) R. Br. with
whose broad-leaved typical form it agrees almost perfectly in all
characters except the plainly short-toothed calyx-rim.
