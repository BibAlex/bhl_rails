Recent examination of four specimens received on loan for the
Flora of Ecuador project appear to represent a new variety of Â£.
stricklandii (Baker) Meerow. Far more importantly, the discovery of
this variety may resolve a vexing taxonomic problem in Phaedranassa .
Eucrosia stricklandii (Baker) Meerow var. montana Meerow, var.
nov.
