Engler's Convollarieae is divided into two subtribes,vi2 ConvoUarieae-
Aspidistreae and Convollarieae-Convoilarineae. These two groups gained
the tribal status (Hutchinson, 1973). The distinction between these two
tribes was substantiated, on anatomical bases, by Cheadle & Kosakai
(1971). Sen (1975) had also accepted these two tribes, he pointed out
to the resemblance between Convollarieae ( sensu stricto ) and Polygonateae.
This affinity was suggested by Therman (1956). In our arrangement Convol-
larieae-Convollarinea is separated from Convollarieae-Aspidistreae, in
GROUP IV and GROUP III respectively. Our results also substantiate
Sen's (1975) idea about the close relationship of Polygonateae and Convol-
larieae. GROUP IV includes Polygonateae (except Clintonia) and Convol-
laerieae (sensu stricto ).
Engler's Asparageae includes Asparagus, Ruscus and Danea . The
relationship of these genera raised serious taxonomic debates. Hutchinson
(1973) retained this tribe to include only Asparagus, while the other
two genera are Ruscaceae. Takhtajan (1969) and Dahlgren (1976) had
suggested the family status for Asparagus . However, Sen (1975) stated
that there is no cogent cytological evidence for that status. Also El-
Gazzar &. Badawi (1975) did rxjt warrant enough distirxrtion to erect
separate family for Asparagus . In our arrangement these 3 genera are
grouped together even to the 25 groups level (Badawi & EJwan, 1986).
Such grouping, nevertheless, may be due to their pronounced distinction
from other liliaceous taxa rather than their similarity.
The tribe Pariideae in Engler's (1888) system is Medeoleae by Bentham
and Hooker; including Medeola , Scoliopus, Paris and Trillium. Takhtajan
(1969) and Cronquist (1968) kept also this tribe in Liliaceae. A distinct
family, Trilliaceae was erected for these genera (Hutchinson, 1973).
However, in our arrangement Pariideae seems to fit in quite well with
other Asparagoideae in Group IV. Chatterji 6c Sharma (1970) had also
on cytological bases suspected the recognition of a distinct family for
such group of genera.
