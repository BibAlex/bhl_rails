The fruits of §.. ensiformis are described as changing
from green to red to yellowish white at maturity
whereas those of §,, pendula apparently remain green or
become somewhat yellowish. The fruits of S. ensiformis
are said to be very fragrant at maturity. This is true
also at least for some individuals of S. pendula ; the
fruits of the plant here figured had a very strong
fragrance of Juicy Fruit gum. Because of their brightly
colored and juicy (non fragrant) mature fruits with
dehiscent caps, most species of Sphaeradenia would
appear to be bird dispersed. However, S. pendula and
several closely related species with green to
yellow-green, very hard leathery or rubbery,
indehiscent and at least sometimes fragrant fruits seem
more likely to be dispersed by bats or other mammals.
Nevertheless, old fruiting spadices of S. pendula and
related species are often found intact, fallen or on
plants, but dry and almost woody, the fruits containing
still turgid seeds. These spadices are sometimes also
found covered with their own seedlings, the seeds
having germinated in situ.
