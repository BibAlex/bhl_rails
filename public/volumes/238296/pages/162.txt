Imogene Rock Glacier
Imogene rock glacier (37"" 56' AO" N; 107' 44' W) , a northeast-
facing tongue rock glacier, is located approximately 11 km south-
southwest of Ouray, Ouray Co. It has an elevational range of 3721-
3464 m, from source to frontal slope. Headwall source material for
this rock glacier consists of biotite-quartz latite and fluvial-
banded flows of rhyodacltic composition (Burbank and Luedke 1966).
Gilpin Rock Glacier
Originating high on the flanks of Gilpin Peak, the Gilpin rock
glacier (37" 59' 35" N; 107' 47" 30" W) is located approximately
14.5 km southwest of Ouray, Ouray Co. Although north- facing at its
source, at 3965 m elevation, the rock glacier makes a 45 bend and
becomes east-facing near its frontal slope, at 3721 m elevation.
Headwall material is Gilpin Peak tuff consisting predominantly of
quartz latite welded ash flow tuffs (Burbank and Luedke 1964) .
Kendall Rock Glacier
Kendall Rock Glacier (37'^ 47' 05" N; 107' 37' 48" W) is located
approximately 8 km southeast of Silverton, San Juan Co. North-
northwest- facing at the source end, this rock glacier also makes a
45 bend to west -facing at the front terminus. The elevational
range, lowest of all five rock glaciers, is 3782-3599 m, from source
to frontal slope. The headwall source of the rock glacier debris
consists of bedded tuff, agglomerate, and breccia of andesite and
latite (Burbank et al . 1935).
Burns Rock Glacier
Located approximately 19 km northeast of Silverton, San Juan
Co., Burns rock glacier (37" 53' 45" N; 107'^' 32' 15" W) is a complex
of multiple lobate units that coalesce to form a short, west-facing
tongue at its terminus. The elevational range, from source to
frontal slope, is 3904-3697 m. Biotite-quartz latite and aphanitic
andesite constitute the primary rock debris of the glacier.
METHODS
This study was conducted over five field seasons, 1981-1985.
The surface and slopes of each of the five rock glaciers were
systematically traversed in order to locate and flag potential
vegetated areas for floristic inventory and community analysis. A
total of 154 vascular plant communities and/or single species
populations were analyzed. Dominance, when applicable, was
determined according to the Braun-Blanquet cover -abundance scale
(Mueller-Dombois and Ellenberg 1974). Nomenclature follows Kartesz
and Kartesz (1980) with alternate names used by Weber (1984) added
in parentheses. Voucher specimens are deposited in COLO and CU-
Denver .
