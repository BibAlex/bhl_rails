Synge (1956) says that it was introduced into cultivation in England
in f843 from the West Indies. Roig found it cultivated as an orna-
mental in Cuba, The corollas are described as having been "yellow"
on KIUjJlyi i KltUp 2008 and MofUon 4274 and by all authors who refer
to the color and as "brilliant yellow" on Ekman 12644.
Gibbs (1974) reports negative results, with blue fluorescence,
from the Juglone test of the leaves, stems, and roots of this plant.
Common and vernacular names reported for it are "bois-de-cabri a
grandes fleurs", "large yellow-flowered aegiphila", "oviedo",
"oviedo amariUo", "oviedo bianco", "oviedo de flor blanca" and
"ovieda flor blanca".
It may be noted here that AlcUn 4SS exhibits especially large
leaves. A sheet of ["fUghX 3176 in the British Museum herbarium con-
sists of a branch with holly-like leaves, re-annotated as probably
bignoniaceous, which probably represents a species of Pi&jxdoca.Kp'Ld-
-Lum.
