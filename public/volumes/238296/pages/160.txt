ABSTRACT
Rock glaciers are the most extensive Holocene glacial deposits
in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. An inventory was taken of the
vascular plant flora of five rock glacier complexes in alpine basins
of the San Juan Mountains, Colorado. A flora of 89 species in 55
genera and 22 families is reported. Eight species were found only
on the rock glaciers and not in the adjacent basins. Dominance
within representative community types was analyzed.
Rock glaciers are the most common Holocene glacial deposits in
the cirques of the Southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado (Meierding
and Birkeland 1980). Many studies pertaining to the origin, age,
morphology, ice composition, and movement of rock glaciers are found
in the literature (Howe 1909, Capps 1910, Ives 1940, Wahrhaftig and
Cox 1959, Outcalt and Benedict 1965, Barsch 1971, White 1971, White
1973, Ellis and Calkin 1979, Johnson 1983). Although there are some
general references to the presence of vascular plants on rock
glaciers in North America (Wahrhaftig and Cox 1959, White 1971,
Madole 1972, White 1973, Carrara and Andrews 1976, Johnson 1983) no
lists of species are given. The purpose of this study was to survey
the vascular plant species present on five rock glaciers in the San
Juan Mountains and to determine dominance within representative
community types.
ROCK GLACIERS
Wahrhaftig and Cox (1959) describe rock glaciers as tongue-
shaped or lobate masses of poorly sorted angular debris lying at the
base of cliffs or talus slopes and ranging in size from a few
hundred feet to over a mile in length, in the direction of flow, and
a few hundred feet to nearly two miles in width, perpendicular to
the direction of flow. Dimensions vary according to rock glacier
type and topographic location. All rock glaciers have an ice
component: either a central core of ice, superimposed by rock debris
(ice-cored), or an interstitial matrix of ice (ice-cemented). The
occurrence of rock glaciers also implies the occurrence of
permafrost and a periglacial climate for maintenance of the landform
(White 1981). The upper surface of most rock glaciers has a
microrelief determined by a system of longitudinal and transverse
ridges and furrows that give the impression of slow plastic or
viscous flow (Wahrhaftig and Cox 1959).
