In regard to the economic uses of C. A.ndLicim, Dymock and his asso-
ciates (1893) report that it is "stated by M. C. Dutt to be in use
in Bengal as Bh^rangi , but the samples of that drug which we ob-
tained from Calcutta and Cawnpore proved to be the stems and roots
of C. seAicUum" . Deb (1968) still says that the roots and leaves of
C. indicum are used in native medicine in Tripura, India. Roxburgh
(1832) says that "in some parts of Burma the stems are so long that
they are used as rafters in cottages and various other uses". Bal-
four (1885) states that the species "Grows in both Peninsulas of
India, in Bengal and Sylhet. Its roots and leaves are official; the
Persian name [ dwai -i- mubarak ] means the blessed medicine. It is
slightly bitter and astringent; yields resin. Employed in syphilit-
ic rheumatism."
Watt (1889) says that "A confection called BhaVgi'guda is prepared
[from C. -tncttciunj with a decoction of their root and the ten drugs
called dasamula , chebulic myrobalan, treacle, and the usual aromatic
substances. It is used in asthma. An oil, prepared with a decoc-
tion and paste of the root in the usual proportions, is recommended
for external application in the marasmus of children."
Burkill (1966) says that it is "A tall-herb, common in India,
Indo-China, and southwards into the Malay Peninsula, where it is
rare or absent in the south; then it reappears in Java, where it is
not uncommon in gardens. It does not seem to have any uses in the
[Malay] Peninsula, but in Java it is looked upon as a substitute for
Indian hemp, and takes its names. It is smoked; but Boorsma. . .tried
the dried leaves in a tobacco-pipe without finding that they had the
slightest effect upon him. Ridley writes as if it may be smoked in
the Peninsula, but that it is, is not clearly demonstrated by him."
Vidal tells us that C. indA-Cim is used medicinally in Laos. Duke
& Ayensu (1985) aver that in China the root is used in the treat-
ment of asthma, cough, and scrofula. In New Caledonia, according to
Rageau (1957), this plant "est amer, tonique, peut-etre vermifuge.
