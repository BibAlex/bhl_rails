Collectors have encountered the plant in evergreen hillside for-
ests, at 1--1000 m. altitude, in flower in January, October, and No-
vember, and in fruit in November. Smitinand reports it "scattered
in evergreen forests" in Thailand, where Congdon found it to be
"common in grassy fields". In Malaya Sinclair refers to it as "rare
along forest paths".

lets and twigs medium-slender , obtusely tetragonal, compressed at
the nodes on the younger parts, often conspicuously lenticellate
with close prominent lenticels on the older parts, very densely
short-pubescent or puberulent with brownish hairs, much less so or
even glabrescent on the older parts in age; nodes often more or less
annulate; principal internodes 1--4 cm. long; leaves decussate-oppo-
site, brunnescent in drying; petioles slender, 8--19 mm. long, can-
aliculate above, densely puberulent throughout; leaf-blades mem-
branous, somewhat lighter beneath, elliptic, 5--8 cm. long, 2--4 cm.
wide, apically acute or shortly acuminate, marginally entire, basal-
ly acute, lightly puberulent above, densely puberulent beneath; mid-
rib slender, flat or subcanal iculate above, prominent beneath; sec-
ondaries slender, 4--8 per side, arcuate-ascending, flat above, pro-
minulous beneath; veinlet reticulation usually obscure or indiscer-
nible above, only the largest parts subprominulous beneath; inflor-
