Routine identification of Mexican Asteraceae has revealed the
following novelty.
SENECIO RICHARDSONII B. L. Turner, sp. nov. Fig. 1.
Senecio huachucanus accedens sed spar sif oli is ,
longipedunculatis, petiolis subauriculatis.
Perennial herb to 1.5 m high. Stems glabrate, striate to
somewhat angulate. Leaves elliptic-lanceolate to somewhat
oblanceolate, denticulate; lower leaves 10-20 cm long, 1-4 cm wide,
at first white tomentulose but soon glabrate; stem leaves abruptly
or gradually reduced upwards, auriculate clasping. Heads (2)5-20
in terminal, open corymbose cymules. Involucres campanulate,
glabrous, 6-7 mm high, 5-6 mm wide; bracts 13-21, the apices acute,
tufted; calyculum of 1-3 slender bracts 1-3 mm long. Ray florets
ca. 8 or ca. 13; ligules yellow, 6-8 mm long, 2-3 mm wide. Disk
florets numerous (40-90); corollas yellow, glabrous, 6-7 mm long.
Achenes columnar, glabrous, 2-3 mm long; pappus of numerous white,
fragile, nearly eciliate bristles 6-7 mm long.
TYPE: MEXICO: TAMAULIPAS: Gomez Farias Area, Rancho del
Cielo, "above Olio de Nubes", 22 Jul 1968, Alfred Richardson 778
(holotype, TEX).
Additional Collections Examined: MEXICO. NUEVO LEON: ca.
Cola de Caballo (100° 10' X 25° 23'), "Bosque, 20 Jun 1984,
Villarreal et al^ 2788 (TEX); Chipinque Park, SW of Monterrey along
road above hotel, pine-oak forest, 11 Jun 1978, Poole &_ Watson 1346
(TEX). TAMAULIPAS: northern limits of Charco dos Perros on rocky
winding road from Julilo. Cloud forest. 9 Jun 1967, Stuessy 843
(TEX).
In addition to S^ huachucanus the species might also be
compared to Senecio madrensis Wats, but that species is rayless,
has much larger, more tomentose, leaves and thicker congested
peduncles. The type differs from the remaining specimens cited in
having longer, thinner, mostly basal leaves, and somewhat larger
heads borne in nearly naked scapes up to 70 cm long. Nevertheless,
details of the heads are quite similar and I have no doubt that all
of the plants cited are closely related, although additional field
observations and collection might reveal two recognizable taxa.
It is a pleasure to name the species for my former student.
Dr. Alfred Richardson of Southmost College, Brownsville, Texas, who
has collected widely in the Gomez Farias region.
