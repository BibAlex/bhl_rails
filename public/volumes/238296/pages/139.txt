glabrescent, the limb white, about 1 cm. wid; stamens exserted about
1 cm. or slightly more from the corolla-mouth; pistil about equaling
the stamens, glabrous; fruiting-calyx and fruit not known.
This species is based on VccaKy 5065 from quartzite in a forest
at Ifandana, in Farafangana Province, Madagascar, collected on Sep-
tember 8, 1926, and deposited in the Paris herbarium. The vernacu-
lar name, "fotsivone", is recorded for it.
A key to help distinguish this species from other Madagascan
species of the genus will be found under C. bcLKonianum Oliv. in the
present series of notes (58: 189).

This species based on HolXzz 109 from the vicinity of Port Dar-
win, Northern Territory, Australia, collected between December 1890
and February 1891.
McGregor encountered what has been thought to be this plant
growing between massive granite boulders and refers to it as a tree,
40 feet tall, the trunk 8 inches in diameter at breast height. It
seems obvious, however, that this material needs further study. It
seems most highly unlikely that a northern Australian species would
also occur naturally in Zimbabwe or that it would grow as a 40-foot
tree there! Mueller's original (1891) description of C. koltzeJ. is:
"Pendent cr prostrate or diffuse, much beset with short spreading
hairlets; leaves comparatively small, almost sessile, from cordate
to rhomboid-orbicular, above nearly glabrous; peduncles terminal and
from the axils of the upper leaves, bearing cymousely [ sic ] from
three to several flowers; bracteoles narrow, very short; flowers
rather small; calyx cleft to near the middle, finally somewhat en-
larging, but without succulence, its lobes acute; corolla pure white,
outside beset with minute hairlets, its tube nearly doubly as long
as the calyx, at the orifice bearing soft hairlets, its lobes from
ovate to orbicular, about half as long as the tube; stamens hardly
extending beyond the corolla-lobes; anthers ellipsoid-sagittate."
