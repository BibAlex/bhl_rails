and northern Mexico, I have found that the majority have either
appressed or spreading pedicels and, therefore, one is able to
name them with some confidence. A not inconsiderable number, how-
ever, can be determined only in a somewhat arbitrary manner. In
view of this, it seems to me that a more satisfactory disposition
of these two taxa would be to treat them as varieties of a single
species; Eragrostis pectinacea has priority.
A search for a varietal name for the "tephrosanthos" taxon
revealed that the epithets published by Fournier (1886) as varieties
of Eragrostis Purshii Schrad. have priority in that rank (cf. ICBN,
Sydney, 1983. Art. 11.3). The first of these is "miserrima ,"
which has a short description and appears to be based on E. parvula
Steud., which is listed as a synonym. Koch (1974) has examined a
type fragment at US, and determined it to be a synonym of E. teph-
rosanthos. The epithet, miserrima, therefore, is here selected as
the appropriate one to represent the "tephrosanthos" taxon when it
is treated as a variety of E. pectinacea. The correct name for
each of the two varieties discussed is given below along with the
relevant synonymy. For more complete synonymy, see Koch (1974).
