1986 Moldenke, Notes on CltnodtncUium 495
"annual, 3--4 ft. tall" -- actually, only the stems are annual, the
plant itself is a perennial. Kingdon-Ward speaks of "racemes 20 in.
long", but the infloresences are more accurately described as cymes
and cymose panicles, certainly not racemes. Fianc 12S4, in the Uni-
versity of California herbarium, bears a label reading "Plants of
Yunnan, China" and giving E. E. Maire as the collector -- obviously
a case of labels mixed during the mounting process.
It is worth repeating here Blume's description of what he called
C. ^ofUunaiwn. It reads as follows: "CLEROVEfWRUM FORTUNATUM, Linn.
C. foliis verticil latis ternis quaternisve 1 inear i -lanceol ati s in-
tegerrimis glabris, fasciculis pedunculatis axiUaribus (calix cam-
panulato-5-f idus, ad basin purpurascens; flores pallide flavi, tubo
longissimo). Crescit: circa Linga Jattio ad rivulos spontaneum; in
hortis saepe cultum. Floret: omni tempore. Nomen: Jure . " The
plant here described is obviously not C. {^ofUunaXum, but C. /.ndicwn
instead. The homonyms of C. {^oiXiLnaXum referred to in the synonymy
(above) are disposed of now as follows: C. {^ofUunaXum credited to
Blanco is a synonym of C. iru.nakai66cie. var. b^e.\Jâ– LXabuZo6uJn H. J. Lam,
while that accredited to Buchanan-Hamilton, to Linnaeus, and to
Wallich is the the true C. {^onMinaMm L.; C. ^oiXarwutum Burm. is C.
itZAKoXum (L.) Moon and the C. (^ottunaXum Sess^ & Mocino is C. tiqvub-
tiA-num (Jacq.) R. Br. Similarly, the Clzfiodtndfium angu^ti^fOlAjim
Salisb., referred to in the same synonymy (above) is a synonym of C.
{^oiXamMm L., while C. anguiti^iOtium (Poir.) Spreng., is a valid
species (which see, 57: 482--484). The Oviadu inejimli> credited to
"(L. f.) Baill." and to Retzius are ClzKodtndKum inOAmz. (L.) Gaertn.
Alston in Trimen, Handb. Fl . Ceyl . 6: 233 (1931) iays that a
"Cttxodtndfion rnite. Vahl " is NOT a synonym of C. indLCum. I can find
no such binomial accredited to Vahl anywhere else in literature.
There is a Cltiodzridfion rrUXt accredited to Vatke in the Index Kewen-
sis, but that IS a synonym of CteAodcndfium indicum. It is cited to
Linnaea 43: 537 (1880-82) from "Afr. trop."
Hartwell (1971) cites "Charaka-Samhita, vol. 1--2. 1888--1909.
Calcutta, Corinthian Press, 1718 pp. (transl. by A. C. Kaviratna)"
and "Hoernle, A. F. R. 1893--1912. The Bower manuscript. Calcutta,
Sup't. Gov't. Printing. 401 pp." As yet I have been unable to veri-
fy these references.
It is perhaps also worth noting here that the Willis (1911) work
listed in the bibliography of C. 4.ndA.cwn (above) is credited to both
J. C. and M. Willis on the cover of the work, but only to J. C. Wil-
lis on the actual titlepage.
Linnaeus (1763) described his 0\JA.e.da. mltL6 from Java as follows:
"Ovizda. foliis lanceolatis subrepandis". His original description
of S<.phona.ntluu> indica (1753) is "Folia altera, lanceolata; Pedun-
culi saepe e regione oppositi folii, umbellati. Amm. ruth. 1739,
p. 214 t. 15. Bontius, Hist. Nat. Med. Ind. Orient. 159. 1658."
The unnumbered Roxburgh collection, cited below, is probably part
of the type collection of Ovlzda veAXlCAJULaXja. Roxb. Similarly, the
Herb. Otterbein specimen from Essequibo, Guyana, in the Leningrad
herbarium, also cited below, is probably a cotype of CtojiodtndJion
