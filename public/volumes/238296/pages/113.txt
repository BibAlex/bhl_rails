the exposed portion purple; anthers incumbent; style equaling the
corolla; stigma bifid, its lobes spreading, apically acute; ovary
ovate, tetragonal, 5-celled; ovules solitary in each cell; fruiting-
calyx much accrescent, red or dark-red; fruit drupaceous, obovate,
1.5--1.7 cm. long and wide, shiny, deep-purple or bluish-black to
purplish-black, externally glabrous, apically 4-lobed, succulent, 4-
celled (or with 1--3 cells aborted); seeds solitary; endosperm ab-
sent; cotyledons obovate, fleshy; radicle inferior, roundish.
Collectors have found this very distinctive plant growing in for-
ests, at 270--1300 m. altitude, in flower from April to June. Kan-
jilal and his associates (1939) assert that in Assam it fruits in
the "cold season".
Lindley (1830) comments that "this is a very handsome shrub while
in flower. It is a native of Silhet, where it was found by the late
Mr. M. R. Smith, and by him sent to Dr. Roxburgh in 1811. The Hin-
dustani and Bengali name is Hathi Khan, or Elephant's Ear, in allu-
sion to the shape and size of its leaves. It produces its elegant
white and fragrant flowers in the hot season, during the months of
April and May, and ripens its berries in June and July. In the Bo-
tanic Garden of Calcutta it thrives luxuriantly. For the foregoing
account of this plant we are indebted to the kindness of Dr. Wallich,
by whom seeds were sent to Europe. Our drawing was made from a
specimen obligingly communicated by the Honourable and Rev. W. Her-
bert, in November last. In the stove it is a rapid-growing plant,
easily known by the dark green colour of its halberd-shaped leaves,
which have often a deep stain of purple. It increases freely by
cuttings." The fruits, of course, are drupes, not "berries"
Rao & Rabha (1966) also list the species from Assam, while Cal-
deron & Standley (1941) record it as cultivated in El Salvador.
Wallich (1829) based his ClojiodzridAon tciQltXaXxm on two collec-
tions: T7S6/1 fi^om Silhet and 17S6'2 f>^o"i the Calcutta Botanical
Garden. Later (1831) he corrected the name to CleAodzndAum kaUitiiium
Wall. Some authorities claim that, strictly speaking, the binomial
should be written "(Roxb.) Wall.", since he gives Roxburgh's still
not validly published binomial, SiphonayUhai hcutcUa (as " hcu>tcUiJi&" )
as a synonym. In this second work he cites a third collection,
17B6/C from Gualpara in the Hamilton herbarium.
According to Sweet (1830), the plant we now know as CleAodzndfium
^uw-Cotum was introduced into English gardens in 1824 from the "E.
Indies" --this locale is obviously incorrect since Roxburgh, Wallich,
and Lindley all agree that the original collection was from Silhet
and from there introduced to Calcutta (whence it was later intro-
duced into the horticultural trade. Synge (1956) gives "1825" as
the original date of its introduction.
Keys to help distinguish this species from some of its allies
will be found under C. biXkunianum Low and C. Qtill^lthAjJiYum C. B.
Clarke in the present series of notes (58: 197 and 60: 134 & 136).
The corollas of ClzfiodtndA.um hÂ£U>taXujn are described as "white" by
Lindley (1830) and on Se-ngupta. 1404, as "greenish-white" by Firmin-
ger (1918) and on Kozlz 25168, "white-cream" on Koelz 29642, and
"creamy-yellow" on Clmnd 5479.
