'BIOTECHNOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF POLLEN" edited by David L. Mulcahy, Gab-
riella Bergamini Mulcahy & Ercole Ottaviano, xxiii & 628 pp.,

These "Proceedings of the International Conference on the Biotech-
nology and Ecology of Pollen, 9--11 July 1985" have come into print
so promptly because, like this journal, they are composed of the
authors' typewritten papers reproduced in photo-offset form. A
handful of misspellings and all possible shadings of ink slipped
through. Besides "delivering male gametes to the egg", pollen also
serves "to block alleles and gene combinations into the next gener-
ation simply because pollen tubes carrying defective haploid
genotypes frequently fail to complete growth through the entire
length of the style". There are 7 papers on gene expression. 20 on
biotechnology, 17 on style interactions, 7 on ul trastructure , 12 on
physiology, and 15 on gametophytic ecology. Some of the observations
are based on statistically very limited material. These papers
should certainly lead to important discussions and further studies.
"THE FIELD GUIDE TO PREHISTORIC LIFE" by David Lambert and the Dia-
gram Group, 256 pp., 500+ 2-color illus., maps & charts. Facts
on File Publications, New York, N. Y. 10016. 1985. $17.95
hardcover & 1986 $10.95 papercover.
The author is Cambridge trained: "the Diagram Group is a British
book design studio, known worldwide for its ability to explore
highly technical matters in easily absorbed text and pictures", mak-
ing "the guide accessible to anyone from the inquiring eleven-year-
old to tv.L ^-'jdding scientist". Also the general reader will find
this format captivating and easily comprehensible. There are chap-
ters on fossil clues to prehistoric life and on each of the follow-
ing groups: plants, invertebrates, fishes, amphibians, reptiles,
birds, and mammals now "masters of the land", records in the rocks
through different periods and epochs on our changing planet, and the
stories of fossil hunting and fossil hunters. There is a worldwide
list of famous fossil collections in museums. Such an attractive
introduction to prehistoric life -- even if the ginkgo tree sketch
is hardly recognizable!
