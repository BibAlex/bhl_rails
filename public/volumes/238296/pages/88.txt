ABSTRACT
The status of Passiflora subgenus Tryphostemmatoides
(Harms) Killip is discussed and a key to the species of
this group is provided.
INTRODUCTION
Killip (1938) separated the Subgenus
Tryphostemmatoides (Harms) Killip from the closely
related Subgenera Deidamioides (Harms) Killip and
Plectostemma Mast, by a combination of tendril bearing
inflorescences, non plicate operculum, and bracts crowded
at base of the pedicel (for terminology see Killip 1938
and Jorgensen et al . 1984). In our oppinion all species
of Subg. Tryphostemmatoides have at apex a slightly
plicate or at the least rough operculum, just as seen in
Passiflora f ilipes or P_^ tenella , both recognized members
of Subg. Plectostemma . The floral morphology of Subg.
Tryphostemmatoides does not deviate from the general
arrangement in Plectostemma . Tryphostemmatoides is
accordingly reduced to a Section of Subg. Plectostemma .
