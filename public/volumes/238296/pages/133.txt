glabrous; leaf-blades membranous, broadly oval or ovate to broadly
elliptic, 5--6.5 cm. long, 5--7 cm. wide, marginally entire, basally
rounded to subcordate or the lowermost cordate, pale dull-green on
both surfaces, thick and fleshy when fresh, glabrous on both sur-
faces; cymes axillary, long, very open, pedunculate, 3-flowered,
forming a few-flowered terminal panicle, surpassing the leaves; pe-
duncles about 2 cm. long; pedicels very slender, to 1 cm. long, of-
ten longer than the calyx; flowers regular, very large, odorless or
aromatic (depending on the time of day?); calyx tubular-subcampanu-
late, 0.8--1 .2 cm. long, green but basally tinged dull-purplish, 5-
dentate or -lobed, externally glabrous, the teeth or lobes ovate,
red-tinged, much shorter than the tube, apically acute; corolla hypo-
crateriform, white or cream-color, tinged mauve when fading, the
tube slender, slightly curvate, 2.5--3 cm. long, about 3 times as
long as the calyx, apically dilated, externally sparsely pilose, the
limb about 1.5 cm. wide, the lobes subequal , 0.8--1.2 cm. long; sta-
mens twice as long as the corolla-tube; filaments apically pink or
mauve, basally white; anthers pale-brown or brown-red; pollen yel-
low; style pink or white, apically mauve or reddish; fruiting pedi-

This species is based on HU.dtbHja.ndt 23S9 from Ndara in Teita,
in south-southeastern Ethiopia, collected in February, 1877. Vatke
(1882) comments about it: "C. tfu.{,loio Vis. (fide Schweinfurth ms.)
simile, foliis integerrimis in petiolum haud decurrentibus diversam.
In systemata schaueriano ad EucleAode.ndn.on ยง1. pertinet."
Collectors have encountered this plant in secondary forests,
woodlands, bushland, and thickets, on river flats, in regenerating
cultivated areas, by hot springs, in coppices, at the edges of forest
patches and thickets, in light forests, on tree savannas dominated
by AcdCAJi and herb savannas dominated by ViQiXa.'U.x, EckinochZoa, and
Pa.nA.cum, and in heavy black fissuring soil or rich, red, brown, or
black loam, as well as in gray sandy-clay areas periodically inunda-
ted, at 10--600 m. altitude, in flower in February, April to June,
November, and December, and in fruit from June to September and No-
vember .
Polhill & Paulo found it growing "on sandy soil in disturbed bush
around cultivation with Adan^onia, Lannea, SteicJuJUxL, Mafikkajnia,
Gfieu)la, Jke^peMlOi, AUopkyhu, etc." in Kenya. In Tanganyika Schlie-
ben reports it "scattered" or "common", while Drummond & Hemsley de-
scribe it as "scattered in shrub thickets on shrub- and small-tree
grasslands". Gtlrke (1895) refers to it in East Africa as "Sowohl
suf feuchten Grassfl^chen am Meeresstrande, als auch im lichten Ge-
bOsch, (Jberall hSufig, wie es scheint".
The corollas are described as "white" by Baker (1900) and on
