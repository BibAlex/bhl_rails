Keys to help distinguish C. -Lndicwn from other Assam and Indian
species of the genus are given under C. QKA-^^^^itlnAjxymm C. B. Clarke
in the present series of notes (60: 134--136), from other Indochin-
ese species under C. kakyujinum Dop (60: 141--143), from Thailand
taxa under C. 4.mfimz (l.) Gaertn., from other Madagascar species un-
der C. baKOYUJinum OMv. (58: 184--190), and from other Chinese spe-
cies under C. kznAyl P'ei (60: 180--182). Other keys that may prove
helpful are the following, all somewhat modified by me from the
original for the sake of simplicity and nomenclatural accuracy.
