As a result of a revision of the species of Passiflora with
uncinate trichomes (Doctoral Dissertation, Duke University), the
following transfer is necessary.
PASSIFLORA LOBATA (Killip) Hutch, ex J. MacDougal, comb. nov.
Tetrastyhs lobata Killip, J. Wash. Acad. Sci. 16:368. 1926.
â€” TYPE: Costa Rica, San Jos^, La Hondura, 1200-1500 m,
9 Mar 1926, Standley j^ Valerio 51917 (holotype: US!; photo-
graph of holotype: DUKE!, MEXU!; isotypes: NY!, US!;
photograph of isotype at US: DUKE!).
Passiflora pediculata auct. non Mast.: Woodson & Schery, as
to specimen cited and description in part, Ann. Missouri Bot.
Card. 45:12 [Flora of Panama]. 1958.
Passiflora tetrastylus Denno & Donnelly, Ecol. Entomology 6:
11. 1981. Nom. nudum, sphalma pro P. lobata .
In transferring this species from the genus Tetrastyhs Barb.
Rodr. to Passiflora L. I acknowledge the suggestion, and perhaps
intention, to do so by Professor Hutchinson in his monumental
work on the genera of flowering plants (1967). Though he made
the new combination in his key to the genera of Passifloraceae, he
failed to make direct reference to the basionym. Hutchinson did,
however, recognize a monotypic genus Tetrastylis , correctly point-
ing out that when Killip added P. lobata to the genus (see dis-
cussion in Killip 1926) he created an unnatural group. Presting
(1965) presented palynological evidence for the biphyletic nature
of KilHp's circumscription, and S. Tillet (in Benson et al. 1975)
correctly associated the species with P. adenopoda DC. and P.
warmingii Mast. [=P. morifolia Mast.]. Tillet reiterated the biphyl-
etic nature of the genus Tetrastylis as delineated by Killip.
