Pass! flora tryphostemmatoides ,
arbelaezii and
123
P,
graci 1 1 ima differ especially in the height, relative
position and shape of the limen, but also in different
fruit forms and the size of the flower and peduncles,
however, the vegetative features of the species are very
similar. The three species are therefore difficult to
distinguish in sterile state, this plus a small amount of
indeterminable sterile sheets from Ecuador, of very
interesting and probably new species, makes us recommend
that sterile material of Pass! flora , unlike Knapp &
Mallet (1984), is not collected ( Jargensen et al , 1984).
