Studies such as this very carefully reported, organized, docu-
mented and illustrated one are of great importance now as these land
areas are being destroyed by bulldozers for timber and roads, crop
planting, population expansions, desertification and other changes
that obliterate the virginal vegetation with its known native uses
(medicinal and otherwise). In this book are chapters on specific
plant actions on the cardiovascular and nervous systems, on the hor-
mones of the adrenal, cortex, sex and thyroid glands, on the anti-
bacterial, -fungal, -viral, -protozoan and -metazoan plants and on
sweetening agents. "This book is a sequel to the author's 1960 mono-
graph 'Medicinal Plants in Nigeria'."

This very interesting little book is a combination appreciation
of, history about, directional preparations for forming and main-
taining, of good U. K. sources of topiary specimens and such train-
ing skills. Both the excellently clear photographs and the informa-
tive text provide a fine survey of the topiary art accomplished
mostly with tree-sized Taxui and shrub-sized 8uxu4.

The author, our admired friend, has been president of the Ecua-
dorian Institute of Natural Sciences and lifetime student and col-
lector high in the Andean paramos. These areas are unique, from
3,000 to 6,300 m. high with only lichens and snow above the 4,800 m.
level and a carefully studied specialized flora below. There are
several fine drawings of different paramos indicating their overall
appearances geographically and botanically. The carefully written
text supplies the rest. His personal dedication and enthusiasm
spill over into his listings of all the wonderful further studies
needing to be undertaken. The Spanish is direct and easily readable,
