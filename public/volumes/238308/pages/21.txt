however, the canals remain separated for some distance behind
these loops before entering the large undivided medial cavity
in the posterior half of the crest. As in other forms, this medial

No. 3222) showing a reconstruction of the narial passages of the crest.
The lateral elements of the crest have been partially removed to show the
paired condition of the lower canals and the "undivided" dorsal (posterior)
cavity and "choanal" tube. Organic material, perhaps representing cartila-
ginous tissues, found in the posterior cavity indicates this cavity may have
been divided by a median septum in life. The arrow indicates the passage
of the "choanal" canal from tiie crest. (From Ostrom, 1961b.)
crest cavity (site of the olfactory chambers?) is continuous
ventrally with an unpaired "choanal" tube leading to the
interorbital region just anterior to the brain case.
The crest of Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus (C.N.H.M. No.
