and there is no large excavation of these bones. Instead, the
premaxillaries and nasals have been prolonged dorsocaudallv
and inflated at a more dorsal and posterior level forming the
true narial crest.
In Procheneosaurus the inflated region occurs dorsal to the
maxillaries immediately in front of the orbits. In Cheneosaurus
it occupies a similar position, but has expanded dorsocaudallv
and lies over the orbits as well. The inflated zone of Corytho-
sav/rus, Hypacrosaurus, and Lambeosanrtis has expanded still

Fig. 5. Outline sketch of the skull of Edmontosaurus regalis (N.M.C.
No. 2288) illustrating the prohahle position of the cartilaginous nasal
capsule (stippled pattern) in the preorbital fossa. The preorbital position
of the olfactory bulbs suggested here is based upon the close proximity of
nasal capsule and olfactory bulbs found in all modern reptiles. Notice that
the expanded snout of the Hadrosaurinae provides ample space for a nasal
capsule and narial sphincter muscles.

well above and behind the orbital level in a supracranial posi-
tion. And in Paras aurolophus, an extreme expansion has car-
ried the inflated region well behind the cranium, as well as
above it, to a postcranial position. These hadrosaurs would
seem to form a sequence of structural stages through which the
