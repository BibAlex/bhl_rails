covery, most paleontologists had viewed these cranial prom-
inences simply as interesting decorative features. Lambe's reve-
lation, however, made such an interpretation quite untenable
and a rash of hypotheses attempting to explain these structures
ensued. The aquatic adaptations of the hadrosaurs had already
been noted by this time and consequently many of these theories
related the complex crestal cavities to the probable semi-aquatic
habits of these ornithischian dinosaurs.
In spite of some popular appeal, and what may appear to
be a certain degree of adaptive significance, most of the crestal
hypotheses that are correlated with an aquatic mode of life
involve serious weaknesses that have generally been overlooked.
This situation, together with certain recently acquired infor-
mation, warrants a careful reconsideration of the hadrosaurian
crest problem.
