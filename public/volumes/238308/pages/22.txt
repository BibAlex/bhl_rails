about hadrosaurian crestal cavities (Ostrom, Ms.) (see tig. 9).
Dissection of one side of the crest illustrates that the narial
canals extend as separate passages along the full length of the
crest. From the rostrally situated external nares, the paired
passages (anterior nasal tubes?) ascend in the upper half of the
tubular crest. At the caudal extremity, they loop down to the
lower half of the crest and pass forward to the roof of the skull.
Only at the base of the crest, just above and behind the orbits
do these paired passages join in a common cavity. (These in-
ferior passages and the undivided basal cavity may represent
the location of the olfactory chambers.) Thin medial lamellae

pattern of the crestal cavities. The only "unpaired" portion of the passages

of the premaxillaries form a continuous wall between the canals
over their entire length, and similar transverse bony walls
separate the upper and lower canals as well. The undivided
medial cavity at the base of the crest communicates with the
interorbita] region by way of a "choanal" tube as in other
crested hadrosaurs. The only subsidiary chambers discovered
