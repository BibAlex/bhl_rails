chamber is in large part sensory in function. The olfactory
chamber is further divisible into three regions relating to an
epithelial swelling or protuberance of its lateral wall â€” the
concha. These are: the anterior space (anterior to the concha]
swelling), the conchal zone, and the antorbital space (posterior
to the concha) (Oelrich, 195(5). Neutrally the olfactory cham-
ber (usually in the conchal /one) opens into the choanal tube
and thereby communicates with the oral cavity.
In Sphenodon (see fig. 2) a short anterior nasal tube passes
posteroniediallv from the laterally situated external naris to a
OB.

short but slightly expanded anterior chamber adjacent to the
nasal septum. The anterior chamber is continuous with a larger
olfactory chamber behind. (Although the olfactory chamber
of Sphenodon is larger than the anterior chamber, it is rela-
tively smaller than the olfactory chamber in most Lizards
[Pratt, 1948].) Within the olfactory chamber, the anterior
space is restricted and the concha occurs as a very weakly
developed swelling of the lateral wall. The antorbital space is
also restricted. Sensory epithelium is limited to relatively small
