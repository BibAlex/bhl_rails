cranial cavity (see figs. 10 and 11). In fact, no other suitable
site for the olfactory bulbs seems to exist. Additional support
for this interpretation was recently found in Lambeosaurus
clavinitialis (Y.P.M. No. 3222) where remains of what appears
to have been a cartilaginous extension of the walls of the olfac-

(Y.P.M. Xo. 8222) showing the dorso-ventrally compressed snout and the
greatly inflated narial erest. The stippled pattern indicates the generalized
arrangement of the nasal capsule proposed here together with tin- probable
location of the olfactory bulbs.
tory nerve canal passes from the brain case up into the crestal
cavities through the "choanal" canal. Strange as such a posi-
tion may appear, it conforms only with a crestal position of
the olfactory chambers and is entirely consistent with the mod-
ern reptilian condition where the olfactory bulbs are located
immediately adjacent to the nasal or olfactory sac.
