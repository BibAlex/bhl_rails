superior and inferior rami or lobes lying above and below the
nares. Both lobes ascend caudally, almost completely enclosing
the anterior portion of the narial passage. The nasal bone
occupies a dorsal position between the upper extremities of the
premaxillarv lobes and encloses the upper part of the narial
canal.
Fifr. 7. Outline sketch of the skull of Corythosaurus excavatus (X.M.C.
Xo. 8(i7(i) showing a reconstruction of the narial passages of the crest.
The left premaxillarv and nasal have been partially removed to show the
paired lower canals and lateral cavities and the "undivided" medial cavity.
The arrow indicates the approximate passage of the "choanal" canal from
the crest. (From Ostrom, 1961b.)
