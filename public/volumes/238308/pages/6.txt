THE CRANIAL CRESTS OF
HADROSAURIAN DINOSAURS
Johx H. Ostrom
INTRODUCTION
Ever since 11)14 when Lawrence Lambe described and figured
the first of the hooded dinosaurs, there lias been considerable
speculation and debate about the function of the hadrosaurian
cranial crest. Although the debate has subsided somewhat in
recent years, it has not been because general agreement has
been reached. Dozens of crested hadrosaurs have been collected
and described since that first discover v and one cannot help
but be impressed by the variety of crestal shapes and sizes
represented. There are the relatively small, almost incipient
crests of Procheneosaurus and Cheneosawrus, the large "Corin-
thian helmets" of Corythosawrus and Hypacrosawrus, the "top
hats" of Lambeosaurus, and the curved, tubular crests of
Parasaurolophus. But in spite of the number and diversity of
available specimens, the crestal function has remained quite
elusive.
In 1920, Lambe discovered that the hadrosaurian crest was
not a solid bony structure, but was instead constructed as a
thin and delicate bony sheath which enclosed folded and some-
times complicated passages and chambers. Prior to this dis-
