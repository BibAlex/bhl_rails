Dauby was the academic father of numerous doctoral students in ecology, many of
these friends of mine. For the most part he kept them at a distance; some he favored
with warm, but detached, smiles and relatively brief office conferences; others he
simply ignored, doubting their competence, begrudgingly entering into their research
projects and practically never into their personal problems. Most of his students
appeared to stand in awe of the man, even forming cabals among themselves and their
leader, constituting a solid phalanx whenever Dauby's views were atlzicked by W.H.
Whitaker or yet others. But that is another telling.
