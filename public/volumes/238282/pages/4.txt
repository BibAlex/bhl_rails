In the course of a palynological study that included Anredera, I disco\'crcd that
two new sjxcics and four new combinations established by the laic Cahin Sperling
(1987) arc heretofore unpublished. The Latin dcscnptions ol the two new species,
Anredera densiflora from Ecuador and Peru, and A. aspera from northern Bolivia, and
the synonymy of the remaining four new combinations, A. tucumanensis (Lillo &
Hauman) Sperling, A. floribunda (Mcx^.) Sperling, A. krapovickxisii (Villa) Sperling,
and A. brachystachys (Moq.) Sperling, have been taken from Spelling's dissertation.
Before his death, he approved publication of these names.
Two more new combinations, Anredera diffusa (Moq.) Sperling and A. niarginala
(H.B.K.) Sperling, were recently published (Brako & Zarucchi 1993, p. 1253). In
addition to the twelve species of Anredera, Sperling treated ihc remaining three genera
that compnse Basellaceae, Basella L. (5 species), Tournonia Mcx^. (1 species), and
Ullucus Caldas (1 species). Although his study concentrated on Ullucus tuberosus
Caldas, Spelling's dissertation has keys, descriptions, distribution maps, and
