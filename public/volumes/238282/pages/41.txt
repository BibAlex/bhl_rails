The var. zaragozaniun is a distinctive populational element of the Hedeotna pabneri
complex and, so far as known, is largely confined to the environs of Cerro EJ Viejo,
mostly between 1400 to 2400 meters where it occurs in pine -oak woodlands. It is
readily distinguished from var. palmeri by its nearly glabrate, reddish-hued calyx
lobes, which characters also serve to distinguish it from var. sanliagoanwn. Future
workers might wish to treat the taxon as a monotypic element of its own subspecies.
