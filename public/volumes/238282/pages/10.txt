Turner New Menodora from Mexico
Hinton et al. 24474 (TEX); 3 km N of Galeana on rather bare gypseous-calcareous (?)
soils, 26 Jul 1993. Turner 93-158 (TEX).
Collections of this species were unknown to me at the time of my treatment of
Menodora for North America (Phytologia 71:340-356. 1991.). As indicated by the
specimens cited above, this taxon was first collected by myself in 1993 (along with
several close-up photographs). The two subsequent collections were made by Jaime
and George Hinton in about the same area, apparently also in gypseous soils. 1 have
selected Hinton 25643 as the type of this species because the collections concerned
possess relatively large well-developed leaves and bountiful flowers. The other two
collections are not as lush and possess leaves about half the size of the type, with
decidedly smaller flowers, especially Turner 93-158 which has very small calyces (3-4
mm long) with only ca. 8 lobes (vs. ca. 13 in the type). In most other details,
however, the paratypes are like those of the holotype. When originally collected 1
thought that M. gypsophila might be an aberrant specimen of M. coulteri, the latter
having thinner, largely enervate leaves and a finer, down-curved stem-pubescence.
The additional Hinton collections have convinced me that the populations concerned
deserve a name. 1 am especially grateful to George Hinton's perceptive eye who sent
me the most recent collection with the observation (pers. letter) that "the leaves have
clear venations that are unlike any in our collections, and I couldn't match it to any in
your revision of the genus", which is so, hence the description here.
