Axelius: New combination in Physalis 1 1
shown that MargaranOius is well nested within the Physalis clade (including P.
pubescens L., P. angulata L., and P. peruviana L.), close to P. pubescens (Axelius
1995, fig. 1). The species of Chamaesaracha, Quincula, and Leucophysalis are more
distantly related and found clearly outside the Physalis clade. The species of
Chatnaesaracfia group together eind form a very strongly supported sister-relation with
Quincula. There is thus a rather strong support for the hypothesis that Margaranthus
has originated from an ancestor within the core Physalis. This view is also in
accordance with aiudysis based on molecular data (Martfnez 1993). Hence
Margaranthus cannot be kept separated from Physalis without splitting the core of this
genus into smaller monophyletic entities. Physalis is a large genus which lacks a
modem revision and it's circumscription might be questioned in many ways but to
keep Margaranthus separated under these circumstances, can not longer be justified.
