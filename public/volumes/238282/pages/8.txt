Tumen New Stevia from Mexico
Stiffly erect, mostly unbranched, perennial herbs ca. 1 m high. Stems reddish,
vestiture puberulent with minute upcurved hairs ca. 0.2 mm high. Leaves opposite
throughout, gradually reduced upwards, petioles 1-3 mm long. N/Iidstem leaves linear-
oblanccolate, 5.0-6.5 cm long, 5-6 mm wide, glabrous throughout, abundantly
glandular-punctate, especially beneath, 1-nervate or weakly 3-nervate, the margins
entire. Heads arranged in both terminal and axillary, mostly congested, flat-topped
cymules 4-10 cm across, the ultimate peduncles mostly 1-5 mm long. Involucres
cylindric, 5-6 mm long, the bracts sparsely puberulent to nearly glabrate, their apices
acute. Corollas (dried) deep rose-colored, 6-9 mm long, the tube and throat indistinct,
glabrous or nearly so, the lobes 1-2 mm long, glabrous without. Achenes with body
3.0-3.5 mm long, minutely hispidulous, the pappus of 3 linear sirtistate scales ca. 5
mm long, the upper portion barbellale for 1-2 mm, below these a crown of 3 or more
united scales ca. 0.5 mm high.
This species is distinguished by its linear-oblanceolote leaves which are essentially
glabrous, and 3-aristate achenes. In Grashoffs unpublished doctoral thesis (Univ. of
Texas, Austin, 1972) the species will key to or near Stevia jorullensis H.B.K., but it
differs from the latter in both leaf shape (linear-oblanceolate vs. ovate) texture (densely
glandular-punctate beneath vs. not so), and pappus aristate (vs. coroniform, without
aristae).
It is a pleasure to name this distinctive Stevia for J.l. Calzada, extraordinary
collector of Mexican plants, now associated with UNAM on the flora of the N4ixteca
Alta region of Oaxaca.
