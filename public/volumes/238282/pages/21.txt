ABSTRACT
The status of Quercus arkansatia Sarg. in Texas is discussed. It is known
to occur in Cass County, and there is an historical record for Jasper County.
KEY WORDS: Quercus arkansatia, Texas, Fagaceae, phytogeography
Quercus arkansatia Sarg., an uncommon Coastal Plain oak with scattered
populations ranging from southwestern Georgia and northwestern Horida to
southwestern Arkansas and northwestern Louisiana, has not been known for Texas
(Bill Carr, Texas Natural Hentage Program, pers. comm.; Correll & Johnston 1970;
Johnston 1990; Stanley D. Jones, Botanical Research Center (BRCH), pers. comm.;
Hunt 1986; Little 1977; Nixon 1985; Sargent 1965; Simp.son 1988; Vines 1977).
Hunt (1990) lists the species as occurring m Texas on the basis of an histoncal
specimen collected in 1903 in Jasper County {W.W. Ashe 1 [NCU]). More recently,
two small populations of Q. arkansatia have been found in Cass County.
In 1990, Hunt (Hutil TX218 [to be distributed to TEX and ND]) first confirmed
Quercus arkatisaiia from Texas, identifying it as "g. arkatisana tending toward Q.
nigra" This collection, representing one sapling, was from the south side of TX 77,
1 km west of the Louisiana state line in sandy icxuii pinc-oak woods dominated b\
Finns echinata P. Mill., Quercus falcaki Michx., Q. nigra L., and ljqnidaml)ar
styraciflua L. This find was the result of searches stimulalcd by the presence ol' a
large population in Lc^uisiana about 3 km away, documented initially by G.H. Waic
{Ware 1492 [DAV|) in 1965 (Hunt 1990).
In 1995, the MacRobertses found several small trees (up to 7 meters high) in a
young, densely stcKked, even-aged pine plantation on deep .sandy soils along a 1 km
