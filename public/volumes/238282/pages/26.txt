Hitchc. (North Amer. R. 17:460. 1935.).
Perennial with scaly rhizomes; the scales 3-18 mm long, acute, often deteriorating
with age. Culms much-branched above, wiry, erect, seldom spreading, 7-17 cm tall
(rarely higher), 0.3-0.7 mm diam., glabrous; intemodes 5-33 mm long, nodulose-
roughened at least below the inflorescence. Sheaths 3-16 mm long, usually about 1/2
the length of the intemode, margins hyaline and clasping at the base, open and
diverging from culm near the leaf collar. Ligules membranous, 0.3-1.5 mm long,
erose, toothed, or acute, decurrent. Blades 3-19 mm long, 0.2-1.0 mm wide, abaxiai
surface glabrous, adaxial surface pubescent, strongly involute and arcuate sprcadmg,
margins scabrous, prominent midvein absent. Inflorescence a contracted panicle, 1-4
cm long (occasionally longer), 1-15 mm wide or wider if branches open or reflexed,
usually exserted above the upper leaf sheath; inflorescence branches solitary at each
node, with 4-11 nodes per inflorescence; branches ascending. Pedicels 0.1-1.1 mm
long, minutely setose. Spikelets 1.4-2.3 mm long, not crowded on the branches, 1-15
spikelets on the lowermost panicle branch. Glumes equal, 0.6-1.7 mm long, acute,
1/2-2/3 the length of the floret, 1 (occasionally 2-or 3-) -nerved, green or purple.
Lemmas acute, 1.3-2.3 mm long, 3-ncrvcd, densely villous near the base and along
midnerve and margins to near the apex, green or becoming purple at maturity; niucro
absent to 0.6 mm long. Paleas 1.0-2.1 mm long, densely villous between the ner\es,
with color similar to lemma. Anthers 0.7-1.6 mm long, yellow, dark green, or purple.
Caryopses narrowly elliptic to linear, 0.7-1.2 mm long, 0.2-0.3 mm v\ide,' dark
brown. Chromo.some number 2ii =20, 22 (Recdcr 1967).
Distribution. Mexico: Chihuahua, Coahuila, Hidalgo, Nue\o Leon, San Luis
Poiosf, and Zacatecas. Open ground in gypsiferous to calcareous soils, often fonning
extensive stands across gypsum Hals,
