MORPHOLOGY
Stem solitary, semihypogeous, moderately short (20-30 cm), cylindric (12-18 cm
in diameter), covered by rough, irregular persistent leaf and cataphyll bases,
brownish-red; cataphylls wrinkled, stipulate, triangular, densely white hairy at crown,
irregularly arranged on lower portions of stem, 5 cm wide and 5 cm long; leaves 2.0-
2.5 m long, usually in whorls of 2-4, recently-emerged and juvenile leaves glaucous
on both surfaces, light pea-green, older leaves glabrous, uniformly medium-green on
both surfaces, adult plants with up to 2 previous whorls of leaves; petiole 1.00-1.25 m
long, terete with an expanded base, 15 mm in diameter at base and tapering gradually
to 8 mm at the first leaflet, sparsely armed with simple spines (1-3 mm), spines more
densely distributed proximally and becoming sparse distally; rachis neariy straight,
subterele, very sparsely armed on proximal 25%, ending in conical-linear apex 10-25
mm long and unarmed; adaxial surface is flattened and shallowly bisulcate with leaflets
inserted in the paired grooves up to 5 mm apart, the paired grooves ansing distally to
the first pair of leaflets; leaflets linear lanceolate to falcate, papyraceous, the median
leaflets 30-50 cm in length, gradually attenuate, 30-38 mm in width with 22-27 veins
slightly raised on abaxial surface, 30-40 "pairs" inserted on 25-50 mm centers,
opposite to sub-opposite, 9-12 mm wide at point of attachment on rachis, margins are
slightly revolute and turned upward, basal 25-30% of leaf keeled becoming Hattened
distally, leaflets gradually reduced in length towards apex; microsporangiate strobilus
elongate-conical, solitary, 26-28 cm in length, 28 mm in diameter at base, 15 mm in
diameter distally, mucronate, peduncle 20-30 mm in length and 11-15 mm in diameter,
tomentose to wooly; microsporophylls 8 mm wide and 3 mm long, sporangia in a
single patch, olive green; megasporangiate strobilus cylindrical to ovoid with a large
apiculum, solitary, overall length 14-18 cm and diameter 7.5-10.0 cm at maturity,
apiculate cap 1.5-3.0 cm in length and 3-5 cm in width, megastrobilus borne on a
short peduncle 30-38 mm long and 18-20 mm wide; mcgasporophyil length 2.5-3.0
cm, sporophyll face 3.5-5.0 cm wide and 17-23 mm long, inner face somewhat
glabrous except for the moderately rolled margins which are gray tomentose;
sporophyll horns divergent to either .side of the sporophyll up to 10 mm long, only
slightly raised from the sporophyll face, outer edges grey and tomentose, horns joined
by a wrinkled raised edge; megastrobilus with short purple hairs sparsely scattered on
sporophyll face and sarcotesta where expt:)sed between mcgaspt)ropyhlls which arc
widely separated at matunty by the fully-developed seeds; sarcotesta white, soon
turning brown as it ripens; 31-33 mm long, 25-27 mm wide; sclerotesta irregular,
ovoid, tan, 24-26 mm long, 18-20 mm wide, smooth with 8-9 indislincl longitudinal
ridges.
Etymology: The species is named to honor Mr. Lx)ran Whitelock of Los
Angeles, CALIFORNIA for his remarkable dedication and contribution to cycad
biology and awareness throughout the world.
DISTRIBUTION AND HABITAT
Ceralozomia whitelockiaim is known only from the drainage o'i the Rfo Vallc
Nacional in montane tropical forest within the range of 335-973 m, but occurs more
commonly at lower elevations (335-6(X) m). Habitat consists of very steep slopes
