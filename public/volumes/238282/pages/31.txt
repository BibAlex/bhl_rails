34 PHYTOLOGIA July 1995 volume 79(1 ):3 1-34
Erect fibrous-rooted perennial (?) succulent 5-8 cm high. Stems near base 3-4 mm
across (when dried), papillose. Leaves (dried) ovate, papillose, 7-10 mm long, 3-4
mm wide, gradually reduced from the bottom of the stem (where soon deciduous)
upwards, overlapping for 1/2-2/3 their lengths so as to obscure the stem. Flowers 5-
10, arranged terminal on short circinnate branches, forming a congested inflorescence
1-2 cm wide, ca. 1 cm high. Sepals 5, ovate, glabrous, ca. 3 mm long, 1.5 mm wide,
widest at or near the middle, free to the base, or nearly so, with a pronounced dorsal
midrib. Stamens 5, alternate with the petals, ca. 3 mm long, the anthers yellow at
matunty. Carpels 5, in flower ca. 2.5 mm long, the styles erect, ca. 1 mm long.
Mature fruit not available.
According to the collectors, the type was collected at the date given above,
subsequently flowering at their residence on 27 June 1990 from which herbarium
material was made, this constituting the holotype. The photograph (Figure 1) was also
made from type material.
Vegetatively, Sedum booleanum much resembles sjsecies of the genus Villadia, but
the flowers appear to be like those of Sedutn, the petals free to the base, or nearly so.
It is a pleasure to name this very attractive red flowered Sedum for George Boole
Hinton, age 5 (Figure 2), the great grandson of the well-known Mexican collector,
George B. Hinton (1880-1943). In spite of his relative youth, George Boole has
become a fourth generation plant collector in Mexico. He reportedly often
accompanies both his father, George, and his grandfather, James, on various
collection expeditions to the Sierra Madre Oriental of northeastern Mexico. Let's hope
he continues this familial tradition.
