near the leaf collar. Ligules membranous, 0.4-1.5 mm long, erose, toothed, or acute,
decurrent. Blades 7-30 mm long, 0.2-1.2 mm broad, abaxjal surface glabrous,
adaxial surface pubescent, sU-ongly involute and arcuate spreading, margins scabrous,
prominent midvein absent. Inflorescence a contracted panicle, 1-5 cm long, 1-5 mm
wide, usually exserted above the upper leaf sheaths; inflorescence branches solitary at
each node, with 5-11 nodes per inflorescence; branches ascending. Pedicels 0.1-1.2
mm long, minutely setose. Spikelets 1.8-2.5 mm long, not crowded on the branches,
with 2-9 spikelets on the lowermost panicle branch. Glumes equal, 0.6-1.8 mm long,
acute, 1/2-2/3 the length of the floret, 1 (rarely 2) -nerved, green or purple. Lemmas
acute, 1.8-2.4 mm long, 3-nerved, densely villous near the base and along the
midnerve and margins to near the apex, green or becoming purple with maturity;
mucro absent to 0.4 mm long. Paleas 1.7-2.3 mm long, densely villous between the
nerves, color similar to the lemma. Anthers 0.9-1.4 mm long, yellow, dark green or
purple. Caryopses narrowly elliptic to linear, 1.0-1.4 mm long, 0.2-0.4 mm wide,
dark brown. Chromosome number 2/i =20, 40 (Morden 1985; Reeder 1967).
Distribution. United States: southern New Mexico and Te.xas in the Trans-Pecos,
western Edwards Plateau and southern High Plains. Open ground in alkaline to
calcareous soils, usually in isolated clumps and seldom forming dense stands.
