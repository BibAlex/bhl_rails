SUMMARY.
In the })resent paper three new primary hymenopterous
parasites of sheep maggot-flies are recorded,^ — Spalungia
mtiscidarum Richardson, Paraspilomicrus froggatti n. gen.,
n. sp., and Austrahncyrtus giravlti n. gen., n. sp. — and a few-
observations on the hfe- history of these and certain others
are recorded.
As a result of a short investigation regarding the habits of
these wasps and their hosts, it appears hkely (from laboratory
experiments only, however) that the value of some of these,
especially Nasonia brevicornis, has been greatly over-estimated.
In conclusion, reasons are given for the advisability of the
introduction of the well-known English sheep-fly parasite,
Ahjsia manducator .
