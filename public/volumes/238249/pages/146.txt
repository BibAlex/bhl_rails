FRESHWATER FISPI EPIDEMICS IN QUEENSLAND RIVERS. 189
Queensland is a country in which heavy rain normally
falls during the summer, December to April, while the winters
are dry. Thus cold and dr}^ conditions commonly go together,
although in the early summer the weather may be hot and
dry.
The Commonwealth Meteorologist, in a letter dated 31st
January 1918, drew our attention to the following statement
by Mr. J. B. Henderson, Government Analyst, Brisbane, in a
report on a sample of water from Cooper's Creek at Windorah : —
" With reference to your letter . . . and sample of water,
no poisons were found in the water. A small fish placed in the
water for 48 hours was quite normal at the end of that time.
" The enormous number of dead fish referred to in your
letter points either to suffocation by mud or to a more common
cause, a sudden drop in temperature. Nothing in your letter
indicates or contra-indicates the presence of either of these
causes."
The Meteorologist went on to state that an investigation
of the temperature records for June 1917 showed rather
remarkable departures from the normal and appeared to bear
out Mr. Henderson's theory. A copy of minima records for a
number of inland stations in Queensland was enclosed.
The localities were Urandangie, Boulia, Winton, Long-
reach, Isisford, Windorah, Tambo, Adavale, Thargomindah,
and Cunnamulla. From the 1st to the 15th of that month there
was a warm period in which the averages of daily minimum
temperatures for the fifteen days and the number of degrees
above June normal — given in brackets — for each locality
were as follows, respectively : — 52-3 (6-8) ; 51-2 (6-5) ; 51-3
(1-6) ; 50-5 (2-8) ; 48-4 (1-4) ; 48-8 (4-0) ; 47-2 (3-8) ; 49-5
(5-7) ; 50-0 (4-9) ; 49-4 (7-2). During the remainder of the
month there was a sudden drop experienced at all these
stations, commencing on 16th June. The mean of the daily
minima during the cold period and the number of degrees
below the June normal, for each of the ten localities were
respectively as follows :— 37-8 (7-7) ; 38-6 (7-1) ; 40-5 (9-2) ;
38-2 (9-5) ; 37-9 (9-1) ; 35-8 (9-0) ; 32-6 (10-8) ; 35-3 (8-5) ;
38-5 (6-6) ; 38-0 (4-2). The mean of daily minima for June
1917 at each locality as compared with the normal (calculated
from twelve years' records) were given as follows : — 45- 1
(45-5) ; 44-9 (45-7) ; 45-9 (49-7) ; 44-4 (47-7) ; 43-2 (47-0) ;
42-3 (44-8) ; 39-9 (43-4) ; 42-4 (43-8) ; 42-2 (45-1) ; 43-7 (42-2).
