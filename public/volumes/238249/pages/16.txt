With diminution in water content of pricMy pear the amounts
consumed are progressively diminished, but the amounts of dry-
matter ingested and nutrients utilised are slightly increased.
The indication is that somewhat fuller employment of prickly
pear will be made when the water content is below that of the
highest succulence. Probably an upper limit would be reached,
after which loss of succulence would render the plant less
palatable to cattle.
Effect of Watering Cattle on Consumption of PricMy Pear. —
Six of the steers were each given water on thirty consecutive
days in the second maintenance trials. The giving of water had
little effect on the appetite of the animals for prickly pear. Thus
the average consumption during the days on which water was
given was 6-02 starch equivalent, on the other days 6-42
starch equivalent. The remaining steers during the periods
for which the comparison was made ate 6-33 and 6-35 starch
equivalent of prickly pear.
Attempted Improvement of Palatabiliiy of Pricldy Pear. —
No method of feeding prickly pear — as feeding after boihng the
joints, after singeing or roasting, or feeding salted or admixed
with palatable meals — was found to increase the amounts eaten
by the steers.
The Water Requirement of Prickly Pear Fed Steers and
THE Effect of Watering.
The water supplied by the succulent prickly pear was
evidently sufficient for the steers in the winter season. During
the first maintenance trials and thereafter for a total of 150
days, the animals had no other water supply than that furnished
by the pear. In warmer weather during the second trials it
