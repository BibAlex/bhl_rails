The follomng observations are the result of several mo^iths
of stud}^ of the " Magnificent Spider." Dicrostichus magnificns,
specimens of which have been transferred to my garden in
Brisbane. The so-called cocoons or egg-bags of this spider
are such remarkable objects that they are frequently brought
to the Queensland Museum. The children call them " cow's
teats." As the spiders are practically stationary in the adult
stage, they can be studied at leisure if estabhshed in a garden.
Apparently no observations have been previously made on the
spinning of the large cocoons, or on the remarkable way in
which these spiders catch their prey, as described in this
paper.
The adult female of Dicrostichus magnificus is a very large
and handsome spider. A detailed description was given by
Rainbow (1), and need not be repeated here, in view of my
illustrations.
The abdomen is cream-coloured above, \\ith darker
vermiculations and a mosaic of fourteen salmon-pink spots
on the front edge ; the two prominent tubercles are yellowish.
The daint}' httle turret on the cephalo-thorax, forming Simon's
generic character (2), has an alabaster base, and the wine-
coloured turret itself supports two pairs of eyes.
Although the locahty for Rainbow's type was Mount
Kembla, N.S.W., there appear to be no special distinctions in
our Queensland specimens.
Apparently the different species of Dicrostichus manufac-
ture distinct types of cocoons, but the contours of those
associated with D. magnificus vary considerably. Rainbow
figured cocoons with a very blunt terminal portion or tail.
