A.— OBSERVATIONS ON THE BIOLOGY OF THE CHALCID
PARASITES OF AUSTRALIAN SHEEP BLOWFLIES.
The chalcid wasjjs that parasitize sheep maggot-flies may
be divided into two groups according as they attack the pupa
or larva. Egg parasites have not yet been discovered. To
the former group l)elong Xasonia brevicornis, Paraspilomicrus^
froggatti, Spalangia muscidarum, Dirhinus sarcophagce, Pachy
crepoideus dubius, and Hemilexomyia abrupta ; to the latter
group, Chalcis dipterophaga, Chalcis callipJwrce, and Australen-
cyrtus glraulti.
1. Nasonia brevicornis Ashmead. (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 20, 21, 22,
27-33.)
A full description of this species -svas given by Girault and
Sanders (1909-191C). Its presence in Australia was detected by
Girault in October, 1911 ; two years later it was found by
Mr. Froggatt in N.S.W. and by Mr. E. Jarvis in Longreach,
Central Queensland.
The wasp occurs very commonly in Brisbane, and can
generally be easily attracted by exposing deca3dng meat.
Careful observations on its life-history have been carried
out by W. W. Froggatt and T. McCarthy (1914, 1915), as well
as by J. L. Froggatt (1919). A more complete account which
includes the observations of these authors has been given by
Altson (1920). Graham-Smith (1919) also refers to this insect
in his work on the parasites of common house-flies. {See
also Johnston and Bancroft, 1920 ; Johnston, 1920.)
In the following account, therefore, only a very brief
summary of published observations, supplemented by others
of our own, will be given.
Length of Life-cycle. — Various observers have obtained
varying results ; Girault and Sanders give 15-22 J days,
according to the season, in America ; W. W. Froggatt and
McCarthy 11 to 15, and J. L. Froggatt gives 11-14 days, in
N.S.W. In Brisbane, during November, the. total period was
found by us to vary from 11 to 14 or even as much as 16 days,
while in January and February it occupied about 14 days.
Altson found that under lal;oratory conditions with a mean
temperature of 20° C. it averaged 21 days in London.
Oviposition. — The ^^■asps are readily attracted to carrion.
