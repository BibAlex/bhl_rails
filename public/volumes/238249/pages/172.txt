Dr. J. Shirley, F.M.S., exhibited specimens of Arcidfe
from the following localities : â€” Area mosanibicana Bianconi,
Solomon Islands ; A. nigra Lamy, Moreton Bay, usually
reported as A. tenehrica; A. scaplm, Moreton Bay; A.

of Nyctimene tryoni, a new species of Megachiroptera,
secured by Mr. D. Lahey at Canungra, South Queensland,
and described in the Memoirs of the Queensland INIuseum,

so far south of previous records for the genus was of special
interest.

Hcdypnois polymorphs Linn., a Mediterranean plant found
as a naturalised alien near Brisbane by Mr. F. F. Coleman ;
Cidioriurn, intyhus Linn., the Chicory, and Carthamus
lanatus Linn., the Saffron Thistle, both naturalised in
Queensland for some years past but only now showing a
tendency to become bad weeds; and Lamium amplexicaule
Linn.. Henbit or Dead Nettle, with which feeding experi-
ments have recently been conducted in New South Wales
showing the plant to be capable of causing the disease
popularly known in Australia as "Staggers" or "Shivers."
As yet the last-mentioned example is not a very common
weed in Queensland.
