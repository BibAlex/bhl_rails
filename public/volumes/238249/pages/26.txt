PRICKLY PEAR AS STOCK FEED. SMITH.
21
On the basis of butter-fat production, Woodward, Turner.
and Griffiths found that, for 0. Qommei and 0. cyanella, one
part digestible nutrients of sorghum hay equalled 1-4 parts
digestible nutrients prickly pear when fed in medium amount ;
while when fed in high amount the value of the priokly pear
was 33 per cent, lower.
•
As milk is generally valued as a commodity on butter-fat
content, the butter-fat basis is no doubt the best on which to
evaluate the feeds. If compared on the basis of milk produced,
having no regard to fat content, the comparative values of
prickly pear and hay will be slightly more favourable to prickly
pear. In terms of weights of the feeds, 1 lb. of chaffed Soudan
grass hay in rations for milch cows is equal in value to 5 to
6 lb. of succulent prickly pear (85 per cent, water content)
when the prickly pear is fed in medium amount, and to 8 lb.
when fed in high amounts.
The Influence of Prickly Pear on Composition of
Milk.
Feeding prickly pear reduces the fat content of the milk ;
generally the higher the amount fed, the greater the reduction.
(Table 10.) Table 14 gives the fat percentage of the milk of
individual cows receiving various feeds in the course of the trials.
Table 15 also shows the effect of prickly pear by comparing
the fat content of the milk of individuals just before and
after changes of roughages ;—
