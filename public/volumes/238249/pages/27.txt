A similar reduction of butter-fat content was shown to
attend the feeding of prickly pear in the Brownsville trials (9).
As already shown, the inclusion of prickly pear in the
ration of dairy cows does not influence the percentage of solids-
not-fat of the milk.
The Influence of Prickly Pear on the Quality of
THE Product.
No characteristic flavour was found to be imparted to the
milk of the cows by feeding prickly pear. Tested for keeping
properties in comparison with milk produced on hay roughage,
no distinction could be drawn with regard to the rate or con-
dition of souring of the samples. The cream from the milk
of prickly pear fed cows could be chuiaied without difficulty.
The butter, in contrast to the highly coloured product obtained
by Woodward, Turner, and Grifliths, was *paler than that
produced on the hay roughage. It was judged by the Govern-
ment dairy expert to be not inferior to the butter produced by
hay fed cows.
The milk of prickly pear fed cows seemed to be entirely
suitable for cheesemaking. The time of coagulation was
normal, and the curd displayed no property that would be
unfavourable to manufacture.
The Suitability of Prickly Pear as a Roughage for
Dairy Cows.
Prickly pear is an entirely wholesome roughage for dairy
cows, and can be safely fed for considerable periods. All the
