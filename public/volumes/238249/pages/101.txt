results Avill not necessarily te obtained in our Western areas
as in Brisbane. It might be expected, for example, that
maggots would pupate to a much larger extent in the wool,
and beneath the carcass of a dead sheep (where they would be
accessible to the chalcid), than they would in less protected
places, such as under a piece of dry meat.^ Experiments
carried out with rather large surfaces, such as sheep's heads
spht down the centre to produce greater areas for protection,
indicate that this does not make much difference. In view
of the unfavourable results to be described, obtained locally
Mith Na-sonia, it seems at least worth while to repeat the
experiments with various species of larvae under sheep-country
conditions during different portions of the year.
In January, 1921 (i.e. during the hottest part of the year),
Lucilia sericata and Sarcophaga spp. were allowed to infect
meat placed on dry soil. The experiment was carried out in
the shade. After the maggots had ceased feeding the meat
had to a great extent disappeared, only the fibrous portion
remaining and producing an excellent shelter for pupating
maggots. Different layers of the underlying soil were then
removed and the pupae in eacli laj'er counted, the following
results being obtained : —

1 J. L. Froggatt (1919, p. 260) has stated that it is generally amongst
llie pupae of P. riifijacies and to a less extent P. varipes that Nasonia
is actually found to woik in the field, this being due largely to the habits
of the larvae of these particular species, which usually pupate under the
edge of the carcass remains or on the hones, mooI, etc., instpfirl of crawling
away as the maggots of other blowflies do.
