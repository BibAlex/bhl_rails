entire hay roughage. Under circumstances where the
accompanying depression of butter- fat content is not important,
the inclusion of the succulent in the dietar}^ of medium-pelding
dairy cows would be an advantage.
PART III.— PRICKLY PEAR IN THE MAINTENANCE
OF SHEEP.
Cacti, cut by the machettes of ranchmen, in conjunction
with browse afforded by edible bush, are reported to be service-
able as a drought feed for sheep in Texas, while the succulence
of the plants in the Mexican desert is said to enable flocks
to remain as long as sixty days un watered (2). Locally O.
inermis in pasture has been regarded as of no value as sheep
feed, the animals either being injured by the prickle or becoming
addicted to fruit-eating with fatal results. The object of the
experimentation with sheep was to determine the value of
prickly pear as a maintenance feed when fed after preparation.
Experimental.
The sheep utilised were lightly woolled store six-tooth
ewes, crossbreds or merinos. The prickly pear was of 83-85
per cent, water content, sliced by machine and further finely
minced by hand implements. The prickly pear was variously
supplemented. The arrangement of the experiment is sh6wn

The total time for which the sheep were fed prickly pear
was five months.
The sheep were fed by groups in wooden troughs, and no
other feed was available than was given. The animals were
