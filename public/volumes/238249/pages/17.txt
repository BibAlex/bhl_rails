was deemed advisable to water the steers at least about each
fifth day. Certain of the animals given water each day were
found to drink from nil on cool days to 6 gallons per head
during hot spells. The animals offered water at intervals drank
freely.
As already shown, the administration of water has but
Httle effect on the consumption of prickly pear by beasts.
Nor is it apparent that watering is directly harmful. Although
scouring was more marked in the case of the six steers given
water daily for thirty days in the second maintenance trials,
it was apparently in no way harmful, and these made body
weight gains equal to those of the other animals. {See Tables
2 and 3.)
Prickly Pear — Forest and Scrub Growth.
The view has been held by some cattle-men that the
prickly pear sheltered by scrubs is more valuable and nutritious
than that occurring in open forest land. During the first
maintenance trials the scrub form was for a period substituted
for the ordinary forest growth. There was no indication that
the experimental animals made any discrimination when both
forms were placed before them in the feed-boxes. The two
forms have practically the same composition, are apparently
of equal feeding value, and were equally utiHsed in the feeding
trials (Table 7) :—

Cow Pear.
It is a matter of frequent observation that cattle agisted
on prickly pear are accustomed to browse certain plants,
commonly referred to as "cow pear," to the exclusion of those
adjacent. It has been assumed that the preference is on
account of distinguishing flavour or instinctive recognition of
greater nutritive value. The preferred plant is recognised by
