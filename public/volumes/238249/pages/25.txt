production of body-weight increase. Their method was essen-
tially to divide the weights or nutritive values of each feed
by the weight of butter-fat produced. For the production of
1 lb. of butter-fat they were thus able to show in the various
rations that a certain quantity of hay or prickly pear, pro-
portional to their values for production, and equal quantities
of grain were required.
By a similar method applied to the data for Groups 1 and
3 (Table 12), the author obtained the figures shown in Table

It was thought, however, that the roughages could be
better compared if the rations provided only for maintenance
and milk-production without body- weight increase, and the
figures were subsequently adjusted by subtraction from the
nutrients of the roughage feeds of amounts adequate to the
gains noted.* In addition, on the assumption that the nutrients
of the hay and meal were of equal value in the rations, the
slight inequalities of the quotients for meal have beer
smoothed out by conversion of the excess in one of the pair
of meal quotients to hay nutrients. By this method of pro-
cedure there were obtained the following results, which are
thought to be at least as accurate as those of Woodward,
Turner, and Griffiths, viz. : —
Prickly pear fed as sole roughage (high amounts), 7-32 lb.
starch equivalent prickly pear = 3-90 lb. starch
equivalent hay, or 1-88 lb. starch equivalent prickly
pear = 100 lb. starch equivalent hay.
Prickly pear fed as part roughage with hay (medium
amounts), 3-48 lb. starch equivalent prickly pear =
2-39 lb. starch equivalent hay; or 1-41 lb. starch
equivalent prickly pear =^ TOO lb. starch equivalent
hay.
* Viz., 3-0 starch equivalent for 1 lb. body-weight increase (6, p. 198).
