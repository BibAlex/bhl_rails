Abstract of Proceedings, 26th September, 1921.
The Ordinary Monthly ^Meeting of the Society was held
in the Geology Lecture Theatre of the University at 8 p.m.
on Monday, 26th September, 1921.
The President, :\Ir. C. T. White, F.L.S., in the chair.
The minutes of the previous monthly meeting were read
and confirmed.
:\Iiss B. Ludgate, B.A., and Mr. W. B. Alexander, M.A.,
were nominated for ordinary membership.
Dr. E. 0. ^larks exhibited a stone tomahawk found in
alluvium at Bulimba Point, Brisbane, at a depth of 3 ft.
6 in. below the surface. Messrs. Bryan, Bennett, and

]\lr. 11. A. Longman, F.L.S., exhibited mandibles of
Phascolonus gigas and Euryzygoma {Nototherium) dunense.
In view of the discussion of species of Nototherium by Scott
and Lord (Pr. Roy. Soc. Tas., 1921, p. 2) and their earlier
association of De Vis' dune use with Phascolonus, as
criticised by the exhibitor (Longman, 2Iem. Qld. Mus., vii,
pt. 2, 1921, p. 77), these fossil marsupial mandibles were
shown side by side. Not only are the dental characters
totally distinct, but the large ectocrotaphyte depression and
the as-sociated external ridge readily distinguish all
Phasco]o»iyid(e from Euryzygoma du)i€)ise, which is the

The exhibit was discussed by Mr. Bryan and Dr. Marks.
Mr. H. A. Longman communicated a paper by Mr.
