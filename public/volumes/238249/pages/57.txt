Brauer and Bergenstamm (1891) used the name S. aurifera
Maeq. but we suspect it to be an error for S. mirifrons. At
any rate it is a mere nomen nudum as used by these two authors.
Walker (1849) added the names of four species to the list,
viz., (9) S. impatiens, (10) 8. misera. (11) S. irrequieta, and
(12) S. prcedafrix. The type specimens of all four species are
in the British Museum and are females labelled as having
been collected in Sydney, New Holland, Houtman's Abrolhos
(West Australia), and Port Essington (Northern Territory)
respectively. We are now able to give full accounts of the
first three of Walker's species, but the fourth is not represented
in our collection.
Thomson in 1868 described two Sarcophagids collected
by the " Eugenie" naturalists in Sydney, viz., (13) S. ochri-
palpis and (14) S. pallichrus. The former was stated to be
near S. aurata, a species described by Macquart (locality,
? Oceania) ; but we have regarded it as a synonym of S. irre-
quieta. S. pallichrus, Avhich Van der Wulp placed tentatively
in his genus Sarcophagula (1887), is not represented in our
collection.
There do not appear to be any more references to the
group until 1891, when Olliff and Skuse named two parasites
of grasshoppers as (15) Tachina osdipoda and (16) Masicera
packyiili respectively. Olliff referred to the latter and pub-
lished a figure of it (1891a), the illustration being republished
by Mackinnon (1920). The species was subsequently stated by
Froggatt (1905, 1907) to be a Sarcophaga. Tachina oedipoda
is a nomen nudum as far as Olliff- (1891b) is concerned, but
Froggatt (1905, 1907) has reported it to be a Sarcophaga,
closely related to S. aurifrons. The status of these two flies
bred from locusts can only be determined by an examination
of the type material.
Certain specimens collected in Brisbane and forwarded
by Mr. Froggatt (1907) to Coquillet for determination were
reported to be (17) S. frontalis. Owing to Mr. Froggatt's
kindness we have been able to synonymise Thomson's species
with Walker's S. misera. Besides, the name frontalis is pre-
occupied, having been employed by Doleschall in 1858.
Information relating to S. aurifrons was published by
Mr. Froggatt in 1905, 1907, and in 1915.
