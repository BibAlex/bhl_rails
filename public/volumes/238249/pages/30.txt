The amount of digestible protein in the average prickly
pear ration in Experiment 1 was -01 lb. ; the amounts in
Experiments 2 to 5 ranged from •OS to •09 lb. ; in Experiments
6 to 10, -09 lb. The gains shown are the averages in the groups ;
at the same time it was apparent that some sheep did better
than others. The differences would be accounted for by
differences in appetite for prickly pear. Two sheep in Experi-
ment 2 and one in Experiment 3 ate so Uttle prickly pear that
it was necessary to remove them to other feed.
The proportion of the total nutrients furnished by prickly
pear in Experiments 2 to 5 was about 50 per cent. ; in Experi-
ments 6 to 10, 40 to 50 per cent.
The average rations in Experiments 2 to 5 were sufficient
to enable the sheep to maintain their condition. In Experi-
ments 6 to 10 the sheep did less well owing to the lower appetite
displayed for prickly pear.
The Appetite of Sheep for Prickly Pear.
Prickly pear is indifferently palatable to sheep. It was
found that as the amounts of supplementary feeds were
increased the amount of prickly pear consumed was pro-
