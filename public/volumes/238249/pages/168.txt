Abstract of Proceedings, 25th July, 1921.
The Ordinary Monthly Meeting of the Royal Society
of Queensland was held in the Geology Lecture Theatre of
the University on 25th July, 1921, at 8 p.m.
The President, Mr. C. T. White, F.L.S., in the chair.
The minutes of the previous monthly meeting were read
and confirmed.
i\Ir. C. L. Thompson, B.D.Sc, was elected an Ordinary
Member. Misses E. Muir and C. Moxon and xMr. F. W.
Whitehouse were elected as Associates.
Dr. J. Shirley, F.M.S., exhibited species of Tijphohia,
Keymondia, Litlioglyphus, Syrnolopsis, &c., from Lake
Tanganyika. It was pointed out that these shells, with a
marine faeies, were absent from Lakes Victoria and Albert
Nyanza and Nyassa, though similar species inhabit Lake
Mweru to the west. The likelihood of geological formations
containing these shells being regarded as of marine origin
was also stressed.
]Mr. H. A. Longman, F.L.S.. exhibited the malformed
hoof of a horse from Beerburrum, which had been donated
to the Queensland Museum by Mr. T. B. Tripcony. The
proximal, medium, and distal phalangeal bones were in
pairs, whilst the hoof itself was tripartite, the median seg-
ment being very small. The specimen is of considerable
interest as probably illustrating a reversion to an ancestral
condition.
Mr. C. T. White, F.L.S., exhibited speci-uens ofâ€” (1)
Bassia lanuginosa C.T.W., from sandstone country near the
junction of the Mayne and Diamantina Rivers. The species,
which is closely allied to the West Australian B. carnosa
F.v.jM., is characterised by exceptionally long silky hairs
covering the perianth. (2) Heliotropium indicum Linn.
This plant was recorded by F. v. Mueller in the Second
