points converging towards each other. A moderately developed
connecting membrane present. Accessory plate brown, hairy.
First joint of penis dark brown ; second somewhat like that
of Sarcophaga froggatti, though more elongated.
Described from one male, caught on decaying meat in
Brisbane, April 1921.
This species is distingufshed irom all other Sarcophagids
known to us by the above-mentioned very prominent excres-
cences on the head. As all the remaining external characters
are of the ordinary Sarcophaga type, we are placing this form
in a new subgenus Parasarcophaga which may be provisionally
diagnosed as follows : — Male : General characters as in Sarco-
phaga ; but frontal stripe about three times the width of the
parafrontals whereas in the males of Sarcophaga it is seldom
more than twice ; frontal stripe developed into a very large
lobed prominence forming an arch around the mesofacial
plate. Type species, Parasarcophaga omega.
