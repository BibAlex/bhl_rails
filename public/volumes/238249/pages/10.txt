FOREWORD.
In 1916-17 the author investigated the value as stock feed
of the common pest pear {0. inermis) for 'the Queensland
Government at WaUumbilla, Maranoa district. There was
subsequently published by the Department of Agriculture
a popular bulletin* in which the main conclusions of the
investigation were set forth. Experimental data bearing on
the value of the common pest pear have, however, not pre\4ously
appeared.
The author is indebted to the Minister for Agriculture
(Hon. W. N. GiUies) for permission to make the basis of this
paper his technical manuscrij)t dealing A\ith the WaUumbilla
experiments in possession of the department. The short
description of the feeding trials is derived from, and the tabu-
lated data upon which the conclusions here advanced are
founded are reproduced by permission from the manuscript
referred to.
