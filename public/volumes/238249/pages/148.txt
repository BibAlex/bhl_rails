FRESHWATER FISH EPIDEMICS IN QUEENSLAND RIVERS. 191
(i) Thomson River. — Longreach recoids for 1917 shew that
June and July of that year were both colder and drier than in
the average year (2-7° and 67 points less for June; 11° and
77 points less for July). An outbreak occurred in July. The
lowest minima recorded during June and July were 32-2° on
22nd June and 35-5 on 5th July. Thus, although both months
were colder and drier than usual, the thermometer reached
freezing jDoint only once. We are not aware of the condition
of the river prior to the outbreak.
The outbreak which occurred in March 1918 can scarcely
have had any dependence on the temj)erature. The record3
again shew that it was colder (by 4-7°) and drier (140 points less)
than the average, but the lowest minimum recorded \\'as only
51°, viz., on 18th March.
The rainy season had begun early in November 1917.
The Thomson was in high flood during part of January and
February 1918, and was still running when the outbreak began
in March {vide Mr. Mill's letter of 30th March), there being no
stagnant water at the time.
June 1918 was again colder and drier (2-3° and 85 points
less) than the average, wliile the lowest minimum (35-2°)
occurred on the 28th. In July, hoAvever, a more decided cold
snajD was experienced ; for the nine days following 8th July
the minimum records were consistently low, culminating in
three nights of frost — 28-5° on the loth, 27° (lowest recorded)
on the 16th, and 31-7° on the 17th. After this no further
frosts Avere experienced.
No rain fell in the district during May, June, or July, so
that the river was fairl}^ low when the outbreak began at the end
of July. The epidemic Avas at its height during the first AA'eek in
August and had abated completely by the middle of the tliird
Aveek. ShoAAcrs of rain yielding 45 points fell on 3rcl and 4th
of August. During September 1918 no rain fell. The minimum
temperature fell to 36° on the 5th, this being the loAvest for the
month, though the three succeeding days experienced 'oav
minima.
An outbreak occurred during the latter half of December
1918, extending into early Januar}^ 1919 (midsummer), Avhen
the temperatures Avere certainly not Ioav. It Avas a A-ery dry
period and ;he Avater Avas stagnant. Another made its appear-
ance in July and early August 1919, but particulars as to the
AA'eather are not in our possession.
