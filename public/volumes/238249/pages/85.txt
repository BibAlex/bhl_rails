The spider can be artificially fed by holding a moth to the
hanging globule, to which it can be transfixed by the slightest
contact. Occasionally the. filament and globule will be drawn
n\) and another manufactured. The spider will ignore a moth
wliich is artificially pla^ced along its lines, and apparently its
one method of catching them is by the filament and globule.
The moth is as helpless when touched by the globule as is a fly
on fly-paper. When the insect is secured on the sticky globule
it is pulled up, and apparently killed by an injection of venom ;
it is then neatly bound in a little bundle, leisurely placed in
line with the spider"s head and there held and sucked, the wings
being ultimately discarded.
Probably the study of allied species will reveal other
stages in the evolution of this curious habit. Cehenia excavafa,
A\hich makes small spherical cocoons, is also without a web.
