FRESHWATER FISH EPIDEMICS IN QUEENSLAND RIVERS. 187
in the Severn (Dumaresq) and Mclntyre Rivers on the southern
border of Queensland. These rivers rorm part of the Barwon or
Darling River system. Three rivers flowing east f om the
Great Dividing Range were affected though not very seriously —
viz., the Brisbane and Mary in the A^inter of 1917 and the
Burnett in 1918.
We may note that the outstanding features of the epidemic
w^ere as follows : —
(a) The species especially affected were the golden
perch or yellow-belly {Plectrojylites ambiguus),
the freshw'ater black bream or grunters {Therapon
spp.), Murra}^ cod or perch (Oligoriis macquarlce),
and bony bream {Nematalosa elongata), and jeAV-
fish or catfish (various species of Siluridce).
{b) It usually occurred during the colder and drier
portion of the year, July and August, though
sometimes earlier and often persisting later.
(c) The water Avas nearly always stagnant and the
epidemic ceased suddenly, after heavy rains had
caused the rivers to flow.
{d) The affected fish Avere always fat ; they became
lethargic, sAvam sIoavI}- at the surface of the Avater,
and died. A bluish colour Avas commonlj^ seen
in the mouth region.
POSSIBLE CAUSES.
1. The use of dynamite or other explosive.
2. Chmatic —
(a) Dry AAeather ;
(6) LoAv temperature.
3. State of the Avater —
(a) Physically, i.e. presence of suspended matter or
Aveeds AA'hich might clog fish-gills ;
(6) Ciiemically, e.g. excess of carbon dioxide, defi-
ciency of oxygen, acidity or alkalinity, etc.
4. Poisoning due to the presence of some toxic subs+ance
in the Avater.
5. Overstocking and consequent ^tarA^ation.
