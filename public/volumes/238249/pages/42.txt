1.— INTRODUCTION.
To the Australian, the native wattles, forming his national
emblem, possess a sentimental interest. To the general
botanist they are none the less interesting, presenting striking
peculiarities in their adaptation to climate. Many species
use their flattened leafstalks or phyllodes to play the part of
leaves after the seedling stage is jjassed, and these phyllodes
bear stomata in almost equal number on both surfaces. The
colour attraction for insects is found in the filaments of the
stamens and not in the petals. The stamens may have eight
spherical chambers for the protection of jaoUen, instead of the
four usually present in flowering plants ; and there are no
arrangements for protecting the pollen from rain or dew.
Another peculiarity is the propagation of many species by
means of root-cuttings.
