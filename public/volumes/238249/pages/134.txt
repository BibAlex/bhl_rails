LARVAL AND PUPAL STAGES, MYZORHYNCHUS BANCROFTI. 173
Taylor was working with a species of which, except for the
female, little else was loiown. He is further of opinion that,
now we are in a position to compare larval forms of both
mosquitoes, and having already made a comparison with the
brief intelligence he could glean from Theobold's Monograph
of the Culicidse of the World (iii, p. 86), relating to larval
barbirostris, there is every reason for rejecting Taylor's
synonymy on the differences observed in frontal hairs
(p. 18 I.e. fig. 4f) and palmate hairs alone. Theobold's
descriptions are unfortunateh^ too brief, nor has the writer
been able to obtain any other literature on the subject of
larval forms of M. barbirostris. Nevertheless, it is only
reasonable to conclude on the transmutation hypothesis
that, when obvious differences are manifested in two larvae,
the imagines resulting from these forms will be more or less
different.
