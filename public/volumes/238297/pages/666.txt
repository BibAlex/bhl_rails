176 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
into an infinite number of rays, which form a hollow
cone within the crystal, and a hollow cylinder when
emerging from the opposite side. In another case, a
somewhat different, but equally strange, effect is pro-
duced. These phenomena are peculiarly interesting,
because cones and cylinders of light are not produced in
any other cases. They are, in fact, wholly opposed to all
analogy, and constitute singular, or exceptional cases, of
a kind which we shall afterwards have to consider more
fully. Their very strangeness rendered them peculiarly
fitted to test the truth of the theory by which they were
discovered; and when Professor Lloyd, at Hamilton's
request, succeeded, after considerable difficulty, in wit-
nessing the new appearances, no further doubt could
remain of the validity of the great theory of waves, which
we owe to Huyghens, Young, and FresneK
Predictions from the Theory of Undulations.
It is curious to reflect that the undulations of light,
although so inconceivably rapid and small, admit of more
accurate observation and measurement than the waves of
any other medium. But so far as we can carry out exact
experiments on other kinds of waves, we find the phe-
nomena of interference repeated, and analogy gives con-
siderable powers of prediction. Sir John Herschel was
perhaps the first to suggest that two sounds might be
made to destroy each other by interference s . For if one-
half of a wave travelling through a tube could be sepa-
rated, and conducted by a somewhat longer passage, so as,
on rejoining the other half, to be one-quarter of a vibra-
