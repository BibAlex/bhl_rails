as regards the earth.
Tides are vast waves, and were the earth's surface
entirely covered by an ocean of uniform depth, they would
admit of very exact theoretical investigation. The wholly
irregular form of the several seas introduces unknown
quantities and complexities with which theory cannot cope.
Nevertheless, Whewell, observing that the tides of the
German Ocean consist of interfering waves, which arrive
partly round the north of Scotland and partly through
the British Channel, was enabled to predict that at a point
about midway between Lowestoft and Brill on the coast
of Holland, in latitude 52 27' N, and longitude 3 h.
1 4m. E, no tides would be found to exist. At that point
the two waves would be of exactly the same amount, but
in opposite phases, so as to neutralise each other. This
assertion was verified by a surveying vessel of the British
navy - v .

Generations, or even centuries, will probably elapse
before mankind are in possession of a mathematical theory
of the constitution of matter as complete and satisfactory
as the theory of gravitation. Nevertheless, mathema-
tical physicists have in recent years acquired a fair hold
of some of the simple relations of the physical forces to
matter, and the proof is found in some remarkable anti-
cipations of curious phenomena which had never been
observed. Professor James Thomson deduced from Car-
not's theory of heat that the application of pressure would
lower the melting-point of ice. He even ventured to
assign the amount of this effect, and his statement was
