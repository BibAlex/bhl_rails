ACCORDANCE OF QUANTITATIVE THEORIES, <bc. 199
explanation of the discrepancy may be accomplished in
any one of at least four distinct ways, as follows :
(1) The direct measurement may be erroneous owing to
various sources of casual error.
(2) The theory may be correct so far as regards the
general form of the supposed laws, but some of the con-
stant numbers or other quantitative data employed in the
theoretical calculations may be inaccurate.
(3) The theory may be false, in the sense that the
forms of the mathematical equations assumed to express
the laws of nature are incorrect.
(4) The theory and the involved quantities may be
approximately accurate, but some regular unknown cause
may have interfered, so that the divergence may be re-
garded as a residual effect representing possibly a new
and interesting phenomenon.
No precise rules can be laid down as to the best mode
of proceeding to explain the divergence, and the experi-
mentalist will have to depend upon his own insight and
knowledge ; but the following general recommendations
may perhaps be made.
In the first place, if the experimental measurements are
not numerous, repeat them and take a more extensive
mean result, the probable accuracy of which, as regards
freedom from casual errors of experiment, will increase as
the square root of the number of experiments. Supposing
that no considerable modification of the result is thus
effected, we may suspect the existence of some more deep-
seated and constant source of error in our method of
measurement. The next resource will be to change the
size and form of the apparatus employed, and to introduce
various modifications in the materials employed or in the
course .of procedure, in the hope, as before explained
(vol. i. p. 462), that some cause of constant error may thus
be removed. If the inconsistency with theory still re-
