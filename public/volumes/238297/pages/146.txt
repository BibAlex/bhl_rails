120 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
examined ; not only may the requisite labour become
formidable, but a considerable chance of mistake may
arise. I have therefore given much attention to modes
of facilitating the work, and have succeeded in reducing
the method to an almost mechanical form. It soon
appeared obvious that if the conceivable combinations
of the abecedarium, for any number of letters, instead
of being printed in fixed order on a piece of paper or
slate, were marked upon light moveable pieces of wood,
mechanical arrangements could readily be devised for
selecting the combinations in any required order. The
labour of comparison and rejection might thus be im-
mensely reduced. This idea was first carried out in the
Logical Abacus, which I have found useful in the lecture-
room for exhibiting the complete solution of logical
problems. A minute description of the construction and
use of the abacus, together with figures of the parts, has
already been given in my essay called The Substitution of
Similars 8, and I will here give only a general description.
The abacus consists of a common school black-board
placed in a sloping position and furnished with four
horizontal and equi-distant ledges. The combinations of
the letters shown in the first four columns of the abece-
darium (see p. 109), are printed in somewhat large type,
so that each letter is about an inch from the neighbour-
ing one, but the letters are placed one above the other
instead of being in horizontal lines as in p. 109. Each
combination of letters is separately fixed to the surface
of a thin slip of wood one inch broad and about one-
eighth inch thick. Short steel pins are then driven in an
inclined position into the wood. When a letter is a large
capital representing a positive term, the pin is fixed in
the upper part of its space ; when the letter is a small
