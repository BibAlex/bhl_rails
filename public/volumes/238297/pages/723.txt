CHARACTER OF THE EXPERIMENTALIST. 233
evidence ; indeed the more a man loves his theory, the
more scrupulous should be his attention to its faults.
Nothing is more common in life than to meet with some
theorist, who, by long cogitation over a single theory, has
allowed it to mould his mind, and render him incapable of
receiving anything but as a contribution to the truth of
his one theory. A narrow and intense course of thought
may sometimes lead to great results, but the adoption of
a wrong theory at the outset is in such a mind irretriev-
able. The man of one idea has but a single chance of
truth. The fertile discoverer, on the contrary, chooses
between many theories, and is never wedded to any one,
unless impartial and repeated comparison has convinced
him of its validity. He does not choose and then
compare ; but he compares time after time, and then
chooses.
Having once deliberately chosen, the philosopher may
rightly entertain his theory with the strongest love and
fidelity. He will neglect no objection ; for he may chance
at any time to meet a fatal one ; but he will bear in mind
the inconsiderable powers of the human mind compared
with the tasks it has to undertake. He will see that no
theory can at first be reconciled with all possible objec-
tions, simply because there may be many interfering causes,
or the very consequences of the theory may have a com-
plexity which prolonged investigation by successive gene-
rations of men may not exhaust. If then, a theory exhibit
a number of very striking coincidences with fact, it must
not be thrown aside until at least one conclusive dis-
cordance is proved, regard being had to possible error in
establishing that discordance. In science and philosophy
something must be risked. He who quails at the least
difficulty will never establish a new truth, and it was
not unphilosophic in Leslie to remark concerning his
own experimental investigations into the nature of heat
