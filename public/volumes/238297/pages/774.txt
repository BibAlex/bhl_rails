284 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
chord, the Sages of Thebes, and the Gates of Thebes, but
it does not extend beyond the fact that they were all
seven in number. Between the most discrete notions, as,
for instance, those of time and space, analogy may exist,
arising from the fact that the mathematical conditions of
the lapse of time and of motion along a line are similar.
There is no identity of nature between a word and the
thing it signifies ; the substance iron is a heavy solid,
the word iron is either a momentary disturbance of the
air, or a film of black pigment on white paper ; but there
is analogy between words and their significates. The
substance iron is to the substance iron-carbonate, as the
name iron is to the name iron-carbonate, when these names
are used according to their correct scientific definitions.
The whole structure of language and the whole utility of
signs, marks, symbols, pictures, and representations of
various kinds, rest upon analogy. I may, perhaps, hope
to enter fully upon this important subject at some future
tune, and to attempt to show how the invention of signs
enables us to express, guide, and register our thoughts.
It will be sufficient to observe here that the use of words
constantly involves analogies of a subtle kind ; we should
often be at a loss how to describe a notion, were we not
at liberty to employ in a metaphorical sense the name of
anything sufficiently resembling it. There would be no
expression for the sweetness of a melody, or the brilliance
of an harangue, unless it were furnished by the taste of
honey and the brightness of a torch.
A very cursory examination of the cases in which we
popularly use the word analogy, shows that it includes all
degrees of resemblance or similarity. The analogy may
consist only in similarity of number or ratio ; or in like
relations of time or space. It may also consist in more
simple resemblance between physical properties. We
should not be using the word inconsistently with custom,
