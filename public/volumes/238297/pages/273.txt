THE THEORY OF PROBABILITY. 247
relations exceeding our powers of treatment. The infinitely
intricate action of the mind often intervenes and renders
complete analysis hopeless. If, for instance, the probability
that a marksman shall hit the target in a single shot be
i in 10, we might seem to have no difficulty in calculating
the probability of any succession of hits ; thus the proba-
bility of three successive hits would be one in a thousand.
But, in reality, the confidence and experience derived from
the first successful shot would render a second success
more probable. The events are not really independent,
and there would generally be a far greater preponderance
of runs of apparent luck, than a simple calculation
of probabilities could account for. In many persons,
however, a remarkable series of successes will produce a
degree of excitement rendering continued success almost
impossible.
Attempts to apply the theory of probabilities to the
results of judicial proceedings have proved of little value,
simply because the conditions are far too intricate. As
Laplace said, g 'Tant de passions, d'interets divers et de
circonstances compliquent les questions relatives a ces
objets, qu'elles sont presque toujours insolubles.' Men
acting on a jury, or giving evidence before a court, are
subject to so many complex influences that no mathema-
tical formulae can be framed to express the real conditions.
Jurymen or even judges on the bench cannot be regarded
as acting independently, with a definite probability in
favour of each delivering a correct judgment. Each man
of the jury is more or less influenced by the opinion of the
others, and there are subtle effects of character and manner
and strength of mind which defy human analysis. Even
in physical science we shall in comparatively few cases be
able to apply the theory in a definite manner, because the
