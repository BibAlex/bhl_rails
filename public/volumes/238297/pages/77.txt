PROPOSITIONS. 51
Spalding d distinctly says that the proposition ' all metals
are minerals' might be described as an assertion of partial
identity between the two classes. Hence the name which
I have adopted for the proposition.
Limited Identities.
A highly important class of propositions have the
general form
AB = AC,
expressing the identity of the class AB with the class AC.
In other words, ' Within the sphere of the class of things
A, all the B's are all the C's/ or < The B's and C's, which
are A's, are identical/ But it will be observed that nothing
is asserted concerning things which are outside of the
class A ; and thus the identity is of limited extent. It is
the proposition B = C limited to the sphere of the class A.
Thus if we say ' Plants are devoid of locomotive power/
we must limit the statement to large plants, since minute
microscopic plants often have very remarkable powers of
motion. When we say * Metals possess metallic lustre/ we
mean in their uncombined state.
A barrister may make numbers of most general state-
ments concerning the relations of persons and things in
the course of an argument, but it is of course to be under-
stood that he speaks only of persons and things under the
English Law. Even mathematicians make statements
which are not true with absolute generality. They say
that imaginary roots enter into equations by pairs ; but
this is only true under the tacit condition that the
equations in question shall not have imaginary coefficients. 6
