THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Natural History, is wholly unsuited to the purposes of
science. But of course when records relate to past events
like eclipses, conjunctions, meteoric phenomena, earth-
quakes, volcanic eruptions, changes of sea margins, the
existence of now extinct animals, the migrations of tribes,
floods, &c., we must depend upon traditions or records,
however unsatisfactory, and must endeavour to verify the
statements by the comparison of independent records.
When extensive series of observations have to be made,
as in astronomical, meteorological, or magnetical observa-
tories, trigonometrical surveys, and extensive chemical or
physical researches, it is an advantage that the numerical
estimations and records should be executed by assistants
who are not interested in, and are perhaps unaware of, the
expected results. The record is thus rendered perfectly
impartial. It may even be desirable that those who per-
form the purely routine work of measurement and com-
putation should be unacquainted with the principles of
the subject. The great table of logarithms of the French
Kevolutionary Government was worked out by a staff of
sixty or eighty computers, most of whom were acquainted
only with the rules of arithmetic, and worked under the
direction of skilled mathematicians ; yet their calculations
were usually found more correct than those of persons
more deeply versed in mathematics 11 . In the Indian
Ordnance Survey the actual measurers have been selected
so that they shall not have sufficient skill to falsify their
results without detection.
Both passive observation and experimentation must,
however, be generally conducted by persons who know
for what they are to look. It is only when excited and
guided by the hope of verifying a theory that the ob-
server will notice many of the most important points ;
and, where the work is not of a routine character, no
