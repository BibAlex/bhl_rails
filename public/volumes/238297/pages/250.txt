CHAPTEB X.
THEORY OF PROBABILITY.
THE subject upon which we now enter must not be
regarded as an isolated and curious branch of speculation.
It is the necessary basis of nearly all the judgments
and decisions we make in the prosecution of science, or
the conduct of ordinary affairs. As Butler truly said,
4 Probability is the very guide of life/ Had the science of
numbers been developed for no other purposes, it must
have been developed for the calculation of probabilities.
All our inferences concerning the future are merely pro-
bable, and a due appreciation of the degree of probability
depends entirely upon a due comprehension of the prin-
ciples of the subject. , I conceive that it is impossible
even to expound the principles and methods of induction
as applied to natural phenomena, in a sound manner, with-
out resting them upon the theory of probability. Perfect
knowledge alone can give certainty, and in nature perfect
knowledge would be infinite knowledge, which is clearly
beyond our capacities. We have, therefore, to content our-
selves with partial knowledge knowledge mingled with
ignorance, producing doubt. ( t
Almost the greatest difficulty in this subject consists in
acquiring a precise notion of the matter treated. What
is it that w r e number, and measure, and calculate in the
theory of probabilities ? Is it belief, or opinion, or doubt,
or knowledge, or chance, or necessity, or want of art ?
