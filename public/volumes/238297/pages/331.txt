principles of physical astronomy. Front's Law bears more
probability because it would bring the constitution of the
elements themselves in close connexion with the atomic
theory, representing them as built up out of a simpler
substance.
In historical and social matters, coincidences are fre-
quently pointed out which are due to chance, although
there is always a strong popular tendency to regard them
as the work of design, or as having some hidden cause.
It has been pointed out that if to 1 794, the number of
the year in which Robespierre fell, we add the sum of its
digits, the result is 1815, the year in which Napoleon
fell; the repetition of the process gives 1830, the year
in which Charles the Tenth abdicated. Again, the French
Chamber of Deputies, in 1830, consisted of 402 members,
of whom 221 formed the party called, 'La queue de Robes-
pierre/ while the remainder, 181 in number, were named
* Les honnetes gens/ If we give to each letter a numerical
value corresponding to its place in the alphabet, it will
be found that the sum of the values of the letters in each
name exactly indicates the number of the party m .
A number of such coincidences, often of a very curious
character, might be adduced, and the probability against
the occurrence of each may be enormously great. They
must be attributed to chance, because they cannot be
shown to have the slightest connexion with the general
laws of nature ; but persons are often found to be greatly
influenced by such coincidences, regarding them as evidence
of fatality, that is of a system of causation governing
human affairs independently of the ordinary laws of nature.
Let it be remembered that there are an infinite number of
opportunities in life for some strange coincidence to pre-
sent itself, so that it is quite to be expected that remark-
able conjunctions will sometimes happen.
