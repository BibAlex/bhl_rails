26 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Beneke had employed the principle of substitution, and
had used the word itself in forming a theory of the
syllogism. My imperfect acquaintance with the German
language had prevented me from acquiring a complete
knowledge of Beneke's views, but there is no doubt
that Mr. Lindsay is right in saying that he, and probably
other previous logicians, were in some degree familiar
with the principle 8 . Even Aristotle's dictum may be
regarded as an imperfect statement of the principle of
substitution ; and, as I have pointed out, we have only
to modify that dictum in accordance with the quantifi-
cation of the predicate in order to arrive at the complete
process of substitution *. The Port-B-oyal logicians appear
to have entertained nearly equivalent views, for they
considered that all moods of the syllogism might be
reduced under one general principle u . Of two premises
they regard one as the containing proposition (propositio
continens), and the other as the applicative proposition.
The latter proposition must always be affirmative, and
represents that by which a substitution is made ; the
former may or may not be negative, and is that in
which a substitution is effected. They also show that
this method will embrace certain cases of complex reason-
ing which had no place in the Aristotelian syllogism.
Their views probably constitute the greatest improvement
in logical doctrine made up to that time since the days
of Aristotle. But a true reform in logic must consist,
not in explaining the syllogism in one way or another,
but in doing away with all the narrow restrictions of
the Aristotelian system, and in showing that there exists
