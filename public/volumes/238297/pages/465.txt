THE LA W OF ERROR. 439
arguments are satisfactory and conclusive. The law
adopted is chosen rather on the grounds of convenience
and plausibility, than because it can be seen to be the
true and necessary law. We can however approach the
subject from an entirely different point of view, and yet
get to the same result.
Let us assume that a particular observation is subject
to four chances of error, each of which will increase the
result one inch if it occurs. Each of these errors is to be
regarded as an event independent of the rest and we can
therefore assign, by the theory of probability, the com-
parative probability and frequency of each conjunction of
errors. From the Arithmetical Triangle (pp. 208, 213) we
learn that the ways of happening are as follows :
No error at all . . . i way.
Error of i inch . ... 4 ways.
Error of 2 inches . . .6 ways.
Error of 3 inches . .4 ways.
Error of 4 inches . . i way.
We may infer that the error of two inches is the most
likely to occur, and will occur in the long run in six cases
out of sixteen. Errors of one and three inches will be
equally likely, but will occur less frequently ; while no
error at all, or one of four inches will be a comparatively
rare occurrence. If we now suppose the errors to act as
often in one direction as the other, the effect will be to
alter the average error by the amount of two inches, and
we shall have the following results :
Negative error of 2 inches . . . i way.
Negative error of i inch . . .4 ways.
No error at all . . . . .6 ways.
Positive error of i inch . . .4 ways.
Positive error of 2 inches . . i way.
We may now imagine the number of causes of error
