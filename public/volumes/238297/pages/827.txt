EXCEPTIONAL PHENOMENA. 337
(muriatic acid) was found to contain no oxygen the theory
had to be relinquished. Berzelius' theory of the dual
formation of chemical compounds has met a similar
fate.
It is obvious that all conclusive experimenta crucis
constitute real exceptions to the supposed laws of the
theory which is overthrown. Newton's corpuscular theory
of light was not rejected on account of its absurdity or
inconceivability, for in these respects it is, as we have
seen, far superior to the undulatory theory. It was re-
jected because certain small diffraction fringes of colour
did not appear in the exact place and of the exact size
which calculation showed that they ought to appear
according to the conditions of the theory (vol. ii. pp. 145-
151). One single fact clearly irreconcilable with a theory
involves its total rejection. In the greater number of
cases, what appears to be a fatal exception, may be after-
wards explained away as a singular or disguised result of
the very laws with which it seems to conflict, or as due to
the interference of extraneous causes ; but if we fail thus
to reduce the fact to congruity, it remains more powerful
than any theories or any dogmas.
Of late years not a few of the favourite doctrines of
geologists have been rudely destroyed. It was the general
belief that human remains were to be found only in those
deposits which are actually in progress at the present day,
so that the creation of man appeared to have taken place
at the beginning, as it were, of this geological age. The
discovery of a single worked flint in older strata and in
connexion with the remains of extinct mammals was suf-
ficient to explode such a doctrine. Similarly, the opinions
of geologists have been altered by the discovery of the
Eozoon in the Laurentian rocks of Canada ; it was pre-
viously held that no remains of life occurred in any older
strata than those of the Silurian system. As the exami-
