THE INDUCTIVE OR INVERSE METHOD. 307
Summary of the Theory of Inductive Inference.
The theory of inductive inference adopted in this and
the previous chapter, was chiefly suggested by the study
of the Inverse Method of Probabilities, but it also bears
much resemblance to the so-called Deductive Method
described by Mr. J. S. Mill, in his well known 6 System of
Logic <i/ Mr. Mill's views concerning the Deductive Method,
probably form the most original and valuable part of his
treatise, and I should have ascribed the doctrine entirely
to him, had I not found that the opinions put forward in
other parts of his work are entirely inconsistent with the
theory here upheld. As this subject is the most impor-
tant and difficult one with which we have to deal, I will
try to remedy the imperfect manner in which I have
treated it, by giving a brief recapitulation of the views
adopted .
All inductive reasoning is but an inverse application
of deductive reasoning. Being in possession of certain
particular facts or events expressed in propositions, we
imagine some more general proposition expressing the
existence of a law or cause ; and, deducing the particular
results of that supposed general proposition, we observe
whether they agree with the facts in question. Hypo-
thesis is thus always employed, consciously or uncor/sci-
ously. The sole conditions to which we need conform in
framing any hypothesis is, that we both have and exercise
the power of inferring deductively from the hypothesis,
to the particular logical combinations or results, which are
to be compared with the known facts. Thus there are
but three steps in the process of induction :
(i) Framing of some hypothesis as to the character of
the general law.
