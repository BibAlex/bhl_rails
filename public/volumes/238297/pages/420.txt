circumpolar star, since the refractive power of the atmo-
sphere which affects only the altitude would thus be
entirely avoided f .
Astronomers also endeavour to render their clocks as
accurate as possible, by removing the source of variation.
The pendulum is perfectly isochronous so long as its
length remains invariable, and the vibrations are exactly
of equal length. They render it nearly invariable in
length, that is in the distance between the centres of
suspension and oscillation, by a compensatory arrangement
for the change of temperature. But as this compensation
may not be perfectly accomplished, some astronomers
place their chief controlling clocks in a cellar, or other
apartment, where the changes of temperature may be as
slight as possible. At the Paris Observatory a clock has
been placed in the caves beneath the building, where
there is no appreciable difference between the summer
and winter temperature.
To avoid the effect of unequal oscillations Huyghens
made his beautiful investigations, which resulted in the
discovery that a pendulum, of which the centre of oscil-
lation moved upon a cycloidal path, would be perfectly
isochronous, whatever the variation in the length of
oscillations. But though a pendulum may be rendered in
some degree cycloidal by the use of a steel suspension
spring, it is found that the mechanical arrangements
requisite to produce a truly cycloidal motion introduce
more error than they avoid. Hence astronomers seek to
reduce the error to the smallest amount by maintaining
their clock pendulums in uniform movement s ; and in
fact while a clock is in good order and has the same
weights, there need be little change in the length of
oscillation.
