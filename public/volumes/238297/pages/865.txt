CLASSIFICATION. 375
exhaustive classification in respect to the complexity of
the ratios forming them. P]ane rectilinear figures may
also be classified according to the number of their sides
as triangles, quadrilateral figures, pentagons, hexagons,
heptagons, &c. The bifurcate arrangement is not false
when applied to such series of objects ; it is even neces-
sarily involved in the arrangement which we do apply,
so that its formal statement is needless and tedious. The
same may be said of the division of portions of space.
Reid and Kames endeavoured to cast ridicule on the
bifurcate arrangement n by proposing to classify the parts
of England into Middlesex and what is not Middlesex,
dividing the latter again into Kent and what is not
Kent, the latter again into Sussex and what is not Sussex ;
and so on. This is so far, however, from being an
absurd proceeding that it is requisite to assure us that
we have made an exhaustive enumeration of the parts of
England.
The Five Predicates.
As a general rule it is highly desirable to consign to
oblivion all the ancient logical names and expressions,
which have infested the science for many centuries past.
If logic is ever to be a useful and progressive science,
logicians must distinguish between logic and the history
of logic. As in the case of any other science it may be
desirable to examine the course of thought by which logic
has, before or since the time of Aristotle, been brought
to its present state ; the history of a science is always
instructive as giving instances of the mode in which dis-
coveries take place. But at the same time we ought
carefully to disencumber the statement of the science
