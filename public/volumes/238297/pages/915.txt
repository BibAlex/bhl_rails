CLASSIFICATION. 425
be found that states of rnind really graduate into each
other, so that rigorous classification would prove to be
hopeless.
A little reflection will show that there are whole worlds
of existences which in like manner are incapable of
logical analysis and classification. One friend may be
able to single out and identify another friend by his
countenance among a million other countenances. Faces
are capable of infinite discrimination, but who shall
classify and define them, or say by what particular shades
of feature he does judge. There are of course certain
distinct types of face, but each type is connected with
each other type by infinite intermediate specimens. We
may classify melodies according to the major or minor
key, the character of the time, and some other distinct
points ; but every melody has independently of such cir-
cumstances its own distinctive character and effect upon
the mind. Similar remarks might be made concerning a
multitude of other circumstances. We can detect dif-
ferences between the styles of literary, musical, or artistic
compositions. We can even in some cases assign a picture
to its painter, or a symphony to its composer, by a subtle
feeling of resemblances or differences of character and
expression, which may be felt, but cannot be described.
Finally, it is apparent that in human character there is
unfathomable and inexhaustible diversity. Every mind
is more or less like every other mind ; there is always a
basis of similarity, but there is a superstructure of feelings,
impulses, or motives which is distinctive for each person.
We can often, indeed, predict the general character of the
feelings or actions which will be produced in a given
individual well known to us, by a given external event,
but we also know that we are often inexplicably at fault
in all our inferences. No one can safely generalize upon
the subtle variations of temper and emotion which may
