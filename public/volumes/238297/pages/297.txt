PHILOSOPHY OF INDUCTIVE INFERENCE. 271
Discrimination of Certainty and Probability in the
Inductive Process.
We can never recur too often to the truth that our
knowledge of the laws and future events of the external
world is only probable. The mind itself is quite capable
of possessing certain knowledge, and it is well to discri-
minate carefully between what we can and cannot know
with certainty. In the first place, whatever feeling is
actually present to the mind is certainly known to that
mind. If I see blue sky, I may be quite sure that I
do experience the sensation of blueness. Whatever I do
feel, I do feel beyond all doubt. We are indeed very
likely to confuse what we really feel with what we are
inclined to associate with it, or infer inductively from
it; but the whole of our consciousness, as far as it is
the result of pure intuition arid free from inference, is
certain knowledge beyond all doubt.
In the second place, we may have certainty of inference ;
the first axiom of Euclid, the fundamental laws of thought,
and the rule of substitution (p. n), are certainly true;
and if my senses could inform me that A was indistin-
guishable in colour from B, and B from C, then I should
be equally certain that A was indistinguishable from C.
In short, whatever truth there is in the premises, I can
certainly embody in their correct logical result. But
practically the certainty generally assumes a hypothetical
character. I never can be quite sure that two colours
are exactly alike, that two magnitudes are exactly equal,
or that two bodies whatsoever are identical even in their
apparent qualities. Almost all our judgments involve
quantitative relations, and, as will be shown in succeeding
chapters, we can never attain exactness and certainty
where continuous quantity enters. Judgments concerning
