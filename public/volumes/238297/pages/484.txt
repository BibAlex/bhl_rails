weight in our mean conclusions, and should bear in mind
the discrepancy as one demanding attention. To neglect j
a divergent result is to neglect the possible clue to a great
discovery.
Method of Least Squares.
When two or more unknown quantities are so involved
that they cannot be separately determined by the single
Method of Means, we can yet obtain their most probable
amounts by the Method of Least Squares, without more
difficulty than arises from the length of the arithmetical
computations. If the result of each observation gives an
equation between two unknown quantities of the form
ax + ~by c
then, if the observations were free from error, we should
only need two observations giving two equations ; but,
for the attainment of greater accuracy, we may take a
series of observations, and then reduce the equations so
as to give only a pair with average coefficients. This re-
duction, is effected by, firstly, multiplying the coefficients
of each equation by the first coefficient, and adding to-
gether all the similar coefficients thus resulting for the
coefficients of a new equation ; and secondly, by repeating
this process, and multiplying the coefficients of each equa-
tion by the coefficient of the second term. Thus meaning
by (sum of a 2 ) the sum of all quantities of the same kind,
and having the same place in the equations as a 2 , we
may briefly describe the two resulting mean equations
as follows :
(sum of cr) . x -f (sum of ab) . y (sum of ac),
(sum of ab) . x 4- (sum of b 2 ) . y = (sum of be).
When there are three or more unknown quantities the
process is exactly the same in nature, arid we only need
luhlkionnl mean equations to be obtained by multiply-
ing by the third, fourth, &c., coefficients. As the numbers
