appears are more numerous than all the other compounds
known to chemists. Almost the whole of the substances
which have been called organic contain carbon, and are
probably held together by the carbon atoms, so that many
chemists are now inclined to abandon the name Organic
Chemistry, and substitute the name Chemistry of the
Carbon Compounds. It used to be believed that the
production of the so-called organic compounds was due
solely to the action of a vital force, or some inexplicable
cause involved in the phenomena of life, but it is now
found that chemists are able to commence with the
elementary materials, pure carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,
and by strictly chemical operations, combine these together
so as to form complicated organic compounds. So many
compounds have already been thus formed that the proba-
bility is very great that many others will be so formed in
the course of time, and we might be inclined to generalize,
and infer that all so-called organic compounds might ulti-
mately be produced without the agency of living beings.
Thus the distinction between the organic and the inorganic
kingdoms seems to be breaking down, but our wonder at
the peculiar powers of carbon must increase at the same
time.
In considering generalization, the law of continuity was
applied chiefly to physical properties capable of mathe-
matical treatment. But in the classificatory sciences, also,
the same important principle is often beautifully ex-
emplified. Many objects or events seem to be entirely
exceptional and abnormal, and in regard to degree or
magnitude they may be so termed. We might adduce
examples on the one hand of such extreme cases, but it
is often easy to show, on the other hand, that they are
connected by intermediate links with other apparently
different cases.
In the organic kingdoms of nature there is a common
