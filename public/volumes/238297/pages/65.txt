TERMS. 39
Certain Special Conditions of Logical Symbols.
In order that we may argue and infer truly we must
treat our logical symbols according to the fundamental
laws of Identity and Difference. But in thus using our
symbols we shall frequently meet with combinations of
which the meaning will not at first be apparent. In some
cases, for instance, we may learn that an object is c yellow
and round/ in other cases ' that it is * round and yellow ' :
there arises the question whether these two descriptions
are identical in meaning or not. Or again, if we proved
that an object was * round round' the meaning of such an
expression would be open to doubt. Accordingly we must
take notice, before proceeding further, of certain special
laws which govern the combination of logical terms.
In the first place the combination of a logical term
with itself is without effect, just as the repetition of a
statement does not alter the meaning of the statement :
' a round round object' is simply 'a round object/ What
is yellow yellow is merely yellow ; metallic metals cannot
differ from metals, nor elementary elements from elements.
In our symbolic language we may similarly hold that A A
is identical with A, or
A = AA = AAA = &c.
The late Professor Boole is the only logician in modern
times who has drawn attention to this remarkable property
of logical terms b ; but in place of the name which he gave
to the law, I have proposed to call it The Law of Sim-
plicity c . Its high importance will only become apparent
when we attempt to determine the relations of logical and
mathematical science. Two symbols of quantity, and only
