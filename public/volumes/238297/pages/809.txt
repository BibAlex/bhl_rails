EXCEPTIONAL PHENOMENA.
passing through certain double-refracting crystals. The
laws obeyed by the wave are exactly the same as in other
cases, yet the results are entirely sui generis. So far are
such cases from contradicting the theory of ordinary
cases, that they afford the supreme opportunities for
verification.
In astronomy singular exceptions might occur, and in
an approximate manner they do occur. We might point
to the rings of Saturn as objects which, though undoubt-
edly obeying the law of gravity, are yet entirely unique,
as far as our observation of the universe has gone. They
agree, indeed, with the other bodies of the planetary
system in the stability of their movements, which never
diverge far from the mean position. But a truly singular
event might happen, or might have happened, under
slightly different circumstances. Had the rings been
exactly uniform all round, and with a centre of gravity
coinciding for a moment with that of Saturn, a singular case
of unstable equilibrium would have arisen, necessarily re-
sulting in the sudden collapse of the rings, and the fall of
their debris upon the surface of the planet. Thus in one
single case the theory of gravity would give a result
wholly unlike anything else known in the mechanism of
the heavens.
It is possible that we might meet with singular excep-
tions in crystallography. If a crystal of the second
or dime trie system, in which the third axis is usually
unequal to either of the other two, happened to have the
three axes equal, it might be mistaken at first sight for a
crystal of the cubic system, but would in many ways
exhibit different faces and dissimilar properties. There
is, again, a possible class of diclinic crystals in which two
axes are at right angles and the third axis inclined to the
other two. This class is chiefly remarkable for its non-
existence in a material point of view, since no crystals
