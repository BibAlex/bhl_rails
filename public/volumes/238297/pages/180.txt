effects of the crystal upon light, heat, electricity, &c.,
varying in all directions. But when we pursue induction
into the intricacies of its application to Nature we really
enter upon the subject of classification which we must
take up again in a later part of this work.
Complete Solution of the Inverse or Inductive Logical
Problem.
It is now plain that Induction consists in passing back
from a series of combinations to the laws by which such
combinations are governed. The natural law that all
metals are conductors of electricity really means that in
nature we find three classes of objects, namely
1. Metals, conductors;
2. Not-metals, conductors ;
3. Not-metals, not-conductors.
It comes to the same thing if we say that it excludes the
existence of the class, 'metals not-conductors.' In the
same way every other law or group of laws will really
mean the exclusion from existence of certain combinations
of the things, circumstances or phenomena governed by
those laws. Now in logic we treat not the phenomena
and laws but, strictly speaking, the general forms of the
laws ; and a little consideration will show that for a finite
number of things the possible number of forms or kinds
of law governing them must also be finite. Using general
terms we know that A and B can be present or absent in
four ways and no more thus
AB, Aft, aB, ab ;
therefore every possible law which can exist concerning
the relation of A and B must be marked by the exclusion
of one or more of the above combinations. The number
of possible laws then cannot exceed the number of selec-
tions which we can make from these four combinations,
