2-0 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
ball expelled, all simultaneously to our senses. But there
is no doubt that time is occupied by every part of the
process, and that the ball begins to move at first with
indefinite slowness. Captain Noble is able to measure
by his chronoscope the progress of the shot in a 300
pounder gun, and finds that the whole motion within the
barrel takes something less than of a second. It is
200
an invariable principle of nature that no finite force can
produce motion, except in a finite space of time. The
amount of momentum communicated to a body is pro-
portional to the accelerating force multiplied by the time
through which it acts uniformly. Thus a slight force
produces a great velocity only by long continued action.
In a powerful shock, like that of a railway collision, the
stroke of a hammer on a hard anvil, or the discharge of a
gun, the time is very short, and therefore the accelerating
forces brought into play are exceedingly great, but never
infinite. In the case of a large gun the powder in ex-
ploding is said to exert for a moment a force equivalent
to at least 2,800,000 horses.
Our belief in some of the most fundamental laws of
nature rests upon the principles of continuity. Galileo is
held to be the first philosopher who consciously employed
this principle in his arguments concerning the nature of
motion, and it is certain that we can never by pure ex-
perience assure ourselves of the truth even of the first law
of motion. A material particle, we are told, wlien not
acted on by extraneous forces will continue in the same
state of rest or motion. This may be true, but as we can
find no body which is free from the action of extraneous
causes, how are we to prove it ? Only by observing that
the less the amount of those forces the more nearly is the
law found to be true. A ball rolled along rough ground
is soon stopped; along a smooth pavement it continues
