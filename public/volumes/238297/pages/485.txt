THE LAW OF ERROR. 450
are in any case only approximate, it is usually quite un-
necessary to make the computations with any great
degree of accuracy, and places of decimals may therefore
oe freely cut off to save arithmetical work. The mean
equations having been computed, their solution by the
ordinary methods of algebra gives the most probable
values of the unknown quantities.
Works upon the Theory of Probability and the Law
of Error.
Regarding the Theory of Probability and the Law of
Error as constituting, perhaps, the most important subjects
of study for any one who desires to obtain a complete
comprehension of logical and scientific method as actually
applied in physical investigations, I will briefly indicate
the works in one or other of which the reader will best
pursue the study.
The best popular, and at the same time profound
English work on the subject is De Morgan's ' Essay on
Probabilities and on their Application to Life Contin-
gencies and Insurance Offices/ published in the ' Cabinet
Cyclopaedia/ and to be obtained from Messrs. Longman.
No mathematical knowledge beyond that of common
arithmetic is required in reading this work. Quetelet's
' Letters,' already often referred, to, also form a most inter-
esting and excellent popular introduction to the subject,
and the mathematical notes are also of value. Sir George
Airy's brief treatise ' On the Algebraical and Numerical
Theory of Errors of Observation and the Combination of
Observations/ contains a complete explanation of the Law of
Error and its practical applications. De Morgan's treatise
' On the Theory of Probabilities' in the ' Encyclopaedia Me-
tropolitana/ presents an abstract of the more abstruse in-
vestigations of Laplace, together with a multitude of pro-
