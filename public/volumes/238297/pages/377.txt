THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF PHENOMENA. 351
In many instances we are indeed obliged to accept a
very carefully constructed instrument as a standard, as in
the case of a standard barometer. But it is then best to
treat all inferior instruments comparatively only, and
determine the values of their scales by comparison with
the assumed standard.
Systematic Performance of Measurements.
When a large number of accurate measurements have
to be effected, it is usually desirable to make a certain
number of determinations with scrupulous care, and after-
wards use them as points of reference for the remaining
determinations. In the trigonometrical survey of a coun-
try, the principal triangulation fixes the relative positions
and distances of a few points with rigid accuracy. A
minor triangulation refers every prominent hill or village
to one of the principal points, and then the details are
filled in by reference to the secondary points. The survey
of the heavens is effected in a like manner. The ancient
astronomers compared the right ascensions of a few prin-
cipal stars with the moon, and thus ascertained their posi-
tions with regard to the sun ; the minor stars were after-
wards referred to the principal stars. Tycho followed
the same method, except that he used the more slowly
moving planet Venus instead of the moon. Flamsteed
was in the habit of using about seven stars, favourably
situated at points all round the heavens. The distances
of the other stars from these standard points, were deter-
mined in his early observations by the use of the quadrant P.
Even since the introduction of the transit telescope and
mural circle, tables of standard stars are formed at
Greenwich, the positions being determined with every
