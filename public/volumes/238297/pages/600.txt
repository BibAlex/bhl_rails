110 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Even, when we have no means of accurately measuring
the variable quantities we may yet be convinced of their
connexion, if one always varies perceptibly at the same
time as the other. Fatigue increases with exertion ;
hunger with abstinence from food ; desire and degree of
utility decrease with the quantity of commodity con-
sumed. We know that the sun's heating power depends
upon his height in the sky ; that the temperature of the
air falls in ascending a mountain ; that the earth's crust
is found to be perceptibly warmer as we sink mines into
it; we infer the direction in which a sound comes from
the change of loudness as we approach or recede. The
facility with which we can time after time observe the
increase or decrease of one quantity with another suf-
ficiently shows the connexion, although we may be un-
able to assign any precise law of relation. The probability
in such cases depends upon frequent coincidence in time.
Empirical Mathematical Laws.
It is important to acquire a clear comprehension of the
part which, is played in scientific investigation by em-
pirical formulae arid laws. If we have a table containing
certain values of a variable and the corresponding values
of the variant, there are certain mathematical processes by
which we can infallibly discover a mathematical formula
yielding numbers in more or less exact agreement with
the table. We may generally assume that the quantities
will approximately conform to a law of the form
y = A + lBx + Cx 2 ,
in which x is the variable and y the variant. We can
then select from the table three values of y, and the cor-
responding values of x ; inserting them in the equation,
we obtain three equations by the solution of which we
gain the values of A, B, and C. It will be found as a
