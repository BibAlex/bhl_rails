446 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
nated in a heated revolving nebulous mass of gas, and
is in a state of almost infinitely slow progress towards the
cold and stony condition) Other speculative hypotheses
might doubtless be entertained. Every hypothesis is
pressed by difficulties. If the whole universe be cooling,
where does the heat go to ? If we are to get rid of it
entirely, outer space must be infinite in extent, so that it
shall never be stopped and reflected back. But not to
speak of metaphysical difficulties, if the medium of heat
undulations be infinite in extent, why should not the
material bodies placed in it be infinite also in number and
quantity. It is quite apparent that we are venturing
into speculations which altogether surpass our powers
of scientific inference. But then I am arguing nega-
tively ; I wish only to show that those who speak of
the uniformity of nature, and the reign of law, often
misinterpret ^entirely the meaning involved in those
expressions. (Law is not inconsistent with extreme di-
versity,) and, so far as we can read the history of this
planetary system, it did most probably originate in heated
nebulous matter, and man's history forms but a moment
in its progress towards the cold and stony condition. It
is by very doubtfu] and speculative hypotheses alone that
we can avoid such a conclusion, and I depart least from
undoubted facts and well-established laws, when I assert
that, ^whatever uniformities may underlie the phenomena
of nature, constant variety and ever-progressing change is
the real outcome\
Speculations on the Reconcentration of Energy.
There are unequivocal indications, as I have said, that
the material universe, as we at present see it, is pro-
gressing from some act of creation, or some discon-
tinuity of existence of which the date may be approxi-
