THE LAW OF ERROR. 461
to take suitable precautions against such occult errors.
* It is to the observer/ says Gauss *, ' that belongs the task
of carefully removing the causes of constant errors,' and
this is quite true when the error i absolutely constant.
When we have made a number of determinations with a
certain apparatus or method of measurement, there is a
great advantage in altering the arrangement, or even
devising some entirely different method of getting esti-
mates of the same quantity. The reason obviously con-
sists in the improbability that exactly the same constant
error will affect two or more different methods of experi-
ment. If a discrepancy is found to exist, we shall at
least be aware of the existence of error, and can take
measures for finding in which way it lies. If we can try
a considerable number of methods, the probability becomes
considerable that errors constant in one method will be
balanced or nearly so by errors of an opposite effect in the
others. Suppose that there be three different methods
each affected by an error of equal amount. The pro-,
bability that this error wiU in all fall in the same direction
is only ; and with four methods similarly f . If each
method be affected, as is always the case by several inde-
pendent sources of error, the probability becomes very
great that in the mean result of all the methods sojne of
the errors will partially compensate the others. In this case,
as in all others, when human foresight and vigilance has /
exhausted itself, we must trust the theory of probability. /
In the determination of a zero point, of the magnitude
of the fundamental standards of time and space, in the
personal equation of an astronomical observer, we have
instances of such fixed errors ; but as a general rule a
change of procedure is likely to reverse the character of
the error, and many instances may be given of the value
of this precaution.
