18(3 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
whole planetary system through space must occasion a
similar displacement of at most 5". The ordinary aber-
ration can be readily detected with modern astronomical
instruments, because it goes through a yearly change in
direction or amount, but the systematic aberration is
constant and permanent so long as the planetary system
moves uniformly in a sensibly straight line. Only then
in the course of ages, when the curvature of the sun's path
becomes apparent, can We hope to verify the existence of
this kind of aberration. A curious effect also must be
produced by the sun's proper motion upon the apparent
periods of revolution of the binary stars.
To my mind, some of the most interesting truths in
the whole range of science are those which have not been,
and in many cases probably can never be, verified by trial.
Thus the chemist assigns, with a very high degree of
probability the vapour densities of such elements as
carbon and silicon, which have never been observed sepa-
rately in a state of vapour. The chemist also is familiar
with the vapour densities of elements at temperatures at
which the elements in question never have been, and
probably never can be, submitted to experiment in the
form of vapour.
Joule and others have calculated the actual velocity of
the molecules of a gas, and even the number of collisions
which must take place per second during their constant
circulation. Sir W. Thomson has not yet given us the
exact absolute magnitudes of the particles of matter, but
he has ascertained by several distinct methods the limits
within which their magnitudes must lie. Many of such
scientific results must for ever be beyond the power of
verification by the senses. I have elsewhere had occasion
to remark that waves of light, the intimate processes of
electrical changes, the properties of the ether which is
the base of all phenomena, are necessarily determined
