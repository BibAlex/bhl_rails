328 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
appears not to have been able to accept such an ex-
planation ; but fearing that the occurrence of fossil fishes
on the Alps would support the Mosaic account of the
deluge, he did not hesitate to attribute them to the
remains of fishes accidentally brought there by travellers
or pilgrims. In archaeological investigations the greatest
caution is requisite in allowing for secondary burials in
ancient tombs and tumuli, for imitations, casual coin-
cidences, disturbance by subsequent races, or even by
other archaeologists, in fact, for a multitude of interfering
circumstances. In common life extraordinary events
must happen from time to time, as when a shepherdess
in France was astonished at an iron chain falling out of
the sky near to her feet, the fact being that Guy-Lussac
had thrown it out of his balloon, which was passing over
her head unseen at the time.
To this class of accidental exceptions I would refer the
innumerable breaches of the rules of inflexion in grammar.
These rules would be invariable were it not that the
forms derived from distinct roots sometimes get mixed
together, that mistaken analogies sometimes occasion con-
fusion, and a variety of such disturbing causes produce
irregularity. Philology already presents beautiful in-
stances of the manner in which a comprehensive law may
be traced out in a thoroughly scientific manner, in spite of
apparently inexplicable exceptions.
Novel and Unexplained Exceptions.
When a law of nature appears to fail because some
other law has interfered with its action, two cases may
obviously present themselves ; the interfering law may
be a known and familiar one, or it may have been pre-
viously undetected. In the first case, which we have
sufficiently considered in the preceding section, we have
