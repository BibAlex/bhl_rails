THEOE Y OF A PPROXIMA TION. 9 1
gases nearly obey the law of Boyle and Marriotte ; that
they nearly expand, by heat at the uniform rate of one
part in 272*9 of their volume at o for each degree centi-
grade ; and that they more nearly fulfil these conditions
the more distant the point of temperature at which we
examine them from the liquefying point, we pass by the
principle of continuity to the conception of a perfect gas.
Such a gas would probably consist of atoms of matter at
so great a distance from each other as to exert no attrac-
tive forces upon each other ; but for this condition to be
exactly fulfilled the distances must be infinite, so that an
absolutely perfect gas cannot exist. But the perfect gas
is not merely a limit to which we may approach, it is a
limit passed by at least one real gas. ' It has been shown
by Despretz, Pouillet, Dulong, Arago, and finally Regnault,
that all gases diverge from the Boylean law, and in nearly
all cases the density of the gas increases in a somewhat
greater ratio than the pressure, indicating a tendency on the
part of the molecules to approximate of their own accord,
and condense into liquid. In the more condensible gases
such as sulphurous acid, ammonia, and cyanogen, this
tendency is strongly apparent near the liquefying point.
Hydrogen on the contrary diverges from the law of a
perfect gas in the opposite direction, that is, the density
increases less than in the ratio of the pressure \ This is a
singular exception, the bearing of which I am unable to
comprehend.
All gases diverge again from the law of uniform ex-
pansion by heat, but the divergence is less as the gas in
question is less condensible, or examined at a temperature
more removed from its liquefying point. Thus the perfect
gas in this respect must have an infinitely high tempera-
ture. According to Dalton's law each gas in a mixture re-
tains its own properties wholly unaffected by the presence
