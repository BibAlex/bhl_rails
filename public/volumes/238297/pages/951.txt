RESULTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD. 461
effects of a constantly acting tendency. Even man,
according to these theories, is no distinct creation, but
rather an extreme specimen of brain development. His
nearest cousins are the apes, and his pedigree extends
backwards until it joins that of the lowliest zoophytes.
The theories of Darwin and Spencer are doubtless not
demonstrated ; they are to some extent hypothetical, just
as all the theories of physical science are to some extent
hypothetical, and open to doubt. But I venture to look
upon the theories of evolution and natural selection in
their main features as two of the most probable hypo-
theses ever proposed, harmonizing and explaining as they
do immense numbers of diverse facts } I question whether
any scientific works which have appeared since the * Prin-
cipia' of Newton, are comparable in importance with those
of Darwin and Spencer, revolutionizing as they do all
our views of the origin of bodily, mental, moral, arid social
phenomena.
Granting all this/ 1 cannot for a moment admit that
the theory of evolution will alter our theological views.
That theory embraces several laws or uniformities which
are observed to be true in the production of living forms ;
but these laws do not determine the size and figure of
living creatures, any more than the law of gravitation
determines the magnitudes and distances of the planets.
Suppose that Dai win is correct in saying that man is
descended from the Ascidians : yet the precise form of
the human body must have been influenced by an infinite
train of circumstances affecting the reproduction, growth,
and health of the whole chain of intermediate beings.
No doubt, the circumstances being what they were, man
could not be otherwise than he is, and if in any other
part of the universe an exactly similar earth, furnished,
with exactly similar germs of life, existed, a race must
have grown up there exactly similar to the human race.
