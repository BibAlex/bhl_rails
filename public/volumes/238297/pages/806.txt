316 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
LexellV Comet it was afterwards shown, curiously enough,
that its appearance was not one of a regular series of
periodical returns within the sphere of our vision, but a
single exceptional visit never to be repeated, and probably
due to the perturbing powers of Jupiter. Yet this soli-
tary visit was a strong confirmation of the law of gravity
with which it seemed to be in conflict.
The division of Biela's Comet into two companion comets
was at the time when it occurred one of those unlooked-
for and inexplicable events which awaken the attention
and interest of observers in the highest degree. Comets
indeed have altogether the character of eccentric strangers
intruding into our planetary system, and in almost every
point they are yet inexplicable ; but there is a possibility
that the separation of Biela's Comet may prove to be a
comparatively ordinary event of cometary history. For
if, as is now believed, comets be aggregates of small me-
teoric stones or particles, forming the denser parts of con-
tinuous streams of such bodies circulating round the sun,
then it is not unlikely that these aggregates may at times
be increased or diminished by the meeting or separation
of meteoric streams.
Singular Exceptions.
Among the most interesting of apparent exceptions, are
those which I propose to call singular exceptions, because
they are more or less closely analogous to the singular
cases, or solutions which occur in mathematical science.
A general mathematical law embraces an infinite multi-
tude of cases which have a perfect agreement with each
other in a certain respect. It may nevertheless happen
that a single case, while obeying the general law, stands
out as apparently different from all the rest. The daily
rotation of the earth upon its axis gives to all the stars
