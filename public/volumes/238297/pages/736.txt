246 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
of analogical inference is also very correctly described in
the Logic attributed to Kant, where the rule of ordinary
induction is stated in the words ' Eines in vielen, also in
alien,' one quality in many things, therefore in all ; and
the rule of analogy is ' Vieles in einem, also auch das
iibrige in demselben' c , many (qualities) in one, therefore
also the remainder in the same.
It is evident that there may be intermediate cases in
which, from the resemblance of a moderate number of
objects in several properties, we may infer to other objects.
Probability must rest either upon the number of instances
or the depth of resemblance, or upon the occurrence of both
in sufficient degrees. What there is wanting in extension
must be made up by intension, and vice versd.
Two Meanings of Generalization.
The term generalization, as commonly used, includes two
processes which are of different character, but are often
closely associated together. In the first place, we generalize
whenever we recognise even in two facts or objects a certain
common nature. We cannot detect the slightest similarity
without opening the way to inference from one case to
the other. If we compare a cubical with a regular octa-
hedral crystal, there is little apparent similarity ; but, so
soon as we perceive that either can be produced by the
symmetrical modification of the other, we discover a
groundwork of similarity in the constitution of the
crystals, which enables us to infer many things of one,
because they are true of the other. Our knowledge of
ozone took its rise from the time when the similarity of
smell, attending electric sparks, strokes of lightning,
and the slow combustion of phosphorus, was noticed by
c Kant's 'Logik,' 84, Konigsberg, 1800, p. 207.
