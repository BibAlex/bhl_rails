EXPERIMENT. 47
balance to the top of the Dome of St. Paul's, and tried
whether the balance remained in equilibrium after one
weight was allowed to hang down to a depth of 240 feet.
No difference could be perceived when the weights were
at the same and at different levels, but Hooke rightly
held that the failure arose from the insufficient difference
of height. He says, * Yet I am apt to think some difference
might be discovered in greater heights V The radius of
the earth being about 20,922,000 feet, we can now readily
calculate from the known law of gravity that a height of
240 would not make a greater difference than one part in
40,000 of the weight. Such a difference would doubt-
less be inappreciable in the balances of that day, though
it could readily be detected by balances now frequently
constructed. Again, the mutual gravitation of bodies at
the earth's surface is so small that Newton appears to
have made no attempts to demonstrate its existence ex-
perimentally, merely remarking that it was too small to
fall under the observation of our senses 8 . It has since
been successfully detected and measured by Cavendish,
Baily and others.
The smallness of the quantities which we can now
observe is often very astonishing. A balance will weigh to
one millionth part of the load or less. Sir Joseph Whit-
worth can measure to the one millionth part of an inch.
A rise of temperature of the 8 Sooth part of a degree
centigrade has been detected by Dr. Joule. The spectro-
scope can reveal the presence of the one 1 80, 000,000 th
part of a grain of soda, and the sense of smell can probably
feel the presence of a far less quantity of odorous matter *.
We must nevertheless remember that effects of indefinitely
