CLASSIFICA TION. 399
scheme, the great composite family of plants, together
with the closely approximate genus Jasione, are first
separated from all other flowering plants by the compound
character of their flowers. The remaining plants are sub-
divided according as the perianth is double or single.
Since no plants are yet known in which the perianth can
be said to have three or more distinct riDgs, this division
becomes practically the same as one into double and not-
double. Flowers with a double perianth are next discrimi-
nated according as the corolla does or does not consist of
one piece, according as the ovary is free or not-free, as it
is simple or not simple, as the corolla is regular or irre-
gular, and so on. On looking over this arrangement, it
will be found that numerical discriminations often occur,
the numbers of petals, stamens, capsules, or other parts
being the criteria, in which cases, as already explained
(vol. ii. p. 374), the actual exhibition of the bifid division
would be tedious.
Linnaeus appears to have been perfectly acquainted
with the nature and uses of diagnostic classification, which
he describes under the name of Synopsis, saying 6 :
' Synopsis tradit Divisiones arbitrarias, longiores aut brevi-
ores, plures aut pauciores : a Botanicis in genere non
agnoscenda. Synopsis est dichotomia arbitraria, quse
instar viae ad Botanicem ducit. Limites autem non deter-
minat/
The rules and tables drawn out by chemists to facilitate
the discovery of the nature of a substance in qualitative
analysis are usually arranged on the bifurcate method,
and form excellent examples of diagnostic classification,
the qualities of the substances employed in testing being
in most cases merely characteristic properties of little
importance in other respects. The chemist does not detect
potassium by reducing it to the state of metallic potas-
