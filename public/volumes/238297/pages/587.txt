THEORY OF APPROXIMATION. 97
the scale of a balance. How do we know that two pound
weights together will weigh twice as much as one \ Do
we know it to be exactly so 1 Like other results founded
on induction we cannot prove it certainly and absolutely,
but all the calculations of physical astronomy proceed
upon the assumption, so that we may consider it proved
to a very high degree of approximation. We may, in fact,
assume with much probability that bodies gravitate in
entire independence of each other. Had not this been
true the calculations of physical astronomy would have
been almost infinitely more complex than they actually
are, and the progress of knowledge would have been
vastly slower.
The science of the spectrum again is much simplified by
the fact that elements do not apparently interfere with
each other in the production of light. The spectrum of
sodium chloride is the spectrum of sodium superposed
upon that of chlorine. Were it otherwise, we should
have as many distinct spectra as there are distinct com-
pounds in chemistry, and the subject would be almost
hopelessly complex. The spectrum of a substance would
then no more enable us to tell its components than the
appearance of a new mineral indicates its composition.
But it would probably be too early to assert the entire
absence of any joint spectra. There is so much yet
unexplained in the subject that some effects due to the
mutual action of elements may possibly be discovered,
and the independence will then be only approximate.
It is a general principle of scientific method that if
effects be of small amount, comparatively to our means of
observation, all joint effects will be of a higher order of
smallness. and may therefore be rejected in a first ap-
proximation. This principle was distinctly employed by
Daniel Bernouilli in the theory of sound, under the title of
' The Principle of the Coexistence of Small Vibrations.'
