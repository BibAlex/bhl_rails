GENERA LIZA TION. 249
Properties which are unapparent in the hyperbola may
readily be discovered in the ellipse. Most of the complex
relations which the old geometers discovered in the circle
will be reproduced mutatis mutandis in the other conic
sections. The undulatory theory of light might have been
unknown at the present day, had not the theory of sound
supplied hints by analogy. The study of light has made
known many phenomena of interference and polarization,
the existence of which had hardly been suspected in the
case of sound, but which may now be sought out, and per-
haps found to possess unexpected interest and importance.
The careful study of water-waves shows how waves may
alter in form and velocity with varying depth of water.
Analogous changes may sometimes be detected in sound
waves. Thus there is a mutual interchange of aid.
' Every study of a generalization or extension/ as De
Morgan has well saidg, f gives additional power over the par-
ticular form by which the generalization is suggested. No-
body who has ever returned to quadratic equations after the
study of equations of all degrees, or who has done the like,
will deny my assertion that ov /8XeV f$\eirwv may be pre-
dicated of any one who studies a branch or a case, without
afterwards making it" part of a larger whole. Accordingly
it is always worth while to generalize, were it only to give
power over the particular. This principle, of daily fami-
liarity to the mathematician, is almost unknown to the
logician/
Comparative Generality of Physical Properties.
Much of the value of science depends upon the know-
ledge which we gradually acquire of the different degrees
of generality of properties and phenomena of various kinds.
