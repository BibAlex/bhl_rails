THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF PHENOMENA. 315
In the present day the average error of a single observa-
tion is probably reduced to the half or quarter of what it
was in Bradley 's time; and further extreme accuracy is
attained by the multiplication of observations, and their
skilful combination according to the theory of error.
Some of the more important constants, for instance that
of nutation, have been determined within the tenth part
of a second of space .
It would be a matter of great interest to trace out the
dependence of this vast progress upon the introduction of
new instruments. The astrolabe of Plotemy, the tele-
scope of Galileo, the pendulum of Galileo and Huygens,
the micrometer of Horrocks, and the telescopic sights and
micrometer of Gascoygne and Picard, Hcemer's transit in-
strument, Newton's and Hadley's quadrant, Dollond's
achromatic lenses, Harrison's chronometer, and Ramsden's
dividing engine such were some of the principal addi-
tions to astronomical apparatus. The result is, that we
now take note of quantities, 300,000 or 400,000 times as
small as in the time of the Chaldaaans.
It would be interesting again to compare the scrupulous
accuracy of a modern trigonometrical survey with Erato-
sthenes' rude but ingenious guess at the difference of lati-
tude between Alexandria and Syene or with Norwood's
measurement of a degree of latitude in 1635. ' Sometimes
I measured, sometimes I paced/ said Norwood ; ' and I
believe I am within a scantling of the truth.' Such was
the germ of those elaborate geodesical measurements
which have made the dimensions of the globe known to
us within a few hundred yards.
In other branches of science, the invention of an instru-
ment has usually marked, if it has not made, an epoch.
The science of heat might be said to commence with the
