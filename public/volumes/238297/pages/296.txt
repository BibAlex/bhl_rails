270 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
nearer than i part in 540. We might imagine measure-
ments so accurately executed as to give us eight or ten
places correctly. But the power of the hands and senses
must soon stop, whereas the mental powers of deductive
reasoning can proceed to an unlimited degree of approxi-
mation. Geometrical truths, then, are incapable of verifi-
cation ; and, if so, they cannot even be learnt by observa-
tion. How can I have learnt by observation a proposition
of which I cannot even prove the truth by observation,
when I am in possession of it 1 All that observation or
empirical trial can do is to suggest propositions, of which
the truth may afterwards be proved deductively. By
drawing a number of right-angled triangles on paper,
with squares upon their sides, and cutting out and
weighing these squares very accurately, I might have
reason to suspect , the existence of the relation of equality
proved in Euclid's 47th Proposition ; but no process of
weighing or measuring could ever prove it, nor could it
ever assure me that the like degree of approximation
would exist in untried cases.
Much has been said about the peculiar certainty of
mathematical reasoning, but it is only certainty of deduc-
tive reasoning, and equal certainty attaches to all correct
logical deduction. If a triangle be right-angled, the
square on the hypothenuse will undoubtedly equal the
sum of the two squares on the other sides ; but I can
never be sure that a triangle is right-angled : so I can be
certain that nitric acid will not dissolve gold, provided I
know that the substances employed really correspond to
those on which I tried the experiment previously. Here
is like certainty of inference, and like doubt as to the
facts.
