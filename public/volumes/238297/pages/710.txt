220 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
If genius, indeed, be that by which intellect diverges from
what is common, it must necessarily be a phenomenon be-
yond the domain of the ordinary laws of nature. Never-
theless, it is always an interesting arid instructive work
to trace out, as far as possible, the characteristics of mind
by which great discoveries have been achieved, and we
shall find in the analysis much to illustrate the principles
of scientific method.
Error of the Baconian Method.
Hundreds of investigators may be constantly engaged
in experimental inquiry ; they may compile numberless
notebooks full of scientific facts, and may frame endless
tables full of numerical results ; but if the views of the
nature of induction here maintained be true they can
never by such work alone rise to new and great dis-
coveries. By an organized system of research they may
work out deductively the detailed results of a previous
discovery, but to arrive at a new principle of nature is
another matter. Francis .. Bacon contributed to spread
abroad the hurtful notion that to advance science we
must begin by accumulating facts, and then draw from
them, by a process of patient digestion, successive laws of
higher and higher generality. In protesting against the
false method of the scholastic logicians, he exaggerated
a partially true philosophy, until it became almost as
false as that which preceded it. His notion of scientific
method was that of a kind of scientific bookkeeping. Facts
were to be indiscriminately gathered from every source,
and posted in a kind of ledger, from which would emerge
in time a clear balance of truth. It is difficult to imagine
a less likely way of arriving at great discoveries.
The greater the array of facts, the less is the probability
that they will by any routine system of classification or
