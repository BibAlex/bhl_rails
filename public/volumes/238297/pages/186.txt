development. We may also have ' all A's are all B's,
and all B's are C's,' r even 'all A's are all B's, and all
B's are all CV All such premises admit of variations,
greater or less in number, the logical distinctness of which
can only be determined by trial in detail. Disjunctive
propositions either singly or in pairs were also treated,
but were often found to be equivalent to other propo-
sitions of a simpler form ; thus A =. ABC -|- Kbc is exactly
the same in meaning as AB = AC.
This mode of exhaustive trial bears some analogy to
that ancient mathematical process called the Sieve of
Eratosthenes. Having taken a long series of the natural
numbers, Eratosthenes is said to have calculated out in
succession all the multiples of every number, and to have
marked them off, so that at last the prime numbers alone
remained, and the factors of every number were exhaus-
tively discovered. My problem of 2 56 series of combinations
is the logical analogue, the chief points of difference being
that there is a limit to the number of cases, and that prime
numbers have no analogue in logic, since every series of
combinations corresponds to a law or group of conditions.
But the analogy is perfect in the point that they are
both inverse processes. There is no mode of ascertaining
that a number is prime but by showing that it is not
the product of any assignable factors. So there is no
mode of ascertaining what laws are embodied in any
series of combinations but trying exhaustively the laws
which would give them. Just as the results of Erato-
sthenes' method have been worked out to a great extent
and registered in tables for the convenience of other
mathematicians, I have endeavoured to work out the
inverse logical problem to the utmost extent which is
at present practicable or useful.
I have thus found that there are altogether fifteen
conditions or series of conditions which may govern
