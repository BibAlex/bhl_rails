CLASSIFICATION. 365
in the classes varying from three to twenty elements.
Now if we were to calculate the whole number of ways
in which sixty-three objects can be arranged in six groups,
we should find the number to be so great that the life
of the longest lived man would be wholly inadequate
to enable him to go through these possible groupings.
The rule of exhaustive arrangement, then, is absolutely
impracticable. It foUows also that mere haphazard trial
cannot as a general rule give any useful result. If we
were to write the names of the elements in succession
upon sixty-three cards, throw them into a ballot-box, and
draw them out haphazard in six handfuls time after
time, the probability is excessively small that we take
them out at any one trial in a specified order, for in-
stance that at present adopted by chemists.
The usual mode in which an investigator proceeds to
form a classification of any new group of objects, seems to
consist in tentatively arranging them according to their
most obvious similarities. Any two objects which present
a close resemblance to each other will be joined and
formed into the rudiment of a class, the definition of
which will at first include all the apparent points of
resemblance. Other objects as they come to our notice
will be gradually assigned to those groups with which
they present the greatest number of points of resem-
blance, and the definition of a class will often have to
be altered in order to admit them. The early chemists,
for instance, could hardly avoid classing together the
common metals, gold, silver, copper, lead, and iron, which
present such conspicuous points of similarity as regards
density, metallic lustre, malleability, &c. With the pro-
gress of discovery, however, difficulties begin to present
themselves in such a grouping. Antimony, bismuth, and
arsenic are distinctly metallic as regards lustre, density,
and some chemical properties, but are wanting in malle-
