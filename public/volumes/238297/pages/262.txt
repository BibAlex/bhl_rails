tion. The answer obtained is therefore not the real
probability, which is usually indeterminate, but only, as it
were, the most probable probability. Certain problems
solved by Boole are free from logical conditions and
therefore may admit of valid answers. These as I have
shown h may also be solved by the simple combinations
of the Abecedarium, but the remainder of the problems
do not admit of a determinate answer, at least by Boole's
method.
Comparison of the Theory with Experience.
The Laws of Probability rest upon the simplest principles
of reasoning, and cannot be really negatived by any
possible experience. It might happen that a person
should always throw a coin head uppermost, and appear
incapable of getting tail by chance. The theory would
not be falsified, because it contemplates the possibility of
the most extreme runs of luck. Our actual experience
might be counter to all that is probable ; the whole
course of events might seem to be in complete contra-
diction to what we should expect, arid yet a casual con-
junction of events might be the real explanation. It is
just possible that some regular coincidences which we
attribute to fixed laws of nature, are due to the accidental
conjunction of phenomena in the cases to which our
attention is directed. All that we can learn from
finite experience is capable, according to the theory of
probabilities, of misleading us, and it is only infinite
experience that could assure us of any inductive truths.
At the same time, the probability that any extreme
runs of luck will occur is so excessively slight, that it
would be absurd seriously to expect their occurrence. It
