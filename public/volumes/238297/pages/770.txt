280 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
hold did this doctrine take that we still have its results
in many customs, not only in the seven days of the week,
but the seven years' apprenticeship, puberty at fourteen
years, the second climacteric, and legal majority at twenty-
one years, the third climacteric. The system was repro-
duced in the seven sacraments of the Roman Catholic
Church, and the seven year periods of Comte's grotesque
system of domestic worship. Even in scientific matters
the loftiest intellects have occasionally yielded, as when
Newton was misled by the analogy between the seven
tones of music and the seven colours of his spectrum.
Other numerical analogies, though rejected by Galileo,
held Kepler in thraldom ; no small part of Kepler's
labours during seventeen years was spent upon nu-
merical and geometrical analogies of the most baseless
character ; and he gravely held that there could not be
more than six planets, because there were not more than
five regular solids. Even the acute genius of Huyghens
did not prevent him from inferring that but one satellite
could belong to Saturn, because, with those of Jupiter and
the Earth, it completed the perfect number of six. A
whole series of other superstitions and fallacies attach to
the numbers six and nine 1 .
It is by false generalization, again, that the laws of
nature have been supposed always to possess that sim-
plicity and perfection which we attribute to particular
forms and relations. The heavenly bodies, it was held,
must move in circles, for the circle was the perfect figure.
Even Newton seemed to adopt the questionable axiom
that nature must always proceed in the simplest way ; in
stating his first rule of philosophizing, he adds : ' To this
purpose the philosophers say, that nature does nothing in
