128 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
sideling the principles of approximation we found that a
small portion of any curve will appear to be a straight
| line. Whenever our modes of measurement are compara-
tively rude, we must expect to be unable to detect the
curvature. Thus Kepler made meritorious attempts to
discover the law of refraction, and he slightly approxi-
mated to it when he observed that the angles of incidence
and refraction if small bear a constant ratio to each other.
Angles when small are very nearly as their sines, so that
he reached an approximate result of the true law. Cardan
assumed, probably as a mere guess, that the force required
to sustain a body on an inclined plane was simply propor-
tional to the angle of elevation of the plane. This is
approximately the case when the angle is very small, and
it becomes true again when the angle is a right angle ;
but in reality the law is much more complicated, the
power required being proportional to the sine of the
angle. The early thermometer-makers were quite unaware
whether the expansion of mercury was exactly propor-
tional or not to the heat communicated to it, and it is
only in the present century that we have learnt it to be
not so. We now know that even gases obey the law of
uniform expansion by heat only in an approximate man-
ner. Until some reason to the contrary is shown, we
should do well to look upon every law of simple propor-
tion as only provisionally true.
Nevertheless, there are many of the most important
i laws of nature which are in the form of simple propor-
tions. Wherever a uniform cause acts in independence
of its previous effects, we may expect this relation. Thus,
an accelerating force acts equally upon a moving and a
motionless body. Hence the velocity produced is always
in simple proportion to the force, and also to the duration
of its uniform action. As gravitating bodies never in-
terfere with each other's gravity, this force is in direct
