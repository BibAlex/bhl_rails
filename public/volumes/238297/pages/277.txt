PHILOSOPHY OF INDUCTIVE INFERENCE. 251
tents of our knowledge, except through new impressions
upon the senses, or upon some seat of feeling. I shall
attempt to show that inference, whether inductive or
deductive, is never more than an unfolding of the contents
of our experience, and that it always proceeds upon the
assumption that the future and the unperceived will be
governed by the same conditions as the past and the
perceived, an assumption which will often prove to be
mistaken. /
In inductive just as in deductive reasoning, the con-
clusion never passes beyond the premises. Eeasoning \
adds no more to the implicit contents of our knowledge, \
than the arrangement of the specimens in a museum adds j
to the number of those specimens. This arrangement adds/ 1
to our knowledge in a certain sense : it allows us to per-
ceive the similarities and peculiarities of the individual
specimens, and on the assumption that the museum is an
adequate representation of nature, it enables us to judge
of the prevailing forms of natural objects. Bacon's first
aphorism holds perfectly true, that man knows nothing
but what he has observed, provided that we include his
whole sources of experience, and the whole implicit con- \
tents of his knowledge. Inference but unfolds the hidden \
meaning of our observations, and the theory of probability \
shows how far we go beyond our data in assuming that
new specimens will resemble the old ones, or that the /
future may be regarded as proceeding uniformly with the /
past.

Various Classes of Inductive Truths.
It will be desirable, in the first place, to distinguish
between the several kinds of truths which we endeavour
to establish by induction. Although there is a certain
common and universal element in all our processes of
