ANALYSIS OF QUANTITATIVE PHENOMENA. 413
will be affected by atmospheric refraction and the
curvature of the earth. But if in the case of two points
the apparent elevation of each as seen from the other be
observed, the corrections will be the same in amount, but
reversed in direction, and the mean between the two
apparent differences of altitude will give the true dif-
ference of level m .
In the next two chapters we really pursue the Method
of Reversal into more complicated applications.
