424 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
and homogeneous body. The slightest irregularity or pro-
trusion from the surface will destroy the rigorous cor-
rectness of the assumption. The spheroid, on the other
hand, has no invariable centre at which its mass may
always be regarded as concentrated. The point at which
its resultant attraction acts will move about according
to the distance and position of the other attracting body,
and it will only coincide with the centre as regards an in-
finitely distant body whose attractive forces may be con-
sidered as acting in parallel lines.
Physicists speak familiarly of the pole of a magnet,
and the term may be used with convenience. But, if
we attach any real and definite meaning to it, the pole
is not the end of the magnet, nor is it any one fixed
point within, but the variable point from which the
resultant of all the forces exerted by the particles in
the whole bar upon exterior magnetic particles may be
considered as acting. The pole is, in short, a Centre of
Magnetic Forces; but as those forces are really never
parallel, this centre will vary in position according to
the relative place of the object attracted. Only when
we regard the magnet as attracting a very distant, or,
strictly speaking, infinitely distant particle, does the
centre become a fixed point, situated in short magnets
approximately at one sixth of the whole length from
each end of the bar. We have in the above instances
of centres or poles of force sufficient examples of the mode
in which the Fictitious Mean or Average is employed in
physical science.
The Precise Mean Result.
We now turn to that mode of employing the mean
result which is analogous to the method of reversal, but
which is brought into practice in a most extensive manner
throughout many branches of physical science. We find
