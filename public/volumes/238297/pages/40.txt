14 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
passing from more general to less general truths ; induc-
tion is the contrary process from less to more general
truths. We may however describe the difference in
another manner. In deduction we are engaged in develop-
ing the consequences of a law or identity. We learn
the meaning, contents, results or inferences, which attach
to any given proposition. Induction is the exactly inverse
process. Given certain results or consequences, we are re-
quired to discover the general law from which they flow.
In a certain sense all knowledge is inductive. We can
only learn the laws and relations of things in nature by
observing those things. But the knowledge gained from
the senses is knowledge only of particular facts, and we
require some process of reasoning by which we may con-
struct out of the facts the laws obeyed by them. Expe-
rience gives us the materials of knowledge : induction
digests those materials, and yields us general knowledge.
Only when we possess such knowledge, in the form of
general propositions and natural laws, can we usefully
apply the reverse process of deduction to ascertain the
exact information required at any moment. In its ultimate
origin or foundation, then, all knowledge is inductive in
the sense that it is derived by a certain inductive
reasoning from the facts of experience.
But it is nevertheless true, and this is a point to
which insufficient attention has been paid, that all reason-
ing is founded on the principles of deduction. I call in
question the existence of any method of reasoning which
can be carried on without a knowledge of deductive pro-
cesses. I shall endeavour to show that induction is really
the inverse process of deduction. There is no mode of
ascertaining the laws which are obeyed in certain pheno-
mena, except we previously have the power of determining
what results would follow from a given law. Just as the
process of division necessitates a prior knowledge of multi-
