UNITS AND STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT. 377
quantities in terms of any unit which he likes to adopt.
He may use the yard for linear measurement and the
litre for cubic measurement, only there will then be a
complicated relation between his different results. The
system of derived units which we have been briefly con-
sidering, is that which gives the most simple and natural
relation between quantitative expressions of different
kinds, and therefore conduces to ease of comprehension
and saving of laborious calculation.
Provisionally Independent Units.
Ultimately, as we can hardly doubt, all phenomena
will be recognised as so many manifestations of energy ;
and, being expressed in terms of the unit of energy, will
be referable to the primary units of space, time, and
mass. To effect this reduction, however, in any particular
case, we must not only be able to compare different
quantities of the phenomenon, but to trace the whole
series of steps by which it is connected with the primary
notions. We can readily observe that the intensity of
one source of light is greater than that of another ; and,
knowing that the intensity of light decreases as the
square of the distance, we can easily determine their
comparative brilliance. Hence we can express the inten-
sity of light falling upon any surface, if we have a unit
in which to make the expression. Light is undoubtedly
one form of energy, and the unit ought therefore to be
the unit of energy. But at present it is quite impossible
to say how much energy there is in any particular
amount of light. The question then arises, Are we to
defer the measurement of light until we can fully and
accurately assign its relation to other forms of energy I
If we answer Yes, it is equivalent to saying that the
science of light must stand still perhaps for a generation ;
