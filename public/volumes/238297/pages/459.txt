come within the sphere of vision in each half hour or
quarter hour, and then, assuming that the law of varia-
tion is symmetrical, they select a moment for the passage
of the whole body equidistant between times of equal
frequency.
The eclipses of Jupiter's satellites are not only of great
interest as regards the motions of the satellites themselves,
but used to be, and perhaps still are, of importance in de-
termining longitudes, because they are events occurring
at fixed moments of absolute time, and visible in all parts
of the planetary system at the same time, allowance being
made for the interval occupied by the light in travelling.
But as is excellently explained by Sir John Herschel r , the
moment of the event is wanting in definiteness, partly
because the long cone of Jupiter's shadow is surrounded
by a penumbra, and partly because the satellite has itself
a sensible disc, and takes a certain time in entering the
shadow. Different observers using different telescopes
would usually select different moments for that of the
eclipse. But it is evident that the increase of light in
the emersion will proceed according to a law exactly the
reverse of that observed in the immersion, so that if an
observer notes the time of both events with the same tele-
scope, he will be as much too soon in one observation as
he is too late in the other, and the mean moment of the
two observations will represent with considerable accuracy
the time when the satellite is in the middle of the shadow.
The personal error of judgment of the observer is thus
eliminated, provided that he takes care to act at the
emersion as he did at the immersion.
