scale are naturally added together without the slightest
error. There is no difficulty in the precise juxtaposition
of two grammes, but the juxtaposition of two metre mea-
sures can only be effected with tolerable accuracy, by the
use of microscopes and many precautions. Hence, the
extreme trouble and cost attaching to the exact measure-
ment of a base line for a survey, the risk of error entering
at every juxtaposition of the measuring bars, and indefatig-
able attention to all the requisite precautions being neces-
sary throughout the operation z .

In certain cases a peculiar conjunction of circumstances
enables us to dispense more or less with instrumental
aids, and to obtain the most exact numerical results in
the simplest manner. The mere fact, for instance, that
no human being has ever seen a different face of the moon
from that familiar to us, conclusively proves that the
period of rotation of the moon on its own axis is equal
to that of its revolution round the earth. Not only have
we the repetition of these movements during 1000 or
2000 years at least, but we have observations made for
us at very remote periods, free from instrumental error,
no instrument being needed. We learn that the seventh
satellite of Saturn is subject to a similar law, because its
light undergoes a variation in each revolution, owing to
the existence of some dark tract of land ; now this failure
of light always occurs while it is in the same position
relative to Saturn, clearly proving the equality of the
axial and revolutional periods, as Huyghens perceived a .
