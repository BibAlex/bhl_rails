PRINCIPLES OF NUMBER. 183
symbols, but two of these laws seem to be inapplicable
simply because they are presupposed in the definition of
the mathematical unit. Logic thus lays down the con-
ditions of number, and the science of arithmetic developed
as it is into all the wondrous branches of mathematical
calculus is but an outgrowth of logical discrimination.
Principle of Mathematical Inference.
As I have asserted, the universal principle of all
reasoning is that which allows us to substitute like for
like. I have now to point out that in the mathema-
tical sciences this principle is involved in each step of
reasoning. It is in these sciences indeed that we meet
with the clearest cases of substitution, and it is the
simplicity with which the principle can be applied which
probably led to the comparatively early perfection of the
sciences of geometry and arithmetic. Euclid, and the
Greek mathematicians from the first, recognised equality
as the fundamental relation of quantitative thought, but
Aristotle rejected the exactly analogous, but far more
general relation of identity, and thus crippled the formal
science of logic as it has descended to the present day.
Geometrical reasoning starts from the Axiom that
' things equal to the same thing are equal to each other/
Two equalities enable us to infer a third equality ; and this
is true not only of lines and angles, but of areas, volumes,
numbers, intervals of time, forces, velocities, degrees of
intensity, or, in short, anything which is capable of being
equal or unequal. Two stars equally bright with the
same star must be equally bright with each other, and two
forces equally intense with a third force are equally
intense with each other. It is remarkable that Euclid
has not expressly stated two other axioms, the truth of
which is necessarily implied. The second axiom should
