368 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
discover, and, if we arrange the classes in any one order
rather than another, it must be for the purpose of showing
that the combinations are logically complete. It will be
obvious that there are three different possible arrange-
ments which may be of some use ; firstly, that employed
above in which all the combinations containing A stand
first, and those devoid of it follow ; secondly, and thirdly,
the similar arrangements in which the combinations con-
taining B, and C, respectively stand first.
Suppose now that there are but four kinds of objects
possessing the qualities A, B, C, and that these kinds are
represented by the combinations ABC, AbC, aBc, abc.
The order of arrangement will now be of importance ; for
if we place them in the order
fABC
[aBc
JA6C
[abc
placing the B's first and those which are Us last, we shall
perhaps overlook the law of correlation of properties in-
volved. But if we arrange the combinations as follows
JABC
[AbC
faBc
[abc
it becomes apparent at once that where A is, and only
where A is, the property C is to be found, B being in-
differently present and absent. The second arrangement
then would be called a natural one, as rendering mani-
fest the conditions under which the combinations exist.
As a further instance, let us suppose that eight objects
are presented to us for classification, which exhibit combi-
nations of the five properties, A, B, C, D, E, in the follow-
ing manner :
