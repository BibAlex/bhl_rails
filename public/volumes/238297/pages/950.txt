judicious words in a despatch may irritate the national
pride ; the accidental discharge of a gun may precipitate
a collision, the effects of which will last for centuries.
It is said that the history of Europe at one moment

The Theory of Evolution.
Very profound philosophers have lately generalized
concerning the production of living forms and the mental
and moral phenomena regarded as their highest develop-
ment. \ Mr. Herbert Spencer's Theory of Evolution pur-

that not even the rise of a Homer or a Beethoven would
