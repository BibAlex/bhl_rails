158 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
(4) Lastly, there may and does exist knowledge of
phenomena accepted solely on the ground of theory, and
which is incapable of experimental confirmation, at least
with the instrumental means at the time in our pos-
session.
It is a work of much interest to compare and illustrate
in some degree the relative extent and value of these
four groups of knowledge. As a general rule we shall
observe that every great branch of science originates
in facts observed accidentally, or without any distinct
consciousness of what is to be expected. But as science
progresses, its power of foresight rapidly increases, until
the mathematician in his study seems to acquire the
power of anticipating nature, and predicting what will
happen in stated circumstances before the eye of man has
ever witnessed the event.
Empirical Knowledge.
By empirical knowledge we mean such as is derived
directly from the examination of certain detached facts,
and rests entirely on those facts, without corroboration or
connexion with other branches of knowledge. It is con-
trasted to generalised and theoretical knowledge, which
embraces many series of facts under a few simple and
comprehensive principles, so that each series serves to
throw light upon each other series of facts. Just as, in
the map of a half- explored country, we see detached
portions of rivers, isolated mountains, and undefined
plains, not connected into any general plan, so a new
branch of knowledge often consists of groups of facts, each
group standing apart, so as not to allow us to reason from
one part to another.
Before the time of Descartes, and Newton, and Huy-
ghens, there was much empirical knowledge of the
