18 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Expression of Identity and Difference.
To denote the relation of sameness or identity I unhesi-
tatingly adopt the sign = , so long used by mathematicians
to denote equality. This symbol was originally appropri-
ated by Eobert Recorde in his 'Whetstone of Wit/ to
avoid the tedious repetition of the words 'is equal to';
and he chose a pair of parallel lines, because no two things
can be more equal l . The meaning of the sign has how-
ever been gradually extended beyond that of common
equality ; mathematicians have themselves used it to
indicate equivalency of operations. The force of analogy
has been so great that writers in all other branches of
science have more or less employed the same sign. The
philologist indicates by it equivalency of meaning of words :
chemists adopt it to signify the identity in kind and
equality in weight of the elements which form two different
compounds. Not a few logicians, for instance Ploucquet,
Condillac m , George Bentham 11 , Boole, have employed it
as the copula of propositions. Prof, de Morgan declined
to use it for this purpose, but still further extended its
meaning so as to include the equivalency of a proposition
with the premises from which it can be inferred , and
Herbert Spencer has applied it in a like manner P.
Many persons may think that the choice of a symbol is
a matter of slight importance or of mere convenience, but
I hold that the common use of this sign = in so many
different meanings is really founded upon a generalisation
