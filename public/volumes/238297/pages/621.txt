CHAPTER XXIII.
THE USE OF HYPOTHESIS.
IF the views of induction upheld in this work be
correct, all inductive investigation consists in a marriage
of hypothesis and experiment. When facts are already
in our possession, we frame an hypothesis to explain their
mutual relations, and by the success or non-success of this
explanation is the value of the hypothesis to be entirely
judged. In the framing and deductive treatment of such
hypotheses, we must avail ourselves of the whole body
of scientific truth already accumulated, and when once
we have obtained a probable hypothesis, we must not
rest until we have verified it -by comparison with new
facts. By deductive reasoning and calculation, we must
endeavour to anticipate such new phenomena, especially
those of a singular and exceptional nature, as would
necessarily happen if the hypothesis be true. Out of the
infinite number of observations and experiments which are
possible at every moment, theory must lead us to select
those few critical ones which are suitable for confirming
or negativing our anticipations.
This work of inductive investigation cannot be guided
by any system of precise and infallible rules, like those of
deductive reasoning. There is, in fact, nothing to which
we can apply rules of method, because the laws of nature
to be treated must be in our possession before we can
treat them. If, indeed, there were any single rule of
