THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF PHENOMENA. 333
the standard unit until we get a magnitude equal to that
to be measured. Ordinary measurement by a foot rule,
a surveyor's chain, or the excessively careful measurements
of the base line of a trigonometrical survey by standard
bars form a sufficient instance of this case.
In the second case, where p - q, we multiply or divide

a magnitude until we get what is equal to the unit, or to
some magnitude easily comparable with it. As a general
rule the quantities which we desire to measure in
physical science are too small rather than too great for
easy determination, and the problem consists in multiply-
ing them without introducing error. Thus the expansion
of a metallic bar when heated from o C to 100 may be
multiplied by a train of levers or cog wheels. In the
common thermometer the expansion of the mercury is
rendered very apparent, and easily measurable by the
fineness of the tube, and many other cases might be
quoted. There are some phenomena, on the contrary,
which are too great or rapid to come within the easy
range of our senses, and our task is then the opposite
one of diminution. Galileo found it difficult to measure
the velocity of a falling body, owing to the very consider-
able velocity acquired in a single second. He adopted
the elegant device, therefore, of lessening the rapidity
by letting the body roll down an inclined plane, which
enables us to reduce the accelerating force in any required
ratio. The same purpose is effected in the well known
experiments performed on Attwood's machine, and the
measurement of gravity by the pendulum really depends
on the same principle applied in a far more advantageous
manner. Sir Charles Wheatstone has invented a beauti-
ful method of galvanometry for strong currents, which
consists in drawing off from the main current a certain
determinate portion, which is equated by the galvano-
