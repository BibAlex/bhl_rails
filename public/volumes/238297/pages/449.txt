side with a pressure varying according to the depth,
but always in a direction perpendicular to the side.
We may then conceive the whole pressure as exerted
on one point, which will be one-third from the bottom
of the cistern, and may be called the Centre of Pressure.
The Centre of Oscillation of a pendulum, discovered by
Huyghens, is that point at which the whole weight of
the pendulum may be considered as concentrated, without
altering the time of oscillation (see p. 370). Similarly
when one body strikes another the Centre of Percussion
is that point in the striking body at which all its mass
might be concentrated without altering the effect of the
stroke. Mathematicians have also described the Centre
of Gyration, the Centre of Conversion, the Centre of
Friction, &c.
We ought however carefully to distinguish between
those circumstances in which an invariable centre can
be assigned, and those in which it cannot. In perfect
strictness, there is no such thing as a true invariable
centre of gravity. As a general rule a body is capable
of possessing an invariable centre only for perfectly
parallel forces, and gravity never does act in absolutely
parallel lines. Thus, as usual, we find that our concep-
tions are only hypothetically correct, and only approxi-
mately applicable to real circumstances. There are indeed
certain geometrical forms, called Cenfaobaric\ such that
bodies of that shape would attract each other exactly
as if the mass were concentrated at the centre of gravity,
whether the forces act in a parallel manner or not.
Newton shewed that uniform spheres of matter have
this property, and this truth proved of the greatest im-
portance in simplifying his calculations. But it is after
all a purely hypothetical truth, because we can nowhere
meet with, nor can we construct, a perfectly spherical
