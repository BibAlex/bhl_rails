THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
effects upon luminous stars. Thus if one member of a
double star were dark, we could readily detect its exist-
ence, and even estimate its size, position, and motions,
by observing those of its visible companion. It was a
favourite notion of Huyghens that there may exist stars
and vast universes so distant that their light has never
yet had time to reach our eyes ; and we must also bear
in mind that light may possibly suffer slow extinction
in space, so that there is more than one way in which
an absolute limit to the powers of telescopic discovery
may exist.
There are natural limits again to the power of our
senses in detecting undulations of various kinds. It is
commonly said that vibrations of less than sixteen strokes
or more than 38,000 strokes per second are not audible as
sound ; and as some ears actually do hear sounds of much
higher pitch, even two octaves higher than what other
ears can detect, it is exceedingly probable that there
are incessant vibrations which we cannot call sound be-
cause they are never heard. Insects may possibly com-
municate by such acute sounds, constituting a language
inaudible and inscrutable to us ; and the remarkable agree-
ment apparent among bodies of ants or bees might thus
perhaps be explained. Nay, as Fontenelle long ago sug-
gested in his scientific romance, there may exist unlimited
numbers of senses or modes of perception which we can
never feel, though Darwin's theory would render it pro-
bable that any useful means of knowledge in an ancestor
would be developed and improved in the descendants.
We might doubtless have been endowed with a sense
capable of feeling electric phenomena with acuteness, so
that the positive or negative state of charge of a body
could be at once estimated. The absence of such a sense
is probably due to its comparative uselessness.
Heat undulations are subject to the same considerations.
