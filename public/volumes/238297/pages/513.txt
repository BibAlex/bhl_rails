EXPERIMENT. 23
of the earth with its attractive and electric properties ;
the temperature and other powers of the persons pro-
ducing motion ; the radiation from the sun, and to and
from the sky ; the electric excitement possibly existing
in any overhanging cloud ; even the positions of the
heavenly bodies must be mentioned. Now on a priori
grounds it is unsafe to assume that any one of these
circumstances is without effect, and it is only on the
results of experience that we can finally single out those
precise conditions from which the observed heat of friction
proceeds.
The great method of experiment consists in removing,
one at a time, each of those conditions which may be
imagined to have an influence on the result. Our object
in the experiment of rubbing sticks is to discover the
exact circumstances under which heat appears. Now the
presence of air may be requisite ; therefore prepare a
vacuum, and rub the sticks in every respect as before,
except that it is done in vacuo. If heat still appears we
may say that air is not, in the presence of the other
circumstances, a requisite condition. The conduction of
heat from neighbouring bodies may be a condition.
Prevent this by making all the surrounding bodies ice
cold, which is practically what Davy aimed at in rubbing
two pieces of ice together. If heat still appears we have
eliminated another condition, and so we may go on until
it becomes apparent that the expenditure of energy in the
friction of two bodies is the sole condition of the produc-
tion of heat.
The great difficulty of experiment arises from the fact
that we must not assume an independence to exist among
the conditions. Thus previous to experiment we have no
right to say that the rubbing of two sticks will produce
heat in the same way when air is absent as before. We
may have heat produced in one way when air is present,
