454 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
computers had to solve simultaneous equations involving
seventy-seven unknown quantities. The reduction of the
levellings again required the solution of a system of
ninety-one equations. But these vast calculations present
no approach whatever to what would be requisite for the
complete treatment of any one physical problem. The
motion of glaciers is supposed to be moderately well
understood in the present day. A glacier is a viscid,
slowly yielding mass, neither absolutely solid nor abso-
lutely rigid, but it is expressly remarked by Forbes",
that not even an approximate solution of the mathe-
matical conditions of such a moving mass can yet be pos-
sible. * Every one knows/ he says, ' that such problems
are beyond the compass of exact mathematics;' but
though mathematicians may know this, they do not often
enough impress that knowledge on other people.
The problems which are solved in our mathematical
books consist of a small selection of those which happen
from peculiar conditions to be practicable. But the very
simplest problem in appearance will often give rise to
impracticable calculations. Mr. Todhunter seems to
blame Condorcet, because in one of his memoirs he men-
tions a problem to solve which would require
successive integrations. Now if our mathematical sciences
are to pretend to cope with the problems which await solu-
tion, we must be prepared to effect an unlimited number
of successive integrations ; yet at present, and almost
beyond doubt for ever, the probability that even a single
integration, taken haphazard, will be found to come within
our powers is exceedingly small.
