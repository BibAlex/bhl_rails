EXPERIMENT. 25
binations; but this being impracticable, the experimentalist
necessarily abandons strict logical method, and trusts to
his own insight. Analogy, as we shall afterwards see,
gives some assistance, and attention will probably be con-
centrated on those kinds of conditions which have been
found important in like cases. But we are now entirely
in the region of probability, and the experimenter, while
he is confidently pursuing what he thinks the right clue,
may be entirely overlooking the one condition whose im-
portance has been hitherto unsuspected. It is an impres-
sive lesson, for instance, that Newton pursued all his
exquisite researches on the spectrum unsuspicious of the
fact that if he reduced the hole in the shutter to a narrow
slit, all the mysteries of the bright and dark lines were
within his grasp, provided of course that his prisms were
sufficiently good to define the rays. In a similar manner
we know not what slight alteration in the most familiar
experiments may not open the way to realms of new
discovery.
Many additional practical difficulties encumber the pro-
gress of the physicist. It is often impossible to alter one
condition without altering others at the same time ; and
thus we may not get the pure effect of the condition in
question. Some conditions may be absolutely incapable
of alteration ; others may be with great difficulty, or only
in a certain degree, removable. A very treacherous source
of error is the existence of unsuspected conditions, which
we of course cannot remove except by accident. These
difficulties we will shortly consider in succession.
It is often beautiful to observe how the alteration of a
single circumstance conclusively explains a phenomenon.
An excellent instance is found in Faraday's investigation
of the behaviour of Lycopodium spores scattered on a
vibrating plate. It was observed that these minute spores
collected together at the points of greatest motion, whereas
