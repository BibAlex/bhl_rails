GENERALIZATION. 247
Schdnbein. There was a time when the rainbow was an
entirely inexplicable phenomenon, a portent, like a comet,
and a cause of superstitious hopes and fears. But we find
the true spirit of science in Roger Bacon, who desires us
to consider the objects which present the same colours as
the rainbow ; he mentions hexagonal crystals from Ireland
and India, but he bids us not suppose that the hexagonal
form is essential, for similar colours may be detected in
many other transparent stones. Drops of water scattered
by the oar in the sun, the spray from a water-wheel, the
dew-drops lying on the grass in the summer morning,
all display a similar phenomenon d . No sooner have we
grouped together these apparently diverse instances, than
we have begun to generalize, and have acquired a power
of applying to one instance what we can detect of others.
Even when we do riot apply the knowledge gained to
new objects and phenomena, our comprehension of those
already observed is vastly strengthened and deepened by
thus learning to view them as particular cases of one
more general property.
A second process, to which the name of generalization
is equally given, consists in passing from a given fact or
partial law to a multitude of unexamined cases, which
we believe to be subject to the same conditions. Instead
of merely recognising similarity as it is brought before us,
we predict its existence before our senses can detect it, so
that generalization of this kind endows us with a pro-
phetic power of more or less probability. Having ob-
served that many substances assume, <like water and
mercury, the three states of solid, liquid, and gas, and
having assured ourselves by frequent trial that the greater
the means we possess of heating or cooling, the more sub-
stances we can vapourize and freeze, we pass confidently
