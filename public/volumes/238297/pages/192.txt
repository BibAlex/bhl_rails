166 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
assertion concerning them without fear of mistake. Every
bone might be proved to consist of phosphate of lime ;
every cell to enclose a nucleus ; every cave to contain
remains of extinct animals ; every stratum to exhibit signs
of marine origin ; every coin to be of Roman manufacture.
These are cases where our investigation is limited to a
definite portion of matter, or a definite area on the earth's
surface.
There is another class of cases where induction is
naturally and necessarily limited to a definite number of
alternatives. Of the regular solids we can say without
the least doubt that no one has more than twenty faces,
thirty edges, and twenty corners ; for by the principles
of geometry we learn that there cannot exist more than
five regular solids, of each of which we easily observe
that the above statements are true. In the theory of
numbers, an endless variety of perfect inductions might
be made ; we can show that no number less than sixty
possesses so many divisors, and the like is true of 360,
for it does not require any very great amount of labour to
ascertain and count all the divisors of numbers up to sixty
or 360. Similarly I can assert that between 60,041 and
60,077 no prime number occurs, because the exhaustive
examination of those who have constructed tables of prime
numbers proves it to be so.
In matters of human appointment or history, we can
frequently have a complete limitation to the numbers of
instances to be included in an induction. We might show
that none of the other kings of England reigned so long as
George III ; that Magna Charta has not been repealed by
any subsequent statute ; that the propositions of the third
book of Euclid treat only of circles ; that no part of the
works of Galen mentions the fourth figure of the syl-
Wallis's 'Treatise of Algebra' (1685), p. 22.
