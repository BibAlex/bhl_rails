CLASSIFICATION. 413
those- marks, it will then be usually found to include too
many forms ; if the definition be made more particular,
the result is to produce so-called anomalous genera, which,
while they are held to belong to the class, do not in all
respects conform to its definition. The practice has hence
arisen of allowing considerable latitude in the definition
of natural orders. The family of Cruciferae, for instance,
forms an exceedingly well marked natural order, and
among its characters we find it specified that the fruit
is a pod, divided into two cells by a thin partition,
from which the valves generally separate at maturity ;
but we are also informed that, in a few genera, the pod
is one-celled, or indehiscent, or separates transversely into
several joint s m . Now this must either mean that the
formation of the pod is not an essential point in the
definition, or that there are several closely associated
families.
The same holds true of typical classification. The type
itself is an individual, not a class, and no other object can
be exactly like the type. But so soon as we abstract the
individual peculiarities of the type and thus specify a
finite number of qualities in which other objects may
resemble the type, we immediately constitute a class.
If some objects resemble the type in some points and
others in other points, then each definite collection of
points of resemblance constitutes intensively a separate
class. The very notion of classification by types is in
fact erroneous in a strictly logical point of view. The
naturalist is constantly occupied by endeavouring to mark
out definite groups of living forms, where the forms them-
selves do not in many cases admit of any such rigorous
lines of demarcation. A certain laxity of logical method
is thus apt to creep in, the only remedy for which will be
