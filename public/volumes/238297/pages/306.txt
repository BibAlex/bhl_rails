280 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
process we arrive at the conclusion that the actual pro-
bability of C, being the cause is
and the similar probabilities of the existence of C 2 and
C 3 p 2
and
Pi + P 2 + ^3
The sum of these three fractions amounts to unity, which
correctly expresses the certainty that one cause or other
must be in operation.
We may thus state the result in general language.
If it is certain that one or other of the supposed causes
exists, the probability that any one does exist is the
probability that if it exists the event happens, divided by
the sum of all the similar probabilities. There may seem
to be an intricacy in this subject which may prove dis-
tasteful to some readers ; but this intricacy is essential
to the subject in hand. No one can possibly understand
the principles of inductive reasoning, unless he will take
the trouble to master the meaning of this rule, by which
we recede from an event to the probability of each of its
possible causes.
This rule or principle of the indirect method is that
which common sense leads us to adopt almost instinctively,
before we have any comprehension of the principle in its
general form. It is easy to see, too, that it is the rule
which will, out of a great multitude of cases, lead us most
often to the truth, since the most probable cause of an
event really means that cause which in the greatest
number of cases produces the event. But I have only
met with one attempt at a general demonstration of the
principle. Poisson imagines each possible cause of an
event to be represented by a distinct ballot-box, containing
black and white balls, in such ratio that the probability of
a white ball being drawn is equal to that of the event
