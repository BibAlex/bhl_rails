GENERALIZATION. 251
All gases expand by heat, according to the one same law,
and by nearly the same amount ; the specific heats of
equivalent weights are equal, and the densities, though
not the same, are exactly proportional to the atomic
weights. All such gases obey the general law, that the
volume multiplied by the pressure, and divided by the
absolute temperature, is constant or nearly so. The laws
of diffusion and transpiration are the same in all cases,
and, generally speaking, all physical laws, as distinguished
from chemical laws, which apply to one gas apply equally
to all other gases. Even when gases differ in chemical or
physical properties, the differences are minor in degree
or number. Thus the differences of viscosity are far less
marked than in the liquid and solid states. Nearly all
gases, again, are colourless, the exceptions being chlorine,
the vapours of iodine, bromine, and some other sub-
stances.
Only in one single point, so far as I am aware, do gases
present distinguishing marks unknown, or nearly so, in
the solid and liquid states. I mean as regards the
light given off when incandescent. Each gas, when suf-
ficiently heated, yields its own peculiar series of rays,
arising from the free vibrations of the constituent parts
of the molecules when pursuing separate paths. Hence
the possibility of distinguishing gases by the spectro-
scope. But the molecules of solids and liquids appear
to be continually in conflict with each other, so that
only a confused noise of atoms is produced, instead of a
definite series of luminous chords. At the same tempera-
ture, accordingly, all solids and liquids give off nearly
the same rays when strongly heated, and we have in
this case a single exception to the general rule of the
greater generality of properties in gases.
Liquids are in many ways intermediate in character
between gases and solids. While incapable of possessing
