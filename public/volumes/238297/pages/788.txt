298 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
between the Copernican, and Ptolemaic systems, it was
analogy which furnished the most satisfactory arguments.
Galileo discovered, by the use of his new telescope, the
four small satellites which circulate round Jupiter, and
make a miniature planetary world. These four Medi-
cean Stars, as they were called, were plainly seen to re-
volve round Jupiter in various periods, but approximately
in one plane, and astronomers irresistibly inferred that
what might happen on the smaller scale might also be
found true of the greater planetary system. This dis-
covery gave the holding turn, as Sir John Herschel has
expressed it, to the opinions of mankind. Even Francis
Bacon, who had, in a manner little to the credit of his
scientific sagacity, previously opposed the Copernican
views, now became partially convinced, saying ' We affirm
the solisequium of Venus and Mercury ; since it has been
found by Galileo that Jupiter also has attendants.' Nor
did Huyghens think it superfluous to adopt the analogy
as a valid argument k . Even in an advanced stage of the
science of physical astronomy, the Jovian system has not
lost its analogical interest ; for the mutual perturbations
of the four satellites pass through all their phases within
a few centuries, and thus enable us to verify in a minia-
ture case the principles of stability, which Laplace has
established for the great planetary system. Oscillations
or disturbances which in the motions of the planets appear
to be secular, because their periods extend over millions
of years, can be watched, in the case of Jupiter's satellites,
through complete revolutions within the historical periods
of astronomy 1 .
In obtaining a knowledge of the stellar universe we
must depend much upon somewhat precarious analogies.
We must start with the opinion, entertained by Bruno as
