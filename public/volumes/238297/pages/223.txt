COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS. 197
one for the case in which all the letters would be
absent. But the formation of our vocal organs prevents
our using the far greater part of these conjunctions of
letters. At least one vowel must be present in each word;
more than two consonants cannot usually be brought to-
gether ; and to produce words capable of smooth utterance
a number of other rules must be observed. To determine
exactly how many words might exist in the English
language under these circumstances, would be an exceed-
ingly complex problem, the solution of which has never
been attempted. The number of existing English words
may perhaps be said not to exceed one hundred thousand,
and it is only by investigating the combinations presented
in the dictionary, that we can learn the Laws of Euphony
or calculate the possible number. In this example we
have an epitome of the work and method of science. The
combinations of natural phenomena are limited by a great
number of conditions which are in no way brought to our
knowledge except so far as they are disclosed in the ex-
amination of nature.
It is often a very difficult matter to determine the
numbers of permutations or combinations which may
exist under various restrictions. Many learned men
puzzled themselves in former centuries over what were
called Protean verses, or Latin verses admitting many
variations in accordance with the Laws of Metre. The
most celebrated of these verses was that invented by
Bernard Bauhusius, as follows a :
' Tot tibi sunt dotes, Virgo, quot sidera ccelo.'
One author, Ericius Puteanus, filled forty- eight pages of
a work in reckoning up its possible transpositions, making
them only 1022. Other calculators gave 2196, 3276, 2580
as their results. Dr. Wallis assigned 3096, but without
