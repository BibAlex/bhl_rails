EXCEPTIONAL PHENOMENA. 335
always been so, but have, in wandering through space,
been entangled in our system and retained by the attrac-
tive influence of Jupiter, or one of the other larger planets.
We must then limit the statement of the law of uniform
direction to bodies which are derived from the original
constituents of the nebulous mass.
Limiting exceptions occur most frequently in the natural
sciences of Botany, Zoology, Geology, &c., the laws of
which are almost wholly empirical. In innumerable in-
stances the confident belief of one generation has been
falsified by the wider observation of a succeeding one.
Aristotle confidently held that all swans are white 1, and
the proposition seemed true until not a hundred years
ago black swans were discovered in Western Australia.
At one time all the animal remains discovered in the
Scottish Old Bed Sandstone were fishes or shells, until
at last a single small air-breathing reptile occurred oppor-
tunely to prevent any hasty conclusions 1 ". In zoology and
physiology we may expect a fundamental identity to exist
in the vital processes, but continual discoveries show that
there is no limit to the apparently anomalous expedients
by which life is reproduced. Alternate generation, fer-
tilization for several successive generations, hermaphro-
ditism, are opposed to . all we should expect from
induction founded upon the higher animals. But such
phenomena are only limiting exceptions showing that
what is true of one class is not true of another. In
certain of the cephalopoda we meet the extraordinary
fact that an arm of the male is cast off and lives inde-
pendently until it encounters the female.
