INTRODUCTION.
Consciousness would almost seem to consist in the break
between one state of mind and the next, just as an
induced current of electricity arises from the beginning
or the ending of the primary current. We are always
engaged in discrimination ; and the rudiment of thought
which exists in the lower animals probably consists in
their power of feeling difference and being agitated by
its occurrence.
But had we power of discrimination only, Science could
not be created. To know that one feeling differs from
another gives purely negative information. It cannot teach
us what will happen. Each sensation would stand out dis-
tinct from any other, and there would be no tie, no bridge
of affinity between them. We want a unifying power by
which the present and the future may be linked to the
past ; and this seems to be accomplished by a different
power of mind. Francis Bacon has pointed out that dif-
ferent men possess in very different degrees the powers of
discrimination and identification. It may be said indeed
that discrimination necessarily implies the opposite process
of identification ; and so it doubtless does in superficial
points. But there is a rare property of mind which
consists in penetrating the disguise of variety and seizing
the common elements of sameness ; and it is this pro-
perty which furnishes the true measure of intellect. The
very name of intellect (interligo) expresses the action, not
of separating, but of uniting and binding together the
particular and various into the general and like. Logic
is but another name for the same process b , the peculiar
work of reason ; and Plato said of this unifying power,
that if he met the man who could detect the one in the
many, he would follow him as a god.
