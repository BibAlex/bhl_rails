mind must follow in solving the question. Although
thought may seem to outstrip the rapidity with which the
symbols can be written down, yet the mind does not really
follow a different course from that indicated by the sym-
bols. For a fuller explanation of this natural system of
Numerically Definite Reasoning, with more abundant
illustrations and an analysis of De Morgan's Numerically
Definite Syllogism, I must refer the reader to the paper in
the Memoirs of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical
Society, as already referred to, portions of which, how-
ever, have been embodied in the present section.
The reader may be referred, also, to Boole's writings
upon the subject in the t Laws of Thought,' chap. xix.
p. 295, and in a paper on ' Propositions Numerically De-
finite,' communicated by De Morgan, in 1868, to the
Cambridge Philosophical Society, and printed in their
1 Transactions,' vol. xi. part ii. Mr. Alexander J. Ellis
treats the same subject in his ' Contributions to Formal
Logic/ read to the Eoyal Society, in March, 1872, but
as yet published only in the form of a brief abstract, in
the Proceedings of the Society, vol. xx. p. 307.
