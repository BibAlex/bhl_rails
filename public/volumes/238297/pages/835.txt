CLASSIFICATION. 345
the logical nature of the operation is, or should be, exactly
the same in both cases. We form a class of figures called
parallelograms, and we form a general notion of Trilo-
bites.
Science, it has been said at the outset, is the detection
of identity, and classification is the placing together, either
in thought or in actual proximity of space, those notions
or objects between which identity has been detected. Ac-
cordingly the value of classification is co-extensive with;
the value of science and general reasoning. Whenever
we form a class we reduce multiplicity to unity, and
detect, as Plato said, the one in the many. The result
of such classification is to yield generalized knowledge, as
distinguished from the direct and sensuous knowledge of
particular facts. Of every class, so far as it is correctly
formed, the great principle of substitution is true, and
whatever we know of one object in a class we also know
of the other objects, so far as identity has been detected
between them. The facilitation and abbreviation of mental
labour is at the bottom of all mental progress. The
reasoning faculties of Newton were not different in quali-
tative character from those of a ploughman; the difference
lay in the extent to which they were exerted, and the
number of facts which could be treated. Every thinking
being generalizes more or less, but it is the depth and
extent of his generalizations which distinguish the philo-
sopher. Now it is the exertion of the classifying and
generalizing powers which thus enables the intellect of
man to cope in some degree with the infinite number and
variety of natural phenomena and objects. In the chapters
upon Combinations and Permutations it was rendered quite
evident, that from a few elementary differences immense
numbers of various combinations can be produced. The
process of classification enables us to resolve these com-
binations, and refer each one to its place according to
