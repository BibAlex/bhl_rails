cause. Accordingly whenever we find any two phenomena
which do proceed, time after time, through changes of
exactly the same period, there is much probability that
they are connected. It was in this manner, doubtless, that
Pliny correctly conjectured that the cause of the tides
lay in the sun and moon, the intervals between suc-
cessive high tides being equal to the intervals between
the moon's passage across the meridian. Kepler and
Descartes too admitted .the connection previous to
Newton's demonstration of its precise nature. When
Bradley discovered the apparent motion of the stars
arising from the aberration of light, he was soon able to
attribute it to the earth's annual motion, because it went
through all its phases in exactly a year.
The most extensive and beautiful instance of induction
concerning periodic changes which can be cited, is that of
the discovery of an eleven-year period in various meteoro-
logical arid astronomical phenomena. It would be difficult
to mention any two things apparently more disconnected
than the spots upon the sun and auroras. As long ago as
1826, Schwabe, of Dessau, commenced a regular series of
observations of the spots upon the sun, which has been
continued to the present time, and he was able to show
that at intervals of about eleven years the spots increased
much in size and number. Hardly was this discovery
made known, than Dr. Lamont pointed out a nearly equal
period of variation in the magnetic needle as regards
declination. The occasional magnetic storms or sudden
irregular disturbances of the needle were next shown to
take place most frequently at the times when sun spots
were prevalent, and as auroras are generally coincident
with magnetic storms, these strange phenomena were
brought into the cycle x . It has since been shown by
