QUANTITATIVE INDUCTION. 119
Engraved sheets of paper ready prepared for the draw-
ing of curves may be obtained from Mr. Stanford, at
6 and 7 Charing Cross, or from Messrs. W. and A. K
Johnston, of London and Edinburgh. When we do
not require great accuracy, paper ruled by the common
machine-ruler into equal squares of about one-fifth or one-
sixth of an inch square will serve well enough. I have
found Vere Foster's Exercise Book, No. 1 2 m , which is
ruled in this way, very useful for statistical or other
numerical purposes. I have also met with engineers' and
surveyors' memorandum books ruled with one-twelfth inch
squares. When a number of complicated curves have to
be drawn, I have found it best to rule a good sheet of
drawing paper with lines carefully adjusted at the most
convenient distances, and then to prick the points of the
curve through it upon another sheet fixed underneath.
In this way we obtain an accurate curve upon a blank
sheet, and need only introduce such division lines as are
requisite to the understanding of the curve.
In some cases our numerical results will correspond,
not to the height of single ordinates, but to the area of
the curve between two ordinates, or the average height of
ordinates between certain limits. If we measure, for
instance, the quantities of heat absorbed by water when
raised in temperature from o to 5, from 5 to 10, and so
on, these quantities will really be represented by areas of
the curve denoting the specific heat of water; and, since
the specific heat varies continuously between every two
points of temperature, we shall not get the correct curve
by simply laying off the quantities of heat at the mean
temperatures, namely 2^, 7^, and so on. Mr. J. W.
Strutt has shown that if we have drawn such an incorrect
curve, we can with little trouble correct it by a simple
