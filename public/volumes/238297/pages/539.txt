EXPERIMENT. 49
geological changes is like a mere point in the infinite pro-
gression of time. When we know that rain water falling
on limestone will carry away a minute portion of the
rock in solution, we do not hesitate to multiply that quan-
tity by millions and millions, and assert that in course of
time a mountain may be dissolved away. We have actual
experience concerning the rise of land in some parts of
the globe and its fall in others to the extent of some feet.
Do we hesitate to infer what may thus be done in course
of geological ages I As Gabriel Plattes long ago re-
marked, c The sea never resting, but perpetually winning
land in one place and losing in another, doth shew what
may be done in length of time by a continual operation,
not subject unto ceasing or intermission' 11 . The action
of physical circumstances upon the forms and characters
of animals by natural selection is subject to exactly the
same remarks. As regards animals living in a state of
nature the change of circumstances which can be ascer-
tained to have occurred is so indefinitely slight, that we
could not expect to observe any change in those animals
whatever. Nature has made no experiment at all for us
within historical times. Man, however, by taming and
domesticating dogs, cats, horses, oxen, &c., has made con-
siderable change in their circumstances, and we find con-
siderable change also in their forms and character. Sup-
posing the state of domestication to continue unchanged,
these new forms would continue permanent so far as we
know, and in this sense they are permanent. Thus the
arguments against Darwin's theory, founded on the non-
observation of natural changes within the historical period,
are of the weakest character, being purely negative.
