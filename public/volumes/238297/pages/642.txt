more slowly in glass than in air^. More recently, in 1850,
Fizeau and Foucault independently measured the velocity
of light in air and water by a revolving mirror, and found
that the velocity is greater in air r . There are indeed a
number of other points at which experience decides
against Newton, and in favour of Huyghens and Young.
Euler rejected the Corpuscular theory because particles
of matter moving with the immense velocity of light
must possess great momentum, of which there is no
evidence in fact 5 . Bennet concentrated the light and heat
of the sun upon a body so delicately suspended that an
exceedingly small amount of momentum must have been
rendered apparent, but there was no such effect*. This
experiment, indeed, is of a negative kind, and is not
absolutely conclusive, unless we could estimate the mo-
mentum which Newton's theory would require to be
present (see vol. ii. p. 45) ; but there are other difficulties.
Laplace pointed out that the attraction supposed to exist
between matter and the corpuscular particles of light,
would cause the velocity of light to vary with the size of
the emitting body, so that if a star were 250 times as
great in diameter as our sun, its attraction would prevent
the emanation of light altogether u . But so far as experi-
ence shows, the velocity of light is uniform, and inde-
pendent of the magnitude of the emitting body, as it should
be according to the undulatory theory. Lastly, Newton's
explanation of diffraction or inflection fringes of colours
was only plausible, and not true ; for Fresnel ascertained
that the dimensions of the fringes are not what they
would be according to Newton's theory.
