THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF PHENOMENA. 329
to different results.- We may sometimes overcome this
difficulty to a certain extent, by observations repeated in
a special manner, as we shall afterwards- see ; but when
possible, we should choose opportunities for measure-
ment when precise definition is easy. The moment of
occultation of a star by the moon can be observed with
great accuracy, because the star disappears with perfect
suddenness ; but there are many other astronomical con-
junctions, eclipses, transits, &c., which occupy a certain
length of time in happening, and thus open the way to
differences of opinion. It would be impossible to observe
with precision the movements of a body possessing no
definite points of reference. The spots on the sun, for
instance, furnish the only direct criterion of its rotation,
and the possibility that these spots have a tendency to
move in one direction throws a doubt upon all deter-
minations of the sun's axial movement.
The colours of the complete spectrum shade with perfect
continuity into each other, so that their separation is
entirely an arbitrary matter. Exact determinations of
refractive indices would have been impossible, had we not
the fixed dark lines of the solar spectrum as precise points
for measurement, or, what comes to the same thing, various
kinds of homogeneous light, such as that of sodium, pos-
sessing a nearly uniform length of vibration.
In the second place, we cannot measure accurately
unless we have the means either of multiplying or dividing
a quantity without considerable error, so that we may
correctly equate one magnitude with the multiple or sub-
multiple of the other. In some cases we operate upon the
quantity to be measured, and bring it into accurate coin-
cidence with the actual standard, as when in photometry
we vary the distance of our luminous body, until its
illuminating power at a certain point is equal to that of a
standard lamp. In other cases we repeat the unit until it
