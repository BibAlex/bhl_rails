THE USE OF HYPOTHESIS. 153
Although the Science of Light presents us with the
most beautiful examples of crucial experiments and ob-
servations, instances are not wanting in other branches of
science. Copernicus asserted in opposition to the ancient
Ptolemaic theory that the earth and planets moved round
the sun, and he predicted that if ever the sense of sight
could be rendered sufficiently acute and powerful, we
should see phases in Mercury and Venus. Galileo with
his telescope was able, in 1610, to verify the prediction as
regards Venus, and subsequent observations of Mercury
lead to a like conclusion. The discovery of the aberra-
tion of light added a new proof, still further strengthened
by the more recent determination of the parallax of fixed
stars. Hooke proposed to prove the existence of the
earth's diurnal motion by observing the deviation of a
falling body, an experiment successfully accomplished by
Benzenberg ; and Foucault's pendulum has since fur-
nished an additional indication of the same motion, which
is indeed also apparent in the direction of the trade winds.
All these are crucial facts in favour of the Copernican
theory.
Davy's discovery of potassium and sodium in 1 807 was
a good instance of a crucial experiment ; for it decisively
confirmed Lavoisier's views, and at the same time nega-
tived the ancient notions of phlogiston.

Descriptive Hypotheses.
There are some, or probably many, hypotheses which
we may call descriptive hypotheses, and which serve for
little else than to furnish convenient names. When a
certain phenomenon is of an unusual and mysterious kind,
we cannot even speak of it without using some analogy.
Every word implies some resemblance between the thing
to which it is applied, and some other thing, which fixes
