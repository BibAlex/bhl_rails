CLASSIFICATION. 355
with considerable confidence, but he has also pointed out
that such inferences are likely from time to time to prove
mistaken. I will quote his own words :
* If a fragmentary fossil be discovered, consisting of no
more than a ramus of a mandible, and that part of the
skull with which it articulated, a knowledge of this law
may enable the palaeontologist to affirm, with great con-
fidence, that the animal of which it formed a part
suckled its young, and had non-nucleated red blood-cor-
puscles ; and to predict that should the back part of that
skull be discovered, it will exhibit two occipital condyles
and a well-ossified basi-occipital bone.
' Deductions of this kind, such as that made by Cuvier
in the famous case of the fossil opossum of Montmartre,
have often been verified, and are well calculated to im-
press the vulgar imagination ; so that they have taken
rank as the triumphs of the anatomist. But it should
carefully be borne in mind, that, like all merely empirical
laws, which rest upon a comparatively narrow observa-
tional basis, the reasoning from them may at any time
break down. If Cuvier, for example, had had to do with a
fossil Thylacinus instead of a fossil Opossum, he would
not have found the marsupial bones, though the inflected
angle of the jaw would have been obvious enough. And
so, though, practically, any one who met with a character-
istically mammalian jaw would be justified in expecting
to find the characteristically mammalian occiput associ-
ated with it ; yet, he would be a bold man indeed, who
should strictly assert the belief which is implied in this
expectation, viz., that at no period of the world's history
did animals exist which combined a mammalian occiput
with a reptilian jaw, or vice versa!
One of the most distinct and remarkable instances of
correlation in the animal world is that which occurs in
ruminating animals, and which could not be better stated
