54 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
The speed of electricity in passing through a conductor
mainly depends upon the inductive capacity of the sur-
rounding substances, and, except for technical or special
purposes, there is little use in measuring velocities which
in some cases are one hundred times as great as in other
cases. But the maximum speed of electric conduction is
probably a constant quantity of great scientific importance,
and according to Prof. Clerk Maxwell's determination in
1868 is 174,800 miles per second, or little less than that
of light. The true boiling point of water is a point on
which all practical thermometry depends, and it is highly
important to determine that point in relation to the ab-
solute thermometric scale. But when water free from air
and impurity is heated there seems to be no definite limit
to the temperature it may reach, a temperature of 356
Fahr. having been actually observed. Such temperatures,
therefore, do not require very accurate measurement. All
meteorological measurements depending on the accidental
condition of the sky are of infinitely less importance than
physical measurements in which such accidental conditions
do not intervene. Many profound investigations depend
upon our knowledge of the radiant energy continually
poured upon the earth by the sun ; but this must be
measured when the sky is perfectly clear, and the absorp-
tion of the atmosphere at its minimum. The slightest
interference of cloud destroys the value of such a measure-
ment, except for meteorological purposes, which are of
vastly less generality and importance. It is seldom use-
ful, again, to measure such a quantity as the height of
a snow-covered mountain within a foot, when the thick-
ness of the snow alone may cause it to vary 25 feet or
more, when in short the height itself is indefinite to that
extent 6 .
