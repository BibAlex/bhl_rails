PRINCIPLES OF NUMBER. 181
Similarly, just as in logic
triangle or square - square or triangle,
or generally A I B = B I A,
so in quantity 2+3 = 34-2,
or generally x + y = y + x.
The symbol I is not identical with + , but it is so far
analogous.
How far, now, is it true that mathematical symbols
obey the law of simplicity expressed in the form
or the example
Bound round = round \
Apparently there are but two numbers which obey this
law ; for it is certain that
x x x x
is true only in the two cases when x = i or o.
In reality all numbers obey the law, for 2 x 2 = 2 is not
really analogous to AA = A. According to the definition
of a unit already given, each unit is discriminated from
each other in the same problem, so that in 2' x 2 ', the
first two involves a different discrimination from the
second two. I get four kinds of things, for instance, if I
first discriminate ' heavy and light ' and then ' cubical and
spherical/ for we now have the following classes
heavy, cubical. light, cubical.
heavy, spherical. light, spherical.
But suppose that my two classes are in both cases
discriminated by the same difference of light and heavy,
then we have
heavy heavy = heavy,
heavy light = o,
light heavy = o,
light light = light.
In short, twice two is two unless we take care that the!
second two has a different meaning from the first. But
