144 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
usually be in operation at the same time, the effects of
which are complicated together. The only modes of dis-
covery consist either in exhaustively trying a great number
of supposed laws, a process which is exhaustive in more
senses than one, or else by carefully contemplating the
effects, endeavouring to remember cases in which like
effects followed from known laws. However we accom-
plish the disco very , it must be done by the more or less
apparent application of the direct process of deduction.
The Logical Abecedarium illustrates induction as well as
it does deduction. In the Indirect process of Inference we
found that from certain propositions we could infallibly
determine the combinations of terms agreeing with those
premises. The inductive problem is just the inverse.
Having given certain combinations of terms, we need to
ascertain the propositions with which they are consistent,
and from which they may have proceeded. Now if the
reader contemplates the following combinations
ABC abC
aEC abc,
he will probably remember at once that they belong to the
premises A = AB, B = BO. If not, he will require a few
trials before he meets with the right answer, arid every
trial will consist in assuming certain laws and observing
whether the deduced results agree with the data. To test
the facility with which he can solve this inductive pro-
blem, let him casually strike out any of the combinations,
say of the fourth column of the Abecedarium (p. 109), and
say what laws the remaining combinations obey, observing
that every one of the letter-terms and their negatives
ought to appear in order to avoid self-contradiction in the
premises (pp. 88, 128). Let him say, for instance, what
laws are embodied in the combinations
ABC aBC
Kbc alG.
