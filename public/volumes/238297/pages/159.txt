THE EQUIVALENCY OF PROPOSITIONS. 133
be true at the same time ; ' All men are immortals ' is of
course contradictory.
One sufficient test of equivalency is the capability of
mutual inference. Thus from
All electrics = all non-conductors,
I can infer
All non-electrics = all conductors,
and vice versa from the latter I can pass back to the
former. In short A = B is equivalent to a = b. Again,
from the union of the two propositions, A AB and
B AB, I get A = B, and from this I might as easily
deduce the two with which I started. In this case one
proposition is equivalent to two other propositions. There
are indeed no less than four modes in which we may
express the identity of two classes A and B, namely,
FIRST MODE. SECOND MODE. THIRD MODE. FOURTH MODE.
7 A = AB1
a = T> A-n f
B AB J
The Indirect Method of Inference furnishes an universal
and clear criterion as to the relationship of propositions.
The import of a statement is always to be measured by
the combinations of terms which it destroys. Hence two
propositions are exactly equivalent when they remove
exactly the same combinations from the Abecedarium,
and neither more nor less. A proposition is inferrible
but not equivalent to another when it removes some but
not all the combinations which the other removes. Again,
propositions are consistent provided that they leave some
one combination containing each term, and the negative
of each term. If after all the combinations inconsistent
with two propositions are struck out, there still appears
in the Abecedarium each of the letters A, a, B, I, C, c, D, d,
which were there before, then no inconsistency between
the propositions exists, although they may not be equiva-
lent or even inferrible. Finally, contradictory propositions
A -p 7 = a = ab\
A = D a = A- -L ~L\
b = ab J
