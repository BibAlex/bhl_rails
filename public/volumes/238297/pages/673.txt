adduced. The usual agent by which we melt or liquefy
a substance is heat ; but if we can melt a substance
without heat, then we may expect the negative of heat
as an effect. This is the foundation of all freezing mix-
tures. The affinity of salt for water causes it to melt
snow or ice, and may thus reduce the temperature
to Fahrenheit's zero. Calcium chloride has so much
higher an attraction for water that a temperature of
50 Fahr. may thus be attained. Even the solution of
a certain alloy of lead, tin, and bismuth in mercury, may
be made to reduce the temperature from 63 to 14 Fahr.
All the other modes of producing cold are inversions of
more familiar uses of heat. Carre's freezing machine is
an inverted distilling apparatus, the distillation being
occasioned by chemical affinity instead of heat. Another
kind of freezing machine is the exact inverse of the
steam engine.
A very paradoxical effect is due to another inversion.
It is hard to believe at the first moment that a current
of steam at 212 could raise a body of liquid to a higher
temperature than the steam itself possesses. But Mr.
Spence has pointed out that if the boiling-point of a saline
solution be above 212, it will continue, on account of its
affinity for water, to condense steam when above 212
in temperature. It will condense the steam until heated
to the point at which the tension of its vapour is equal
to that of the atmosphere, that is, its own boiling-points.
Since heat, again, melts ice, we might expect to produce
heat by the inverse change from water into ice. Now this
is accomplished in the phenomenon of suspended freezing.
Water may be cooled in a clean glass vessel many degrees
below the freezing-point, and yet retained in the liquid
condition. But if disturbed, and especially if brought
into contact with a small particle of ice, it immediately
