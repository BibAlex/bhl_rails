THE LOGICAL ABACUS. 119
must be either granite or not, and vice versd, the premises
fail to give us any information on the point, that is to say
the Method of Indirect Inference saves us from falling
into any fallacious conclusions. This example sufficiently
illustrates both the fallacy of Negative premises and that
of Undistributed Middle of the old logic (pp. 75-77).
The fallacy called the Illicit Process of the Major Term
is also incapable of commission in following the rules of
the method. Our example was (p. 77)
All planets are subject to gravity, (i)
Fixed stars are not planets. (2)
The false conclusion is that ' fixed stars are not subject to
gravity/ The terms are
A = planet
B = fixed star
C = subject to gravity.
And the premises are A = AC, (i)
B= aB. (a)
The combinations which remain uncontradicted on com-
parison with these premises are
aBC abG
abc.
For fixed star we have the description
B = aBC -I- aBc,
that is, ' a fixed star is not a planet, but is either subject
or not, as the case may be, to gravity/
The Logical Abacus.
The Indirect Method of Inference has now been suffi-
ciently described, and a careful examination of its powers
will show that it is capable of giving a full analysis and
solution of every question involving any simply logical
relations. The chief difficulty of the method consists in
the great number of combinations which may have to
