126 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
of science, no precise laws have yet been detected. The
tension of aqueous vapour at different temperatures has
been determined by a succession of eminent experimenta-
lists, Dalton, Kaemtz, Dulong, Arago, Magnus, and Keg-
nault, and by the last mentioned the measurements, were
conducted with all accuracy apparently attainable at pre-
sent. Yet no incontestible general law has been esta-
blished. Several functions have been proposed to express
the elastic force of the vapour as depending on the tempe-
rature. The first general form is that of Young, namely
F = (a + 1} t) m , in which a, b and m are unknown quanti-
ties to be determined by comparison with observation.
Roche has proposed, on theoretical grounds, a complicated
formula of an exponential form, and a third form of func-
tion is that of Biot, as follows log F = a + ba t + c /3* u .
I mention these formulae particularly, because they well
illustrate the feeble powers of empirical inquiry. None
of the formulae can be made to correspond exactly with
experimental results, and the last two forms correspond
nearly equally well. But there is very little probability
that the real law has been reached, and it is highly
unlikely that it will be discovered except by deduction
from mechanical theory.
The same remarks may be made upon any other laws
except those of the most simple character. A vast amount
of the most ingenious labour has been spent upon the
discovery of some general law of atmospheric refraction.
Tycho Brahe and Kepler commenced the inquiry : Cassini
first formed a table of refractions, calculated on theoretical
grounds : Newton entered into some profound investiga-
tions upon the subject : Brooke Taylor, Bouguer, Simpson,
Bradley, Mayer, and Kramp successively attacked the ques-
tion, which is of the highest practical importance as regards
the correction of astronomical observations. Laplace next
