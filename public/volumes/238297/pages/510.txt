20 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
it, we have a conclusive negative proofs. On this account,
as it has been well said, false facts in science are more
mischievous than false theories. A false theory is open to
every person's criticism, and is ever liable to be judged by
its accordance with facts. But a false or grossly erroneous
assertion of a fact often stands in the way of science for a
long time, because it may be extremely difficult or even
impossible to prove the falsity of what has been once
recorded.
In other sciences the force of a negative argument will
often depend upon the number of possible alternatives which
may exist. Thus it was long believed that the character
or quality of a musical sound, as distinguished from its
pitch must depend upon the form of the undulation, be-
cause no other cause of it had ever been suggested or was
apparently possible. The truth of the conclusion was
proved by Helmholtz, who applied a microscope to lu-
minous points attached to the strings of various instru-
ments, and thus actually observed the different modes of
undulation 2 .
In mathematics negative inductive arguments have
seldom much force, because the possible forms of expres-
sion, or the possible combinations of lines and circles in
geometry are quite unlimited in number. An enormous
number of attempts were made to trisect the angle by the
ordinary methods of Euclid's geometry, but their in-
variable failure did not establish the impossibility of the
task. This was shown in a totally different manner, by
proving that the problem involves an irreducible cubic
equation to which there could be no corresponding plain
geometrical solution a . This is a case of reductio ad
absurdum, a form of argument of a totally different
