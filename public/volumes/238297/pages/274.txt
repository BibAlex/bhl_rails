248 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
data required for the estimation of probabilities are too
complicated and difficult to obtain. But such failures in
110 way dimmish the truth and beauty of the theory itself;
for in reality there is no branch of science in which, as we
shall afterwards folly consider, our symbols can cope with
the complexity of Nature. As the late Professor Donkin
excellently said,
* I do not see on what ground it can be doubted that
every definite state of belief concerning a proposed
hypothesis, is in itself capable of being represented
by a numerical expression, however difficult or im-
practicable it may be to ascertain its actual value. It
would be very difficult to estimate in numbers the vis
viva of all the particles of a human body at any instant ;
but no one doubts that it is capable of numerical ex-

The difficulty, in short, is merely relative to^our_know-
ledge and skill, and is not absolute or inherent in the
subject. We must distinguish between what~ls~tKeo-
reticaUy conceivable and what is practicable with our
present mental resources. Provided that our aspirations
are pointed in a right direction, we must not allow them
to be damped by the consideration that they pass beyond
what can now be turned to immediate use. In spite of
its immense difficulties of application, and the aspersions
which have been mistakenly cast upon it, the theory of
probabilities, I repeat, is the noblest, as it will in course
of time prove, perhaps the most fruitful branch of mathe-
matical science. It is the very guide of life, and hardly
can we take a step or make a decision of any kind without
correctly or incorrectly making an estimation of proba-
bilities. In the next chapter we proceed to consider how
the whole cogency of inductive reasoning, as applied to
