380 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Natural Constants and Numbers.
Having acquired accurate measuring instruments, and
decided upon the units in which the results shall be
estimated and expressed, there remains the question,
What use shall be made of our powers of measurement 1
Our principal object must be to discover general quanti-
tative laws of nature ; but a very large amount of pre-
liminary labour is employed in the accurate determination
of the dimensions of existing objects, and the numerical
relations between diverse forces and phenomena. Step
by step every part of the material universe is surveyed
and brought into known relations with other parts. Each
manifestation of energy is correlated with each other kind
of manifestation. Professor Tyndall has described the care
with which such operations are conducted b .
'Those who are unacquainted with the details of
scientific investigation, have no idea of the amount of
labour expended on the determination of those numbers
on which important calculations or inferences depend.
They have no idea of the patience shown by a Berzelius
in determining atomic weights ; by a Eegnault in deter-
mining coefficients of expansion ; or by a Joule in deter-
mining the mechanical equivalent of heat. There is a
morality brought to bear upon such matters which, in
point of severity, is probably without a parallel in any
other domain of intellectual action.'
Every new natural constant which is recorded brings
many fresh inferences within our power. For if n be the
number of such constants known, then \ (n 2 n) is the
number of ratios which are within our powers of cal-
culation, and this increases with the square of n. We
thus gradually piece together a map of nature, in which
the lines of inference from one phenomenon to another
