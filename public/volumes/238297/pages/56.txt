30 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
they are at once like and unlike. Two fragments of
rock may differ entirely in outward form, yet they may
have the same colour, hardness, and texture. Flowers
which agree in colour may differ in odour. The mind
learns to regard each object as an aggregate of qualities,
and acquires the power of dwelling at will upon one or
other of those qualities to the exclusion of the rest.
Logical abstraction, in short, comes into play, and the
mind becomes capable of reasoning, not merely about
objects which are physically complete and concrete, but
about things which may be thought of separately in
the mind though they exist not separately in nature.
We can think of the hardness of a rock, or the colour
of a flower, and thus produce abstract notions, denoted
by abstract terms which will form a subject for further
consideration.
At the same time arise general notions and classes of
objects. We cannot fail to observe that the quality
hardness exists in many objects, for instance in many
fragments of rock ; and mentally joining these we create
the class hard object, which will include, not only the
actual objects examined, but all others which may
happen to agree with them as they agree with each
other. As our senses cannot- possibly report to us all
the contents of space, we cannot usually set any limits
to the number of objects which may fall into any such
class. At this point we begin to perceive the power and
generality of thought which enables us at once to treat
of indefinitely or even infinitely numerous objects. We
can safely assert that whatever is true of any one object
coming under a general notion or class is true of any of
the other objects so far as they possess the common
qualities implied in their belonging to the class. We
must not place an individual thing in a class unless we
are prepared to believe of it all that is believed of the
