DEDUCTIVE REASONING. 63
the ancient Greek ^aX/co? is our copper, then it must be
the French cuivre, the German kupfer, the Latin cuprum,
because -these are words, in one sense at least, equivalent
to copper. Whenever we can give two definitions or
expressions for the same term, the formula applies ; thus
Senior defined wealth as ' whatever is transferable, limited
in supply, and productive of pleasure or preventive of
pain ;' it is also equivalent to ' whatever has value in
exchange ;' hence obviously ' Whatever has value in ex-
change' = * Whatever is transferable, limited in supply, and
productive of pleasure or preventive of pain/ Two ex-
pressions for the same term are often given in the same
sentence, and their equivalency implied. Thus Thomson
and Tait say c , ' The naturalist may be content to know
matter as that which can be perceived by the senses, or as
that which can be acted upon by or can exert force.' I
take this to mean
Matter = what can be perceived by the senses ;
Matter =-. what can be acted upon by or can exert force.
For the term ' matter' in either of these identities we
may substitute its equivalent given in the other definition.
Elsewhere they often employ sentences of the form exem-
plified* in the folio wing d ; ' The integral curvature, or whole
change of direction of an arc of a plane curve, is the angle
through which the tangent has turned as we pass from
one extremity to the other/ This sentence is certainly of
the form
The integral curvature = the whole change of direction,
&c. = the angle through which the tangent has
turned, &c.
Disguised cases of the same kind of inference occur
throughout all sciences, and a remarkable instance is
found in algebraic geometry. Mathematicians readily
