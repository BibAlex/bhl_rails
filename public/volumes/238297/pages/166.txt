140 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
from certain conditions, laws, or identities governing the
combinations of qualities, we may deduce the nature of
the combinations agreeing with those conditions. Our
work has been to unfold the results of what is contained
in any statements, and the process has been one of Syn-
thesis. The terms or combinations of which the character
has been determined have usually, though by no means
always, involved more qualities, and therefore, by the
relation of extension and intension, fewer objects than
the terms in which they were described. The truths
inferred were thus usually less general than the truths
from which they were inferred.
In induction all is inverted. The truths to be ascer-
tained are more general than the data from which they
are drawn. The process by which they are reached is
analytical, and consists in separating the complex com-
binations in which natural phenomena are presented to
us, and determining the relations of separate qualities.
Given events obeying certain unknown laws, we have to
discover the laws obeyed. Instead of the comparatively
easy task of finding what effects will follow from a given
law, the effects are now given and the law is required.
We have to interpret the will by which the conditions of
creation were laid down.
Induction an Inverse Operation.
I have already asserted that induction is the inverse
operation of deduction, but the difference is one of such
great importance that I must dwell upon it. There are
many cases where we can easily and infallibly do a certain
thing but may have much trouble in undoing it. A per-
son may walk into the most complicated labyrinth or the
most extensive catacombs, and turn hither and thither at
his will ; it is when he wishes to return that doubt and
