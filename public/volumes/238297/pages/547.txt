METHOD OF VARIATIONS. 57
it was conducted. Thus Dr. Joule clearly proved that
rarefaction produces as much heat as cold, and that only
when there is a disappearance of mechanical energy will
there be production of heat h . What we have to notice,
however, is not so much the result of the experiment, as
the admirably simple manner in which a single change in
the apparatus, the separation of the portions of water
surrounding the strong air vessels, is made to give indi-
cations of the utmost significance.
Collective Experiments.
There is an interesting class of experiments which
enable us to observe an indefinite number of quantitative
results in one act. Generally speaking, each experiment
yields us but one number, and before we can approach
the real processes of reasoning we must laboriously repeat
measurement after measurement, until we can lay out a
pretty complete curve of the variation of one quantity as
depending on another. Now we can sometimes abbreviate
this labour, by making one quantity vary in different
parts of the same apparatus through every required
amount. Thus in observing the height to which water
rises by the capillary attraction of a glass vessel, we may
take a series of glass tubes of different bore, and measure
the height through which it rises in each. But if we
take two glass plates, and place them vertically in water,
so as to be in contact at one vertical side, and slightly
separated at the other side, the interval between the
plates varies through every intermediate width, and the
water rises to a corresponding height, producing at its
upper surface a hyperbolic curve.

liquid may be beautifully shown by enclosing the liquid
