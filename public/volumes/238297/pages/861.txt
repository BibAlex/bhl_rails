CLASS1FICA TION. 371
Bifurcate Classification.
Every system of classification ought theoretically to be
formed on the principles of the Logical Abecedarium. Each
superior class should be divided into two inferior classes,
distinguished by the possession and non-possession of a
single specified property. Each of these minor classes,
again, is divisible by any other property whatever which
can be suggested, and thus every classification logically
consists of an infinitely extended series of subaltern
genera and species. The classifications which we form
are in reality very small fragments of those which would
correctly and fully represent the relations of existing
things. But if we take more than four or five qualities
into account, the number of subdivisions grows imprac-
ticably large. Our finite minds are unable to treat any
complex group exhaustively, and we are obliged to
simplify and generalize scientific problems, often at the
risk of overlooking particular conditions and exceptions.
Every system of classes displayed in the manner of the
Logical Abecedarium may be called 'bifurcate, because every
class branches out at each step into two minor classes,
existent or imaginary. It would be a great mistake to
regard this arrangement as in any way a peculiar or
special method ; it is not only a natural and important
one, but it is the inevitable and only system which is
logically perfect, according to the fundamental laws of
thought. All other arrangements of classes correspond
to the bifurcate arrangement, with the implication that
some of the minor classes are not represented among
existing things. If we take the genus A and divide it
into the species AB and AC, we imply two propositions,
namely that in the class A, the properties of B and C
B b 2
