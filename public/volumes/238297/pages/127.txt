THE INDIRECT METHOD OF INFERENCE. 101
C = some
D = heavenly bodies,
we have the premises
A = AB, (i)
CD = 6CD. (2)
Now from (i) we can draw the Contrapositive
b = ab,
and substituting this expression for b in (2) we obtain
CD = abCD,
which expresses the conclusion of the argument that
' some heavenly bodies are not fixed stars/
Contrapositive of a Simple Identity.
The reader should carefully note that when we apply
the process of Indirect Inference to a simple identity
of the form
A = B,
we may obtain further results. If we wish to know
what is the term not-B, we have as before, by the Law of
Duality,
b = A.b [ ab>
and substituting for A we obtain
b = B6 -|. db = ab.
But we may now also draw a second Contrapositive ; for
we have
a = aB -I- ab,
and substituting for B its equivalent A we have
a = ah. -I- ab = ab.
Hence from the single identity A = B we can draw
the two propositions
a = ab
b = ab,
and observing that these propositions have a common
term we can make a new substitution, getting
a = b.
