QUANTITATIVE INDUCTION. 125
trace of every change which a substance could undergo
under unattainable circumstances. By observing, for in-
stance, the tension of aqueous vapour between o and
1 00 C., we ought theoretically to be able to infer its
tension at every other temperature; but this is out of
the question because we cannot really ascertain the law
precisely between those temperatures.
Many instances might be given to show that laws
which appear to represent correctly the results of experi-
ments within certain limits altogether fail beyond those
limits. The experiments of Boscoe and Dittmar, on the
absorption of gases in water 1 ' afford many interesting
illustrations, especially in the case of hydrochloric acid,
the quantity of which dissolved in water under different
pressures follows very closely a linear law of variation,
from which however it diverges very widely at low pres-
sures 8 . Sir J. Herschel having deduced from various
recorded observations of the double star 7 Virginis, an
elliptic orbit for the motion of one component round the
centre of gravity of both, found that for a certain time the
motion of the star agreed very well with this orbit.
Nevertheless a divergence began to appear by degrees,
and after a time became so great that an entirely new
orbit, of more than double the linear dimensions of the
old one, had ultimately to be adopted*.
Illustrations of Empirical Quantitative Laws.
Although our chief object in every quantitative inquiry
must be to discover the exact or rational formulse, express-
ing the general laws of nature applying to the subject,
it is instructive to observe in how many important branches
