148 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
according to Newton, from all the particles being too
minute to reflect light ; but if so, every transparent sub-
stance should appear perfectly black by reflected light,
and, vice versa, every black substance should be trans-
parent. Newton himself so acutely felt this last difficulty
as to suggest that true blackness is due to some internal
refraction of the rays to and fro, and an ultimate stifling
of them, which he did not attempt further to explain.
Unless some other process came into operation, neither
refraction nor reflection, however often repeated, would
destroy the energy of light. The theory gives no account,
therefore, as Brewster shows, of 24 parts out of 25 of the
light which falls upon a black coal, and the ^-th part
which is reflected from the lustrous surface is equally in-
consistent with the theory, because fine coal-dust is almost
entirely devoid of reflective power 1 . It is now generally
believed that the colours of natural bodies are due to the
unequal absorption of rays of light of different refrangi-
bilitv.
Experimentum Crucis.
As we deduce more and more conclusions from a theory,
and find them verified by trial, the probability of the
theory increases in a most rapid manner ; but we never
escape the risk of error altogether. Absolute certainty is
beyond the power of inductive investigation, and the
most plausible suppositions may ultimately be proved
false. Such is the groundwork of similarity in nature,
that two very different conditions may often give closely
similar results. We sometimes find ourselves therefore
in possession of two or more hypotheses which both agree
