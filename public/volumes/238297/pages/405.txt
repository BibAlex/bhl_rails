UNITS AND STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT. 379
equivalent of heat, we know that the assumed unit of
heat is equal to the energy of 423*55 gramme -metres,
or that energy which will raise the mass of 423*55
grammes through one metre against 9*80868 absolute
units of force. Heat may also be expressed in terms of
the quantity of ice at o Cent., which it is capable of con-
verting into water under an inappreciable pressure.
The science of electricity has lately become so much a
matter of quantity, that it is necessary to have some
means of accurate expression. When we know exactly
the mechanical equivalent of electricity, we can express
quantities of electricity in terms of energy, but in the
meantime we need some easy available unit. The British
Association accordingly have selected as the unit of
electrical force that which can just overcome the resistance
offered by a piece of pure silver wire i metre in length,
and i millemetre in diameter. This unit must be re-
garded as merely a convenient provision for working
purposes, to be employed for the easy expression of
quantities not yet brought into precise relation with the
ultimate standards of time, space, and mass. There may
also be other provisionally independent units employed
in electrical science, such as the voltametric unit of cur-
rent strength, namely, that current which by decomposing
water produces one cubic centimetre of detonating gas at
o Cent, and 7 60 mm. of pressure in one minute. The unit
of electrical quantity, again, is that quantity which when
concentrated in a point and acting on an equal quantity
also concentrated in a point at a unit of distance, exerts
a repulsion equal to the unit of force. There must also
be a unit of electro-magnetic force. All these electrical
units must, however, be definitely related to each other,
and to the fundamental units, and it is a matter for
continual investigation to determine such relations more
and more accurately.
