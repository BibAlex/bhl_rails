of the widest character and of the greatest importance -
one indeed which it is a principal object of this work to
endeavour to explain. The employment of the same sign
in different cases would be wholly unphilosophical unless
there were some real analogy between its diverse meanings.
If such analogy exist, it is not only allowable, but highly
desirable and even imperative, to use the symbol of equi-
valency with a generality of meaning corresponding to the
generality of the principles involved. Accordingly Prof,
de Morgan's refusal to use the symbol in logical proposi-
tions indicated his opinion that there was a want of analogy
between logical propositions and mathematical equations.
I use the sign because I hold the contrary opinion.
I conceive that the sign = always denotes some form
or degree of sameness or equivalency, and the particular
form is usually indicated by the nature of the terms joined
by it. Thus '6720 pounds = 3 tons' is evidently an
equation of quantities. The formula x = -f ex-;
presses the equivalency of operations. ' Exogens Dico-
tyledons ' is a logical identity expressing a profound
truth concerning the character of vegetables.
We have great need in logic of a distinct sign for the
copula, because the little verb is, hitherto used both in
logic and ordinary discourse, is thoroughly ambiguous.
It sometimes denotes identity, as in ' St. Paul's is the
chef-d'oeuvre of Sir Christopher Wren/ but it more
commonly indicates inclusion of class within class, or
partial identity, as in ' Bishops are members of the House
of Lords.' This latter relation involves identity, but re-
quires careful discrimination from simple identity, as will
be shown further on.
When with this sign of equality we join two nouns or
logical terms, as in
Hydrogen = The least dense element,
we signify that the object or group of objects denoted by
