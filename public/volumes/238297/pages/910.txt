420 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
groundwork of similarity running through all classes,
but particular actions and processes present themselves
conspicuously in particular families and classes. Tenacity
of life is most marked in the Rotifera, and some other
kinds of microscopic organisms, which can be dried and
boiled without loss of life. Eeptiles are distinguished
by torpidity, and the length of time they can live without
food. Birds, on the contrary, exhibit ceaseless activity and
high muscular power. The ant is as conspicuous for
intelligence and size of brain among insects as the quad-
rumana and man among vertebrata. Among plants the
Leguminosee are distinguished by a tendency to sleep,
folding their leaves at the approach of night. In the
genus Mimosa, especially the Mimosa pudica, commonly
called the sensitive plant, the same tendency is magnified
into an extreme irritability, almost resembling voluntary
motion. More or less of the same irritability probably
belongs to vegetable forms of every kind, but it is of
course to be investigated with special ease in such an
extreme case. In the Gymnotus and Torpedo, we find that
organic structures can act like galvanic batteries. Are we
to suppose that such animals are entirely anomalous ex-
ceptions ; or may we not justly expect to find less intense
manifestations of electric action in all animals and
plants 1
In the animal world we find many phenomena which
seem to be peculiar to certain classes, but are afterwards
found to differ but in degree from what is always present.
The lower animals, for instance, seem to differ entirely
from the higher ones in the power of reproducing lost
limbs. A kind of crab has the habit of casting portions of
its claws when much frightened, but they soon grow again.
There are multitudes of smaller animals which, like the
Hydra, may be cut in two and yet live and develop into
new complete individuals. No mammalian animal can repro-
