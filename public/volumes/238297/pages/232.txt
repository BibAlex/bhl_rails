of m things may be chosen out of a total number of n
things, in a number of combinations denoted by the formula
n. (n-i) (n-2) (n-%) . . . . (n-m+ T)
1.2.3.4 .... m
The extreme importance and significance of this formula
seems to have been first adequately recognised by Pascal,
although its discovery is attributed by him to a friend,
M. de Ganieres/ We shall find it perpetually recurring
in questions both of combinations and probability, and
throughout the formulae of mathematical analysis traces of
its influence will be noticed.
The Arithmetical Triangle.
The Arithmetical Triangle is a name long since given to
a series of remarkable numbers connected with the subject
we are treating. According to Montucla g * this triangle is
in the theory of combinations and changes of order, almost
what the table of Pythagoras is in ordinary arithmetic,
that is to say, it places at once under the eyes, the numbers
required in a multitude of cases of this theory/ As early
as 1544 Stifels had noticed the remarkable properties of
these numbers and the mode of their evolution. 11 Briggs,
the inventor of the common system of logarithms, was so
struck with their importance that he called them the
Abacus Panchrestus. Pascal, however, was the first who
wrote a distinct treatise on these numbers, and gave them
the name by which they are still known. But Pascal did
not by any means exhaust the subject, and it remained for
James Bernouilli to demonstrate fully the importance of
the Jigurate numbers, as they are also called. In his
treatise De Arte Conjectandi, he points out their appli-

tlie name as De Gruieres, 'Histoire des Hathdmatiques/ vol. iii. p. 389.
