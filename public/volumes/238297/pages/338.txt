312 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
that events will long continue to happen as they have
previously happened.
We have now pursued the theory of inductive inference,
as far as can be done with regard to simple logical or
numerical relations. The laws of nature deal with time
and space, which are indefinitely, or rather infinitely, divi-
sible. As we passed from pure logic to numerical logic,
so we must now pass from questions of discontinuous,
to questions of continuous quantity, encountering fresh
considerations of much difficulty. Before, therefore, we
consider how the great inductions and generalizations of
physical science illustrate the views of inductive reason-
ing just explained, we must break off for a time, and
review the means which we possess of measuring and
comparing magnitudes of time, space, mass, force, mo-
mentum, energy, and the various manifestations of energy
in motion, heat, electricity, chemical change, and the other
phenomena of nature,
