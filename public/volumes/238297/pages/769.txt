GENERALIZATION. 279
besetting error of most first attempts at scientific research.
The faculty to generalize accurately and philosophically
requires large caution and long training ; and is not fully
attained, especially in reference to more general views,
even by some who may properly claim the title of very
accurate scientific observers in a more limited field. It
is an intellectual habit which acquires immense and
accumulating force from the contemplation of wider
analogies/
Hasty and superficial generalizations have always been
the bane of science, and there would be no difficulty in
finding endless illustrations. Between things which are
the same in number there is a certain resemblance, namely
in number, but in the infancy of science men could not be
persuaded that there was not a deeper resemblance im-
plied in that of number. Pythagoras was not the inventor
of a mystical science of number. In the ancient Oriental
religions the seven metals were connected with the seven
planets, and in the seven days of the week we still have,
and probably always shall have, a relic of the septiform
system ascribed by Dio Cassius to the ancient Egyptians.
The disciples of Pythagoras carried the doctrine of the
number seven into great detail. Seven days are men-

In natural science there were not only the seven
planets, and the seven metals, but also the seven primi-
