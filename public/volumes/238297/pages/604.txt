the quantities, and trying by preference functions which
give a similar form of variation.
(3) By deducing from previous knowledge the form of
the function which is most likely to suit.
Having certain numerical results we are always at
perfect liberty to invent any kind of mathematical formula
we like, and then try whether, by the suitable selection
of values for the unknown constant quantities we can
make iiigive the required results. If ever we fall upon a
formula which does so, to a fair degree of approximation,
there i^ a presumption in favour of its being the true
function, although tin.ere is no certainty whatever in the
matter. In this way I happened to discover a simple
mathematical law which closely agreed with the results
of certain experiments on muscular exertion. This law
was afterwards shown by Professor Haughton to be the
true rational law according to his theory of muscular
action h .
But the chance of succeeding in this manner is usuaUy
very small. The number of possible functions is certainly
infinite, and even the number of comparatively simple
functions is so very large that the probability of falling
upon the correct one by mere chance is very slight. Let
the reader observe that even when we can thus obtain
the law it is by a deductive process, not by showing that
the numbers give the law, but that the law gives the
numbers.
In the second place, * we may, by a survey of the
numbers, gain a general notion of the kind of law they
are likely to obey, and we may be much assisted in this
process by drawing them out in the form of a curve, as
will be presently considered. We can in this way ascer-
tain with some probability whether the curve is likely to
