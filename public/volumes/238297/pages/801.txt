proceeded to test with great care the other assertion in-
volved, they would have become still better convinced
of the truth of their own theory. A stone dropped from
the top of a high tower, or into a deep well, would
certainly not have been deflected from the vertical direc-
tion in the considerable degree required to support the
anti-Copernican views ; but, with very accurate obser-
vation, they might have discovered, as Benzenberg sub-
sequently did, a very small deflection towards the west
(vol. i. p. 453). At the moment when a body begins to
fall freely, it begins to resemble a very small satellite
moving under the force of gravity, as exerted from the
earth's centre of attraction, and it therefore describes, like
other satellites, a portion of an elliptic orbit b . Had the
Copernicans then been able to detect and interpret the
meaning of this small divergence, they would have found
in it a conclusive proof of their own views.
Multitudes of cases might be cited in which laws of
nature seem to be evidently broken, but in which the
apparent breach entirely arises from a misapprehension of
the facts of the case. It is a general law, absolutely true
of all crystals yet submitted to examination, that no
crystal has a re-entrant angle, that is an angle which
towards the axis of the crystal is greater than two right
angles. Wherever the faces of a crystal meet they pro-
duce a projecting edge, and wherever .edges meet they
produce a corner. Many crystals, however, when care-
lessly examined, present exceptions to this law, but closer
observation always shows that the apparently re-entrant
angle really arises from the oblique union of two distinct
crystals. Other crystals seem to possess faces contradict-
ing all the principles of crystallography ; but again
careful examination shows that the supposed faces are not
