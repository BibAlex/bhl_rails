PRINCIPLES OF NUMBER. 177
hardness of gold as three qualities, though none of these
is before or after the other, either in space or time.
Every means of discrimination may be a source of
plurality.
Our logical notation may be used to express the rise of
number. The symbol A stands for one thing or one class,
and in itself must be regarded as a unit, because no differ-
ence is specified. But the combinations AB and Kb are
necessarily two, because they cannot logically coalesce, and
there is a mark B which distinguishes one from the other.
A logical definition of the number four is given in the
combinations ABC, ABc, A&C, Abe, where there is a double
difference, and as Puck says
' Yet but three ? Come one more ;
Two of both kinds makes up four.'
I conceive that all numbers might be represented as
arising out of the combinations of the Abecedarium, more
or less of each series being struck out by various logical
conditions. The number three, for instance, arises from
the condition that A must be either B or C, so that the
combinations are ABC, ABc, A6C.
Of Numerical Abstraction.
There will now be little difficulty in forming a clear
notion of the nature of numerical abstraction. It consists
in abstracting the character of the difference from which
plurality arises, retaining merely the fact. When I speak
of three men I need not at once specify the marks by
which each may be known from each. Those marks must
exist if they are really three men and not one and the
same, and in speaking of them as many I imply the
existence of the requisite differences. Abstract number,
then, is the empty form of difference; the abstract
