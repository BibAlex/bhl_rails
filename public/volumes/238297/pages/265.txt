THE THEORY OF PROBABILITY. 239

trates the connection between combinations and permu-
tations, which is exhibited in the Arithmetical Triangle,
and which underlies many of the most important
theorems of science.
Probable Deductive Arguments.
With the aid of the theory of probabilities, we may
extend the sphere of deductive argument. Hitherto we
have treated propositions as certain, and on the hypo-
thesis of certainty have deduced conclusions equally
certain. But the information on which we reason in
ordinary life is seldom or never certain, and almost all
reasoning is really a question of probability. We ought
therefore to be fully aware of the mode and degree in
which the forms of deductive reasoning are affected by
the theory of probability, and many persons might be
surprised at the results which must be admitted. Many
controversial writers appear to consider, as De Morgan
remarked k , that an inference from several equally pro-
bable premises is itself as probable as any of them, but
the true result is very different. If a fact or argument
involves many propositions, and each of them is uncertain,
the conclusion will be of very little force.
The truth of a conclusion may be regarded as a com-\
pound event, depending upon the premises happening
to be true ; thus, to obtain the probability of the conclusion,
we must multiply together the fractions expressing the
probabilities of the premises. Thus, if the probability is
^ that A is B, and also ^ that B is C, the conclusion that
A is C, on the ground of these premises, is \ x ^ or ^.
