DISJUNCTIVE PROPOSITIONS. 85
synonymous, at any rate an organ is a part. And it is
obvious that a part may be developed at the same time
both in an extraordinary degree and manner, although
such cases may be comparatively very rare.
From a careful examination of ordinary writings, it
will thus be found that the meanings of terms joined by
' and ' or ' vary from absolute identity up to absolute
contrariety. There is no logical condition of distinctness
at all, and when we do choose exclusive expressions, it is
because our subject demands it. The matter, not the form
of an expression, points out whether terms are exclusive e .
The question, as we shall afterwards see, is one of the
greatest theoretical importance, because it furnishes the
true distinction between the sciences of Logic and Ma-
thematics. It is the very foundation of number that every
unit shall be distinct from every other unit ; but Dr. Boole
imported the conditions of number into the science of
Logic, and produced a system which, though wonderful in
its results, was not a system of logic at all.
Laws of the Disjunctive Relation.
In considering the combination or synthesis of terms
(P- 39)> we found that certain laws, those of Simplicity and
Commutativeness, must be observed. In uniting terms by
the disjunctive symbol we shall find that the same or
closely similar laws hold true. The alternatives of either
member of a disjunctive proposition are certainly commu-
tative. Just as we cannot properly distinguish between
rich and rare gems and rare and rich gems, so we must
consider as identical the expression rich or rare gems, and
rare or rich gems. In our symbolic language we may say
generally
A -|. B = B .|. A.
