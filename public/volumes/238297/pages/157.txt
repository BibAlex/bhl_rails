THE ORDER OF PREMISES. 131
The mechanical performance of logical inference affords
a demonstration both of the truth of Boole's results and
of the mistaken nature of his mode of deducing them.
Conclusions which he could only obtain by pages of
intricate calculation, are exhibited by the machine after
one or two minutes of manipulation. And not only are
those conclusions easily reached, but they are demon-
stratively true, because every step of the process involves
nothing more obscure that the Laws of Thought.
The Order of Premises.
Before quitting the subject of deductive reasoning, I
may remark that the order in which the premises of
an argument, or any propositions whatsoever, are placed,
is a matter of logical indifference. Much discussion has
taken place at various times concerning the arrangement
of the premises of a syllogism ; and it has been generally
held, in accordance with the opinion of Aristotle, that
the so-called major premise, containing the major term,
or the predicate of the conclusion, should stand first.
This distinction however falls to the ground in our system,
since the proposition is reduced to an identical form in
which there is no distinction of subject and predicate.
In a strictly logical and philosophic point of view the
order of statement is wholly devoid of significance. The
premises are simultaneously coexistent, and are not related
to each other according to any of the properties of space
or time. Just as the qualities of the same object are
neither before nor after each other in nature (p. 40),
and are only thought of in some one order owing to
our limited capacity of mind, so the premises of an
argument are neither before nor after each other, and
are only thought of in succession because the mind can-
not grasp many ideas at once. The logical combinations
