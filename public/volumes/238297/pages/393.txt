UNITS AND STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT, 3G7
be sure that even the most solid metallic bars do not
slightly contract by age, or undergo variations in their
structure by change of temperature. M. Fizeau was in-
duced to try whether a quartz crystal, subjected to several
hundred alternations of temperature, would be modified in
its physical properties, and he was unable to detect any
change in the coefficients of expansion 11 . It does not
follow however, that, because no apparent change was
discovered in a quartz crystal, newly-constructed bars of
metal would undergo no change.
The only principle, as it seems to me, upon which the
perpetuation of a standard of length can be ultimately
rested, is that, if a variation of length occurs, it will in
all probability be of different amount in different sub-
stances. If then a great number of standard metres were
constructed of all kinds of different metals, alloys; hard
rocks, such as granite, serpentine, slate, quartz, limestone ;
artificial substances, such as porcelain, glass, &c., &c., care-
ful comparison would show from time to time the com-
parative variations of length of these different substances.
The most variable substances would be the most divergent,
and the true standard would be furnished by the mean
length of those which agreed most closely with each other,
just as uniform motion is that of those bodies which agree
most closely in indicating the efflux of time.
Tine Terrestrial Standard.
The second method assumes that the globe itself is a
body of invariable dimensions. The founders of the me-
trical system selected the ten-millionth part of the dis-
tance from the equator to the pole as the definition of the
metre, and the late Sir John Herschel proposed that
