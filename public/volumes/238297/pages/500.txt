10 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
ganized succession of small and large drops, oscillating in
form. The drops fall so rapidly that their impressions
upon the eye run into each other, and in order to see the
separate drops we require some device for giving an in-
stantaneous view, such as illumination by the electric
spark, or the use of the revolving disc called the phena-
kistiscope.
One insuperable limit to our powers of observation
arises from the impossibility of following and identifying
the ultimate atoms of matter. One atom of oxygen is pro-
bably undistinguishable from another atom ; only by keep-
ing a certain volume of oxygen safely enclosed in a bottle
can we assure ourselves of its identity ; allow it to mix with
other oxygen, and we have lost all power of identification .
Accordingly we seem to have no means of directly proving
that every gas is in a constant state of diffusion of every
part into every part. We can only infer this to be the
condition from observing the behaviour of distinct gases
which we can distinguish in their course, and by reasoning
on the grounds of molecular theory %.
External Conditions of Correct Observation.
Before we proceed to draw inferences from any series o
recorded facts, we must take great care to ascertain per-
fectly, if possible, the external conditions under which the
facts are brought to our notice. Not only may the ob-
serving mind be prejudiced and the senses defective, but
there may be circumstances which cause one kind of event
to come more frequently to our notice than another. The
comparative numbers of events or objects of different kinds
existing may in any degree differ from the numbers which
we are able to record. This difference must if possible
be taken into account before we make any inferences.
