himself that the letters in Astronomers make No more
stars, that Serpens in cikuleo is an anagram of Joannes
Keplerus, or Great gun do us a sum an anagram of Au-
gustus de Morgan, it will certainly be necessary to break
up the act of comparison into several successive acts. The
process will acquire a double character, and will consist in
ascertaining that each letter of the first group is among
the letters of the second group, and vice versd, that each
letter of the second is among those of the first group.
In the same way we can only prove that two long lists of
names are identical, by showing that each name in one
list occurs in the other, and vice versd.
This process of comparison really consists in establish-
ing two partial identities, which are, as already shown
(p- I 33)> equivalent in conjunction to one simple iden-
tity. We first ascertain the truth of the two propositions
A = AB, B = AB, and we then rise by substitution to the
single law A = B.
There is another process, it is true, by which we may
get to exactly the same result, for the two propositions
A = AB, a ab are also equivalent to the simple identity
A = B (p. 133). If then we can show that all objects
included under A are included under B, and also that all
objects not included under A are not included under B,
our purpose is effected. By this process we should
usually compare two lists if we are allowed to mark them.
For each name in the first list we should strike off one in
the second, and if, when the first list is exhausted the
second list is also exhausted, it follows that all names
absent from the first must be absent from the second,
and the coincidence must be complete.
The two modes of proving a simple identity are so
closely allied that it is doubtful how far we can detect
any difference in their powers and instances of application.
The first method is perhaps more convenient where the
