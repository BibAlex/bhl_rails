98 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
To represent this process of inference symbolically we
take the premise in the form
A = AB. (i)
We observe that by the Law of Duality the term not-B is
thus described
b = A.b -I- ab. (2)
For A in this proposition we substitute its description
as given in (i), obtaining
b = AB6 I ab.
But according to the Law of Contradiction the term
AB6 must be excluded from thought or
AB6 = o.
Hence it results that b is either nothing at all, or it is
ab ; and the conclusion is
b = ab.
As it will often be necessary to refer to a conclusion
of this kind I shall call it, as is usual, the Contrapositive
Proposition of the original. The reader need hardly be
cautioned to observe that from all A's are B's it does not
follow that all not-A's are not-B's. For by the Law
of Duality we have
a = aB | ab,
and it will not be found possible to make any substitu-
tion in this by our original premise A = AB. It still
remains doubtful, therefore, whether not-metal is element
or not-element.
The proof of the Contrapositive Proposition given above
is exactly the same as that which Euclid applies in the
case of geometrical notions. De Morgan describes Euclid's
process as follows d : ' From every not-B is not-A he pro-
duces every A is B, thus If it be possible, let this A be
not-B, but every not-B is not-A, therefore this A is not-A,
which is absurd : whence every A is B/ Now De Morgan
thinks that this proof is entirely needless, because common
