256 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Confusion of Tivo Questions.
The subject is much complicated, too, by the confusion
of two distinct questions. An event having happened, we
may ask
(1) Is there any cause for the event \
(2) Of what kind is that cause \
No one would assert that the mind possesses any
faculty capable of inferring, prior to experience, that the
.occurrence of a sudden noise with flame and smoke indi-
cates the combustion of a black powder, formed by the
mixture of black, white, and yellow powders. The greatest
upholder of a priori doctrines will allow that the parti-
cular aspect, shape, size, colour, texture, and other qualities
of a cause must be gathered from experience and through
the senses.
The question whether there is any cause at all for an
' event, is of a totally different kind. If an explosion could
happen without any prior existing conditions, it must be
a new creation a distinct addition to the universe. It
may be plausibly held that we can imagine neither the
creation nor annihilation of anything. As regards matter,
this has long been held true ; as regards force, it is now
almost universally assumed aj an axiom that energy can
neither come into nor go out of existence without distinct
acts of Creative Will. That there exists any instinctive
belief to this effect, indeed, seems doubtful. We find
Lucretius, a philosopher of the utmost intellectual power
and cultivation, gravely assuming that his raining atoms
could turn aside from their straight paths in a self-deter-
mining manner, and by this spontaneous origination of
energy determine the form of the universe. Sir George
Airy, too, seriously discussed the mathematical conditions
