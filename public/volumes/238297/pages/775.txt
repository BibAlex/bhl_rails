ANALOGY. 285
if we said that there was an analogy between iron, nickel,
and cobalt, manifested in the strength of their magnetic
powers. There is a still more perfect analogy between
iodine and chlorine ; not that every property of iodine is
identical with the corresponding property of chlorine ;
for then they would be one and the same kind of sub-
stance, and not two substances ; but every property of
iodine resembles in all but degree some property of chlo-
rine. For almost every substance in which iodine forms
a component, a corresponding substance may be dis-
covered containing chlorine, so that we may confidently
infer from the compounds of the one to the compounds
of the other substance. Potassium iodide crystallizes in
cubes ; therefore it is to be expected that potassium chlo-
ride will also crystallize in cubes. The science of chemistry,
as now developed, rests almost entirely upon a careful and
most extensive comparison of the properties of substances,
bringing to light deep-lying analogies. When any ap-
parently exceptional or new substance is encountered, the
chemist is guided in his treatment of it entirely by the
analogies which it seems to present with previously known
substances.
In this chapter I cannot hope to illustrate the all-
pervading influence of analogy in human thought and
science. All science, it has been said, at the outset, arises
from the discovery of identity, and analogy is but one
name by which we denote the deeper-lying cases of re-
semblance. I shall only try to point out at present how
analogy between apparently diverse classes of phenomena
often serves as an all-important guide in discovery. We
thus commonly gain the first insight into the nature of an
apparently unique object, and we thus, in the progress of
a science, often discover that we are treating over again, '
in a new form, phenomena which were well known to us
in another form.
