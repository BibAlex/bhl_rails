ACCORDANCE OF QUANTITATIVE THEORIES, <fcc. 191
tion and comparison with theory, in detail, is far too great
for private inquirers to undertake. In meteorology, espe-
cially, an enormous waste of labour and money is taking
place, only a very small fraction of the results recorded
being ever used for the advancement of the science. For
one meteorologist like Quetelet, Dove, or Baxendell, who
devotes himself to the truly useful labour of reducing
other people's observations, there are hundreds who are
under the delusion that they are advancing science by
merely loading our book-shelves with numerical tables.
Purely empirical measurements may often indeed have
a direct practical value, as when tables of the specific
gravity, or strength of materials, assist the engineer ; the
specific gravities of mixtures of water with acids, alcohols,
salts, &c., are useful in chemical manufactories, custom-
house guaging, &c. ; observations of rain-fall are requisite
for questions of water supply ; the refractive index of
various kinds of glass must be known in making achro-
matic lenses ; but in all such cases the use made of the
measurements is not scientific, but practical. It may pro-
bably be asserted with truth, that no number which
remains entirely isolated, and uncompared by theory with
other numbers, is of any really scientific value. Having
tried the tensile strength of a piece of iron in a particular
condition, we know what will be the strength of the same
kind of iron in a similar condition, provided we can ever
meet with that exact kind of iron again ; but we cannot
argue from piece to piece, or lay down any laws exactly
connecting the strength of iron with the quantity of its
impurities.
It is to be feared that almost the whole bulk of statis-
tical numbers, whether commercial, vital, or moral, is at
present, and probably will long continue, of little scientific
value.
