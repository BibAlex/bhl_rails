can measure. Unless any of the quantities D, E, &c., should
happen to be very great, it is evident that all the suc-
ceeding terms will also be inappreciable, because the
powers of x become rapidly smaller in geometrical ratio.
Thus when x is made small enough the quantity y seems
to obey the equation
y = A + B x.
If x should be made still less, if it should become so
small, for instance, as I|OO Q )OOO of an inch, and B should
not be very great, then y would appear to be the fixed
quantity A, and would not seem to vary with x at all.
On the other hand, were x to grow greater, say equal to
YQ inch, and C not be very small, the term x 2 would
become appreciable, and the law would now be more
complicated.
We can invert the mode of viewing this question, and
suppose that while the quantity y undergoes variations
depending on many powers of x y that our power of de-
tecting the changes of value is more or less acute. While
our powers of observation remain very rude and imperfect
we may even be unable to detect any change in the
quantity at all, that is to say B x may always be smaller
than to come within our notice, just as in former days
the fixed stars were so called because they remained at
apparently fixed distances from each other. With the
use of telescopes and micrometers we become able to de-
tect the existence of some motion, so that the distance of
one star from another may be expressed by A + B x } the
term including x 2 being still inappreciable. Under these
circumstances the star will seem to move uniformly, or in
simple proportion to the time, x. With much improved
means of measurement it will probably be found that this
uniformity of .motion is only apparent, and that there
exists some acceleration or retardation due to the next
term. More and more careful investigation will show
