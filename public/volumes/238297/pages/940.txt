same laws as regards temperature, pressure, and volume.
But in reality these laws are only approximately true,
and the divergences have afforded a wide and yet quite
unexhausted field for further generalization. The more
recent discoveries of Cagniard de la Tour and Professor
Andrews might seem to have summed up many of these
exceptional facts under a wider generalization, but in
reality they have opened to us vast new regions of in-
teresting inquiry, and they leave wholly untouched the
question why one gas or one substance behaves differently
from another.
The science of 'Crystallography ^s that perhaps in which
the most precise and general laws have been detected, but
it would be utterly untrue to assert that it has lessened
the area of future discovery. We can show that each one
of the seven or eight hundred forms of calcite is derivable
by plain geometrical modifications from an hexagonal
prism, but who has attempted to explain the molecular
forces producing these modifications, or the chemical con-
ditions in which they arise^ The law of isomorphism is
an important generalization, for it establishes a general
resemblance between the forms of crystallization of natural
classes of elements. But if we examine a little more
closely we find that these forms are only approximately
alike, and the divergence peculiar to each substance is an
unexplained exception.
By many similar illustrations it might be readily shown
that in whatever direction we extend our investigations
and successfully harmonize a few facts, the result is only
to raise up a host of other unexplained facts. Can any
scientific man venture to state that there is less opening
now for new discoveries than there was three centuries
ago ? Is it not rather true that we have but to open a
scientific book and read a page or two, and we shall in all
probability come to some recorded phenomenon of which
