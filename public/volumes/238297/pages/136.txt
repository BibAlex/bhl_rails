110 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
In a theoretical point of view we may conceive that the
abecedarium is always extended indefinitely. Every new
quality or circumstance which can belong to an object,
subdivides each combination or class, so that the number
of such combinations when unrestricted by logical con-
ditions is represented by an indefinitely high power of
two. The extremely rapid increase in the number of sub-
divisions obliges us to confine our attention to a few
circumstances at a time.
When contemplating the properties of this abecedarium,
I am often inclined to think that Pythagoras perceived
the deep logical importance of duality ; for while unity
was the symbol of identity and harmony, he described the
number two as the origin of contrasts, or the symbol of
diversity, division and separation. The number four or
the Tetractys was also regarded by him as one of the chief
elements of existence, for it represented the generating
virtue whence come all combinations.
In one of the golden verses ascribed to Pythagoras, he
conjures his pupil to be virtuous 6 :
'By him who stampt The Four upon the Mind,
The Four, the fount of Nature's endless stream.'
Now four and the higher powers of duality do represent
in this logical system the variety of combinations which
can be generated in the absence of logical restrictions. The
followers of Pythagoras may have shrouded their master's
doctrines in mysterious and superstitious notions, but in
many points these doctrines seem to have some basis in
logical philosophy.
