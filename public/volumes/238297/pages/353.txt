THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF PHENOMENA. 327
9. If so, is it a secular, i. e. a continually growing
change, or does it give evidence of a greater period \
Already the periodic changes of a certain number of
stars have been determined with accuracy, and the lengths
of the periods vary from less than three days up to in-
tervals of time at least 250 times as great. Periods
within periods have also been detected .
There is, perhaps, no subject in which more complicated
quantitative conditions have to be determined than ter-
restrial magnetism. Since the time when the declination
of the compass was first noticed, as some suppose by
Columbus, we have had successive discoveries from time
to time of the progressive change of declination from
century to century ; of the periodic character of this
change ; of the difference of the declination in various
parts of the earth's surface ; of the varying laws of the
change of declination ; of the dip or inclination of the
needle, and the corresponding laws of its periodic changes ;
the horizontal and perpendicular intensities have also
been the subject of exact measurement, and have been
found to vary by place and time, like the directions of the
needle ; daily and yearly periodic changes have also been
detected, and all the elements are found to be subject to
occasional storms or abnormal perturbations, in which the
eleven year period, now known to be common to many
planetary relations, is apparent. The complete solution
of these motions of the compass needle involves nothing
less than a determination of its position and oscillations in
every part of the world at any epoch, the like deter-
mination for another epoch, and so on, time after time,
until the periods of all changes are ascertained, and the
character of the variations determined. This one subject
offers to men of science an almost inexhaustible field for
Humboldt's 'Cosmos/ translated by Otte, vol. iii. p. 228.
