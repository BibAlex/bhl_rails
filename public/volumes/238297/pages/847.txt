Planet. Rotation. Density.
Mercury .. .. 24 hours 5 minutes .... 7-94
Venus 23 21 .. .. 5-33
Earth 23 56 .... 5-67
Mars 24 37 .. .. 5-84
Forming a similar table for the other chief planets, it is
as follows :
Name of Period of Axial
Planet. Rotation. Density.
Jupiter .. .. 9 hours 55 minutes .. .. i'36
Saturn .. .. 10 29 .... '74
Uranus 9 30 .... -97
Neptune .. .. .... 1*02
It will of course be observed that in neither group is
the equality of the rotational period or of the density more
than rudely approximate, nevertheless the difference of
the numbers in the first and second group is so very
marked, the periods of the first being at least double and
the densities four or five times those of the second, that
the coincidence cannot be attributed to accident. The
reader will also notice that the first group consists of the
planets nearest to the sun, that with the exception of
the earth none of them possess satellites, and that they
are all comparatively small ; the second group are furthest
from the sun, and all of them possess several satellites,
and are comparatively great. Therefore, with but slight
exception, the following correlations hold true :
Interior planets. Long period. Small size. High density. No satellites.
Exterior ,, Short ,, Great Low Many
These coincidences certainly point with much proba-
bility to a difference in the conditions of origin of the
two groups, but no further explanation of the matter is
yet possible.
The classification of comets by Mr. Hind and Mr. A. S.
Davis according to their periods tends to establish the
conclusion that distinct groups of comets have been
