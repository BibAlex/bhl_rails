EXCEPTIONAL PHENOMENA. 307
ages two brilliant but temporary stars caused more
popular interest in astronomy than any other events,
and to one of them we owe all the observations of Tycho
Brahe, the mediaeval Hipparchus.
In other sciences, as well as in that of the heavens,
exceptional events are commonly the points from which
we start to explore new regions of knowledge. It has
been beautifully said that Wonder is the daughter of
Ignorance, but the mother of Invention ; and though the
most familiar and slight events, if fully examined, will
afford endless food for wonder and for wisdom, yet it is
the few peculiar and unlooked-for events which most often
lead a scientific mind into a course of discovery. It is
true, indeed, that it requires much philosophy to observe
things which are too near to us.
The high scientific importance attaching, then, to ex-
ceptions, renders it desirable that we should carefully
consider the various modes in which an exception may
be disposed of; while some new facts will be found to
confirm the very laws to which at first sight they seem
clearly opposed, others will cause us to limit the generality
of our previous statements. In some cases the exception
may be proved to be no exception ; occasionally it will
prove fatal to our previous most confident speculations ;
and there are some new phenomena which, without really
destroying any of our former theories, open to us wholly
new fields of scientific investigation. The study of this
subject is especially interesting and important, because, as
I have before said (vol. ii. p. 233), no important theory
can be built up complete and perfect all at once. When
unexplained phenomena present themselves as objections
to the theory, it will often demand the utmost judgment
and sagacity to assign to them their proper place and
force. The acceptation or rejection of a theory will entirely
depend upon discriminating the one insuperable contra-
