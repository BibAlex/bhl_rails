THE USE OF HYPOTHESIS. 155
really entertained it did not do more than describe what
took place. It involved no deep analogy to any other phe-
nomena of nature, for Newton could not point to any
other substance which went through these extraordinary
changes. We now know that the true analogy would
have been the waves of sound, of which Newton had
acquired in other respects so complete a comprehension.
But though the notion of interference of waves had dis-
tinctly occurred to Hooke, Newton had failed to see how
the periodic phenomena of light could be connected with
the periodic character of waves. His hypothesis feh 1 be-
cause it was out of analogy with everything else in nature,
and it therefore did not allow him, as in other cases, to
descend by mathematical deduction to consequences which
could be verified or refuted.
We are always at freedom, again to imagine the existence
of a new agent or force, and give it an appropriate name,
provided there are phenomena incapable of explanation
from known causes. We may speak of vital force as oc-
casioning life, provided that we do not take it to be more
than a name for an undefined something giving rise to
inexplicable facts, just as the French chemists called Iodine
the Substance X, while they were unaware of its real
character and place in chemistry y. Encke was quite
justified in speaking of the resisting medium in space so
long as the retardation of his comet could not be other-
wise accounted for. But such hypotheses will do much
harm whenever they divert us from attempts to reconcile
the facts with known laws, or when they lead us to mix
up entirely discrete things. We have no right, for
instance, to confuse Encke' s supposed resisting medium
with the ethereal basis of light. The name protoplasm,
now so familiarly used by physiologists, is doubtless
legitimate so long as we do not mix up different sub-
