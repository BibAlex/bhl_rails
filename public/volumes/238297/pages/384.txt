358 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Angular magnitude is the second case in which we
have a natural and almost necessary unit of reference,
namely, the whole revolution or perigon, as it has been
called by Mr. Sandeman a .
It is a necessary result of the uniform properties of
space, that all complete revolutions are equal to each
other, so that we need not select any one, and can always
refer anew to space itself. Whether we take the whole
perigon, its half, or its quarter, is really immaterial ;
Euclid took the right angle, because the Greek geome-
ters had never generalized their notions of angular
magnitude sufficiently to conceive clearly angles of all
magnitude, or of unlimited quantity of revolution. But
Euclid defines a right angle as half that made by a line
with its own continuation, not called by him an angle, and
which is of course equal to half a revolution. In mathe-
matical analysis, again, a different fraction of the perigon
is taken, namely, such a fraction that the arc or portion
of the circumference included within it is equal to the
radius of the circle. This angle, called by De Morgan the
arcual unit, is equal to about 57, 17', 44"'8, or decimally
57' 2 957795i3 , and is such that the half revolu-
tion contains 3*14159265.... such units b . Though this
standard angle is naturally employed in mathematical
analysis, and any other unit would introduce needless
complexity, we must not look upon it as a distinct unit,
since its amount is connected with that of the half peri-
gon, by a natural constant 3*14159 usually signified
by the letter TT.
When we pass to other species of quantity, the choice
of unit is found to be entirely arbitrary. There is abso-
