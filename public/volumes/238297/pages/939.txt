RESULTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD. 449
The Divergent Scope for New Discovery.
(in the writings of some recent philosophers, especially
of Auguste Comte, and in some degree John Stuart Mill,
there is an erroneous and hurtful tendency to represent
our knowledge as assuming an approximately complete
character. At least these and many other writers fail to
impress upon their readers a truth which I think cannot
be too constantly borne in mind, namely, that [the utmost
successes which our scientific method can accomplish will
not enable us to comprehend more than an infinitesimal
fraction of what there doubtless is to comprehend. Pro-
fessor Tyndall seems to me open to the same charge in a
less degree. He remarks 1 that we can probably never
bring natural phenomena completely under mathematical
laws, because the approach of our sciences towards com-
pleteness may perhaps be asymptotic, so that however far
we may go, there may still remain some facts not subject
to scientific explanation. He thus likens the supply of
novel phenomena to a convergent series, the earlier and
larger terms of which have been successfully disposed of,
so that only comparatively minor groups of phenomena
remain for future investigators to occupy themselves upon.
On the contrary, as it appears to me, the supply of new
and unexplained facts is divergent in extent, so that the
more we have explained, the more there is to explain.
The further we advance in any generalization, the more
numerous and intricate are the exceptional cases still
demanding further treatment. The experiments of Boyle,
Mariotte, Dalton, Gay-Lussac, and others, upon the
physical properties of gases might seem to have ex-
hausted that subject by showing that all gases obey the
