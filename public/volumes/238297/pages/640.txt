150 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
between two equally plausible views. ' When in search
of any nature, the understanding comes to an equilibrium,
as it were, or stands suspended as to which of two or
more natures the cause of nature inquired after should
be attributed or assigned, by reason of the frequent and
common occurrence of several natures, then these Crucial
Instances show the true and inviolable association of one
of these natures to the nature sought, and the uncertain
and separable alliance of the other, whereby the question
is decided, the former nature admitted for the cause,
and the other rejected. These instances, therefore, afford
great light, and have a kind of overruling authority, so
that the course of interpretation will sometimes terminate
in them, or be finished by them/
The long continued strife between the Corpuscular and
Undulatory theories of light forms the best possible illus-
tration of the need of an Experimentum Crucis. It is
highly remarkable in how complete and plausible a
manner both these theories agreed with the ordinary laws
of geometrical optics, relating to reflection and refraction.
A moving particle, according to the first law of motion,
proceeds in a perfectly straight line, when undisturbed by
extraneous forces. If the particle, being perfectly elastic,
strike a perfectly elastic plane, it will bound off in such a path
that the angles of incidence and reflection will be equal.
Now a ray of light proceeds in a perfectly straight line,
or appears to do so, until it meets a reflecting body, when
its path is altered in a manner exactly similar to that of
the elastic particle. Here is a remarkable correspondence
which probably suggested to Newton's mind that light
consisted of minute elastic particles moving with excessive
rapidity in straight lines. The correspondence was found
to extend also to the law of simple refraction ; for if these
particles of light be supposed capable of attracting matter,
and being attracted by it at insensibly small distances,
