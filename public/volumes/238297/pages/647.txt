EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE, EXPLANATION, AND
PREDICTION.
THE one great method of inductive investigation, as we
have seen, consists in the union of hypothesis and experi-
ment, deductive reasoning being the link by which the
experimental results are made to confirm or confute the
hypothesis. Now when we consider this relation between
hypothesis and experiment, it is obvious that we may
classify our knowledge under four heads.
(1) We may be acquainted with facts or phenomena
which have come under our notice accidentally or without
reference to any special hypothesis,, and which have not
been brought into accordance as yet with any hypothesis.
Such facts constitute what is called Empirical Know-
ledge.
(2) Another very extensive portion of our knowledge
consists of those facts which, having been first observed
empirically, have afterwards been brought into accord-
ance with other facts by an hypothesis concerning the
general laws applying to them. This portion of our
knowledge may be said to be explained, reasoned, or
generalised.
(3) In a third place comes the collection of facts, minor
in number, but most important as regards their scientific
value and interest, which have been anticipated by theory
and afterwards verified by experiment.
