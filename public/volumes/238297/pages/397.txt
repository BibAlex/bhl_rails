UNITS AND STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT. 371
Unit of Density.
Before we can measure and define the phenomena of
nature, we require a third independent unit, which shall
enable us to define the quantity of matter which occupies
any given space. All the motions and changes of nature,
as we shall see, are probably so many manifestations of
energy ; but energy requires some substratum or material
machinery of molecules, in and by which it may be
exerted. Very little observation shows that, as regards
force, there may be two modes of variation of matter.
The force required to set a body in motion, varies in
simple proportion to the bulk or cubic dimensions of the
matter, but also according to its quality. Two cubic
inches of iron of uniform quality, will require twice as
much force to produce a certain velocity in a given time
as one cubic inch ; but one cubic inch of gold will require
more force than one cubic inch of iron. There is then
some new measurable quality in matter apart from its
bulk, which we may call density, and which is, strictly
speaking, indicated by its capacity to resist and absorb
the action of force. For the unit of density we may
assume that of any substance which is uniform in quality,
and can readily be referred to from time to time. Pure
water at any definite temperature, for instance that of
snow melting under an inappreciable pressure, furnishes
a natural and invariable standard of density, and by
testing equal bulks of various substances compared with a
like bulk of ice-cold water, as regards the velocity pro-
duced in a unit of time by the same force, we should
ascertain the densities of those substances as expressed in
that of water.
Practically the force of gravity is used to measure
density ; for a simple and beautiful experiment with the
