INDUCTION. 151
But for the aggregate of alternatives we may now
substitute their equivalent as given in the first premise,
namely A, so that we get the required result
A- AX.
It may be remarked that we should have reached the
same final result if our original premise had been of the
form
A = AB-I-ACI I AQ.
The difference of meaning is that all B's need not now
be A's, nor all C's, &c. But we should still have
A = ABX! ACX I I AQX = AX.
We can always prove a proposition, if we find it more
convenient, by proving its equivalent. To assert that all
not-B's are not- A's, is exactly the same as to assert that all
A's are B's. Accordingly we may ascertain that A = AB
by first ascertaining that b = ab. If we observe, for in-
stance, that^all substances which are not solids are also
not capable of double refraction, it follows necessarily
that all double refracting substances are solids. We may
convince ourselves that all electric substances are noncon-
ductors of electricity, by reflecting that all good conduc-
tors do not, and in fact cannot, retain electric excitation.
When we come to questions of probability it will be found
^desirable to prove, as far as possible, both the original
proposition and its equivalent, as there is then an increased
area of observation.
The number of alternatives which may arise in the
division of a class varies greatly, and may be any number
from two upwards. Thus it is probable that every sub-
stance is either magnetic or diamagnetic, and no substance
can be both at the same time. The division then must be
made in the form
A = ABclA&C.
If now we can prove that all magnetic substances
are capable of polarity, say B = BC, and also that all
