GENERALIZATION. 243
we not know that Mr. Gladstone must die, because he is like
other men ? May we not argue that because some men die
therefore he must ? Is it requisite to ascend by induction
to the general proposition * all men must die/ and then
descend by deduction from that general proposition to the
case of Mr. Gladstone ? My answer will be undoubtedly
that it is necessary to ascend to general propositions.
The fundamental principle of the substitution of similars
gives us no warrant in affirming of Mr. Gladstone what
we know of other men, simply because we cannot be
sure that Mr. Gladstone is exactly similar to other men.
Until his death we cannot be perfectly sure that he
possesses precisely all the attributes of other men ; it is
a question of probability, and I have endeavoured to
explain the mode in which the theoiy of probability is
applied to calculate the probability that from a series
of similar events we may infer the recurrence of like
events under identical circumstances. There is then no
such process as tha.t of inferring from particulars to par-
ticulars. A careful analysis of the conditions under which
such an inference appears to be made, shows that the
process is really a general one, and that what is inferred
of a particular case might be inferred of all similar cases.
All reasoning is essentially general, and all science implies
generalization. In the very birth-time of philosophy this
was held to be so : ' Nulla scientia est de indivicliis, sed
de solis universalibus/ was the doctrine of Plato, delivered
by Porphyry. And Aristotle a held a like opinion

No one who holds the doctrine that reasoning may be
from particulars to particulars, can be supposed to have
