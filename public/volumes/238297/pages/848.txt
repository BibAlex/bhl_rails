brought into the solar system by the attractive powers of
Jupiter, Uranus, or other planets s. The classification of
nebulae as commenced by the two Herschels, and con-
tinued by Lord Eosse, Mr. Huggins, and others, will
probably lead at some future time to the discovery of
important empirical laws concerning the constitution of
the universe. The minute examination and classification
of meteorites, as carried on by Mr. Sorby and others,
seems likely to afford us an insight into the constitution
of the material universe.
We should never fail to remember and record the
slightest and most apparently inexplicable coincidences or
correlations, for they may prove of importance in the future.
Discoveries begin when we are least expecting them.
It is a very significant fact that the greater number
of variable stars are of a reddish colour. Not all variable
stars are red, nor all red stars variable, but considering
that only a small fraction of the observed stars are known
to be variable, and only a small fraction are red, the
number which fall into both classes is too great to be
accidental h . It is also remarkable that the greater number
of stars possessing great proper motion are double stars,
the star 61 Cygni being especially noticeable in this
respect 1 . The correlation in these cases is not perfect
and without exception, but the preponderance is so great
as to point to some natural correlation, the exact nature
of which must be a matter for future investigation. Sir
John Herschel has remarked that the two double stars
6 1 Cygni and a Centauri of which the orbits were well
ascertained, evidently belonged to the same family or
genus k .
