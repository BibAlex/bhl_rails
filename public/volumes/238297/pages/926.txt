436 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
attempted to inquire in this work, and it is not requisite
for my present purpose. If the law of gravity were the
only law of nature and the Creator had chosen to render
all matter obedient to that law, there would doubtless
be restrictions upon the effects derivable from any one
distribution of matter.
Hierarchy of Natural Laws.
A further consideration inevitably presents itself. A
natural law like that of gravitation expresses a certain
uniformity in the mode of action of agents submitted to
it, and this uniformity produces, as we have seen, certain
geometrical restrictions upon the effects which those
agents may produce. But there are other forces and
laws besides those of gravity. Pne force may override
another, and two laws may each be obeyed and may
each disguise the action of the other. Jin the intimate
constitution of matter there may be hidden springs of
force which, while acting in accordance with their own
fixed laws, may lead to sudden and unexpected changes.
So at least it has been found from time to time in the
past, and so there is every reason to believe it will be
found in the future. To the ancients it seemed incredible
that one lifeless stone could make another leap towards
it. [A piece of iron while it obeys the magnetic forces
of the loadstone does not the less obey the law of gravity^)
A plant also gravitates downwards as regards every con-
stituent cell or fibre, and yet it persists in growing
upwards.] Life altogether is an exception to the simple
phenomena of mineral substances, not in the sense of
disproving those laws, but in that of superadding forces
of new and inexplicable character. Doubtless no law of
chemistry is broken by the action of the nervous cells,
and no law of physics by the pulses of the nervous
