METHOD OF VARIATIONS. 53
Fizeau's method of measuring the velocity of light
enabled him to appreciate the time occupied by light in
travelling through a distance of eight or nine thousand
metres. But the revolving mirror of Wheatstone sub-
sequently enabled Foucault and Fizeau to measure the
velocity in a space of four metres. In this latter method
there was the obvious advantage that various media could
be substituted for air, and the temperature, density, and
other conditions of the experiment accurately governed or
defined.
Measurement of the Variable.
There is little use in obtaining exact measurements of
an effect unless we can also exactly measure the conditions
with which the effect is to be connected. It is absurd to
measure the electrical resistance of a piece of metal, its
elasticity, tenacity, density, or other physical qualities, if
these vary in degree, not only with the minute and almost
inappreciable impurities of the metal, but also with its
physical condition. If the same bar changes its properties
by being heated and cooled, and we cannot exactly define
the state in which it is at any moment, our care in
measuring will be wasted, because it can lead to no law.
It is of little use to determine very exactly the electric
conductibility of carbon, which as graphite or gas carbon
conducts like a metal, as diamond is almost a non-con-
ductor, and in several other forms possesses variable and
intermediate powers of conduction. It will be of use only
for immediate practical applications. Before measuring
these we ought to have something to measure of which
the conditions are capable of exact definition, and to
which at a future time we or others can recur. Similarly
the accuracy of our measurement need not much surpass
the accuracy with which we can define the conditions of
the object treated.
