EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE, EXPLANATION, &c. 187
in a hypothetical, but not therefore a less certain
manner.
Though only two of the metals, gold and silver, have
ever been observed to be transparent, we know on the
grounds of theory that they are all more or less so ; we
can even estimate by theory their refractive indices, and
prove that they are exceedingly high. The phenomena
of elliptic polarization, and perhaps also the theory of
internal radiation 1 ', depend upon the refractive index, and
thus, even when we cannot observe any refracted rays,
we can indirectly learn how they would be refracted.
In many cases large quantities of electricity must be
produced, which we cannot observe because it is instantly
discharged. In the common electric machine the cylinder
and rubber are made of non-conductors, so that we can
separate and accumulate the electricity. But even a little
damp, by serving as a conductor, prevents this separation
from enduring any sensible time. Hence there is little
or no doubt that when we rub two good conductors
against each other, for instance two pieces of metals,
much electricity is produced, but instantaneously con-
verted into some other form of energy. Dr. Joule, indeed,
believes that all the heat of friction is but transmuted
electricity.
As regards phenomena of insensible amount, Nature is
absolutely full of them. We must, in fact, regard those
considerable changes which we can observe as the com-
paratively speaking infinitely rare aggregates of minuter
changes. On a little reflection we must allow that no
object known to us remains for two instants of exactly the
same temperature. If so, the dimensions of objects must
be in a perpetual state of variation. The minor planetary
and lunar perturbations are indefinitely, or rather in-
finitely numerous, but usually too small to be detected by
