ties of these six numbers, to infer the properties of the
next number ending in five. If we proceed to test their
properties by the process of perfect induction, we soon
perceive that they have another common property, namely
that of being divisible ~by five without remainder. May
we then assert that the next number ending in five is also
divisible by five, and, if so, upon what grounds 1 Or
extending the question, Is every number ending in five
divisible by five ? Does it follow that because six num-
bers obey a supposed law, therefore 376,685,975 or any
other number, however large, obeys the law ? I answer
certainly not. The law in question is undoubtedly true ;
but its truth is not proved by any finite number of exam-
ples. All that these six numbers can do, is to suggest to
my mind the possible existence of such a law ; and I then
ascertain its truth, by proving deductively from the rules
of decimal numeration, that any number ending in five
must be made upi of multiples of five, and must therefore
be itself a multiple.
To make this more plain, let the reader now examine
the numbers
7, i7> 37> 47> 6 7> 97-
They all obviously end in 7 instead of 5, and though not
at equal intervals, the intervals are exactly the same as in
the previous case. After a little consideration, the reader
will perceive that these numbers all agree in being prime
numbers, or multiples of unity only. May we then infer
that the next, or any other number ending in 7, is a
prime number ? Clearly not, for on trial we find that
27, 57, 117 are not primes. Six instances, then, treated
empirically, lead us to a true and universal law in one
case, and mislead us in another case. We ought, in fact
to have no confidence in any law until we have treated it
deductively, and have shown that from the conditions
supposed the results expected must ensue. From the
