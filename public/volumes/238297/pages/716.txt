226 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
The Newtonian Method, the True Organum.
Laplace was of opinion that the ' Principia ' and the
' Opticks ' of Newton furnished the best models then
available of the delicate art of experimental and theo-
retical investigation. In these, as he says, we meet
with the most happy illustrations of the way in which,
from a series of inductions, we may rise to the causes of
phenomena, and thence descend again to all the resulting
details.
The popular notion concerning Newton's discoveries is
that in early life, while driven into the country by the
Great Plague, a falling apple accidentally suggested to
him the existence of gravitation, and that, availing him-
self of this hint, he was led to the discovery of the law
of gravitation, the explanation of which constitutes the
4 Principia/ It is difficult to imagine a more ludicrous and
inadequate picture of Newton's labours and position. No
originality, or at least priority, could be or was claimed
by Newton as regards the discovery of the celebrated law
of the inverse square, so closely associated with his name.
In a well-known Scholium d he acknowledges that Sir
Christopher Wren, Dr. Hooke, and Dr. Halley, had
severally observed the accordance of Kepler's third law
of motion of the planets with the principle of the inverse
square.
Newton's work was really that of developing the
methods of deductive reasoning and experimental verifica-
tion, by which alone great hypotheses can be brought to
the touch-stone of fact. Archimedes was the greatest of
ancient philosophers, for he showed how mathematical
theory could be wedded to physical experiments ; and his
works are the first true Organum. Newton is the modern
d ' Principia/ bk. I. Prop. iv.
