430 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
man and his Creator. The course of nature is regarded
as being determined by invariable principles of mechanics
which have acted since the world began, and will act for
infinite ages to come. Even if the origin of all things be
attributed to an intelligent creative mind, that Being is
regarded as having yielded up arbitrary power, and as
being subject like a human legislator to the laws which
he has himself enacted. Such notions I should describe
as superficial and erroneous, being derived, as I think,
from false views of the nature of scientific inference, and
the degree of certainty of the knowledge which we acquire
by inductive investigation.
A law of nature, as I regard the meaning of the
expression, is not a uniformity which must be obeyed by
all objects, but merely a uniformity which is as a matter of
fact obeyed by those objects which have come beneath
our observation. There is nothing whatever incompa-
tible with logic in the discovery of objects which should
prove exceptions to any law of nature. Perhaps the best
established law is that which asserts an invariable cor-
relation to exist between gravity and inertia, so that all
gravitating bodies are found to possess inertia, and all
bodies possessing inertia are found to gravitate. But it
would be no reproach to our scientific method, if something
were ultimately discovered to possess gravity without in-
ertia. Strictly defined and correctly interpreted, the law
itself would acknowledge the possibility ; for with the
statement of every law we ought properly to join an esti-
mate of the number of instances in which it has been
observed to hold true, and the probability thence calcu-
lated, that it will hold true in the next case. Now as we
before found (vol. i. p. 299) no finite number of instances "
can warrant us in expecting with certainty that the next
instance will be of like nature ; in the formulas yielded
by the inverse method of probabilities a unit always
