ANALOGY. 305
adduced, we learn that analogical reasoning leads us to
the conception of many things which, so far as we can
ascertain, do not exist. In this way great perplexities
have arisen in the use of language and mathematical
symbols. All language depends upon analogy ; &r we
join and arrange words so that they may represent the
corresponding junctions or arrangements of things and
their qualities. But in the use of language we are
obviously capable of forming many combinations of words
to which no corresponding meaning apparently exists.
The same difficulty arises in the use of mathematical
signs, and mathematicians have needlessly puzzled them-
selves about the square root of a negative quantity, which
is, in many applications of algebraic calculation, simply a
sign without any analogous meaning, there being a failure
of analogy.
