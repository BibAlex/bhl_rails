IN TROD UCTION. 2 3
it follows that ' The killer of a man is the killer of some
reasonable creature/ and also ' The killer of God's image/
This replacement of equivalents may be repeated over
and over again to any extent. Thus if person is identical
in meaning with individual, it follows that
Meeting of persons = meeting of individuals ;
and if assemblage = meeting, we may make a new replace-
ment and show that
Meeting of persons = assemblage of individuals.
We may in fact found upon this principle of substitution
a most general axiom in the following terms ^ :
Same parts samely related make same wholes.
If, for instance, exactly similar bricks be used to build
two houses, and they be similarly placed in each house, the
two houses must be similar. There are millions of cells
in a human body, but if each cell of one person were
represented by an exactly similar cell similarly placed in
another body, the two persons would be undistinguishable,
and would be only numerically different. It is upon this
principle, as we shall see, that all accurate processes of
measurement depend. If for a weight in a scale of
a balance we substitute another weight, and the equili-
brium remains entirely unchanged, then the weights must
be exactly equal. The general test of equality is substi-
tution. Objects are equally bright when on replacing one
by the other the eye perceives no difference. Two objects
are equal in dimensions when tested by the same gauge
they fit in the same manner. Generally speaking, two
objects are alike so far as when substituted one for another
no alteration is produced, and vice versd when alike no
alteration is produced by the substitution.
