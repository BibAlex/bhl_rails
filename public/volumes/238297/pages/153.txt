THE LOGICAL MACHINE. 127
Disjunctive propositions are to be treated in an exactly
similar manner. Thus, to work the premises
A = AB I AC
B t C = BD t CD,
it is only necessary to press in succession the keys
A (subj.), copula, A (pred.), B, | A,C, full stop.
B (subj.), t C, copula, B (pred.), D, | , C, D, full stop.
The combinations then remaining will be as follows
ABCD aBCD
ABcD aBcD
A&CD a&CD
afoD
abed.
On pressing the subject key A, all the possible com-
binations which do not contain A will disappear, and the
description of A may be gathered from what remains,
namely that it is always D. The full-stop key restores
all combinations consistent with the premises and any
other selection may be made, as say not-D, which will
be found to be always not- A, not-B, and not-C.
At the end of every problem, when no further questions
need be addressed to the machine, it is desirable to press
the Finis key, which has the effect of bringing into view
the whole of the conceivable combinations of the abece-
darium. This key in fact obliterates the conditions im-
pressed upon the machine by moving back into their
ordinary places those combinations which had been re-
jected as inconsistent with the premises. Before begin-
ning any new problem it is requisite to observe that
the whole sixteen combinations are visible. After the
Finis key has been used the machine represents a mind
endowed with powers of thought, but wholly devoid
of knowledge. It would not in that condition give any
answer but such as would consist in the primary laws
of thought themselves. But when any proposition is
