METHOD OF VARIATWNS. 63
siderable presumption in favour of the identity of the
body apart from the similarity of the orbit. There is
nothing which so strongly fascinates the attention of men
as the recurrence time after time of some unusual event.
Things and appearances which remain ever the same,
like mountains and valleys, fail to excite the curiosity of
a primitive people. It has been remarked by Laplace
that even in his day the rising of Venus in its brightest
phase never failed to excite surprise and interest. So
there is little doubt that the first germ of physical
science arose in the attention given by Eastern people to
the changes of the moon and the motions of the planets.
One of the earliest astronomical discoveries must have
consisted in proving the identity of the morning and
evening stars, on the ground of their similarity of aspect
and invariable alternation 9. Periodical changes of a
somewhat complicated kind must have been understood
by the Chaldseans, because they were aware of the cycle
of 6585 days or 19 years which brings round the new
and full moon upon the same days, hours, and even
minutes of the year. The earliest efforts of scientific
prophecy were founded upon this knowledge, and if at
present we cannot help wondering at the precise antici-
pations of the nautical almanack, we may readily imagine
the wonder excited by such successful predictions in
early times.
Combined Periodic Changes.
We shall seldom or never find a body subject to a single
periodic variation, and free from any other disturbances.
As a general rule we may expect the periodic variation
itself to undergo variation, which may possibly be secular
or incapable of repetition, but is more likely to prove
