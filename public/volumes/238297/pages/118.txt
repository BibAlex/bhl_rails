92 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
canine, bicuspid, or mola,r,' it follows that a not-incisor
tooth is either canine, bicuspid, or molar/ The general
rule is that from the denial of any of the alternatives the
affirmation of the remainder can be inferred. Now this
result clearly follows from our process of substitution ; for
if we have the proposition
A = B | C|D,
and insert this expression for A on one side of the self-
evident identity
Ab = Aft,
we obtain Ab = ABb -I- AbC [ AbD ;
and, as the first of the three alternatives is self-contra-
dictory, we strike it out according to the law of contra-
diction : there remains
Ab = AbC -I- A6D.
Thus our system fully includes and explains that mood of
the Disjunctive Syllogism technically called the modus
tollendo ponens.
But the reader must carefully observe that the Dis-
junctive Syllogism of the mood ponendo tollens, which af-
firms one alternative, and thence infers the denial of the rest,
cannot be held true in this system. If I say, indeed, that
Water is either salt or fresh water,
it seems evident that ' water which is salt is not fresh/
But this inference really proceeds from our knowledge
that water cannot be at once salt and fresh. This incon-
sistency of the alternatives, as I have fully shown, will
not always hold. Thus, if I say
Gems are either rare stones or beautiful stones, (i)
it will obviously not follow that
A rare gem is not a beautiful stone, (2)
nor that
A beautiful gem is not a rare stone. (3)
Our symbolic method gives only true conclusions ; for if
we take
