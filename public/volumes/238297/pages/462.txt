436 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
tion ; Herschel rests upon geometrical considerations ; while
Laplace and Quetelet regard the Law of Error as a de-
velopment of the doctrine of combinations ; that of Gauss
may be first noticed.
The Law of Error expresses the comparative probability!
of errors of various magnitude, and partly from ex-
perience, partly from a priori considerations, we may
readily lay down certain conditions to which the law will
certainly conform. It may fairly be assumed as a first
principle to guide us in the selection of the law, that large
errors will be far less frequent and probable than small
ones. We know that very large errors are almost im-
possible, so that the probability must rapidly decrease as
the amount of the error increases. A second principle is
that positive and negative errors shall be equally pro-
bable, which may certainly be assumed, because we are
supposed to be devoid of any knowledge as to the causes
of the residual errors. It follows that the probability of
the error must be a function of an even power of the
magnitude, that is of the square, or the fourth power, or
the sixth power, otherwise the probability of the same
amount of error would vary accordingly as the error was
positive or negative. The even powers x 2 , x*, X Q , &c., are
always intrinsically positive, whether x be positive or
negative. There is no d priori reason why one rather
than another of these even powers should be selected.
Gauss himself allows that the fourth or sixth powers would
fulfil the conditions as well as the second 6 , but in the
absence of any theoretical reasons we should prefer the
second power, because it leads to formulae of great com-
parative simplicity. Did the Law of Error necessitate the
use of the higher powers of the error, the complexity of
