class in another, or of an object in a class. It was called
a universal affirmative proposition, because the attribute
vertebrate was affirmed of the whole subject mammalia ;
but the attribute was said to be undistributed, because
not all vertebrata were of necessity involved in the propo-
sition. Aristotle, overlooking the importance of simple
identities, and indeed almost denying their existence, un-
fortunately founded his system upon the notion of inclusion
in a class, in place of identity. He regarded inference as
resting upon the rule that what is true of the containing
class is true of the contained, instead of the vastly more
general rule that what is true of a class or thing is true
of the like. Thus he not only reduced logic to a fragment
of its proper self, but destroyed the deep analogies which
bind together logical and mathematical reasoning. Hence
a crowd of defects, difficulties and errors which will long
disfigure the first and simplest of the sciences.
It is surely evident that the relation of inclusion rests
upon a relation of identity. Mammalian animals cannot
be included among vertebrates unless they be identical
with part of the vertebrates. Cabinet Ministers are in-
cluded almost always in the class Members of Parlia-
ment, because they are identical with some who sit in
Parliament. We may indicate this identity with a part
of the larger class in various ways ; as for instance
Mammalia = part of the vertebrata
Diatoms = species of plants.
Cabinet Ministers = some Members of Parliament.
Iron = a metal.
In ordinary language the verbs is or are express mere
inclusion more often than not. Men are mortals, means
that men form a part of the class mortal, but great con-
fusion exists between this sense of the verb and that in
which it expresses identity, as in ' The sun is the centre of
the planetary system/ The introduction of the indefinite
