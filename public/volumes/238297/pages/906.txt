416 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
fication. Naturalists have never pointed out any separate
method of deciding what are the results of distinct crea-
tions, and what are not. As Darwin says'*, ' the definition
must not include an element which cannot possibly be
ascertained, such as an act of creation/ It is, in fact,
by investigation of forms and classification that we should
ascertain what were distinct creations and what were not ;
this information would be a result and not a means of
classification.
The eminent naturalist Agassiz seems to consider that
he has discovered an important principle, to the effect that
general plan or structure is the true ground for the dis-
crimination of the great classes of animals, which may be
called branches of the animal kingdom 1 ". He also thinks
that genera are definite and natural groups. ' Genera/
he says 8 , 'are most closely allied groups of animals, differ-
ing neither in form, nor in complication of structure, but
simply in the ultimate structural peculiarities of some
of their parts; and this is, I believe, the best definition
which can be given of genera,' But it is surely apparent
that there are endless degrees both of structural peculi-
arity and of complication of structure. It is impossible to
define the amount of structural peculiarity which consti-
tutes the genus as distinguished from the species.
The form which any classification of plants or animals
tends to take is that of an unlimited series of subaltern
classes. Originally botanists confined themselves for the
most part to a limited number of such classes ; thus
Linnaeus adopted Class, Order, Genus, Species, and
Variety, and even seemed to think that there was some-
thing essentially natural in a five- fold arrangement of
groups *.
