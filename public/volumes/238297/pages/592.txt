102 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Four Meanings of Equality.
Although it might seem that there are few terms more
free from ambiguity than the term equal, yet scientific
men do as a matter of fact employ it with four meanings,
which it is very desirable to distinguish carefully. These
meanings I may briefly describe as
(1) Absolute Equality.
(2) Sub-equality.
(3) Apparent Equality.
(4) Probable Equality.
By absolute equality we signify that which is complete
and perfect to the last degree ; but it is obvious that we
can only know such equality in a theoretical or hypothe-
tical manner. The areas of two triangles standing upon
the same base and between the same parallels are abso-
lutely equal. Hippocrates beautifully proved that the
area of a lunula or figure contained between two seg-
ments of circles was absolutely equal to that of a certain
right-angled triangle. As a general rule all geometrical
and other elementary mathematical theorems involve ab-
solute equality.
De Morgan proposed to describe as sub-equal those
quantities which are equal within an infinitely small
quantity, so that x is sub-equal to x + dx. The whole of
the differential calculus may, as I apprehend it, be said
to arise out of the neglect of infinitely small quantities ;
with this subject however we are not in this place much
concerned. In mathematical science many other subtle
distinctions may have to be drawn between kinds of
equality, as De Morgan has shown in a remarkable memoir
4 On Infinity ; and on the Sign of Equality ' b .
Apparent equality is that with which physical science
deals. Those magnitudes are practically equal which
