tended and careful examination has often proved their
falsity. Not many years since it was quite a well credited
conclusion in geology that no remains of man were found
in connexion with those of extinct animals, or in any de-
posit not actually at present in course of formation. Even
Babbage accepted this conclusion as strongly confirmatory
of the Mosaic accounts 8 . But when the opinion was yet
universally held, flint implements had been found dis-
proving any such conclusion, and overwhelming evidence
of man's long continued existence has since been found.
At the end of the last century when Herschel had searched
the heavens with his powerful telescopes, there seemed
little probability that planets yet remained unseen within
the orbit of Jupiter. But on the first day of this century
such an opinion was overturned by the discovery of Ceres,
and more than a hundred other small planets have since
been added to the lists of the planetary system.
The discovery of the Eozoon Canadense in strata of
much greater age than any previously known to contain
organic remains, has given a severe shock to many
groundless opinions concerning the origin of organic
forms ; and the oceanic dredging expeditions, under Dr.
Carpenter and Professor Wyville Thompson, have further
disconcerted geologists by disclosing the continued ex-
istence of forms long supposed to be extinct. These
and many other cases which might be quoted show the
extremely unsafe character of negative inductions.
It must not be supposed that negative arguments are
of no force and value. The earth's surface, for instance,
has been sufficiently searched to render it highly impro-
bable that any terrestrial animals of the size of a camel
remain to be discovered. It is believed that no new large
animal has been encountered in the last eighteen or twenty
