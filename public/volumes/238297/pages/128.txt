102 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
This result is in strict accordance with the fundamental
principles of inference, and it may be a question whether
it is not a self-evident result, independent of the steps of
deduction by which we have reached it. For where two
classes are coincident like A and B, whatever is true
of the one is true of the other ; what is excluded from
the one must be excluded from the other similarly.
Now as a bears to A exactly the same relation that b
bears to B, the identity of either pair follows from the
identity of the other pair. In every identity, equality,
or similarity, we may argue from the negative of the
one side to the negative of the other. Thus at ordinary
temperatures
Mercury = liquid-metal,
hence obviously
Not-mercury = not-liquid- metal ;
or since
Sirius = brightest fixed star,
it follows that whatever star is not the brightest is not
Sirius, and vice versd. Every correct definition is of the
form A = B, and may often require to be applied in the
equivalent negative form.
Let us take as an illustration of the mode of using this
result the argument following :
Vowels are letters which can be sounded alone, (i)
The letter w cannot be sounded alone ; (2)
Therefore the letter w is not a vowel. (3)
Here we have a definition (i), and a comparison of a
thing with that definition (2), leading to exclusion of the
thing from the class defined.
Taking the terms
A = vowel,
B = letter which can be sounded alone,
C = letter w
