increased and the amount of each error decreased, and the
arithmetical triangle will always give us the proportional
frequency of the resulting errors. Thus if there be five
positive causes of error and five negative causes, the fol-
lowing table shows the comparative numbers of aggregate
errors of various amount which will be the result :
Direction of Error.
Positive Error.
Negative Error.
Amount of Error.
5, 4> 3, 2, i
O
i, 2, 3,* 4, 5
Number of such Errors.
I, 10, 45, 120, 210
252
210, 120, 45, 10, i
It is plain that from such numbers I can ascertain the
probability of any particular amount of error under the
conditions supposed. Thus the probability of a positive
error of exactlv one inch is
210
1024'
in which fraction the
numerator is the exact number of combinations giving
one inch positive error, and the denominator the whole
number of possible errors of all magnitudes. I can also,
by adding together the appropriate numbers, get the pro-
bability of an error not exceeding a certain amount. Thus
the probability of an error of three inches or less, positive
or negative, is a fraction whose numerator is the sum of
45 + 120 + 210 + 252 + 210+120 + 45, and the denomi-
nator, as before, giving the result - .
We may see at once that, according to these principles,
the probability of small errors is far greater than of large
ones : thus the odds are 1002 to 22, or more than 45 to i,
that the error will not exceed three inches ; and the odds
are 1022 to 2 against the occurrence of the greatest pos-
sible error of five inches. The existence of no error at all
is the most likely event; but a small error, such as that of
one inch positive, is little less likely.
