THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF PHENOMENA. 317
searches of Bunsen and Eoscoe on the chemical action of
light, we were absolutely devoid of any mode of measuring
the energy of light ; even now the methods are tedious,
and it is not clear that they give the energy of light so
much as one of its special effects. Many natural phe-
nomena have hardly yet been made the subject of mea-
surement at all, such as the intensity of sound, the phe-
nomena of taste and smell, the magnitude of atoms, the
temperature of the electric spark or of the sun's photo-
sphere.
To suppose, then, that quantitative science treats only of
exactly measurable quantities, is a gross if it be a common
mistake. Whenever we are treating of an event which
either happens altogether or does not happen at all, we are
engaged with a non-quantitative phenomenon, a matter of
fact, not of degree ; but whenever a thing may be greater or
less, or twice or thrice as great as another, whenever, in short,
ratio enters even in the rudest manner, there science will
have a quantitative character. There can be little doubt,
indeed, that every science as it progresses will become
gradually more and more quantitative. Numerical pre-
cision is doubtless the very soul of science, as Herschel
said 6 , and as all natural objects exist in space, and involve
molecular movements, measurable in velocity and extent,
there is no apparent limit to the ultimate extension of
quantitative science. But the reader must not for a
moment suppose that, because we depend more and more
upon mathematical methods, we leave logical methods
behind us. Number, as I have endeavoured to show,
is logical in its origin, and quantity is but a development
of number, or is analogous thereto.
