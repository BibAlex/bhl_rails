CLASSIFICATION. 397
matter of the greatest importance, for, unless we can
recognise, from time to time, objects or substances which
have been before investigated, all recorded discoveries
would lose their value. Even a single investigator must
have some means of recording or systematizing his ob-
servations of any large number of objects like those
furnished by the vegetable and animal kingdoms.
Now whenever a class has been properly formed, a
definition must have been laid down, stating the qualities
and circumstances possessed by all the objects which are
intended to be included in the class, and not possessed
completely by any other objects. Diagnosis, therefore,
consists simply in comparing the qualities of a certain
object with the definitions of a series of classes ; the
absence in the object of any one quality stated in the
definition excludes it from the class thus defined ; whereas,
if we find every point of a definition exactly fulfilled in
the specimen, we may at once assign, it to the class in
question. It is of course by no means certain that every-
thing which has been affirmed of a class is true of all
objects afterwards referred to the class ; for this would
be a case of imperfect inference, which is never more
than a matter of probability. A definition can only make
known a finite number of the properties of an object, so
that it always remains possible that objects agreeing in
those assigned properties will differ in other ones. An
individual cannot be defined, and can only be made known
by the exhibition of the individual itself, or by a material
specimen exactly representing it. But this and many
other questions relating to definition must be treated if
I am able to take up the general subject of language in
another work.
Diagnostic systems of classification should, as a general
rule, be arranged on the bifurcate method explicitly. Any
property may be chosen which divides the whole group
