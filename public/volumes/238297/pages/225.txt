COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS. 199
that concur in producing a given event, or effect, is
oftentimes so immensely great, and the causes them-
selves are so different one from another, that it is ex-
tremely difficult to reckon up all the different ways in
which they may be arranged or combined together, it
often happens that men, even of the "best understandings
and greatest circumspection, are guilty of that fault in
reasoning which the writers on logic call the insufficient
or imperfect enumeration of parts or cases : insomuch
that I will venture to assert, that this is the chief, and
almost the only, source of the vast number of erroneous
opinions, and those too very often in matters of great
importance, which we are apt to form on all the subjects
we reflect upon, whether they relate to the knowledge of
nature or the merits and motives of human actions. It

affords a cure to this weakness, or defect, of our under-
standings, and teaches us so to enumerate all the possible
ways in which a given number of things may be mixed
and combined together, that we may be certain that we
have not omitted any one arrangement of them that can
lead to the object of our inquiry, deserves to be con-
sidered as most eminently useful and worthy of our
highest esteem and attention. And this is the business
of the art or doctrine of combinations. Nor is this art
or doctrine to be considered merely as a branch of the
mathematical sciences. For it has a relation to almost
every species of useful knowledge that the mind of man
can be employed upon. It proceeds indeed upon mathe-
matical principles, in calculating the number of the com-
binations of the things proposed : but by the conclusions
that are obtained by it, the sagacity of the natural
philosopher, the exactness of the historian, the skill and
judgment of the physician, and the prudence and fore-
sight of the politician maybe assisted ; because the business
