-THE THEORY OF PROBABILITY. 225
Does probability exist in the things which are probable,
or in the mind which regards them as such ? The
etymology of the name lends us no assistance : for,
curiously enough, probable is ultimately the same word
as provable, a good instance of one word becoming differ-
entiated to two opposite meanings.
Chance cannot be the subject of the theory, because
there is really no such thing as chance, a regarded as pro-
ducing and governing events. This name signifies/a^'^/,
and the notion is continually used as a simile to express
uncertainty, because we can seldom predict how a die,
or a coin, or a leaf will fall, or when a bullet will hit
the mark. But every one knows, on a little reflection, that
it is in our knowledge the deficiency lies, not in the cer-
tainty of nature's laws. There is no doubt in lightning
as to the point it shall strike ; in the greatest storm there
is nothing capricious ; not a grain of sand lies upon the
beach, but infinite knowledge would account for its lying
there ; and the course of every falling leaf is guided by
the same principles of mechanics as rule the motions of
the heavenly bodies.
Cha.nce then exists not in nature, and cannot co-exist
with knowledge ; it is merely an expression for our
ignorance of the causes in -action, and our consequent
inability to predict the result, or to bring it about in-
fallibly. In nature the happening of a physical event
has been pre-determined from the first fashioning of the
universe. Probability belongs wholly to the mind ; this
indeed is proved by the fact that different minds may
regard the very same event at the same time with totally
different degrees of probability. A steam-vessel, for in-
stance, is missing and some persons believe that she has
sunk in mid-ocean ; others think differently. In the
