EXCEPTIONAL PHENOMENA. 327
nebulous mass from which our system has doubtless been
evolved. The retrograde motions of the satellites of
Uranus constituted a distinct breach in this law of uniform
direction, which became all the more interesting when the
single satellite of Neptune was also found to be retro-
grade. It now became probable, as Baden Powell well
observed, that the anomaly would cease to be singular,
and become a case of another law, pointing to some
general interference, which has taken place on the bounds
of the planetary system. Not only have the satellites
suffered from this perturbance, but Uranus is also
anomalous in having an axis of rotation lying nearly in
the ecliptic ; and Neptune constitutes a distinct exception
to the empirical law of Bode concerning the distances of
the planets, which exceptional circumstance may pos-
sibly be due to the same disturbance.
Geology is a science in which accidental exceptions are
very likely to occur. Only when we find strata in their
original relative positions, can we surely infer that the
order of succession is the order of time. But it not
uncommonly happens that strata are inverted by the
bending and doubling action of extreme pressure. Land-
slips may carry one body of rock into proximity with an
unrelated series, and produce results apparently inex-
plicable 1 . Floods, streams, icebergs, and other casual
agents, may occasionally lodge remains in places where
they would be wholly unexpected.
Though such interfering causes may have been often
wrongly supposed to explain important discoveries, the
geologist must of course always bear the possibility of
interference in mind. Scarcely more than a century ago
it was yet held by many persons that fossils were acci-
dental productions of nature, mere forms into which
minerals had been shaped by no peculiar cause. Voltaire
