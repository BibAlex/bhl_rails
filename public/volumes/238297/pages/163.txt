THE NATURE OF INFERENCE. 137
does it destroy, but it transmutes and throws the same
matter into a new form.
The difficult question still remains, Where does novelty
of form begin ? Is it a case of inference when we pass
from f Sincerity is the parent of truth ' to ' The parent of
truth is sincerity V The old logicians would have called
this change conversion, one case of immediate inference.
But as all identity is necessarily reciprocal, and the very
meaning of such a proposition is that the two terms are
identical in their signification, I fail to see any difference
between the statements whatever. As well might we say
that a = b and b = a are different equations.
Another point of difficulty is to decide when a change
is merely grammatical and when it involves a real logical
transformation. Between a table of wood and a wooden
table there is no logical difference (p. 37), the adjective
being merely a convenient substitute for the prepositional
phrase. But it is uncertain to my mind whether the
change from 'All men are mortal' to 'No men are not
mortal' is purely grammatical. Logical change may
perhaps be best described as consisting in the determina-
tion of a relation between certain classes of objects from
a relation between certain other classes. Thus I consider
it a truly logical inference when we pass from c All men
are mortal' to 'All immortals are not-men/ because the
classes immortals and not-men are different from mortals
and men, and yet the propositions contain at the bottom
the very same truth, as shown in the combinations of the
Abecedarium.
From logical inference we must discriminate the passage
from the qualitative to the quantitative form of a pro-
position. We state the same truth when we say that
' mortality belongs to all men,' as when we assert that
* all men are mortals/ Here we do not pass from class to
class, but from one kind of term, the abstract, to another
