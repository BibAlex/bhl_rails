206 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
70 elements which mode of determination is most accurate.
Modern chemistry presents us with an almost infinitely
extensive web of numerical ratios developed out of a com-
paratively few fundamental ratios.
In hygrometry we are presented with a choice among
at least four modes of measuring the quantity of aqueous
vapour contained in a given bulk of air. We can extract
the vapour by absorption in sulphuric acid, and directly
weigh its amount ; we can place the air in a barometer
tube and observe how much the absorption of the vapour
alters the elastic force of the air ; we can observe the dew
point of the air, or the temperature at which the vapour
becomes saturated ; or, lastly, we can insert a dry and wet
bulb thermometer and observe the temperature of an
evaporating surface. Now the results of each such mode
can be connected by well-established theory with those
of the other modes, and we can select for each experiment
that mode which is either most accurate or most conve-
nient. The chemical method of direct measurement is
probably capable of the greatest accuracy, but is trouble-
some ; the dry and wet bulb thermometer is sufficiently
exact for meteorological purposes.
Agreement of Distinct Modes of Measurement.
Many illustrations might be given of the accordance
which has been found to exist in some cases between the
results of entirely different methods of arriving at the
measurement of a physical quantity. While such accord-
ance must, in the absence of any information to the contrary,
be regarded as the best possible proof of the approximate
correctness of the mean result, yet instances have occurred
to show that we can never take too much trouble in con-
firming experimental results of great importance. Even
when three or more distinct methods have given nearly
