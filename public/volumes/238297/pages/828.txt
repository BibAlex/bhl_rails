338 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
nation of the strata of the globe becomes more and more
complete, our views of the origin and succession of life
upon the globe must undergo many changes and ex-
tensions.
Unclassed Exceptions*
At every period of scientific progress there will neces-
sarily exist a multitude of exceptional and unexplained
phenomena which we know not how to regard. They are
the outstanding facts upon which the labours of investi-
gators must be exerted, the ore from which the gold of
future discovery is to be extracted. It might be thought
that, as our knowledge of the laws of nature increases,
the number of such exceptions should decrease ; but, on
the contrary, the more we know the more there is yet to
learn and explain. This arises from several reasons; in
the first place the principal laws and forces in nature are
numerous, so that he who bears in mind the wonderfully
large numbers developed in the doctrine of combinations,
will anticipate the existence of almost infinitely nume-
rous relations of one law to another. When we are once
in possession of a law, we are potentially in possession of
all its consequences ; but it doe's not follow that the mind
of man, so limited in its powers and capacities, can actu-
ally work them all out in detail. Just as the aberration
of light was discovered empirically, though it should have
been foreseen, so there are doubtless multitudes of unex-
plained facts, the connexion of which with laws of nature
already known to us, we should perceive, were we not
hindered by the imperfection of our deductive powers.
But, in the second place, as will be more fully pointed
out, it is not to be supposed that we have in any degree
approximated to an exhaustion of nature's powers. The
