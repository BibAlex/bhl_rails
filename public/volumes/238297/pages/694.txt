204 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Mr. E. J. Stone having re-discussed those observations d
found that grave oversights had been made in the calcu-
lations, which being corrected would alter the estimate
of parallax to 8"*9i, a quantity in such comparatively
close accordance with the other results that astronomers
did not hesitate at once to reduce their estimate of the
sun's mean distance from 95,274,000 to 91,771,000 miles,
although this alteration involved a corresponding correc-
tion in the assumed magnitudes and distances of most of
the heavenly bodies. The final decision of this question
of the ratio between the earth and the visible universe, so
far as it can be decided in the present century, must be
made at the approaching transits of Venus in 1874 and
1882.
In this important and interesting question the theo-
retical relations between the velocity of light, the constant
of aberration, the sun's parallax, and the sun's mean dis-
tance, are of the simplest character, and can hardly be
open to any doubt,^so that the only doubt was as to which
result of observation was the most reliable. Eventually the
chief discrepancy was found to arise from misapprehension
in the reduction of observations, but we have a satisfactory
example of the value of different methods of estimation
in leading to the detection of a serious error. Is it not
surprising that Foucault by measuring the velocity of light
when passing through the space of a few yards, should
lead the way to a change in our estimates of the magni-
tude of the whole universe ?
