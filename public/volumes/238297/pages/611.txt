QUANTITATIVE INDUCTION. 121
results will be as sure and accurate as any we can attain to.
But such a complete procedure is more than we generally
mean by interpolation, which generally denotes the em-
ployment of some general method of estimating in a
merely approximate and probable manner the results
which might have been expected independently of any
complete theoretical investigation.
Regarded in this light, interpolation is in reality an
indeterminate problem. From given values of a function
it is impossible to determine that function ; for we can
always invent an infinite number of functions which would
give those values if we are not restricted by any other
conditions, just as through a given series of points we can
always draw an infinite number of curves, if we may di-
verge between or beyond the points into bends and cusps
as we think fit . In any process of interpolation we must
in fact be guided more or less by a priori considerations ;
we must know, for instance, whether or not periodical
fluctuations are to be expected, and we must be guided
accordingly in the choice of mathematical formulae. Sup-
posing, for the present, that the phenomenon is non-
periodic, we next proceed to assume that the function
can be expressed in a limited series of the powers of the
variable. The number of powers which can be included
depends upon the number of experimental results avail-
able, and must be at least one less than this number. By
processes of calculation, which have been already alluded to
in the section on empirical formulas, we can then calculate
the coefficients of the powers, and obtain an empirical
formula which will give the required intermediate results.
In reality, then, we return to the methods treated under
the head of approximation and empirical formulas; and
interpolation, as commonly understood, consists in assum-
