22 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
We may also endow with special meanings the letter-
terms A, B and 0, and the process of inferen.ce will never
be false. Thus let the sign ** mean 4s height of/ and
let
A = Snowdon,
B = Highest mountain in England or Wales,
C = 3590 feet ;
then it obviously follows that since '3590 feet is the
height of Snowdon/ and ' Snowdon = the highest mountain
in England or Wales/ then * 3590 feet is the height of the
highest mountain in England or Wales/
One result of this general process of inference is that
we may in any aggregate or complex whole replace any
part by its equivalent without altering the whole. To
alter is to make a difference, but if in replacing a part I
make no difference, there is no alteration of the whole.
Many inferences which have been very imperfectly in-
cluded in logical formulae at once follow. I remember the
late Prof, de Morgan remarking that all Aristotle's logic
could not prove that * Because a horse is an animal, the
head of a horse is the head of an animal/ I conceive that
this amounts merely to replacing in the complete notion
head of a horse, the term * horse' by its equivalent some
animal or an animal. Similarly, since
The Lord Chancellor = The Speaker "of the House of
Lords,
it follows that
The death of the Lord Chancellor = The death of the
Speaker of the House of Lords ;
and any event, circumstance or thing which stands in a
certain relation to the one will stand in like relation to
the other. Milton reasons in this way when he says, in
his Areopagitica, ' Who kills a man, kills a reasonable crea-
ture, God's image.' If we may suppose him to mean
God's image = man = some reasonable creature,
