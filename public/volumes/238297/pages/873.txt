In the above scheme we find the bifurcate principle
accurately but not completely applied. Each genus is
subdivided into two species, described by a pair of posi-
tive and negative terms, so that the species are together
equal in extent to the genus. But it will of course be
observed that each negative branch is left without further
subdivision, so that there is only a single infima species,
namely man, instead of thirty-two final branches, as there
would be in a theoretically complete system.
This tree was subsequently reproduced in the works
of a multitude of logicians in a form which is more
complicated and not so good as that of Nicephorus. Thus
