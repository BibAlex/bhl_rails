THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
I have made a series of experiments in a third manner,
which seemed to me even more interesting, and capable
of more extensive trial. Taking a handful of ten coins,
usually shillings, I threw them up time after time, and
registered the numbers of heads which appeared each
time. Now the probability of obtaining 10 , 9 , 8 , 7, &c.,
heads is proportional to the number of combinations of
10,9,8,7, &c., things out of 10 things. Consequently
the results ought to approximate to the numbers in the
eleventh line of the Arithmetical Triangle. I made
altogether 2048 throws, in two sets of 1024 throws each,
and the numbers obtained are given in the following

The whole number of single throws of coins amounted
to 10x2048 or 20,480 in all, one half of which or
10,240 should theoretically give head. The total number
of heads obtained was actually 10,353, or 5222 in the
first series, and 5131 in the second. The coincidence
with theory is pretty close, but considering the large
number of throws there is some reason to suspect a
tendency in favour of heads.
The special interest of this trial consists in the ex-
hibition, in a practical form, of the results of Bernoulli's
theorem, and the law of error or divergence from the
