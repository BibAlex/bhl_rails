82 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
It is undoubtedly possible by the laws of optics, that the
same surface may at one and the same moment give off
light of its own and reflect the light from other bodies.
We speak familiarly of deaf or dumb persons, knowing
that the majority of those who are deaf from birth are
also dumb.
There can be no doubt that in a great many cases,
perhaps the greater number of cases, alternatives are
exclusive as a matter of fact. Any one number is incom-
patible with any other ; one point of time or place is
exclusive of all others. Roger Bacon died either in 1284
or 1292 ; it is certain that he could not die in both years.
Henry Fielding was born either in Dublin or Somerset-
shire ; he could not be born in both places. There is so
much more precision and clearness in the use of exclusive
alternatives that we ought doubtless to select them
when possible. Old works on logic accordingly contained
a rule directing that the Membra dividentia, the parts of
a division or the constituent species of a genus should be
exclusive of each other.
It is no doubt owing to the great prevalence and
convenience of exclusive divisions that the majority of
logicians have held it necessary to make every alternative
in a disjunctive proposition exclusive of every other one.
Aquinas considered that when this was not the case the
proposition was actually false, and Kant adopted the same
opinion a . A multitude of statements to the same effect
might readily be quoted, and if the question were to be
determined by the weight of historical evidence, it would
certainly go against my view. Among recent logicians
Sir W. Hamilton, as well as Dr. Boole, took the exclusive
side. But there are authorities to the opposite effect.
Whately, Mansel, and J. S. Mill, have all pointed out that
a Hansel's 'Aldrich,' p. 103, and 'Prolegomena Logica,' p. 221.
