serious character than the theoretical ones. The length
of a pendulum is not the ordinary length of the instru-
ment, which might be greatly varied, without affecting
the duration of a vibration, but the distance from the
centre of suspension to the centre of oscillation. There is
no direct means of determining this centre, which depends
upon the average momentum of all the particles of the
pendulum as regards the centre of suspension. Huyghens
discovered that the centres of suspension and oscillation
are interchangeable, and Captain Kater pointed out that
if a pendulum vibrates with exactly the same rapidity
when suspended from two different points, the distance
between these points is the true length of the equivalent
simple pendulum 1 ". But the practical difficulties in em-
ploying Kater's reversible pendulum are considerable, and
questions regarding the disturbance of the air, the force
of gravity or even the interference of electrical attractions
have to be entertained. It has been shown that all the
experiments made under the authority of government for
establishing the ratio between the standard yard and the
seconds' pendulum, were vitiated by an error in the correc-
tions for the resisting, adherent or buoyant power of the
air in which the pendulum swung. Even if such correc-
tions were rendered unnecessary by operating in a vacuum,
other difficult questions remain 8 . Gauss' mode of com-
paring the vibrations of a wire pendulum when suspended
at two different lengths is open to equal or greater practi-
cal difficulties. Thus it is found that the pendulum
standard cannot compete in accuracy arid certainty with
the simple bar standard, and the method would only be
useful as an accessory mode of 'restoring the bar standards
if at any time again destroyed.
