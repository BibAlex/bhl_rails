EXPERIMENT. 29
which previous experimenters had thought essential for
the production of electrical phenomena. Davy asserted
that no known fluids, except such as contain water, could
be made the medium of connexion between the poles of a
battery; and some chemists believed that water was an
essential agent in electro-chemical decomposition. Faraday
gives abundant experiments to show that other fluids
allow of electrolysis, and attributes the erroneous opinion
to the very general use of water as a solvent, and its
presence in most natural bodies . It was, in fact, upon
purely negative (vol. ii. p. 16) and weak evidence that the
opinion had been founded.
Many experimenters attributed peculiar and even myste-
rious powers to the poles of a battery, likening them to
magnets, which, by their attractive powers, tear apart the
elements of a substance. By a most beautiful series of
experiments^ Faraday proved conclusively that, on the
contrary, the substance of the poles is of no importance,
being merely the path through which the electric force
reaches the liquid acted upon. Poles of water, charcoal,
and many diverse substances, even air itself, produced simi-
lar results, or if the chemical nature of the pole entered
at all into the question, it was as a disturbing agent.
It is a most essential part of the theory of gravitation
that the proximity of other attracting particles is wholly
without effect upon the attraction existing between any
two molecules. Two pound weights weigh as much to-
gether as they do separately. Every pair of molecules in
the world have, as it were, a private communication, apart
from their relations to all other molecules. Another un-
doubted result of experience pointed out by Newton 6 is
that the weight of a body does not in the least depend
