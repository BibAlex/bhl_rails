once obtained experimental data, there is no further
difficulty beyond that of arithmetic or algebraic calcu-
lation.
Gold is reduced by the gold-beater to leaves so thin,
that the most powerful microscope would not detect any
measurable thickness. If we laid several hundred leaves
upon each other to multiply the thickness, we should
still have no more than ^ th of an inch at the most to
measure, and the errors arising in the superposition and
measurement would be considerable. But we can readily
obtain an exact result through the connected amount of
weight. Faraday weighed 2000 leaves of gold, each
3-f inch square, and found them equal to 384 grains.
From the known specific gravity of gold, it was easy to
calculate that the average thickness of the leaves was
282 !ooo of an incn g -
We must ascribe to Newton the honour of leading the
way in methods of minute measurement. He did not
call waves of light by their right name, and did not
understand their nature ; yet he measured their length,
though it did not exceed the 2,ooo,oooth part of a metre
or the one fifty thousandth part of an inch. He pressed
together two lenses of very large but known radii. It
was not difficult to calculate the interval between the
lenses at any point, by measuring the distance from the
central point of contact. Now, with homogeneous rays the
successive rings of light and darkness mark the points at
which the interval between the lenses is equal to one
half, or any multiple of half a vibration of the light, so
that the length of the vibration became known. In a
similar manner many phenomena of interference of rays
of light admit of the measurement of the wave lengths.
The fringes of interference arise from rays of light which
cross each other at a small angle, and an excessively
