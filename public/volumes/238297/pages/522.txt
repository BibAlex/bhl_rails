of the magnet was cut off, and vice versd the light ap-
peared when the current was re-made. ' These pheno-
mena,' he says, * could be reversed at pleasure, and at any
instant of time, and upon any occasion, showing a perfect
dependence of cause and effect 11 /
Another elegant experiment by Faraday illustrates the
maintainance of similar conditions. He proved that
liquids may conduct electricity when solids will not, by
putting the poles of a battery in melted nitre, when a
strong current was shown to exist by the galvanometer.
But as soon as the nitre was allowed to solidify, the
current ceased. Everything else remaining the same, the
current existed when the nitre was liquid, and not when
the nitre was solid *.
It was Newton's omission to obtain the solar spectrum
under the simplest conditions which prevented him from
discovering the dark lines. Using a broad beam of light
which had passed through a round hole or a triangular
slit, he obtained a brilliant spectrum, but one in which
many different coloured rays overlapped each other. In
the recent history of the science of the spectrum, one
main difficulty has consisted in the mixture of the lines of
several different substances, which are usually to be found
in the light of any flame or spark. It is seldom possible
to obtain the light of any element in a perfectly simple
manner. Angstrom greatly advanced this branch of science
by examining the light of the electric spark when formed
between poles of various metals, and in the presence of
various gases. By varying the pole alone, or the gaseous
medium alone, he was able to discriminate correctly be-
tween the lines due to the metal and those due to the
surrounding gas k .
