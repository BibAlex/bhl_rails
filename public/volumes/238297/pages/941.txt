RESULTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD. 451
no precise explanation can yet be given ? In every such
fact there is a possible opening for new discoveries, and it
can only be the fault of the investigator's mind if he can
look around him and find no scope for the exercise of his
faculties.
The Infinite Incompleteness of the Mathematical
Sciences.
There is one privilege which a certain amount of know-
ledge should confer ; it is that of becoming aware of the
indefinite weakness of our powers compared with the tasks
which they might undertake if stronger. To the poor
savage who cannot count twenty, the arithmetical accom-
plishments of the ordinary schoolboy are miraculously
great in comparison. The schoolboy cannot comprehend
the almost infinitely greater powers of the student, who
has acquired facility with algebraic processes. The student
can but look with feelings of surprise and reverence at
the powers of a Newton or Laplace. But the question at
once suggests itself, Do the powers of the highest human
intellect bear any moderate ratio to the things which are
to be understood and calculated \ How many further
steps must we take in the rise of mental ability and the
extension of mathematical method before we begin to
exhaust the knowable \
I am inclined to find fault with mathematical writers
because they often exult in what they can accomplish, but
omit to point out that what they do is but an indefinitely,
nay an infinitely, small part of what might be done. They
exhibit a general inclination, with few exceptions, not to
do so much as mention the existence of problems of an
impracticable character. This may be excusable so far as
the immediate practical result of their researches is in
question, but the custom has the effect of misleading the
