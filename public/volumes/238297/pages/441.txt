THE METHOD OF MEANS. 415
absolute coincidence, if it even occurs or seems to occur,
must be purely casual, and is no indication of precision. It
is one of the most embarrassing things we can meet when
experimental results agree too closely. Such coincidences
should raise our suspicion that the apparatus in use is in
some way restricted in its operation, so as not really to
give the true result at all a , or that the actual results have
not been faithfully recorded by the assistant in charge of
the apparatus.
If then we cannot get twice over exactly the same
result, the question arises, How can we ever attain the
truth or select the result which may be supposed to
approach most nearly to it 1 The quantity of a certain
phenomenon is expressed in seyeral numbers which diifer
from each other ; no more than one of them at the most
can be true, and it is more probable that they are aU
false. It may be suggested, perhaps, that the observer
should select the one observation which he judged to be
the best made, and there will often doubtless be a feeling
that one or more results were satisfactory, and the others
less trustworthy. This seems to have been the course
adopted ty some of the early astronomers. Flamsteed
when lie had made several observations of a star probably
chose in an arbitrary manner that which seemed to him
nearest to the truth b .
When Horrocks selects for his estimate of the sun's
semidiameter a mean between the results of Kepler and
Tycho he professes not to do it from any regard to the
idle adage, 'Medio tutissimus ibis,' but because he
thought it from his own observations to be correct c . But
this method will not apply at all when the observer has
