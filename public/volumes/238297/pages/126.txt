100 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
The mood Baroko gave much trouble to the old lo-
gicians who could not reduce it to the first figure in
the same manner as the other moods, and were obliged
to invent, specially for it and for Bokardo, a method of
Indirect Reduction closely analogous to the Indirect proof
of Euclid. Now these moods require no exceptional
processes in this system. Let us take as an instance of
Baroko, the argument
All heated solids give continuous spectra, (i)
Some nebulae do not give continuous spectra ; (2)
Therefore some nebulae are not heated solids. (3)
Treating the little word some as an indeterminate
adjective of selection, to which we assign a symbol like
any other adjective, let
A = some
B = nebulae
C = giving continuous spectra
D = heated solid.
The premises then become
D = DC (i)
AB = ABc. (2)
Now from (i) we obtain by the Indirect method the
Contrapositive
c = cd,
and if we substitute this expression for c in (2) we have
AB = ABcd;
the full meaning of which is that ' some nebulae do not
give continuous spectra and are not solids/
We might similarly apply the contrapositive in many
other instances. Take the argument 'All fixed stars
are self-luminous ; but some of the heavenly bodies are
not self-luminous, and are therefore not fixed stars.'
Taking our terms
A fixed stars
.^
B = self-luminous
