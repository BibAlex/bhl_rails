of certain similar events to the probability that there
must have been a condition or cause for such events. We
have found that the theory of probability, although never
yielding a certain result, often enables us to establish an
hypothesis beyond the reach of reasonable doubt. There
is, however, another method of applying the theory,
which possesses for us even greater interest, because it
illustrates, in the most complete manner, the theory of
inference adopted in this work, which theory indeed it
suggested. The problem to be solved is as follows :
An event having happened a certain number of times,
and failed a certain number of times, required the pro-
bability that it will happen any given number of times
in the future under the same circumstances.
All the larger planets hitherto discovered move in one
direction round the sun ; what is the probability that, if a
new planet exterior to Neptune be discovered, it will move
in the same direction ? All known permanent gases, ex-
cept chlorine, are colourless ; what is the probability that,
if some new permanent gas should be discovered, it will
be colourless \ In the general solution of this problem, we
wish to infer the future happening of any event from the
number of times that it has already been . observed to
happen. Now, it is very instructive to find that there is
no known process by which we can pass directly from the
data to the conclusion. It is always requisite to recede
from the data to the probability of some hypothesis, and
to make that hypothesis the ground of our inference
concerning future happenings. Mathematicians, in fact,
make every hypothesis which is applicable to the question
in hand ; they then calculate, by the inverse method, the
probability of every such hypothesis according to the
data, and the probability that if each hypothesis be true,
the required future event will happen. The total pro-
bability that the event will happen, is the sum of the
