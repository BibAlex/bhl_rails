CHARACTER OF THE EXPERIMENTALIST. 231
It is certainly the theory which leads him to the experi-
ments, and most of these could hardly be devised by
accident. The fertility with which he invents new combi-
nations, and foresees the results, subsequently verified,
produces an invincible conviction in the reader that he
has possession of the truth. Newton actually remarks
that it was by mathematically determining all kinds of
phenomena of colours which could be produced by refrac-
tion that he had ' invented ' almost all the experiments in
the book, and he promises that others who shall * argue
truly/ and try the experiments with care, will not be
disappointed in the results.
The philosophic method of Huyghens was almost ex-
actly the same as that of Newton, and Huyghens' investi-
gation of the laws of double refraction furnishes almost
equally beautiful instances of theory guiding experiment.
Double refraction was first discovered by accident, so far
as we know, and was described by Erasmus Bartholinus
in 1669. The phenomenon then appeared to be entirely ex-
ceptional, and the laws governing the two separate paths
of the refracted rays were so unapparent and complicated,
that even Newton altogether misunderstood the pheno-
menon, and it was only at the latter end of the last century
that scientific men generally began to comprehend its laws.
Nevertheless, Huyghens had, with rare genius, arrived
at the true theory as early as 1678. He regarded light
as an undulatory motion of some medium, and in his
* Traite de la Lumiere/ he pointed out that, in ordinary
refraction, the velocity of propagation of the wave is
equal in all directions, so that the front of an advancing
wave is spherical, and reaches equal distances in equal
times. But in crystals, as he supposed, the medium would
be of unequal elasticity in different directions, so that a dis-
turbance would reach unequal distances in equal times, and
the wave produced would have a spheroidal form. Huy-
