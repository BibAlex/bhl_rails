EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE, EXPLANATION, &c. 185
we might imagine a train of magnetic engines and electro-
magnetic machines, which should alternately convert the
same energy into motion and electricity. Similarly, by a
proper arrangement of bars of antimony and bismuth, the
same current of electricity might be converted into heat
and reconverted into electricity an indefinite number of
times. But, practically speaking, there would be an
enormous loss of energy at each conversion, so that the
ultimate effect would dwindle down to an inconsiderable
fraction of the original amount of energy.
Facts known only by Theory.
Of the four classes of facts enumerated in p f 1 5 7 the last
remains unconsidered. It includes the unverified pre-
dictions of science. Scientific prophecy arrests the atten-
tion of the world when it refers to such striking events
as an eclipse, the appearance of a great comet, or any
other phenomenon which every one can verify with his
own eyes. But it is surely a greater matter for wonder
that in many cases a physicist may describe and measure
phenomena which eye cannot see, nor sense of any kind
appreciate. In most cases this arises from the effect being
too small in amount to affect our organs of sense, or come
within the powers of our instruments as at present con-
structed. There is another class of yet more remarkable
cases, where a ^phenomenon cannot possibly be observed,
and yet we can say what it would be if it were observed.
In astronomy, systematic aberration is an effect of the
sun's proper motion almost certainly known to exist, but
which we have no hope of detecting by observation in the
present age of the world. As the earth's motion round
the sun combined with the motion of light causes the
stars to deviate apparently from their true positions to
the extent of about 1 8" at the most, so the motion of the
