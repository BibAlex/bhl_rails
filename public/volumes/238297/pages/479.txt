TEE LAW OF ERROR. 453
precision ; and whenever the neglecting of decimal frac-
tions, or even the slight alteration of a number will much
abbreviate the computations, it may be fearlessly done, ex-
cept in cases of high importance and precision. It has been
stated that the voyages of the Great Britain steamship to
Melbourne from Liverpool, up to May, 1871, have been
thirteen in number, with the following durations in days :
62, 63, 59, 60, 58, 61, 57, 57, 57, 57, 56, 63, 55. The
mean duration of the voyages is 58*85 days, which is the
most probable length of any similar future voyage ; but
to calculate the probable error, we may take the mean to
be 59 days. The sum of the squares of the errors is only
88, and the probable error thence calculated 0*49 day, or,
say half a day. It is as likely as not, then, that any par-
ticular voyage will be not less than 58^ days, nor more
than 59! days.
The experiments of Benzenberg to detect the revolution
of the earth, by the deviation of a ball from the exact
perpendicular line in falling down a deep pit, have been
cited by Encke as an interesting illustration of the Law
of Error. The mean deviation was 5*086 lines, and its
probable error was calculated by Encke to be not more
than "950 line, that is, the odds were even that the true
result lay between 4*136 and 6*036. As the deviation
should, according to astronomical theory be 4*6 lines,
which lies well within the limits, we may consider that
the experiments are consistent with the Copernican system
of the universe.
It will of course be understood that the probable error
has regard only to the differences of the results from
which the mean is drawn, and takes no account of con-
stant errors. The true result accordingly will often fall
far beyond the limits of probable error.
