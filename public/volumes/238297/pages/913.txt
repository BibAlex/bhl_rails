CLASSIFICATION. 423
The nature of a ray of homogeneous light is strictly
defined, either by its place in the spectrum or by the cor-
responding wave-length, but a ray of mixed light admits
of no simple classification ; any of the infinitely numerous
rays of the continuous spectrum may be present or absent,
or present in various intensities, so that we can only class
and define a mixed colour by defining the intensity and
wave-length of each ray of homogeneous light which is
present in it. Complete spectroscopic analysis and the
determination of the intensity of every part of the spec-
trum yielded by a mixed ray is requisite for its accurate
classification. Nearly the same may be said of complex
sounds. A simple sound undulation, if we could meet
with such a sound, would admit of precise and exhaustive
classification as regards pitch, the length of wave, or the
number of waves reaching the ear per second being a suf-
ficient criterion. But almost all ordinary sounds, even
those of musical instruments, consist of complex aggregates
of undulations of several different pitches, and in order to
classify the sound we should have to measure the inten-
sities of each of the constituent sounds, a work which has
been partially accomplished by Professor Helmholtz, as
regards the vowel sounds. The different tones of voice
distinctive of different individuals must also be due to the
intermixture of minute waves of various pitch, which are
at present quite beyond the range of experimental in-
vestigation. We cannot, then, at present, attempt to
classify the different kinds or timbres of sound.
The difficulties of classification re even greater when a
varying phenomenon cannot be shown to be a mixture of
simpler phenomena. If we attempt, for instance, to
classify the tastes of natural and artificial substances, we
may rudely group them according as they are sweet,
bitter, saline, alkaline, acid, astringent, or fiery ; but it is
evident that these groups are bounded by no sharp lines
