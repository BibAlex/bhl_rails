THE LOGICAL ABACUS.
121
italic representing a negative term, the pin is fixed in
the lower part of the space. Now, if one of the series of
combinations be ranged upon a ledge of the black-board,
the sharp edge of a flat rule can be inserted beneath the
pins belonging to any one letter say A, so that all the
combinations marked A can be lifted out and placed upon
a separate ledge. Thus we have represented the act of
thought which separates the class A from what is not- A.
The operation can be repeated; out , of the A's we can in
like manner select those which are B, obtaining the AB's ;
and in like manner we might select any other class such
as the aB's, the ab's or the abc's.
If now we take the series of eight combinations of the
letters A, B, C, a, 6, c 9 and wish to analyse the argument
anciently called Barbara, having the premises
A = AB (i)
B = BC, (2)
we proceed as follows : Firstly we raise the combinations
marked a, leaving the A's behind ; out of these A's we
move to a lower ledge such as are not-B's, and to the
remaining AB's we join the a's which have -been raised.
The result is that we have divided all the combinations
into two classes, namely, the Ab's which are incapable of
existing consistently with premise (i), and the combina-
tions which are consistent with the premise. Turning
now to the second premise, we raise out of those which
agree with (i) the 6's, then we lower the Bc's ; lastly we
join the &'s to the BC's. We should now find our com-
binations arranged as below.
