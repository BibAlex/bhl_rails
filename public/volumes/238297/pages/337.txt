THE INDUCTIVE OR INVERSE METHOD. 311
form an hypothesis as to the logical conditions under
which the given instances might occur ; we calculate
inversely the probability of that hypothesis, and com-
pounding this with the probability that a new instance
would proceed from the same conditions, we gain the
absolute probability of occurrence of the new instance in
virtue of this hypothesis. But as several, or many, or
even an infinite number of mutually inconsistent hypo-
theses may be possible, we must repeat the calculation for
each such conceivable hypothesis, and then the complete
probability of the future instance will be the sum of the
separate probabilities. The complication of this process
is often very much reduced in practice, owing to the fact
that one hypothesis may be nearly certainly true, and
other hypotheses, though conceivable, may be so im-
probable as to be neglected without appreciable error.
But when we possess no knowledge whatever of the con-
ditions from which the events proceed, we may be unable
to form any probable hypotheses as to their mode of
origin. We have now to fall back upon the general
solution of the problem effected by Laplace, which consists
in admitting on an equal footing every conceivable ratio
of favourable and unfavourable chances for the production
of the event, and then accepting the aggregate result as
the best which can be obtained. This solution is only to
be accepted in the absence of all better means, but like
other results of the calculus of probabilities, it comes
to our aid where knowledge is at an end and ignorance
begins, and it prevents us from over-estimating the know-
ledge we possess. The general results of the solution are
in accordance with common sense, namely, that the more
often an event has happened the more probable, as a
general rule, is its subsequent occurrence. With the
extension of experience this probability indefinitely in-
creases, but at the same time the probability is slight
