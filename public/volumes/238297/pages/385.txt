UNITS AND STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT. 359
lately no mode of defining a length, bu<fc by selecting some
physical object exhibiting that length between certain
obvious points as, for instance, the extremities of a bar,
or marks made upon its surface.
Standard Unit of Time.
Time is the great independent variable of all change,
that which itself flows on uninterruptedly, and brings the
variety which we call life and motion. When we reflect
upon its intimate nature, Time, like every other element of
existence, proves to be an inscrutable mystery. We can
only say with St. Augustin, to one who asks us what is
time, ' I know when you do not ask me/ The mind of
man will ask what can never be answered, but one result
of a true and rigorous logical philosophy must be to
convince us, that scientific explanation can only take place
between phenomena which have something in common,
and that when we get down to primary notions, like those
of time and space, the mind must meet a point of mystery
beyond which it cannot penetrate. A definition of time
must not be looked for ; if we say with Hobbes c , that it
is 'the phantasm of before and after in motion,' or with
Aristotle that it is 'the number of motion according to
former and latter ; ' we obviously gain nothing, because
the notion of time is involved in the expressions before
and after, former and latter. Time is undoubtedly one
of those primary notions which can only be defined physi-
cally, or by observation of phenomena which proceed in
time.
If we have not advanced a step beyond A.ugustin's acute
reflections on this subject d , it is curious to observe the
