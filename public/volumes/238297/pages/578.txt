THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
medium, the dispersion of mixed light by the prism and
the production of the spectrum could not take place.
Some of the most striking phenomena were thus in direct
conflict with the theory. The great French mathema-
tician, Cauchy, first pointed out the true explanation,
namely that all previous investigators had made an
arbitrary assumption for the sake of simplifying the
calculations. They had assumed that the particles of
the vibrating medium are so close together that the
intervals are quite inconsiderable compared with the
length of the wave, or in other terms infinitely small.
This hypothesis happened to be approximately true in the
case of air, so that no error was discovered in experiments
on sound. Had it not been so, the earlier analysts would
probably have failed to give any solution, and the pro-
gress of the subject might have been retarded. Cauchy
was able to make a new approximation to truth under
the more difficult supposition, that the particles of the
vibrating medium are situated at considerable distances,
and act and react upon the neighbouring particles by
attractive and repulsive forces. To calculate the rate of
propagation of a disturbance in such a medium is a work
of excessive difficulty. The complete solution of the
problem appears indeed to be beyond human power, so
that we must be content, as in the case of the planetary
motions, to look forward to successive approximations.
All that Cauchy could do was to show that certain mathe-
matical terms or quantities, neglected in previous theories,
became of considerable amount under the new conditions
of the problem, so that there will exist a relation between
the length of the wave, and the velocity at which it
travels. To remove, then, the difficulties in the way of
the undulatory theory of light, a new approach to pro-
bable conditions was needed?.
