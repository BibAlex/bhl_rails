DEDUCTIVE REASONING. 67
The above is a syllogism in the mood called Barbara f
in the truly barbarous language of ancient logicians ; and
the first figure of the syllogism alone contained three other
moods which were esteemed distinct forms of argument.
But it is worthy of notice that without any real change
in our form of inference we readily include these three
other moods under it. The negative mood Celarent will
be represented by the example
Neptune is a planet (i)
No planet has retrograde motion, (2)
hence Neptune has not retrograde motion. (3)
If we put A for Neptune, B for planet,and C for * having
retrograde motion/ then by the corresponding negative
term c, we denote ' riot having retrograde motion.' The
premises now fall into the form
A = AB (i)
B = Be, (2)
and by substitution for B, exactly as before, we obtain
A = ABc. (3)
What is called in the old logic a particular conclusion
may be deduced without any real variation in the sym-
bols. Particular quantity is indicated, as before mentioned
(p. 49), by joining to the term an indefinite adjective of
quantity, such as some, a part, certain, &c., meaning that
an unknown part of the term enters into the proposition
as subject. Considerable doubt and ambiguity arise out
of the question whether the part may not in some cases
be the whole, and in the syllogism at least it must be
understood in this sense . Now if we take a letter to
represent this indefinite part, we need make no change in
f An explanation of this and other technical terms of the old logic
will be found in my 'Elementary Lessons in Logic,' Second Ed. 1871.
