THE LAW OF ERROR. 435
It is perfectly recognised by mathematicians that in
each special case a special Law of Error may apply, and
should be discovered and adopted if possible. ('Nothing
can be more unlikely than that the errors committed in all
classes of observations should follow the same law a / and
the special Laws of Error which will apply to certain in-
struments, as for instance the repeating circle, have been
investigated by M. Bravais b . He concludes that every
partial and distinct cause of error gives rise to a curve of
possibility of errors, which may have any form whatever,
a curve which we may either be able or unable to discover,
and which in the first case may be determined by con-
siderations a priori, on the peculiar nature of this cause,
or which may be determined a posteriori by observation. '
Whenever it is practicable and worth the labour, we ought
to investigate these special conditions of error ; never-
theless, when there are a great number of different sources
of minute error, the general resultant will always tend to
obey that general law which we are about to consider.
Establishment of the Law of Error.
Mathematicians agree far better as to the nature of the
ultimate Law of Error than they do as to the manner in
which it can be deduced and proved. They agree that
among a number of discrepant results of observation, that
mean quantity is probably the most nearly approximate
to the truth which makes the sum of the squares of the
errors as small as possible. But there are at least three
different ways in which this principle has been arrived at
respectively by Gauss, by Laplace, by Quetelet and by
Sir John Herschel. Gauss proceeds much upon assump-
