RESULTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD. 453
and their satellites. A compound atom may perhaps be
compared with a stellar system, each star a minor system
in itself. The smallest particle of solid substance will
consist of a vast number of such stellar systems united
in regular order, each bounded by the other, communi-
cating with it in some manner yet wholly imcomprehen-
sible. Now what are our mathematical powers in com-
parison with this problem \
After two centuries of continuous labour, the most
gifted men have succeeded in calculating the mutual
effects of three bodies each upon the other, under the
simple hypothesis of the law of gravity. Concerning
these calculations we must further remember that they
are purely approximate, and that the methods would not
apply where four or more bodies are acting, and all pro-
duce considerable effects each upon the other. There is
every reason to believe that each constituent of a chemical
atom must go through an orbit in the millionth part of
the twinkling of an eye, in which it successively or simul-
taneously is under the influence of many other consti-
tuents, or possibly comes into collision with them. It is,
I apprehend, no exaggeration to say that mathematicians
have scarcely a notion of the way in which they could
successfully attack so difficult a problem of forces and
motions. Each of these particles is for ever solving dif-
ferential equations, which, if written out in fuU, might
perhaps belt the earth, as Sir J. Herschel has beautifully
remarked 111 .
Some of the most extensive calculations ever made, were
those required for the reduction of the measurements
executed in the course of the Trigonometrical Survey of
Great Britain. Xhe calculations arising out of the prin-
cipal triangulation alone occupied twenty calculators
during three or four years, in the course of which the
