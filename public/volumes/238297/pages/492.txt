THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
vertebra ; Malus unintentionally examined with a double
refracting substance light reflected from distant windows ;
and Sir John Herschel's attention was drawn to the
peculiar appearance of a solution of quinine sulphate. In
earlier times there must have been some one who first
noticed the strange behaviour of a loadstone, or the un-
accountable motions produced by amber. As a general
rule we shall riot know in what direction to look for a
great body of phenomena widely different from those
familiar to us. Chance then must give us the starting
point ; but one accidental observation welHlsed may lead
us to make thousands of observations in an intentional and
organized manner, and thus a science may be gradually
worked out from the smallest opening.
Distinction of Observation and Experiment.
It is -usual to say that the two modes of experience are
Observation and Experiment. When we merely note and
record the phenomena which occur around ns in the
ordinary course of nature we are said to observe. When
we change the course of nature by the intervention of our
will and muscular powers, and thus produce unusual com-
binations and conditions of phenomena, we are said to
experiment. Sir John Herschel has justly remarked b that
we might properly call these two modes of experience
passive and active observation. In both cases we must
certainly employ our senses to observe, and an experiment
differs from a mere observation in the fact that we more
or less influence the character of the events which we
observe. Experiment is thus observation plus alteration
of conditions.
It may readily be seen that we pass upwards by in-
sensible gradations from pure observation to determinate
