THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
distinct impression ; the powers of association bring forth
the record when the like is felt again. By the higher
faculties of judgment and reasoning the mind compares
the new with the old, recognises essential identity, even
when disguised by diverse circumstances, and expects to
find again what was before experienced. It must be the
ground of all reasoning and inference that what is true
of one thing will be true of its equivalent, and that under
carefully ascertained conditions Nature repeats herself.
Were this indeed a Chaotic Universe, the powers of
mind employed in science would be useless to us. Did
Chance wholly take the place of order, and did all phe-
nomena come out, not of one same Infinite Lottery, to
use Condorcet's expression, but out of lotteries ever
changing in their conditions, there could be no reason to
expect the like result in like circumstances. It is possible
to conceive a world in which no two things should be
associated more often, in the long run, than any other
two things. The frequent conjunction of any two events
would then be purely fortuitous, and if we expected
conjunctions to recur continually we should be disap-
pointed. In such a world we might recognise the same
phenomenon as it appeared from time to time, just as we
might recognise a marked ball as it was occasionally
drawn from a ballot-box ; but the approach of any one
phenomenon would be in no way indicated by what had
gone before, nor would it be at all a sign of what was to
come after. In such a world knowledge would be no
more than the memory of past coincidences, and the
reasoning powers, if they existed at all, would give no
clue to the nature of the present, and no presage of the
future.
Happily the Universe in which we dwell is not the
result of chance, and where chance seems to work it is
our own deficient faculties which prevent us from recog-
