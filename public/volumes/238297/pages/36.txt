10 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Identity and Difference, and occupy himself in developing
the variety of forms of reasoning in which their truth may
be manifested.
Again, I need hardly dwell upon the question whether
logic treats of language, notions, or things. As reasonably
might we debate whether a mathematician treats of
symbols, quantities, or things. A mathematician certainly
does treat of symbols, but only as the instruments
whereby to facilitate his reasoning concerning quantities ;
and as the axioms and rules of mathematical science must
be verified in concrete objects in order that the calcu-
lations founded upon them may have any validity or
utility, it follows that the ultimate objects of mathe-
matical science are the things themselves. In like man-
ner I conceive that the logician treats of language so far
as it is essential for the embodiment and exhibition of
thought. Even if reasoning can take place in the inner
consciousness of man without the use of any signs, at
any rate it cannot become the subject of discussion until
by some system of material signs it is manifested to other
persons. The logician then uses words and symbols as
instruments of reasoning, and leaves the nature and pe-
culiarities of existing language to the grammarian. But
signs again must correspond to the thoughts and things
expressed, in order that they shall serve their intended
purpose. We may therefore say that logic treats ulti-
mately of thoughts and things, and immediately of the
signs which stand for them. Signs, thoughts and ex-
terior objects may be regarded as parallel and analogous
series of phenomena, and to treat one series is equivalent
to treating either of the other series h .
