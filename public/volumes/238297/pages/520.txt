30 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
upon its form or texture. It may be added that the
temperature, electric condition, pressure, state of motion,
chemical qualities, and all other circumstances concerning
matter, except its mass, are indifferent as regards its gra-
vitating power.
As natural science progresses, physicists gain a kind of
insight and tact in judging what qualities of a substance
are likely to be concerned in any class of phenomena. The
physical astronomer treats matter in one point of view,
the chemist in another, and the students of physical optics,
sound, mechanics, electricity, &c., make a fair division of
the qualities among them. But errors will arise if too
much confidence be placed in this independence of various
kinds of phenomena, so that it is desirable from time to
time, especially when any unexplained discrepancies come
into notice, to question the indifference which is assumed
to exist, and to test its real existence by appropriate
experiments.
Simplification of Experiments.
One of the most requisite precautions in experimentation
is to vary only one circumstance at a time, and to main-
tain all other circumstances rigidly unchanged. There are
two distinct reasons for this rule, the first and most ob-
vious being that if we vary two conditions at a time, and
find some effect, we cannot tell whether the effect is due
to one or the other, or to both jointly. A second reason
is that if no effect ensues we cannot safely conclude that
either of them is indifferent ; for the one may have neu-
tralized the effect of the other. In our logical formula,
A (B -I- &) is identical with A (see vol. i. p. 112), and B may
be indifferently present or absent ; but A (BC -|- be) is not
identical with A, and none of our logical processes enabled
us to make the reduction.
