274 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
tainty enters, because we cannot be sure that the stones of
the Magdeburg church resemble other stones in all their
properties.
In like manner, not one of the inductive truths which
men have established, or think they have established, is
really safe from exception or reversal. Lavoisier, when
laying the foundations of chemistry, met with so many
instances tending to show the existence of oxygen in
all acids, that he adopted a general conclusion to that
effect, and devised the name oxygen accordingly. He
entertained no appreciable doubt that the acid existing
in sea salt also contained oxygen a ; yet subsequent ex-
perience falsified his expectations.
This instance refers to a science in its infancy, speaking
relatively to the possible achievements of men. But all
sciences are and wiU ever remain in their infancy, relatively
to the extent and complexity of the universe which they
undertake to investigate. Euler expresses no more than
the truth when he says that it would be impossible to fix
on any one thing really existing, of which we could have
so perfect a knowledge as to put us beyond the reach of
mistake k.
Like remarks may be made concerning all other in-
ductive inferences. We may be quite certain that a comet
will go on moving in a similar path if all circumstances
remain the same as before ; but if we leave out this exten-
sive qualification, our predictions will always be subject
to the chance of falsification by some wholly unexpected
event, such as the division of Biela's comet, or the un-
foreseen interference of some planetary or other gravitating
body.
Inductive inference might attain to certainty if our
