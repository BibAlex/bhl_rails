304 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIEXCE.
accelerate the motion of bodies passing through it, some-
what in the mode which Aristotelians attributed falsely
to the air. Thus we can frame the notion of negative
density, and Newton could reason exactly concerning it,
although no such thing exists 3.
In every direction of thought we may meet ultimately
with similar failures of analogy. A moving point gene-
rates a line, a moving line generates a surface, a moving
surface generates a solid, but what does a moving solid
generate ? When we compare a polyhedron, or many-
sided solid, with a polygon, or plane figure of many sides,
the volume of the first is analogous to the area o> the
second ; the face of the solid answers to the side of the
polygon ; the edge of the solid to ,the point of the figure ;
but the corner, or junction of edges in the polyhedron,
is left wholly unrepresented in the plane of the polygon.
Even if we attempted to draw the analogies in some
other manner, we should stih 1 find a geometrical notion
embodied in the solid which has no representative in the
plain figure r .
Faraday was able to frame some notion of matter in a
fourth condition, which should be to gas what gas is to
liquid 8 . Such substance, he thought, would not fall far
short of radiant matter, by which apparently he meant
the supposed caloric or matter assumed to constitute heat,
according to the Corpuscular Theory. Even if we could
frame the notion, matter in such a state cannot be known
to exist, and recent discoveries concerning the continuity
of the solid, liquid, and gaseous states remove the basis
of the speculation.
