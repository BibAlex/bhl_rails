PRINCIPLES OF NUMBER. 191
' For every man in the house there is a person who is
aged ; some of the men are not aged. It follows that
some persons in the house are not men8'/
Now let A = person in house,
B = male,
C = aged.
By enclosing logical symbols in brackets, let us denote
the number of objects belonging to the class indicated by
the symbol. Thus let
(A) = number of persons in house,
(AB) number of male persons in house,
(ABC) = number of aged male persons in house,
and so on. Now if we use w and w f to denote unknown
and indefinite numbers, the conditions of the problem may
be thus stated according to my interpretation of the
words
(AB) = (AC) - w, (i)
that is to say, the number of persons in the house who are
aged is at least equal to, and may exceed, the number of
male persons in the house ;
(ABc) = w', (2)
that is to say, the number of male persons in the house
who are not aged is some unknown positive quantity.
If we develop the terms in (i) by the Law of Duality
(pp. 87, 95, 97), we obtain
(ABC) + (ABc) = (ABC) + (A6C) - w.
Subtracting the common term (ABC) from each side and
substituting for (ABc) its value as given in (2), we get at
once
(AbC) - w + w f ,
and adding (Abe) to each side, we have
(Ab) = Abe + w -f uf.
The meaning of this result is that the number of persons
in the house who are not men is at least equal to w + w',
