CLASSIFICATION. 34?
metals, and have been selected by the ballot. But when
chemists carefully selected from the list the five metals,
Potassium, Sodium, Ca3sium, Eubidium, and Lithium,
and called them the Alkaline metals, a great deal was
implied in this classification. On comparing the qualities
of these substances, they are all found to combine very
energetically with oxygen, to decompose water at all
temperatures, and to form strongly basic oxides, which
are very soluble in water, yielding powerfully caustic and
alkaline hydrates from which water cannot be expelled
by heat. Their carbonates are also soluble in water, and
each metal forms only one chloride. It may also be ex-
pected as a general rule that each salt into which one of
the five metals enters will correspond to salts into which
the other metals enter, there being a general analogy
between the properties and compounds of these metals.
Now in forming this class of alkaline metals, we have
done more than merely select a convenient order of
statement. We have arrived at a discovery of certain
empirical laws of nature, the probability being very con-
siderable that a metal which exhibits some of these pro-
perties will also possess the others. If we discovered
another metal whose carbonate was soluble in water,
and which energetically combined with water at all tem-
peratures, producing a strongly basic oxide, we should
infer that it would form only a single chloride, and
that, generally speaking, it would enter into a series of
compounds corresponding to the salts of the other
alkaline metals. The formation of this class of alkaline
metals, then, is no mere matter of convenience ; it is an
important and highly successful act of inductive dis-
covery, enabling us to register many undoubted propo-
sitions as results of perfect induction, and to make an
almost indefinite series of inferences depending upon the
principles of imperfect induction.
