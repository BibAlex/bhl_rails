INDUCTION. 157
accounting for the tenth case ; and if we change B into b
the identity A. = b accounts for the seventh case. There
may indeed be two other varieties of the simple identity,
namely a = b and a = B ; but it has already been shown
repeatedly that these are equivalent respectively to A = B
and A = b (pp. 133, 134). As the sixteenth column has
already been accounted for as governed by no special
conditions, we come to the following general conclusion :
The laws governing the combinations of two terms must
be capable of expression either in a partial identity
(A AB), or a simple identity (A = B) ; the partial
identity is capable of only four logically distinct varieties,
and the simple identity of two. Every logical relation
between two terms must be expressed in one of these
six laws, or must be logically equivalent to one of them.
In short, we may conclude that in treating of partial
and complete identity, we have exhaustively treated the
modes in which two terms or classes of objects can be
related. Of any two classes it may be said that one must
either be included in the other, or must be identical with
it, or some similar relation must exist between one class
and the negative of the other. We have thus completely
solved the inverse logical problem concerning two terms d .
The Inverse Logical Problem involving Three Terms.
No sooner do we introduce into the problem a third
term C, than the investigation assumes a far more com-
plex character, so that some readers may prefer to pass
over this section. Three terms and their negatives may be
combined, as we have frequently seen, in eight different
