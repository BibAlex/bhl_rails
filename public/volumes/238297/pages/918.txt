428 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
when the tender mechanism of the brain will be traced
out, and every thought reduced to the expenditure of a
determinate weight of nitrogen and phosphorus. No
apparent limit exists to the success of scientific method
in weighing and measuring, and reducing beneath the
sway of law, the phenomena both of matter and of mind.
And if mental phenomena be thus capable of treatment by
the balance and the micrometer, can we any longer hold
that mind is distinct from master 1 Must not the same
inexorable reign of law, which is apparent in the motions
of brute matter, be" extended to the most subtle feelings
of the human heart ? Are not plants and animals and
ultimately man himself, merely crystals, as it were, of a
complicated form ? If so, our boasted Free Will becomes
a delusion, Moral Eesponsibility a fiction, Spirit a mere
name for the more curious manifestations of material
energy. All that happens, whether right or wrong, plea-
surable or painful, is but the outcome of the necessary
relations of time and space and force, and of the laws of
matter emerging from them, which are fixed in the very
nature of things.
Materialism seems, then, to be the coming religion, and
resignation to the nonenity of human will the only duty.
Such may not generally be the reflections of men of
science, but I believe that we may thus describe the
secret feelings of fear which the constant advance of
scientific investigation excites in the minds of many who
view it from a distance. Is science, then, essentially
atheistic and materialistic in its tendency \ Does the
uniform action of material causes, which we learn with
an ever increasing approach to certainty, preclude the
hypothesis of an intelligent and benevolent Creator, who
has not only designed the existing universe, but who
still retains the power to alter its course from time
to time ?
