Rules for finding the probable error of a mean result :
1 . Draw the mean of all the observed results.
2. Find the excess or defect, that is, the error of each
result from the mean.
3. Square each of these reputed errors.
4. Add together all these squares of the errors.
5. Take the square root of this sum.
6. Divide the square root by the number of results.
7. Multiply the quotient by 0*67449 - (or approxi-
mately by 0*674, or even 0*67), a natural constant
number derived from the Law of Error in a manner
which is described in mathematical works upon the
subject.
Suppose, for instance, that five measurements of the
height of a hill, by the barometer or otherwise, have given
the numbers of feet as 293, 301, 306, 307, 313 ; we want
to know the probable error of the mean, namely 304. Now
the differences between this mean and the above numbers,
paying no regard to direction, are n, 3, 2, 3, 9; their
squares are 121, 9, 4, 9, 81, and the sum of the squares
consequently 224. Taking the square root of this sum by
the common arithmetic process, or by logarithms, we ob-
tain 14-966, and dividing by five, the number of observa-
tions, we have 2*99, which has only to be multiplied by
'67 to yield us 2*019. This number is so close to 2, that
we may call the probable error equal to two. Thus the
probability is one-half, or the odds are even, that the true
height of the mountain lies between 302 and 306 feet.
We have thus an exact measure of the degree of credibility
of our mean result, which mean indicates the most likely
point for the truth to fall upon.
The reader should observe that as the object in these
calculations is only to gain a notion of the degree of con-
fidence with which we view the mean, there is no real
use in carrying the calculations to any great degree of
