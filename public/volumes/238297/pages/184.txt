combinations, and the effect of laws or logical conditions
is to destroy any one or more of these combinations.
Now we may make selections from eight things in 2 8 or
256 ways ; so that we have no less than 256 different cases
to treat, and the complete solution is at least fifty times
as troublesome as with two terms. Many series of com-
binations, indeed, are contradictory, as in the simpler
problem, and may be passed over. The test of consistency
is that each of the letters A, B, C, a, b, c shall appear
somewhere in the series of combinations ; but I have
not been able to discover any mode of calculating the
number of cases in which inconsistency would happen.
The logical complexity of the problem is so great that
the ordinary modes of calculating numbers of combinations
in mathematical science fail to give any aid, and ex-
haustive examination of the combinations in detail is
the only method applicable.
My mode of solving the problem was as follows :
Having written out the whole of the 256 series of com-
binations, I examined them separately and struck out
such as did not fulfil the test of consistency. I then chose
some common form of proposition involving two or three
terms, and varied it in every possible manner, both by
the circular interchange of letters (A, B, C into B, C, A
and then C, A, B), and by the substitution for any one or
more of the terms of the corresponding negative terms.
For instance, the proposition AB = ABC can be first varied
by circular interchange, so as to give BC = BCA and then
CA = CAB. Each of these three can then be thrown
into eight varieties by negative change. Thus AB = ABO
gives aB = aBC, A& = A6C, AB = ABc, ab = a&C, and so on.
Thus there may possibly exist no less than twenty-four
varieties of the law having the general form AB = ABC,
meaning that whatever has the properties of A and B has
those also of C. It by 110 means follows that some of the
