be a closed one, or whether it has infinite branches ;
whether such branches are asymptotic, that is, approach
indefinitely towards straight lines ; whether it is loga-
rithmic in character, oj; trigonometric. This indeed we
can only do if we remember the results of previous in-
vestigations. The process is still inversely deductive, and/
consists in noting what laws gave particular curves, and
then inferring inversely that such curves belong to such
laws. If we can in this way discover the class of func-
tions to which the required law belongs, our chances of
complete success are much increased, because our hap-
hazard trials are now reduced within a narrower sphere.
But, unless we have almost the whole curve before us, the
identification of its character must be a matter of great
uncertainty ; and if, as in most physical investigations,
we have a mere fragment of the curve, the assistance
given would be quite illusory. Curves of almost any
character can be made to approximate to each other for a
limited extent, so that it is only by a kind of divination
that we can fall upon the actual function, unless we have
theoretical knowledge of the kind of function applicable
to the case.
When we have once obtained what we believe to be the
correct form of function, the remainder of the work is
mere mathematical computation to be performed infallibly
according to fixed rules*, which include those employed
in the determination of empirical formulas (vol. ii. p. no).
The function will involve two or three or more unknown
constants, the values of which we need to determine by
our experimental results. Selecting some of our results
widely apart and nearly equidistant, we must form by
means of them, as many equations as there are constant
quantities to be determined. The solution of these equa-
tions will then give us the constants required, and having
