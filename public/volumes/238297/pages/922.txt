432 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
passed away, and in this fact we have some illustra-
tion, as Laplace remarks, of the power which scientific
prescience may attain. Doubtless, too, all efforts in the
investigation of nature tend to bring us nearer to the
possession of that ideally perfect power of intelligence.
Nevertheless, as Laplace with profound wisdom adds a , we
must ever remain at an infinite distance from the goal of
our aspirations.
Let us assume, for a time at least, as a highly probable
hypothesis, that whatever is to happen must be the out-
come of what is ; there then arises the question, What is ?
Now our knowledge of what exists must ever remain im-
perfect and fallible in two respects. Firstly, we do not
know all the matter that has been created, nor the exact
manner in which it has been distributed through space.
Secondly, assuming that we had that knowledge, we
should still be wanting in a perfect knowledge of the
way in which the particles of matter will act upon each
other. The power of scientific prediction extends at the
most to the limits of the data employed. Every con-
clusion is purely hypothetical and conditional upon the
non-interference of agencies previously undetected. The
law of gravity asserts that every body tends to approach
towards every other body, with a certain determinate
force, but even supposing the law to hold true, it does
not assert that the body will approach. No single law
nor science can warrant us in making any one absolute
prediction. We must know all the laws of nature and all
the existing agents acting according to those laws before we
can say what will occur. To assume, then, that scientific
method can take everything within its cold embrace of
uniformity, is to imply that the Creator cannot outstrip
the intelligence of his creatures, and that the existing
