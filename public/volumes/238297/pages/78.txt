52 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
The universe, in short, within which they habitually dis-
course, is that of equations with real coefficients. These
implied limitations form part of that great mass of tacit
knowledge which accompanies all special arguments.
It is worthy of inquiry whether almost all identities
are not really limited to an implied sphere of meaning.
When we make such a plain statement as ' Gold is mal-
leable ' we obviously speak of gold only in its solid state ;
when we say that ' Mercury is a liquid metal ' we must
be understood to exclude the frozen condition to which it
may be reduced in the Arctic regions. Even when we
take such a fundamental law of nature as ' All substances
gravitate/ we must mean by substance, material sub-
stance, not including that basis of heat, light and electrical
undulations which occupies space and possesses many
mechanical properties, but not gravity. The proposition
then is really of the form
Material substance = Material gravitating substance.
To De Morgan is due the remark, that we do usually
think and argue in a limited universe or sphere of notions
even when it is not expressly stated f .
Negative Propositions.
In every act of intellect, as we have seen, we are en-
gaged with a certain degree of identity or difference
between certain things or sensations compared together.
Hitherto I have treated only of identities ; and yet
it might seem that the relation of difference must be
infinitely more common than that of likeness. One
thing may resemble a great many other things, but
then it differs from all remaining things in the world.
Difference or diversity may almost be said to constitute
life, being to thought what motion is to a river. The
