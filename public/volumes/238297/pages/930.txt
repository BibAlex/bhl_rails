440 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
The Ambiguous Expression. Uniformity of Nature.
I have asserted that a serious misconception arises from
an ambiguous interpretation of the expression Uniformity
of Nature. (Every law of nature is the statement of a
certain uniformity observed to exist among phenomena^)
and since the laws of nature are supposed to be invariably
obeyed it seems to follow that the course of nature itself
is uniform,(so that we can safely judge of the future by
the present^ This inference is supported by some of the
most profound results of physical astronomy. Laplace
proved that the planetary system was stable, so that
no one of the perturbations which planet produces upon
planet shall become so great as to cause a disruption, and
a permanent alteration in the planetary orbits. A full
comprehension of the law of gravity shows that all such
disturbances are essentially periodic, so that after the lapse
of millions of years the planets will all return to the
same relative positions and a new cycle of disturbances will
commence.
As other branches of inquiry progress, we seem to gain
assurance that no great alteration of the world's condition
is to be expected. A conflict with a comet has long been
a cause of fear to some persons, but now it is credibly
asserted that we have passed through a comet's tail with-
out the fact being known at the time, or manifested by
any more serious a phenomenon than a slight luminosity
of the heavens. More recently still the earth is said to
have actually touched the comet Biela, and the only result
was a beautiful and perfectly harmless display of radi-
ating meteors. A decrease in the heating power of the
sun seems to be the next most probable circumstance
from which we might fear an extinction of life on the
earth. But calculations founded on reasonable physical
