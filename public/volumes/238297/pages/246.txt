220 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
sentences, and a library is a combination of books. A
library, therefore, is a combination of the fifth order, and
the powers of numerical expression would be almost
exhausted in attempting to express the number of dis-
tinct libraries which might be constructed. The calcu-
lation would not be possible, because the union of letters
in words, of words in sentences, and of sentences in books,
are governed by conditions so complex as to defy calcu-
lation. I wish only to point out that there is no limit
to the multitude of different sentences which may be de-
veloped out of the one difference of ink and paper. Galileo
is said to have remarked that all truth is contained in
the compass of the alphabet. We might add that it is all
contained in the difference of ink and paper.
One consequence of this power of successive combi-
nation is that the simplest signals or marks will suffice
to express any information. Francis Bacon proposed
for secret writing a biliteral cipher, which resolves all
letters .of the alphabet into permutations of the two
letters a and b. Thus A was aaaaa, B aaaab,
X baba.b, and so on. s And in a similar way, as Bacon
clearly saw, any one difference can be made the ground
of a code of signals ; we can express, as he says,
omnia per omnia. The Morse alphabet uses only a
succession of long arid short marks, and other systems
of telegraphic language employ right and left strokes.
A single lamp obscured at various intervals, long or
short, may be made to spell out any words, and with
two lamps, distinguished by colour or position, we could
at once represent Bacon's biliteral alphabet. Mr. Bab-
bage ingeniously suggested that every lighthouse in
the world should be made to spell out its own name
or number perpetually, by flashes or obscurations of
