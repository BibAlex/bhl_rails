ANALYSIS OF QUANTITATIVE PHENOMENA. Ill
tion is differently conducted, but the principle is the
same ; the telescope is fixed to the circle, which moves
with it, and the angle through which it moves is read
off at three, six, or more points, disposed of at equal
intervals round the circle. The older astronomers, down
even to the time of Flamsteed, were accustomed to use
portions only of a divided circle, generally quadrants, and
Homer made a vast improvement when he introduced
the complete circle.
The transit circle, employed to determine the meridian
passage of heavenly bodies, is so constructed that the
telescope and the axis bearing it, in fact the whole moving
part of the instrument, can be taken out of the bearing
sockets and turned over, so that what was formerly the
western pivot becomes the eastern one, and vice versd.
It is impossible that the instrument could have been
so perfectly constructed, mounted, and adjusted that the
telescope should point exactly to the meridian, but the
effect of the reversal is that it will point as much to
the west in one position as it does to the east in the
other, and the mean result of observations in the two
positions must be free from such cause of error.
The accuracy with which the inclination of the compass
needle can be determined depends almost entirely on the
method of reversal. The dip needle consists of a bar
of magnetized steel, suspended like the beam of a delicate
balance on a slender axis passing through the centre of
gravity of the bar, so that it is at liberty to rest in that
exact degree of inclination in the magnetic meridian
which the magnetism of the earth induces. The in-
clination is read off upon a vertical divided circle, but
to avoid any error in the centring of the needle and
circle, both ends are read, and the mean of the results
is taken. The whole instrument is now turned carefully
round through 180, which gives two new readings, in
