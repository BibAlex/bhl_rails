COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS. 203
the extraordinary magnitude of the numbers with which
we deal in this subject. Tacquet calculated d that the
twenty-four letters of the alphabet may be arranged in
more than 620 thousand trillions of orders ; and Schottus
estimated e that if a thousand millions of men were em-
ployed for the same number of years in writing out these
arrangements, and each man filled each day forty pages
with forty arrangements in each, they could not have ac-
complished the task, as they would have written only 584
thousand trillions instead of 620 thousand trillions.
In some questions the number of permutations may be
restricted and reduced by various conditions. Some
things in a group may be undistinguishable from others,
so that change of order will produce no difference. Thus
if we were to permutate the letters of the name Ann,
according to our previous rule, we should obtain 3x2x1,
or 6 orders ; but half of these arrangements would be
identical with the other half, because the interchange of
the two ris has no effect. The really different orders will
therefore be ~~p or 3, namely Ann, Nan, Nna. In
the word utility there are two i's and two t's, in respect
of both of which pairs the number of permutations must
be halved. Thus we obtain ' 5 ' 4 ' 3 ' 2 ' * or 1260, as

the number of permutations. The simple rule evidently
is that when some things or letters are undistinguished,
proceed in the first place to calculate all the possible
permutations as if all were different, and then divide by
the number of possible permutations of those series of
things which are not distinguished, and of which the
permutations have therefore been counted in excess.
Thus since the word Utilitarianism contains fourteen
