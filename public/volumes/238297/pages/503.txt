oils. It has been pointed out that the peculiar character
of some extinct floras may be due to the unequal preser-
vation of different families of plants. By various acci-
dents, however, we may gain glimpses of a world that
is usually lost to us as by insects embedded in amber,
the great mammoth preserved in ice, mummies, casts in
solid material like that of the Roman soldier at Pompeii,
and so forth.
We should also remember, that just as there may be
conjunctions of the heavenly bodies that can have hap-
pened only once or twice in the period of history, so re-
markable terrestrial conjunctions may take place. Great
storms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslips, floods,
irruptions of the sea may, or rather must, have occurred,
events of such unusual magnitude and such extreme rarity
that we can neither expect to witness them nor readily
to comprehend their effects. It is a great advantage of
the study of probabilities, as Laplace himself remarked, to
make us mistrust the extent of our knowledge, and pay
proper regard to the probability that events would come
within the sphere of our observations.
Apparent' Sequence of Events.
De Morgan has excellently pointed out 1 that there
are no less than four modes in which one event may
seem to follow or be connected with another, without
being really so. These involve mental, sensual, and ex-
ternal causes of error, and I will briefly state and illustrate
them.
Instead of A causing B, it may be our perception of A
that causes B. Thus it is that prophecies, presentiments,
