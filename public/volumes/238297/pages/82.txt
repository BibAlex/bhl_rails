56 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
chloride. If the number of windows in Salisbury
Cathedral equals the number of days in the year, the
number of days in the year must equal the number of
the windows. Lord Chesterfield was not wrong when
he said, 'I will give anybody their choice of these two
truths, which amount to the same thing ; He who loves
himself best is the honestest man ; or, The honestest man
loves himself best % ! Scotus Erigena exactly expresses this
reciprocal character of identity in saying, ' There are not
two studies, one of philosophy and the other of religion ;
true philosophy is true religion, and true religion is true
philosophy/
A mathematician would not think it worth mention
that if x y then also y~x. He would not consider
these to be two equations at all, but one same equation
accidentally written in two different manners. In written
symbols one of two names must come first, and the other
second, and a like succession must perhaps be observed in
our thoughts : but in the relation of identity there is no
need for succession in order ; each is simultaneously equal
and identical to the other. These remarks will hold true
equally of logical and mathematical identity; so that I
shall consider the two forms
A = B and B = A
to express exactly the same identity differently written.
All need for rules of conversion disappears, and there
will be no single proposition in the system which may
not be written with either term foremost. Thus A = AB
is the same as AB = A, AB = AC as AC = AB, and so on.
The same remarks are partially true of differences or
inequalities, which are also reciprocal to the extent that
one thing cannot differ from a second without the second
differing from the first. Mars differs in colour from
