308 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
dictory fact from many, wliich, however singular and
inexplicable at first sight, may afterwards be shown to be
results of wholly different causes, or possibly the most
striking results of the very law with which they stand in
apparent conflict.
I can enumerate at least eight different classes or kinds
of exceptional phenomena, to one or other of which any
supposed exception to the known laws of nature will
ultimately be referred ; they may be briefly described as
below, and will be sufficiently illustrated in the succeeding
sections.
(1) Imaginary, or false exceptions, that is, facts, ob-
jects, or events which are not really what they are sup-
posed to be.
(2) Apparent, but congruent exceptions, which, though
apparently in conflict with a law of nature, are really in
agreement with it.
(3) Singular exceptions, which really agree with a law
of nature, but exhibit remarkable and unique results of it.
(4) Divergent exceptions, wliich really proceed from the
ordinary action of known processes of nature, but which
are excessive in amount or monstrous in character.
(5) Accidental exceptions, arising from the interference
of some entirely distinct but known law of nature.
(6) Novel and unexplained exceptions, which lead to
the discovery of a new series of laws and phenomena,
modifying or disguising the effects of previously known
laws, without being inconsistent with them.
(7) Limiting exceptions, showing the falsity of a sup-
posed law in cases to which it had been extended, but not
affecting its truth in other cases.
(8) Contradictory or real exceptions which lead us to
the conclusion that a supposed hypothesis or theory is in
opposition to the phenomena of nature, and must therefore
be abandoned.
