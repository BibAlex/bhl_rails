CLASSIFICATION. 381
Bentham indeed long ago stated P. We may always put
an arbitrary limit to the subdivisions of our classification
at any point convenient to our purpose. The crystallo-
grapher would not generally consider as different species
of crystalline form those which differ only in the degree of
development of the faces. The naturalist overlooks innu-
merable slight differences between plants or animals which
he refers to the same species. But in a strictly logical
point of view classification might be carried on so long as
there is a single point of difference, however minute,
between two objects, and we might thus go on until we
arrived at individual objects which are numerically distinct
in the logical sense attributed to that expression in the
chapter upon Number. We must either, then, call the
individual the infima species or allow that there is no
such species at all.

The bifurcate method of classification, arising as it does
from the primary laws of thought, is the very founda-
tion of all strict scientific method, and its application in
formal logic constitutes the method of Indirect Inference,
of which the nature and importance were shown in Chap-
ter VI. So slight, however, has been the attention paid
to this all important subject, that I shall in this case
break the rule which I have laid down for myself, not to
mingle the subject of logic as a science with the history
of logic.
Both Plato and Aristotle were fully acquainted with
the value of bifurcate division which they occasionally
employed in an explicit manner. It is impossible, too,
