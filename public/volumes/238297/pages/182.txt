156 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
We therefore restrict our attention to those cases which
may be represented in natural phenomena where at least
two combinations are present, and which correspond to
those columns of the table in which each of A, a, B, b
appears. These cases are shown in the columns marked
with an asterisk.
We find that seven cases remain for examination, thus
characterised
Four cases exhibiting three combinations,
Two cases exhibiting two combinations,
One case exhibiting four combinations.
It has already been pointed out that a proposition of the
form A = AB destroys one combination Ah, so that this
is the form of law applying to the twelfth case. But
by changing one or more of the terms in A = AB into
its negative, or by interchanging A and B, a and b, we
obtain no less than eight different varieties of the one form ;
thus
1 2th case. 8th case. i5th case. i4th case.
A = AB A = A6 a = aE a = ab
b = ab B = aB b = A.b B = AB.
But the reader of the preceding sections will at once
see that each proposition in the lower line is logically equi-
valent to, and is in fact the contrapositive of, that above
it (p. 98). Thus the propositions A = A& and B = aB
both give the same combinations, shown in the eighth
column of the table, and trial shows that the twelfth,
eighth, fifteenth and fourteenth cases are thus fully ac-
counted for. We come to this conclusion then The
general form of proposition A = AB admits of four
logically distinct varieties, each capable of expression in
two different modes.
In two columns of the table, namely the seventh and
tenth, we observe that two combinations are missing. Now
a simple identity A = B renders impossible both A.b and aB,
