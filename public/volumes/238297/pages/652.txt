162 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
planation, although they have been studied for two cen-
turies or more. I shall subsequently point out that even
the establishment of a wide and true law of nature is but
the starting-point for the discovery of exceptions or slight
divergences giving a wide scope to empirical discovery.
There is probably no science, I have said, which is
entirely free from empirical and unexplained facts. Logic
approaches most nearly to this position, as it is merely
a deductive development of the laws of thought and the
principles of substitution. Yet some of the facts esta-
blished in the investigation of the inverse logical problem
(vol. i. p. 157) may be considered empirical. Mathematical
science often yields empirical truths. Why, for instance,
should the value of TT, when expressed to a great number
of figures, contain the digit 7 much less frequently than
any other digits ? Even geometry may allow of empirical
truths, when the matter does not involve quantities of
space, but numerical results and the positive or negative
character of quantities, as in De Morgan's theorem con-
cerning negative areas.
Accidental Discovery.
There are not a few cases where almost pure accident
has undoubtedly determined the moment when a new
branch of knowledge was to be created. The true laws
of the construction of crystals were not discovered until
Hauy happened to drop a beautiful crystal of calc-spar
upon a stone pavement. His momentary regret, at de-
stroying a choice specimen 4 , was quickly removed when,
in attempting to join the fragments together, he observed
regular geometrical faces, which did not correspond with
the external facets of the crystals. A great many more
crystals were soon broken intentionally, to observe the
s De Morgan's 'Budget of Paradoxes/ p. 291.
