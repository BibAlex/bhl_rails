361 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
It is just possible that in the course of time, some other
body may be found to furnish a better standard of time
than the earth in its annual motion. The greatly superior
mass of Jupiter and its satellites, and their greater
distance from the sun, may render the electrical dissipa-
tion of energy less considerable even than in the case of
the earth. But the choice of the best measure will always
be an open one, and whatever moving body we assume,
may ultimately be shown to be subject to disturbing
forces.
The pendulum, although so admirable an instrument
for subdivision of time, entirely fails as a standard ; for
though the same pendulum affected by the same force of
gravity would perform equal vibrations in equal times,
yet the slightest change in the form or weight of the
pendulum, the slightest corrosion of any part, or the most
minute displacement of the point of suspension, would
falsify the results, and there enter many other diffi-
cult questions of temperature, resistance, length of vibra-
tion, &c.
Thomson and Tait are of opinion k that the ultimate
standard of chronometry must be founded on the physical
properties of some body of more constant character than
the earth ; for instance, a carefully arranged metallic
spring, hermetically sealed in an exhausted glass vessel.
Although their suggestion is no doubt theoretically cor-
rect, it is hard to see how we can be sure that the dimen-
sions and elasticity of a piece of wrought metal will
remain perfectly unchanged for the few millions of years
contemplated by them. A nearly perfect gas, like hydrogen,
is perhaps the only kind of substance in the unchanged
elasticity of which we could have confidence. Moreover,
it is difficult to perceive how the undulations of such a
