REFLECTIONS ON THE RESULTS AND LIMITS OF
SCIENTIFIC METHOD.
BEFORE concluding a work on the Principles of Science,
it will not be inappropriate to add some remarks upon
the limits and ultimate bearings of the knowledge which
we may acquire by the constant employment of scientific
method. All science consists, it has several times been/
stated, in the detection of identities and uniformities in
the action of natural agents. The purpose of inductive
inquiry is to ascertain the apparent existence of necessary
connexion between causes and effects, the establishment
of natural laws. ' Now so far as we thus learn the in-
