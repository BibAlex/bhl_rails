GENERALIZE TION. 267
and assert that, under adequate pressure, every liquid
might be made to pass into a gas without any breach of
continuity*.
The liquid state, again, is considered by Professor
Andrews to be but an intermediate step between the
solid and gaseous conditions. There are various indica-
tions that the process of melting is not perfectly abrupt ;
and could the experiments be made under adequate
pressures, it is believed that every solid could be made
to pass by insensible degrees into the state of liquid, and
subsequently into that of gas.
These discoveries appear to open the way to most im-
portant and fundamental generalizations, but it is probable
that in many other cases phenomena now regarded as dis-
crete may be shown to be different degrees of the same
process. The late Professor Graham was of opinion that
chemical affinity differed but in degree from the ordinary-
attraction which holds different particles of a body together.
He found that sulphuric acid continued to evolve heat
when mixed even with the fiftieth equivalent of water
that is added to it, so that there seemed to be no distinct
limit to chemical affinity. He concludes * There is reason
to believe that chemical affinity passes in its lowest degree
into the attraction of aggregation'".
The atomic theory is well established, but its limits are
not marked out. As Mr. Justice Grove suggests, we may
by selecting sufficiently high multipliers express any com-
bination or mixture whatever of elements in terms of their
equivalent weights x . Sir W. Thompson has suggested
that the power which vegetable fibre, oatmeal, and many
other substances possess of attracting and condensing
aqueous vapour is probably continuous, or, in fact, iden-
