228 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
eulogise the theory is as needless as to eulogise reason
itself.
Fundamental Principles of the Theory.
The calculation of probabilities is really founded, as
I conceive, upon the principle of reasoning set forth in
preceding chapters. We must treat equals equally, and '
what we know of one case may be affirmed of every
other case resembling it in the necessary circumstances 7"
The theory consists in putting similar cases upon a par,
and distributing equally among them whatever know-j
ledge we may possess. Throw a penny into the air, and
consider what we know with regard to its mode of falling.
We know that it will certainly fall upon a flat side, so
that either the head or tail will be uppermost, but as
to whether it will be head or tail, our knowledge is
equally divided. Whatever we know concerning head,
we know as much concerning tail, so that we have no
reason for expecting one more than the other. The least
predominance of belief to either side would be irrational,
as it would consist in treating unequally things of which
our knowledge is equal.
The theory does not in the least require, as some
writers have erroneously supposed, that we should first
ascertain by experiment the equal facility of the events
we are considering. So far as we can examine and
measure the causes in operation, events are removed
out of the sphere of probability. The theory comes in
play where ignorance begins, and the knowledge we
possess requires to be distributed over many cases
Nor does the theory show that the coin will fall as
often on one side as the other. It is almost impossible
that this should happen, because some inequality in the
form of the coin, or some uniform manner in throwing
it up, is almost sure to occasion a slight preponderance
