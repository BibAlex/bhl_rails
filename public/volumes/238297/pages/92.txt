66 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIEXCE.
the propositions are of the form
A = AB
K = c;
whence, by substitution,
A - Ac.
Inference of a Partial from Two Partial Identities.
However common be the cases of inference already
noticed, there is a form occurring almost more frequently,
and which deserves much attention because it occupied a
prominent place in the ancient syllogistic system. That
system strangely overlooked all the kinds of argument we
have as yet considered, and selected as the type of all
reasoning one which employs two partial identities as
premises. Thus from the propositions
Sodium is a metal (i)
Metals conduct electricity, (2)
we may conclude that
Sodium conducts electricity. (3)
Taking A, B, C, respectively to represent the three terms,
the premises are of the form
A = AB (i)
B = BC. (2)
Now for B in (i) we can substitute its description as
given in (2), obtaining
A = ABC, (3)
or, in words, from
Sodium = sodium metal (i)
Metal = metal conducting electricity, (2)
we infer
Sodium = sodium metal conducting electricity, (3)
which in the elliptical language of common life becomes
' Sodium conducts electricity.'
