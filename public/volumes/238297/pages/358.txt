a moving slip of paper, so that equal intervals of time are
represented by equal lengths. There is, perhaps, a ten-
dency to reduce all comparisons to the comparison of space
magnitudes, but in any case one of the senses must be the
ultimate judge of coincidence or non-coincidence.
Since the equation to be established may exist between
any multiples or submultiples of the quantities compared,
there naturally arise several different modes of comparison
adapted to different cases. Let p be the magnitude to
be measured, and q that in terms of which it is to be
expressed. Then we wish to find such numbers x and ?/,
that the equation p = -q may be true. Now this same
j
equation may be presented in four slightly different forms,
namely :
First Form. Second Form. Third Form. Fourth Form.
x y P q
p=- y * fl~i py-i* I'l
Each of these modes of expressing the same equation cor-
responds to one mode of effecting a measurement.
When the standard quantity is greater than that to be
measured, we often adopt the first mode, and subdivide
the unit until we get a magnitude equal to that measured.
The angles observed in surveying, in astronomy, or in
goniometry are usually smaller than a whole revolution,
and the measuring circle is divided by the use of the
microscope and screw, until we obtain an angle undistin-
guishable from that observed. The dimensions of minute
objects are determined by subdividing the inch or centi-
metre, the screw micrometer being the most accurate
means of subdivision. Ordinary temperatures are esti-
mated by division of the standard interval between the
freezing and boiling points of water, as marked on a
thermometer tube.
In a still greater number of cases, perhaps, we multiply
