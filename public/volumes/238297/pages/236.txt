contain the trianguli-pyramidal, the pyramidi-pyramidal
numbers, and so on. k
3. From the mode of formation of the table, it follows
that the differences of the numbers in each column will
be found in the preceding column to the left. Hence
the second differences, or the differences of differences will
be in the second column to the left of any given column,
the third differences in the third column, and so on.
Thus we may say that unity which appears in the first
column is the first difference of the numbers in the
second column ; the second difference of those in the third
column ; the third difference of those in the fourth,
and so on. The triangle is thus seen to be a complete
classification of all numbers according as they have unity
for any of their differences.
4. Every number in the table is equal to the sum of
the numbers which stand higher in the next column to
the left, beginning with the next line above ; thus 84 is
equal to the sum of 28, 21, 15, 10, 6, 3, i.
5. Since each line is formed by adding the previous
line to itself, it is evident that the sum of the numbers
in each horizontal line must be double that of the line
next above. Hence we know, without making any ad-
ditions, that the successive sums must be i, 2, 4, 8, 16,
32, 64, &c., the same as the numbers of combinations in
the Logical Abecedarium. Speaking generally, the sum
of the numbers in the nth line will be 2 n ~ 1 .
6. If the whole of the numbers down to any line be
added together, we shall obtain a number less by unity
than some power of 2 ; thus, the first line gives i or
2 1 i ; the first two lines give 3 or 2 2 i ; the first three
lines 7 or 2 3 i ; the first six lines give 63 or 2 6 i ;
or, speaking in general language, the sum of the first
n lines is 2 n i.
