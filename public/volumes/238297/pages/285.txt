PHILOSOPHY OF INDUCTIVE INFERENCE. 259
seem to be always present, and with more or less pro-
bability we conclude that when they exist the event will
follow.
Let it be observed that the utmost latitude is at present
enjoyed in the use of the term cause. Not only may a
cause be an existent thing endowed with powers, as
oxygen is the cause of combustion, gunpowder the cause
of explosion, but the very absence or removal of a thing
may also be a cause. It is quite correct to speak of the
dryness of the Egyptian atmosphere, or the absence of
moisture, as being the cause of the preservation of
mummies, and other remains of antiquity. The cause oj
a mountain elevation, Ingleborough for instance, is the
excavation of the surrounding valleys by denudation. It
is not so usual to speak of the existence of a thing at one
moment as the cause of its existence at the next, but to
me it seems the commonest case of causation which can
occur. The cause of motion of a billiard ball may be the
stroke of another ball ; and recent philosophy leads us to
look upon all motions and changes, as but so many mani-
festations of prior existing energy. In all probability
there is no creation of energy and no destruction, so that as
regards both mechanical and molecular changes, the cause
is really the manifestation of existing energy. In the
same way I see not why the prior existence of matter is
not also a cause as regards its subsequent existence. All
science tends to show us that the existence of the universe
in a particular state at one moment, is the condition of its
existence at the next moment, in an apparently different
state. When we analyse the meaning which we can
attribute to the word cause, it amounts to the existence of
suitable portions of matter endowed with suitable quan-
tities of energy. If we may accept Home Tooke's asser-
tion, cause has etymologically the meaning of thing before.
Though, indeed, the origin of the word is very obscure, its/
