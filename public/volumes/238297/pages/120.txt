instance. A very common process of reasoning consists in
the determination of the name of a thing by the successive
exclusion of alternatives, a process called by the old name
abscissio infiniti. Take the case :
Red-coloured metal is either copper or gold (i)
Copper is dissolved by nitric acid (2)
This specimen is red-coloured metal (3)
This specimen is not dissolved by nitric acid (4)
Therefore this specimen consists of gold. (5)
Assigning our letter-symbols thus
A = this specimen
B = red-coloured metal
C = copper
D = gold
E = dissolved by nitric acid,
the premises may be stated in the form
B = BCrf + BcD (i)
C = CE (2)
A = AB (3)
A = Ae. (4)
Substituting for C in (i) by means of (2) we get
B = BCdE | BcD.
From (3) and (4) we may infer likewise
A = ABe,
and if in this we substitute for B its equivalent just
stated, it follows that
A = ABCdEe -I ABcDe.
The first of the alternatives being contradictory, the result
is A = ABcDe
which contains a full description of ' this specimen/ as
furnished in the premises, but by ellipsis indicates that
it is gold. It will be observed that in the symbolic
expression (i) I have explicitly stated what is certainly
implied, that copper is not gold, and gold not copper,
without which condition the inference would not hold good.
