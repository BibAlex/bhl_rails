THE INDUCTIVE OR INVERSE METHOD. 303
pretends to give, is the result in the long run, as it is
called, and this really means in an infinity of cases.
During any finite experience, however long, chances may
be against us. Nevertheless the theory is the best guide
we can have. If we always think and act according to
its well interpreted indications, we shall have the best
chance of escaping error ; and if all persons, throughout
all time to come, obey the theory in like manner, they
will undoubtedly thereby reap the greatest advantage.
No rule can be given for discriminating between
coincidences which are casual and those which are the
effect of law or common conditions. By "a fortuitous or
casual coincidence, we mean an agreement between events,
which nevertheless arise from wholly independent and
different causes or conditions, and which w^ill not always
so agree. It is a fortuitous coincidence, if a penny thrown
up repeatedly in various ways always falls on the same
side ; but it would not be fortuitous if there were any
similarity in the motions of the hand, and the height of
the throw, so as to cause or tend to cause a uniform
result. Now among the infinitely numerous events, ob-
jects, or relations in the universe, it is quite likely that
we shall occasionally notice casual coincidences. There
are seven intervals in the octave, and there is nothing very
improbable in the colours of the spectrum happening to
be apparently divisible into the same or similar series of
seven intervals. It is hardly yet decided whether this
apparent coincidence, with which Newton was much
struck, is w^ell founded or not *, but the question will
probably be decided in the negative.
It is certainly a casual coincidence which the ancients
noticed between the seven vowels, the seven strings of the
lyre, the seven Pleiades, and the seven chiefs at Thebes*.
