104 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
likewise informs us that metal is element, and applying
this description to (/3) we again have self-contradiction,
so that there remains only (a) as a description of iron
our inference is
Iron = iron, metal, element.
To represent this process of reasoning in general
symbols, let
A = iron
B = metal
C = element.
The premises of the problem take the form
A = AB (i)
B - BC. (2)
By the Law of Duality we have
A = AB -I- A6 (3)
A = AC ! Ac. (4)
Now, if we insert for A in the second side of (3) its
description in (4), we obtain what I shall call the
development of A
A = ABO | ABc -I- A6C -I- Abe. (5)
Wherever the letters A or B appear in the second side
of (5) substitute their equivalents given in (i) and (2) and
the results at full length are
A = ABC -I- ABCc l- AB&C | AB&Cc.
The last three alternatives break the Law of Contradic-
tion, so that
A = ABC -I- o -I- o -I- o
A = ABC.
This conclusion is, indeed, no more than we could obtain by
the direct process of substitution ; it is the characteristic
of the Indirect process that it gives all possible logical
conclusions, both those which we have previously obtained,
and an almost infinite number of others of which the
ancient logic took little or no account. From the same
premises, for instance, we can obtain a description of the
