100 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
may even be doubtful whether he could treat it in any other
manner. Nevertheless there is no error in the final results,
because having obtained the formulae flowing from this
supposition, each straight line is then regarded as be-
coming infinitely small, and the polygonal line becomes
^indistinguishable from a perfect curve z .
In abstract mathematical theorems the approximation
to absolute truth is perfect, because we can treat of in-
finitesimals. In physical science, on the contrary, we treat
of the least quantities which are perceptible. Neverthe-
less, while carefully distinguishing between these two dif-
ferent cases, we may fearlessly apply to both the principle
of the superposition of small motions or effects. In
physical science we have only to take care that the effects
really are so small that any joint effect will be unquestion-
ably imperceptible. Suppose, for instance, that there is
some cause which alters the dimensions of a body in the
ratio of i to i + a, and another cause which produces an
alteration in the ratio of i to i + ft. If they both act at
once the change will be in the ratio of i to (i + a) (i -f ft),
or as i to i + a + ft + aft. But if a and ft be both very
small fractions of the total dimensions, aft will be yet far
smaller and may be disregarded ; the ratio of change is
then approximately that of i to i+a+ft, or the joint
effect is the sum of the separate effects. Thus if a body
were subjected to three strains at right angles to each
other, the total change in the volume of the body would
be approximately equal to the sum of the changes pro-
duced by the separate strains, provided that these are of
very small amount. In like manner not only is the ex-
pansion of every solid and liquid substance by heat
approximately proportional to the change of temperature,
when this change is very small in amount, but the cubic
