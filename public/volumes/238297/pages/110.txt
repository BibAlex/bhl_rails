dispute. In the ordinary use of these conjunctions we do
riot necessarily join distinct terms only ; and when terms
so joined do prove to be logically distinct, it is by virtue
of a tacit premise, something in the meaning of the names
and our knowledge of them, which teaches us they are
distinct. And when our knowledge of the meanings of the
words joined is defective it will often be impossible to
decide whether terms joined by conjunctions are exclusive
or not.
Take, for instance, the proposition 'A peer is either
a duke, or a marquis, or an earl, or a viscount, or a baron/
If expressed in Professor Boole's symbols, it would be
implied that a peer cannot be at once a duke and marquis,
or marquis and earl. Yet many peers do possess two or

Earl of Dublin, and Baron Renfrew. If it were enacted by
parliament that no peer should have more than one title,
this would be the tacit premise which Professor Boole
assumes to exist. Nor is the restriction true of more
common terms.
In the sentence * Repentance is not a single act, but a
habit or virtue/ it cannot be implied that a virtue is not a
habit ; by Aristotle's definition it is.
Milton has the expression in one of his sonnets,
' Unstained by gold or fee/ where it is obvious that if
the fee is not always gold, the gold is meant to be a fee
or bribe.
Tennyson has the expression 'wreath or anadem/ Most
readers would be quite uncertain whether a wreath may
be an anadem, or an anadem a wreath, or whether they
are quite distinct or quite the same.
From Darwin's ' Origin/ I take the expression, ' When
