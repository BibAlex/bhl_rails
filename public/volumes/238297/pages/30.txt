THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
yet we detect there the same elements of which our
own limbs are composed. The same natural laws can be
detected in operation in every part of the universe within
the scope of our instruments ; and doubtless these laws are
obeyed irrespective of distance, time and circumstance.
It is the prerogative of Intellect to discover what is
uniform and unchanging in the phenomena around us.
So far as object is different from object, knowledge is
useless and inference impossible. But so far as object
resembles object, we can pass from one to the other. In
proportion as resemblance is deeper and more general, the
commanding powers of knowledge become more wonder-
ful. Identity in one or other of its phases is thus always
'the bridge by which we pass in inference from case to
case ; and it is my purpose in this treatise to trace out the
various forms in which the one same process of reasoning
presents itself in the ever-growing achievements of
Scientific Method.
The Poiuers of Mind concerned in the Creation of
Science.
It is no part of the purpose of this work to investigate
the nature of mind, except so far as its powers are
requisite to the formation of Science. In this place I
need only point out that the mental powers engaged in
knowledge are probably three in number. They are
substantially as Mr. Bain has stated them a :
1 . The Power of Discrimination.
2. The Power of Detecting Identity.
3. The Power of Eetention.
We exert the first power in every act of perception.
Hardly can we have a sensation or feeling unless we
discriminate it from something else which preceded.
