from what it was in others. It is only in contact with
metallic surfaces or sharply broken edges that the tem-
perature is at all fixed at 212 Fahr. The suspended
freezing of liquids is another case where the action of
a law of nature appears to be interrupted. Spheroidal
ebullition seemed at first sight a most anomalous phe-
nomenon ; it was almost incredible that water should not
boil in a red-hot vessel, or that ice could actually be
produced in a red-hot crucible. These paradoxical results
are now fully explained as due to the interposition of a
non-conducting film of vapour between the globule of
liquid and the sides of the vessel. The feats of con-
jurors who handle liquid metals are readily accounted
for in the same manner. At one time the passive state
of steel was regarded as entirely anomalous. It may
be assumed as a general law that when two pieces re-
spectively oi electro-negative and electro-positive metal
are placed in nitric acid, and made to touch each other,
the electro-negative metal will undergo rapid solution.
But when iron is the electro-negative and platinum the
electro-positive, the solution of the iron entirely and
abruptly ceases. Faraday ingeniously proved that this
effect was due to a thin film of oxide of iron, which forms
upon the surface of the iron and protects it k .
The law of gravity is of so simple and general a cha-
racter, and is apparently so disconnected from the other
laws of nature, that it never suffers any disturbance, and
is in no way disguised, but by the complication of its own
effects. It is otherwise, however, with those entirely
secondary laws of the planetary system, which have only
an empirical basis. The fact that all the long known
planets and satellites have a similar motion from west to
east is not necessitated by any principles of science, but
points merely to some common condition existing in the
