THE INDUCTIVE OR INVERSE METHOD. 281
happening. He further supposes that each box, as is
possible, contains the same total number of balls, black
and white ; and then, mixing all the contents of the boxes
together, he shows that if a white ball be drawn from the
aggregate ballot-box thus formed, the probability that it
proceeded from any particular ballot-box is represented
by the number of white balls in that particular box,
divided by that total number of white balls in all the
boxes. This result corresponds to that given by the
principle in question c .
Thus, if there be three boxes, each containing ten balls
in all, and respectively containing seven, four, and three
white balls, then on mixing all the balls together we have
fourteen white ones ; and if we draw a white ball, that is
if the event happens, the probability that it came out of
the first box is T 7 T ; which is exactly equal to 15 _,the

fraction given by the rule of the Inverse Method.
Simple Applications of the Inverse Method.
In many cases of scientific induction we may apply the
principle of the inverse method in a simple manner. If
only two, or at the most a few hypotheses, may be made
as to the origin of certain phenomena, or the connection of
one phenomenon with another, we may sometimes easily
calculate the respective probabilities of these hypotheses.
It was thus that Professors Bunsen and Kirchhoff esta-
blished, with a probability little short of certainty, that
iron exists in the sun. On comparing the spectra of sun-
light and of the light proceeding from the incandescent
vapour of iron, it became apparent that at least sixty
bright lines in the spectrum of iron coincided with dark
