METHOD OF VARIATIONS. 55
Maintenance of Similar Conditions.
Our ultimate object in induction must be to obtain the
complete relation between the conditions and the effeci,
but this relation will generally be so complex that we can
only attack it in detail. We must, as far as possible, con
fine the variation to one condition at a time, and establish
a separate relation between each condition and the effect.
This will be at any rate the first step in approximating to
the complete law, and it will be a subsequent question
how far the simultaneous variation of several conditions
modifies their separate actions. In many of the most im-
portant experiments, indeed, it is only one condition which
we wish to study, and the others are merely interfering
forces which we would gladly avoid if possible. One of
the conditions of the motion of a pendulum is the resist-
ance of the air, or other medium in which it swings ; but
when Newton was desirous of proving the equal gravita-
tion of all substances, he had no interest in so entirely
different a force as the effect of the air. His object was
then to observe a single force only, and so it is in a great
many other experiments. Accordingly one of the most
important methods of investigation consists in maintaining
all the conditions of like magnitude except that which is
to be studied. As that admirable experimental philosopher,
Gilbert, expressed it f , * There is always need of similar
preparation, of similar figure, and of equal magnitude, for
in dissimilar and unequal circumstances the experiment is
doubtful/
In Newton's decisive experiment similar conditions were
provided for, with the usual simplicity which characterizes
the highest art. The pendulums of which the oscillations
were compared consisted of exactly equal boxes of wood,
hanging by equal threads, and filled with different sub-
