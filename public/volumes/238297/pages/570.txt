80 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
that there is any inexactness in the laws of nature. We
may even discover a law which we believe to represent
the action of forces with perfect exactness. The mind
may seem to pass in advance of its data, and choose out
certain numerical results as absolutely true. We can
never really pass beyond our data, and so far as assump-
tion enters in, so far want of certainty will attach to our
conclusions ; nevertheless we may in many cases rightly
prefer a probable assumption of a precise law to numerical
results, which are at the best only approximative. We
must accordingly draw a strong distinction between the
laws of nature which we believe to be accurately stated in
our formulas, and those to which our statements only
make an approximation, so that at a future time the law
will be differently stated.
The law of gravitation is expressed in the form
F=-ppr, meaning that gravity is proportional directly to
the product of the gravitating masses, and indirectly to the
square of their distance. The latent heat of steam, again,
is expressed by the equation log F = a + W + eft
in which are five quantities a, 6, c, a, /?, to be deter-
mined by experiment. Now there is every reason, to
believe that in the progress of science the law of gravity
will remain entirely unaltered, and the only effect of
further inquiry will be to render it a more and more
probable expression of the absolute truth. The law of
the latent heat of steam, on the other hand, will be
modified by every new series of experiments, and it may
not improbably be shown that the assumed law can never
be made to agree with the results of experiment.
Philosophers have by no means always supposed that
the law of gravity was exactly true. Xewton, though he
had the highest confidence in its truth, admitted that
there were motions in the planetary system which he
