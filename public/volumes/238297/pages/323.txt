THE INDUCTIVE OR INVERSE METHOD. 297
opening for the doubt which Boole has cast upon it b .
But it may be replied, (i) that the supposition of an infinite
number of balls treated in the manner of Laplace is less
arbitrary and more comprehensive than any other that
could be suggested. (2) The result does not differ much
from that which would be obtained on the hypothesis of
any very ]arge finite number of balls. (3) The supposition
leads to a series of simple formulae which can be applied
with ease in many cases, and which bear all the appearance
of truth so far as it can be independently judged by a
sound and practiced understanding.
Rules of the Inverse Method.
By the solution of the problem, as described in the last
section, we obtain the following series of simple rules.
1. To find the probability that an event which has not
hitherto ~been observed to fail will happen once more,
divide the number of times the event has been observed
increased by one, by the same number increased by two.
If there have been m occasions on which a certain event
might have been observed to happen, and it has happened
on all those occasions, then the probability that it will
happen on the next occasion of the same kind is ^il
m+2'
For instance, we may say that there are nine places in
the planetary system where planets might exist obeying
Bode's law of distance, and in every place there is a
planet obeying the law more or less exactly, although
no reason is known for the coincidence. Hence the pro-
bability that the next planet beyond Neptune will
conform to the law is ~.
2. To find the probability that an event which has not
hitherto failed will not fail for a certain number of new
occasions, divide the number of times the event has hap-
