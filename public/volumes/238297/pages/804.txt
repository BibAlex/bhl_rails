the difference of absolute and relative gravity, as if it
were a new discovery proceeding from his theory 6 . More
than a century elapsed before other apparent exceptions
to the Newtonian philosophy were explained away.
Newton himself allowed that the motion of the apsides
of the moon's orbit appeared irreconcilable with the law
of gravity, and it remained for Clairaut to remove the
reproach by more complete mathematical analysis. There
must always indeed remain, in the motions of the tides
or of the heavenly bodies, discrepancies of some amount
between theory and observation; but like discrepancies
have so often yielded in past times to prolonged investi-
gation that all physicists have come to regard them as
merely apparent exceptions, which will afterwards be found
to be new confirmations of the law with which they now
seem to conflict.
The most beautiful instance, perhaps, which can be
adduced of an apparent exception, is found in the total
reflection of light, which occurs when a beam of light
within a medium falls very obliquely upon the boundary
separating it from a rarer medium. It is the general
law that when a ray strikes the limit between two media
of different refractive indices, part of the light is reflected
and part is refracted, but when the obliquity of the ray
within the denser medium passes beyond a certain point
there is a sudden apparent breach of continuity, and the
w T hole of the light is reflected. A very clear reason can
be given for this exceptional conduct of the light ; for
according to the law of refraction the sine of the angle of
incidence always bears a fixed ratio to the sine of the angle
of refraction, so that the greater of the two angles, which
is always that in the less dense medium, may increase up
to a right angle, but when the media differ in refractive
power, the less angle cannot become a right angle, as this
