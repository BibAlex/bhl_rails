THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
The reader will remark that the correspondence is
remarkably close, except as regards larger errors, which
are excessive in practice. It is one objection, indeed, to
the theory of error, that, being expressed in a continuous
mathematical function, it contemplates the possible exist-
ence of errors of every magnitude, such indeed as could
not practically occur ; yet in this case the theory seems to
under-estimate the number of large errors.
Another excellent comparison of the law with observa-
tion has been made by Quetelet, who has investigated the
errors of 487 determinations in time of the Right Ascen-
sion of the Pole-star, made at Greenwich during the four
years 1836-39. These observations, although carefully
corrected for all known causes of error, as well as for
nutation, precession, &c., are yet of course found to differ,
and being classified as regards intervals of one-half second
of time, and then proportionately increased in number, so
that their sum may be one thousand, give the following
results as compared with what theory would lead us to
expect h :
Magnitude of
error in tenths
of a second.

In this instance the correspondence is also satisfactory,
but the divergence between theory and fact is in the
opposite direction to that discovered in the former com-

Dowries, Letter XIX. p. 88. See also Galton's ' Hereditary Genius,'
