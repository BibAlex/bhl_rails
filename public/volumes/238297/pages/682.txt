192 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Quantities indicated ~by Theory, but Empirically
Measured.
In many cases we are able to foresee the existence of a
quantitative effect, on the ground of general principles,
but are unable, either from the want of numerical data,
or from the entire absence of any mathematical theory, to
assign the amount of such effect. We then have recourse
to direct experiment to determine its amount. Whether
we argued from the oceanic tides by analogy, or more
generally from the theory of gravitation, there could be
no doubt that atmospheric tides of some amount, depend-
ing on the apparent heights of the sun and the moon,
must occur in the atmosphere. Theory, however, even in
the hands of Laplace, was not able to overcome the com-
plicated mechanical conditions of the atmosphere, and
predict the amount of such tides ; and, on the other hand,
these amounts were so small, and were so masked by far
larger undulations arising from the heating power of the
sun, and from other meteorological disturbances, that they
would probably have never been discovered by purely
empirical observations. Theory having, however, indi-
cated their existence, it was easy to make series of baro-
metrical observations in places selected so as to be as free
as possible from casual fluctuations, and then by the suit-
able application of the method of means to detect the
small effects in question. The principal lunar atmospheric
tide was thus proved to amount to between "003 and
004 inch a .
Theory, in fact, yields the greatest possible assistance in
applying the method of means. For if we have a great
number of empirical measurements, each representing the
joint effect of a number of causes, our object will be to
