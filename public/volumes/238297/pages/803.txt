forms are similarly modified, so as to produce a series of
what are called hemihedral forms.
Apparent but Congruent Exceptions.
Not unfrequently a law of nature will present results
in certain circumstances which appear to be entirely in
conflict with the law itself. Not only may the action of
the law be much complicated and disguised, but it may
in various ways be reversed or inverted, so that all care-
less observers are misled. Ancient philosophers gene-
rally believed that while some bodies were heavy by
nature, others, such as flame, smoke, bubbles, clouds, &c.,
were essentially light, or possessed a tendency to move
upwards. So acute and learned an inquirer as Aristotle
entirely failed to perceive the true nature of buoyancy or
apparent lightness, and the doctrine of intrinsic lightness,
being expounded in his works, became the accepted view
for many centuries. It is true that Lucretius was fully
aware why flame tends to rise, holding that
' The flame has weight, though highly rare,
Nor mounts but when compelled by heavier air.'
Archimedes also was so perfectly acquainted with the
buoyancy of bodies immersed in water, that he could not
fail to perceive the existence of a parallel effect in air.
Yet throughout the early middle ages the light of true
science, clear though feeble, could not contend with the
powerful but confused glare of the false Peripatetic doc-
trine. The genius of Galileo and Newton was required
to convince people of the simple truth that all matter
is heavy, but that the gravity of one substance may be
overborne by that of another, as one scale of a balance
is carried up by the preponderating weight in the oppo-
site scale. It is curious to find Newton gravely explaining
