THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Laws of Identity or Difference. Are they Laws of Thought
or Laws of Things'? Do they belong to mind or to
material nature ? On the one hand it may be said
that science is a purely mental existence, and must
therefore conform to the laws of that which formed it.
Science is in the mind and not in the things, and the
properties of mind are therefore all important. It is true
that these laws are verified in the observation of the
exterior world ; and it would seem that they might have
been gathered and proved by generalisation, had they
not already been in our possession. But on the other
hand, it may well be urged that we cannot prove these
laws by any process of reasoning or observation, be-
cause the laws themselves are presupposed, as Leibnitz
acutely remarked, in the very notion of a proof. They
are the prior conditions of all thought and all know-
ledge, and even to question their truth is to allow
them true. Hartley ingeniously refined upon this argu-
ment, remarking that if the fundamental laws of logic
be not certain, there must exist a logic of a second
order whereby we may determine the degree of uncer-
tainty : if the second logic be not certain, there must
be a third, and so on ad inftnitum. Thus we must sup-
pose either that absolutely certain laws of thought exist,
or that there is no such thing as certainty whatever e .
Logicians, indeed, appear to me to have paid insuf-
ficient attention to the fact that mistakes in reasoning
are always likely to occur. The Laws of Thought are
often called necessary laws, that is, laws which cannot
but be obeyed. Yet as a matter of fact who is there
that does not often fail to obey them ? They are the
laws which the mind ought to obey rather than what
it always does obey. Our thoughts cannot be the
criterion of truth, for we often have to acknowledge
