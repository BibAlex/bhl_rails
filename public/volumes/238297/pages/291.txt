PHILOSOPHY OF INDUCTIVE INFERENCE. 265
principles of number, no one can show that numbers
ending in 7 should be primes.
From the history of the theory of numbers some good
examples of false induction can be adduced. Taking the
following series of prime numbers
41, 43, 47, 53, 61, 71, 83, 97, 113, 131, 151, &c.,
it will be found that they all agree in being values of
the general expression x 2 + x 4- 4 1 , putting for x in succes-
sion the values, o, i, 2, 3, 4, &c. We thus seem always
to obtain a prime number, and the induction is apparently
very strong, to the effect that this expression always will
give primes. Yet a few more trials will disprove this false
conclusion. Put x = 40, and we obtain 40 x 40 + 40 + 41,
or 41 x 4 1 . Now such a failure could never have hap-
pened, had we shown any deductive reason why x 2 + x + 41
should give primes.
There can be no doubt that what here happens with
forty instances, might happen with forty thousand or
forty million instances. An apparent law never once
failing up to a certain point may then suddenly break
down, so that inductive reasoning, as it has been described
by some writers, can give no sure knowledge of what is to
come. Mr. Babbage admirably pointed out, in his Ninth
Bridgewater Treatise, that a machine could be constructed
to give a perfectly regular series of numbers, through
a vast series of steps, and yet to break the law of progres-
sion suddenly at any required point. No number of
particular cases as particulars enables us to pass by
inference to any new case. It is hardly needful to inquire
here what can be inferred from an infinite series of facts,
because they are never practically within our power ; but
we may unhesitatingly accept the conclusion, that no
finite number of instances can ever prove a general law,
or can give us sure knowledge of even one other instance.
General mathematical theorems have indeed been dis-
