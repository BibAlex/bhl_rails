THEORY OF APPROXIMATION. 101
expansion may also be considered as being three times as
great as the linear expansion. For if the increase of tem-
perature expands a bar of metal in the ratio of i to i 4- a,
and the expansion be equal in all directions, then a cube
of the same metal would expand as i to (i+a) 3 , or as
i to i + 3 a + 3 a 2 + a 3 . When a is a very small quantity
the third term 3 a 2 will be imperceptible, and still more so
the fourth term* a 3 . The coefficients of expansion of
solids are in fact so small, and so imperfectly determined,
that physicists seldom take into account their second and
higher powers.
It is an universal and important result of these prin-
ciples that all very small errors may be assumed to vary
in simple proportion to their causes ; a new reason why, in
eliminating errors, we should first of all make them as
small as possible. Let us suppose, with De Morgan, that
there is a right-angled triangle of which the two sides
containing the right angle are really of the lengths 3 and
4, so that the hypothenuse is v /3 2 + 4 2 or 5. Now if in
two measurements of the first side we commit slight
errors, making it successively 4*001 and 4*002, then calcu-
lation will give the lengths of the hypothenuse as almost
exactly 5*0008 and 5*00016, so that the error in the
hypothenuse will seem to vary in simple proportion to
that of the side, although it does not really do so with
perfect exactness a . The logarithm of a number does
not vary in proportion to that number nevertheless we
should find the difference between the logarithms of the
numbers 100000 and 100001 to be almost exactly equal to
that between the numbers 100001 and 100002. It is thus
a general rule that very small differences between suc-
cessive values of a function are approximately proportional
to the small differences of the variable quantity.
