212 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Residual Phenomena.
Even when all the experimental data employed in the
verification of a theory are sufficiently accurate, and the
theory itself is sound, there may still exist discrepancies
demanding further investigation. Sir John Herschel was
perhaps the first who pointed out the importance of such
outstanding quantities, and called them residual pheno-
menal. Now if the observations and the theory be really
correct, such discrepancies must be due to the incomplete-
ness of our knowledge of the causes in action, and the
ultimate explanation must consist in showing that there
is in action
(1) Some agent of known nature whose presence was
not suspected.
(2) Some new agent of unknown nature.
In the first case we cannot be said to make any new
discovery, for our ultimate success consists merely in
reconciling the theory with known facts when our in-
vestigation is more comprehensive. But in the second
case we meet with a totally new fact, which may
lead us to whole realms of new discovery. Take the
instance adduced by Sir John Herschel. The theory of
Newton and Halley concerning cometary motions was
that they were gravitating bodies revolving round the
sun in oblique orbits, and the actual return of Halley's
Comet, in 1758, sufficiently verified this theory. But,
when accurate observations of Encke's Comet came to be
made, the verification was not found to be complete.
Each time Encke's Comet returned a little sooner than
it ought, the period having regularly decreased from
121279 days, between 1786 and 1789, to 1210*44 be-
