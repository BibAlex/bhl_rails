THE THEORY OF PROBABILITY. 243
system every term may be indifferently positive or nega-
tive, so that we express under the form A is B or A = AB
as many differences as agreements. It is impossible
therefore that we should have any reason to disbelieve
rather than to believe it. We can hardly indeed invent
a proposition concerning the truth of which we are
absolutely ignorant, except when we are absolutely ignorant
of the terms used. If I ask the reader to assign the
odds that a ' Platythliptic Coefficient is positive } P he
will hardly see his way to doing so, unless he regard
them as even.
The assumption that complete doubt is properly ex-
pressed by | has been called in question by Bishop Terrot, *
who proposes instead the indefinite symbol ~ ; and he
considers that ' the d priori probability derived from
absolute ignorance has no effect upon the force of a
subsequently admitted probability/ But a writer of far
greater power, the late Professor Donkin, has strongly
defended the commonly adopted expression of complete
doubt. If we grant that the probability may have any
value between o and i, and that every separate value
is equally likely, then n and i - n are equally likely,
and the average is always -J-. Or we may take p . dp
to express the probability that our estimate concerning
any proposition should lie between p and p + dp. The
complete probability of the proposition is then the in-
tegral taken between the limits i and o, or again -| r .
Difficulties of the Theory.

The doctrine of probability, though undoubtedly true,
requires very careful application. Not only is it a branch
