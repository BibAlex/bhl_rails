DEDUCTIVE REASONING. 77
Our principle of inference then includes the rule of nega-
tive premises whenever it is true, and discriminates correctly
between the cases where it does and does not apply.
The paralogism, anciently called Undistributed Middle,
is also easily exhibited and infallibly avoided by our
system. Let the premises be
Hydrogen is an element, (i)
All metals are elements. (2)
According to the syllogistic rules the middle term element
is here undistributed, and no conclusion can be obtained ;
we cannot tell then whether hydrogen is or is not a
metal. Eepresent the terms as follows
A = hydrogen
B = element
C = metal.
The premises then become
A = AB (i)
C = CB. (2)
The reader will here, as in a former page (p. 75), find
it impossible to make any substitution. The only term
which occurs in both premises is B, but it is combined
with different letters. For CB we cannot substitute the
equivalent of AB. We have no right to decompose
combinations ; and if we adhere rigidly to the rule given,
that if two terms are stated to be equivalent we may
substitute one for the other, we cannot commit the
fallacy. It is apparent that the form of premises given
above is the same as that which we obtained by trans-
lating two negative premises into the affirmative form.
The old fallacy, technically called the Illicit Process of
the Major Term, is more easy to commit and more diffi-
cult to detect than any other breach of the syllogistic rules.
In our system it could hardly occur. From the premises
All planets are subject to gravity, (i)
Fixed stars are not planets, (2)
