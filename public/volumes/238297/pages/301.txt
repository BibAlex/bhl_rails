PHILOSOPHY OF INDUCTIVE INFERENCE. 275
knowledge of the agents existing throughout the universe
were complete, and if we were at the same time certain
that the same Power which created the universe would
allow it to proceed without arbitrary change. There is
always a possibility of causes being in existence without
our knowledge, and these may at any moment produce
an unexpected effect. Even when by the theory of pro-
babilities we succeed in forming some notion of the com-
parative confidence with which we should receive in-
ductive results, it yet appears to me that we must make
an assumption. Events come out like balls from the vast
ballot-box of nature, and close observation will enable us
to form some notion, as we shall see in the next chapter,
of the contents of that ballot-box. But we must still
assume that between the time of an observation and that
to which our inferences relate, no change in the ballot-box
shall have been made.
