vain, when less will serve ; for Nature is pleased with
simplicity, and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes/
Keill, again, lays down 11 as an axiom that ' The causes of
natural things are such, as are the most simple, and are
sufficient to explain the phenomena : for nature always
proceeds in the simplest and most expeditious method ;
because by this manner of operating the Divine Wisdom
displays itself the more/ If this axiom had any clear
grounds of truth, it would not apply to proximate laws ;
for even when the ultimate law may appear simple the
results may be infinitely diverse, as in the various elliptic,
hyperbolic, parabolic, or circular orbits of the heavenly
bodies. Simplicity is naturally agreeable to a mind of
very finite powers, but to an Infinite Mind everything is
simple.
Every great advance in science consists in a great gene-
ralization, pointing out deep and subtle resemblances.
The Copernican system was a generalization, in that it
classed the earth among the planets ; it was, as Bishop
Wilkins expressed it, ' the discovery of a new planet,' but
it was opposed by a more shallow generalization. Those
who argued from the condition of things upon the earth's
surface, thought that every object must be attached to
and rest upon something else. Shall the earth, they said,
alone be free \ Accustomed to certain special results of
gravity they could not conceive its action under widely
different circumstances . No hasty thinker could seize
the deep analogy pointed out by Horrocks between a pen-
dulum and a planet, true in substance though mistaken in
some details. All the advances of modern science rise
from the conception of Galileo, that in the heavenly
bodies, however apparently different their condition, we
