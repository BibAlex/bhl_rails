DISJUNCTIVE PROPOSITIONS. 83
we may often treat alternatives as Compossible, or true at v
the same time. Whately gives as an example 13 , f Virtue
tends to procure us either the esteem of mankind, or the
favour of God/ and he adds, ' Here both members are
true, and consequently from one being affirmed we are not
authorized to deny the other. Of course we are left to
conjecture in each case, from the context, whether it is
meant to be implied that the members are or are not
exclusive/ Mansel says c , ' We may happen to know that
two alternatives cannot be true together, so that the
affirmation of the second necessitates the denial of the first ;
but this, as Boethius observes, is a material, not & formal
consequence/ Mr. J. S. Mill has also pointed out the
absurdities which would arise from always interpreting
alternatives as exclusive. ' If we assert/ he says d , ' that
a man who has acted in some particular way must be
either a knave or a fool, we by no means assert, or intend
to assert, that he cannot be both.' Again, 'to make an
entirely unselfish use of despotic power, a man must be
either a saint or a philosopher Does the dis-
junctive premise necessarily imply, or must it be construed
as supposing, that the same person cannot be both a
saint and a philosopher ? Such a construction would be
ridiculous/
I discuss this subject fully because it is really the point
which separates my logical system from that of the late
Dr. Boole. In his 'Laws of Thought' (p. 32) he expressly
says, 'In strictness, the words "and," "or," interposed
between the terms descriptive of two or more classes of
objects, imply that those classes are quite distinct, so that
no member of one is found in another/ This I altogether
