Negative Arguments on the Principle of Continuity.
Upon the principle of continuity we may often found
arguments of great force which prove an hypothesis to be
impossible, because it would involve a continual repetition
of a process ad infinitum, or else a purely arbitrary breach
at some point. Bonnet's famous theory of reproduction
represented every living creature as containing germs
which were perfect representatives of the next generation,
so that on the same principle they necessarily included
germs of the next generation, and so on indefinitely. The
theory was sufficiently refuted when once clearly stated,
as in the following poem called the Universe 6 , by Henry
Baker :
' Each seed includes a plant : that plant, again,
Has other seeds, which other plants contain :
Those other plants have all their seeds, and those
More plants again, successively inclose.
' Thus, ev'ry single berry that we find,
Has, really, in itself whole forests of its kind,
Empire and wealth one acorn may dispense,
By fleets to sail a thousand ages hence/
The general principle of inference, that what we know
of one case must be true of similar cases, if they really
are identical in the essential conditions, prevents our
asserting anything which we cannot apply time after
time under the same circumstances. On this principle
Stevinus beautifully demonstrated that weights resting
on two inclined planes and balancing each other must be
proportional to the lengths of the planes between their
apex and a horizontal plane. He imagined an uniform
