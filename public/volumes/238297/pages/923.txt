RESULTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD. 433
universe is not infinite in extent and complexity, an
assumption for which I can see no logical basis whatever.
The Indeterminate Problem of Creation.
A second and very serious misapprehension concern-
ing the import of a law of nature may now be pointed
out. It is not uncommonly supposed that a law deter-
mines the character of the results which shall take place,
as, for instance, that the law of gravity determines what
force of gravity shah 1 act upon a given particle. Surely
a little reflection must render it plain that a law by itself
determines nothing. It is a law plus agents obeying
that law which have results, and it is no part of the
law to govern or define the number and place of its
own agents. Whether a particle of matter shall gravi-
tate, depends not upon the law of Newton only, but
upon the distribution of surrounding particles. The
theory of gravitation may perhaps be true throughout
all time and in all parts of space, and even the Creator
may never find occasion to create those possible excep-
tions to it which I have asserted to be conceivable. Let
this be as it may, and our science cannot certainly
determine the question, yet the theory of gravitation
itself gives no indication of the forces which may be
brought to act at any point of space. The force of
gravitation acting upon any particle depends, as we
have seen, upon the number, mass, distance, and rela-
tive position of all the other particles of matter within
the bounds of space at the instant in question. Even
assuming that all matter when once distributed through
space at the Creation, was thenceforth to act in an in-
variable manner without subsequent interference, yet
the actual configuration of matter at any moment, and
