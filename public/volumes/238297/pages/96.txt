70 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Law of Simplicity (p. 39) some of the repeated letters may
be made to coalesce, and we have
A = ABC . 0.
Substituting again for ABO its equivalent A, we obtain
A = AC,
the desired result.
By a similar process of reasoning it may be shown that
we can always drop out any term appearing in one member
of a proposition, provided that we substitute for it the
whole of the other member. This process was described
in my first logical Essay h , as Intrinsic Elimination, but it
might perhaps be better entitled the Ellipsis of Terms.
It enables us to get rid of needless terms by strict sub-
stitutive reasoning.
Inference of a Simple from Two Partial Identities.
. Two terms may be connected together by two partial
identities in yet another manner, and a case of inference
then arises which is of the highest importance. In the
two premises
A = AB (i)
B = AB, (2)
the second member of each is the same ; so that we can
by obvious substitution obtain
A = B.
Thus in plain geometry we readily prove that ' Every
equilateral triangle is also an equiangular triangle,' and
we can with equal ease prove that ' Every equiangular
triangle is an equilateral triangle/ Thence by substitu-
tion, as explained above, we pass to the simple identity-
Equilateral triangle = equiangular triangle.
We thus prove that one class of triangles is entirely
identical with another class ; that is to say, they differ
only in our way of naming and regarding them.
