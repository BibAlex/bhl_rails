THE INDIRECT METHOD OF INFERENCE. 1 1 1
indirect process of inference becomes reduced to the repe-
tition of a few uniform operations of classification, selection,
and elimination of contradictories. Logical deduction even
in the most complicated questions becomes a matter of
mere routine, and the amount of labour required is the
only impediment when once the meaning of the premises
is rendered clear. But the amount of labour is often
found to be considerable. The mere writing down of
sixty-four combinations of six letters each is no small
task, and, if we had a problem of five premises, each of
the sixty-four combinations would have to be examined
in connection with each premise. The requisite com-
parison is often of a very tedious character and consider-
able chance of errors thus arises.
I have given much attention therefore to reducing both
the manual and mental labour of the process, and I shall
describe several devices which may be adapted for saving
trouble and risk of mistake.
In the first place, as the same sets of combinations
occur over and over again in different problems, we may
avoid the labour of writing them out by having the sets
of letters ready printed upon small sheets of writing paper.
It has also been suggested by a correspondent that, if any
one series of combinations were marked upon the margin
of a sheet of paper, and a slit cut between each pair of
combinations, it would be easy to fold down any particular
combination, and thus strike it out of view. The combi-
nations consistent with the premises would then remain
in a broken series. This method answers sufficiently well
for occasional use.
A more convenient mode, however, is to have the series
of letters shown on p. 109, engraved upon a common
school writing slate, of such a size, that the letters may
occupy only about a third of the space on the left hand
side of the slate. The conditions of the problem can then
