18 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
centuries 1 , and the probability that if existent they would
have been seen, increases the probability that they do not
exist. We may with somewhat less confidence discredit the
existence of any large unrecognised fish, or sea animals,
such as the alleged sea-serpent. But as we descend to
forms of smaller size negative evidence loses weight from
the less probability of our seeing smaller objects. Even
the strong induction in favour of the four-fold division of
the animal kingdom into Vertebrata, Annulosa, Mollusca,
and Ooelenterata, may break down by the discovery of in-
termediate or anomalous forms. As civilisation spreads
over the surface of the earth, and unexplored tracts
are gradually diminished, negative conclusions will in-
crease in force ; but we require to learn much yet con-
cerning the depths of the ocean, almost wholly unexamined
as they are, and covering three-fourths of the earth's
surface.
In geology there are a number of assertions to which
considerable probability attaches on account of the large
extent of the investigations already made, as, for in-
stance, that true coal is found only in rocks of a par-
ticular geological epoch ; that gold occurs in secondary
and tertiary strata only in exceedingly small quantities",
probably derived from the disintegration of earlier
rocks.
In natural history negative conclusions are exceedingly
treacherous and unsatisfactory. The utmost patience will
not enable a microscopist or the observer of any living
thing to watch the behaviour of the organism under all
circumstances continuously for any great length of time.
There is always a chance therefore that the critical act or
change may take place when the observer's eyes are with-
drawn. This certainly happens in some cases; for though
