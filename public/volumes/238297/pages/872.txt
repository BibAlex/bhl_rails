382 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
that Aristotle should state the laws of thought, and
employ the predicables without implicitly recognising the
logical necessity of that method. It is, however, in Por-
phyry's remarkable and in many respects excellent * Intro-
duction to the Categories of Aristotle' that we find the
most distinct account of it. Porphyry not only fully and
accurately describes the Predicables, but incidently intro-
duces an example for illustrating those predicables, which
constitutes a good specimen of bifurcate classification.
Translating his words ^ freely we may say that he takes
Substance as the genus to be divided, under which are
successively placed as Species Body, Animated Body,
Animal, Rational Animal, and Man. Under Man, again,
come Socrates, Plato, and other particular men. Now of
these notions Substance is the genus generalissimurn, and
is a genus only, not a species. Man, on the other hand,
is the species specialissima (infima species), and is a species
only, not a genus. Body is a species of substance, but a
genus of animated body, which, again, is a species of body
but a genus of animal. Animal is a species of animated
body, but a genus of rational animal, which, agaio, is
a species of animal, but a genus of man. Finally, man
is a species of rational animal, but is a species merely
and not a genus, being divisible only into particular
men.
Porphyry proceeds at some length to employ his
example in further illustration of the predicables. We
do not find in Porphyry's own work any scheme or
diagram exhibiting this curious specimen of classifi-
cation, but some of the earlier commentators and epitome
writers drew what has long been called the Tree of
Porphyry.
