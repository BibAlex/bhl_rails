164 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
and Davy speaks of this discovery as the foundation of all
that had since been done in electro-chemical science.
It is otherwise with the discovery of electro-magnetism,
or the relation between the magnet and electricity.
Oersted, in common with many others, had suspected the
existence of some relation between these strange powers,
and he appears to have tried to detect its exact nature.
Once, as we are told by Hansteen, he had employed a
strong galvanic battery during a lecture, and at the close
it occurred to him to try the effect of placing the con-
ducting wire parallel to a magnetic needle, instead of at
right angles, as he had previously done. The needle
immediately moved and took up a position nearly at
right angles to the wire ; he inverted the direction of the
current, and the needle deviated in a contrary direction.
The great discovery was made, and if by accident, it was
such an accident as happens only to those who deserve
them, as Lagrange remarked of Newton h . There was, in
fact, nothing accidental, except that, as in all totally new
discoveries, Oersted did not know what to look for. He
could not infer from previous knowledge the nature of
the relation, and it was only repeated trial in different
modes which could lead him to the right combination.
High and happy powers of inference, and not accident,
subsequently induced Faraday to reverse the process, and
show that the motion of the magnet would occasion an
electric current in the wire.
Sufficient investigation would probably show that
almost every branch of art and science had an accidental
beginning. In historical times almost every important
new instrument, such as the telescope, the microscope, or
the compass, was probably suggested by some accidental
occurrence or observation. In pre-historic times the germs
of the arts must have arisen still more exclusively in
