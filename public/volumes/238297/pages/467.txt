THE LAW OF ERROR. 441
If any case should arise in which the observer knows
the number and magnitude of the independent errors
which may occur, he ought certainly to calculate from the
Arithmetical Triangle the special Law of Error which would
apply. But the general law, of which we are in search,
is to be used in the dark, when we have no knowledge
whatever of the sources of error. To assume any special
number of causes of error is then an arbitrary proceeding,
and mathematicians have chosen the least arbitrary course
of imagining the existence of an infinite number of in-
finitely small errors, just as, in the inverse method of
probabilities, an infinite number of infinitely improbable
hypotheses were submitted to calculation (p. 296).
The reasons in favour of this choice are of several
different kinds.
1. It cannot be denied that there may exist infinitely
numerous causes of error in any act of observation.
2. The resulting law on the hypothesis of a large finite,
or even a moderate finite number of causes of error, does
not appreciably differ from that given by the hypothesis
of infinity.
3. We gain by the hypothesis of infinity a general law
capable of ready calculation, and applicable by uniform
rules to all problems.
4. This law, when tested by comparison with extensive
series of observations, is strikingly verified, as will be
shown in a later section.
When we imagine the existence of any large number of
causes of error, for instance one hundred, the numbers of
combinations become impracticably large, as may be seen
to be the case from a glance at the Arithmetical Triangle
(p. 208), which proceeds only up to the seventeenth line.
M. Que tet, by suitable abbreviating processes, succeeded
in calculating out a table of probability of errors on the
