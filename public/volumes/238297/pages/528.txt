38 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
that electricity must have the power of generating acids
and alkalis, and one chemist thought he had discovered a
new substance called electric acid. But Davy proceeded
to a systematic investigation of the circumstances, by
varying the conditions. Changing the glass vessel for
one of agate or gold, he found that far less alkali was
produced ; excluding impurities by the use of very care-
fully distilled water, he found that the quantities of acid
and alkali were still further diminished ; and having thus
obtained a clue to the cause he completed the exclusion of
impurities by avoiding contact with his fingers, and by
placing the apparatus under an exhausted receiver, no
acid or alkali being then detected. It would be difficult
to meet with a more elegant or successful case of the
detection of a condition previously unsuspected <i.
It is highly remarkable that the presence of common
salt in the air, proved to exist by Davy, nevertheless
continued a stumbling-block in the science of spectrum
analysis, and probably prevented men, such as Brewster,
Herschel, and Talbot, from anticipating by thirty years
the discoveries of Bunsen and Kirchhoff. As I have else-
where pointed out r , the utility of the spectrum was
known in the middle of the last century to Thomas
Melvill, a talented Scotch physicist, who died at the early
age of 27 years 8 . But Melvill was struck in his examina-
tion of various coloured flames by the extraordinary pre-
dominance of homogeneous yellow light, which was due to
some circumstance escaping his attention. Wollaston and
