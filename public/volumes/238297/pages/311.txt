Application of the Theory of Probabilities in
Astronomy.
The science of astronomy, occupied with the simple
relations of distance, magnitude, and motion of the
heavenly bodies, admits more easily than almost any
other science of interesting conclusions founded on the
theory of probability. More than a century ago, in
1 767, Michell showed the extreme probability of bonds
connecting together systems of stars. He was struck
by the unexpected number of fixed stars which have
companions close to them. Such a conjunction might
happen casually by one star, although possibly at a
great distance from the other, happening to lie on the
same straight line passing near the earth. But the
probabilities are so greatly against such an optical union
happening often in the expanse of the heavens, that
Michell asserted the existence of a bond between most of
