296 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Newton has, in any of his works, displayed an under-
standing of the phenomena of interference inseparable from
the notion of waves.
While the general principles of undulatory or harmonic
motion will be the same in whatever medium the motion
takes place, the circumstances must often be excessively
different. Between light travelling 186,000 miles per
second and sound travelling in air only about 1 100 feet in
the same unit of time, or almost 900,000 times as slowly, we
cannot expect a close outward resemblance. There are
great differences, too, in the character of the vibrations.
Gases scarcely admit of transverse vibration, so that sound
travelling in air is a longitudinal wave, the particles of
air moving backwards and forwards in the same line in
which the wave moves onwards. Light, on the other
hand, appears to consist entirely in the movement of
points of force transversely to the direction of propaga-
tion of the ray. The light-wave is partially analogous to
the bending of a rod or of a stretched cord agitated at one
end. Now this bending motion may take place in any
one of an infinite number of planes, and waves of which
the planes are perpendicular to each other cannot interfere
any more than two perpendicular forces can interfere.
Now the whole of the complicated phenomena of polar-
ized light arise out of this transverse character of the
luminous wave, and we must not expect to meet any
analogous phenomena in atmospheric sound-waves. It is
conceivable that in solids we might produce transverse
sound undulations, in which many of the phenomena of
polarization might be reproduced. But it would appear
that even between transverse sound and light-waves the
analogy holds true rather of the principles of harmonic
motion than the circumstances of the vibrating medium ;
'from experiment and theory it is inferred that the plane
of polarization in plane polarized light is perpendicular to
