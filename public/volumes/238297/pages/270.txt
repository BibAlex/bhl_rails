244 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
of mathematics in which positive blunders are frequently
committed, but it is a matter of great difficulty in many
cases, to be sure that the formulae correctly represent the
data of the problem. These difficulties often arise from")
the logical complexity of the conditions, which might be,|
perhaps to some extent cleared up by constantly bearing
in mind the system of combinations as developed in the
Indirect Logical Method. In the study of probabilities,
mathematicians had unconsciously employed logical pro-
cesses far in advance of those in possession of logicians,
and the Indirect Method is but the full statement of
these processes.
It is very curious how often the most acute and power-
ful intellects have gone astray in the calculation of
probabilities. Seldom w T as Pascal mistaken, yet he in-
augurated the science with a mistaken solution. 8 Leibnitz
fell into the extraordinary blunder of thinking that the
number twelve was as probable a result in the throwing
of two dice as the number eleven.* In not a few cases the
false solution first obtained seems more plausible to the
present day than the correct one since demonstrated.
James Bernouilli candidly records two false solutions of
a problem which he at first thought self-evident ; u and he
adds an express warning against the risk of error, especially
when we attempt to reason on this subject without a rigid
adherence to the methodical rules and symbols. x Mont-
mort was not free from similar mistakes/ and as to
D'Alembert, great though his reputation was, and perhaps
is, he constantly fell into blunders which must diminish
the weight of his opinions. 2 He could not perceive, for
