the English inch, which is now almost exactly the
5 00,5 00,000 th part of the polar axis of the earth, should
be made exactly equal to the 5OO,ooo,oooth part, and be
adopted as our standard. The first imperfection in such
a method is that the earth is certainly not invariable in
size; for we know that it is superior in temperature to sur-
rounding space, and must be slowly cooling and contract-
ing. There is much reason to believe that all earthquakes,
volcanoes, mountain elevations, and changes of sea level,
are evidences of this contraction as asserted by Mr. Mallet P.
But such is the vast bulk of the earth and the duration
of its past existence, that this contraction is perhaps less
rapid in proportion than that of any bar or other material
standard which we can construct.
The second and chief difficulty of this method arises
from the vast size of the earth, which prevents us from
making any comparison with the ultimate standard, ex-
cept by a trigonometrical survey of a most elaborate and
costly kind. The French physicists, who first proposed
the method, attempted to obviate this inconvenience by
carrying out the survey once for all, and then constructing
a standard metre, which should be exactly the one ten
millionth part of the distance from the pole to the
equator. But since all measuring operations are merely
approximate, as so often stated in previous pages, it was
impossible that this operation could be perfectly achieved.
Accordingly it was shown by Colonel Puissant in 1838,
that the supposed French metre was erroneous to the con-
siderable extent of one part in 5527, the quadrant of the
earth's circumference measuring 10,001,789 instead of
10,000,000 of such metres. It then became necessary
either to alter the length of the assumed metre, or
otherwise to abandon its supposed relation to the earth's
dimensions.
