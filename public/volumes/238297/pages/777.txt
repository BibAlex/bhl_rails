ANALOGY. 287
Herschel noticed that in three physical phenomena, a
screw-like form, technically called helicoidal dissymmetry,
was presented, namely in electrical helices, plagihedral
quartz crystals, and the rotation of the plane of polariza-
tion of light. As he himself has said b , ' I reasoned thus :
Here are three phenomena agreeing in a very strange pecu-
liarity. Probably, this peculiarity is a connecting link,
physically speaking, among them. Now, in the case of
the crystals and the light, this probability has been turned
into certainty by my own experiments. Therefore, induc-
tion led me to conclude that a similar connexion exists,
and must turn up, somehow or other, between the electric
current and polarized light, and that the plane of polariza-
tion would be deflected by magneto-electricity/ By this
course of analogical thought Sir John Herschel had actu-
ally been led to anticipate Faraday's great discovery of the
influence of magnetic strain upon polarized light. He
had tried as long ago as 1822-25 to discover the influence
of electricity on light, by sending a ray of polarized light
through a helix, or near a long wire conveying an electric
current. Such a course of inquiry, followed up with the
persistency of Faraday, and with his experimental re-
sources, would doubtless have effected the strange dis-
covery. Herschel also suggests that the plagihedral form
of quartz crystals must be due to a screw-like strain
during the progress of crystallization ; but the notion,
although probable, remains unverified by experiment to
the present day.
If ever men approach the investigation of the me-
chanism of thought, they must be guided by analogy.
Already many philosophers have drawn analogies between
nerve influence and the transmission of vibrations. Dr.
Briggs, Newton in his 24th Query, and Hartley, have
vaguely speculated concerning such vibrations, and some
