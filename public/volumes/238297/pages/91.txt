DEDUCTIVE REASONING. 65
the second degree/ The real forms of the propositions
here given are exactly those shown in the symbolic state-
ment, but in this and many other cases it will be sufficient
to state them in ordinary elliptical language for sake of
brevity. In scientific treatises a term and its definition
are often both given in the same sentence, as in ' The
weight of a body in any given locality, or the force with
which the earth attracts it, is proportional to its mass/
The conjunction or in this statement gives the force of
equivalence to the parenthetic definition, so that the
propositions really are
Weight of a body = force with which the earth at-
tracts it.
Weight of a body = weight, &c. proportional to its
mass.
A slightly different case of inference consists in sub-
stituting in a proposition of the form A = AB a defi-
nition of the term B. Thus from A = AB and B = C
we get A = AC. For instance, we may say that ( Metals
are elements' and * Elements are incapable of decompo-
sition/
Metal = metal element.
Element = what is incapable of decomposition.
Hence
Metal = metal incapable of decomposition.
It is almost needless to point out that the form of these
arguments would not suffer any real modification if some
of the terms happened to be negative ; indeed in the last
example * incapable of decomposition ' may be treated as
a negative term. Taking
A = metal
B = element
C = what is capable of decomposition
c = what is incapable of decomposition (p. 17);
