THE LOGICAL MACHINE. 123
whence it is apparent that A must be B, the true conclusion
of the argument.
In my previous Essay 11 I have described the working of
two other logical problems upon the abacus, which it
would be tedious to repeat in this place.
The Logical Machine.
Although the Logical Abacus considerably reduced the
labour of using the Indirect Method, it was not free from
the possibility of error. I thought moreover that it would
afford a conspicuous proof of the generality and power of
the method if I could reduce it to a purely mechanical
form. Logicians had long been accustomed to speak of
Logic as an Organoii or Instrument, and even Bacon, while
he rejected the old syllogistic logic, had insisted, in the
second aphorism of his ' New Instrument/ that the mind
required some kind of systematic aid. In the kindred
science of mathematics mechanical assistance of one kind
or another had long been employed. Orreries, globes,
mechanical clocks, and such like instruments, are really
aids to calculation and are of considerable antiquity. The
arithmetical machine of Pascal is more than two centuries
old, having been constructed in 1642-45. M. Thomas of
Colmar has recently manufactured an arithmetical machine
on Pascal's principles which is extensively employed by
engineers and others who need frequently to multiply or
divide. To Babbage, however, was entirely due the
merit of embodying the Calculus of Differences in a
machine, which thus became capable of calculating the
most complicated tables of figures. It seemed strange
that in the more intricate science of quantity mechanism
could be applicable, whereas in the simple science of
