are those which altogether remove any one or more letter-
terms from the Abecedarium.
What is true of single propositions applies also to
groups of propositions, however large or complicated ;
that is to say, one group may be equivalent, inferrible,
consistent, or contradictory as regards another, and we
may similarly compare one proposition with a group of
propositions.
To give in this place illustrations of all the four kinds
of relation would require much space : as the examples
given in previous sections or chapters may serve more or
less to explain the relations of inference, consistency, and
contradiction, I will only add a, few instances of equivalent
propositions or groups.
In the following list each proposition or group of propo-
sitions is exactly equivalent in meaning to the correspond-
ing one in the other column, and the truth of this state-
ment may be tested by working out the combinations of
the Abecedarium, which ought to be found exactly the
same in the case of each pair of equivalents.
A = Ab B = aB
A = b a- B
A-BC a = b\c
A = AB t AC b = ab t AbC
A I B = C t D ab = cd
At c = B t d aC = bD
, A = ABtACl
A = ABc I Ab(j A -r, . ,,
AB = ABc
A = Bl
A= CJ
A = AC
B = A t aBC
A = ABCD.
