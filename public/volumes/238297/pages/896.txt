406 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
arrangement of the various kinds of animals and plants.
Systematic Botany and Zoology have been commonly
known as the Classificatory Sciences, and scientific men
seemed to suppose that the methods of arrangement,
which we e suitable for living creatifres, must be the best
for all other classes of objects. Several mineralogists,
especially Mohs, have attempted to arrange minerals in
genera and species, just as if they had been animals capable
of reproducing their kind with variations, and thus having
relatives like distant cousins.
It is highly remarkable that this confusion of ideas
between the relationship of living forms and the logical
relationship of things in general prevailed from the earliest
times, as manifested in the etymology of w^ords. We
familiarly speak of a kind of things meaning a class of
things, and the kind consists of those things which are
akin, or come of the same race. It is even believed by
some etymologists that second means othe% kind, the Latin
suffix cund being thus regarded as cognate with kind f .
Similarly when Socrates and his followers wanted a name
for a class regarded in a philosophical light, they again
adopted the analogy in question, and called it a 70/09, or
race, the root -yey- being distinctly connected with the
notion of generation.
So long as the species of plants and animals were
believed to proceed from distinct and unconnected acts of
Creation, the multitudinous points of resemblance and
difference which they present, possessed a simply logical
character, and might be treated as a guide to the classifi-
cation of other objects generaUy. But when once we
come to regard these resemblances as purely hereditary
in their origin, we see that the sciences of systematic
Botany and Zoology have a special character of their
own. There is no reason whatever to suppose that the
