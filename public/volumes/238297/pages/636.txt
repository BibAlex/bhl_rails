The Third Requisite Conformity with Facts.
Before we accept a new hypothesis, it must furnish us
with distinct credentials, consisting in the deductive anti-
cipation of a series of facts, which are not already con-
nected and accounted for by any equally probable hypo-
thesis. We cannot lay down any precise rule as to the
number of accordances which can establish the truth of
an hypothesis, because the accordances will vary much in
value. While, on the one hand, no finite number of
accordances will give entire certainty, the probability of
the hypothesis will increase very rapidly with the number
of accordances. Seldom, indeed, shall we have a theory
free from difficulties and apparent inconsistency with facts.
Though one real and undoubted inconsistency would be
sufficient to overturn the most plausible theory, yet there
is usually some probability that the fact may be misin-
terpreted, or that some supposed law of nature, on which
we are relying, may not be true. Almost every problem
in science thus takes the form of a balance of probabilities.
It is only when difficulty after difficulty has been success-
fully explained away, and decisive experimented crucis
have, time after line, resulted in favour of our theory,
that we can venture to assert the falsity of all objections.
The sole real test of an hypothesis is its accordance with
fact. Descartes' celebrated system of vortices is exploded
and rejected, not because it was intrinsically absurd and
inconceivable, but because it could not give results in
accordance with the actual motions of the heavenly bodies.
The difficulties of conception involved in the apparatus of
vortices, are mere child's play compared with those of
gravitation and the undulatory theory already described.
The vortices are on the whole plausible suppositions ; for
the planets and satellites bear at first sight much re-
semblance to objects carried round in whirlpools, an
