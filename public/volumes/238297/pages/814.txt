324 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Generalization, (vol. ii. p. 259). Quicksilver is divergent
among metals as regards its melting point, and potassium
and sodium as regards their specific gravity. Monstrous
productions and variations, whether in the animal or
vegetable kingdoms, should probably be assigned to this
class of exceptions.
Accidental Exceptions.
The third and largest class of exceptions contains those
which arise from the casual interference of extraneous causes.
A law may be in operation, and, if so, must be perfectly
fulfilled, but, while we conceive that we are examining
its results, we may have before us the effects of a totally
different cause, possessing no connexion with the subject
of our inquiry. The law is not really broken, but at the
same time the supposed exception is not illusory. It may
be a phenomenon which cannot occur but under the con-
dition of the law in question, yet there has been such
subsequent interference and modification of the result,
that there is an apparent failure of science. There is,
for instance, no subject in which more rigorous and in-
variable laws have been established than in crystallo-
graphy. As a general rule, each chemical substance pos-
sesses its own definite form, by which it can be infallibly
recognised ; but the mineralogist has to be on his guard
against what are called pseudomorphic crystals. In some
circumstances a substance, having perfectly assumed its
proper crystalline form, may afterwards undergo chemi-
cal change ; a new ingredient may be added, a former
one removed, or one element may be substituted for
another. In carbonate of lime the carbonic acid is some-
times replaced by sulphuric acid, so that we find gypsum
in the form of calcite ; other cases are known where the
change is inverted and calcite is found in the form of
gypsum. Mica, talc, steatite, hematite, are other minerals
