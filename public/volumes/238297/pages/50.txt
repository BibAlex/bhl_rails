24 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
The Propagating Power of Identity.
The relation of identity or sameness in all its degrees
is reciprocal. So far as things are alike, either may be
substituted for the other ; and this may perhaps be con-
sidered the very meaning of the relation. But it is well
worth notice that there is in identity a peculiar power of
extending itself among all the things which are identical.
To render a number of things similar to each other we
need only render them similar to one standard object.
Each coin struck from a pair of dies not only exactly
resembles the matrix or original pattern from which the
dies were struck, but exactly resembles every other coin
manufactured from the same original pattern. Among a
million such coins there are not less than 499,999,500,000
of -pairs of coins exactly resembling each other. Similars
to the same are similars to all. It is one great advantage
of printing that all copies of a document taken from the
same type are necessarily identical each with each, and
whatever is true of one copy will be true of every copy.
Similarly, if fifty rows of pipes in an organ be tuned in
perfect unison with one row, usually the Principal, they
must be in unison with each other. Identity can also
reproduce or propagate itself ad infinitum ; for if a
number of tuning-forks be adjusted in perfect unison
with one standard fork, all instruments tuned to any one
fork will agree with any instrument tuned to any other
fork. Standard measures of length, capacity, or weight,
or any other measureable quality, are propagated in the
same manner. So far as copies of the original standard,
or copies of copies, or copies again of those copies, are
accurately executed, they must all agree each with every
other.
It is the power of mutual substitution which gives
