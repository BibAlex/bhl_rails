under the title ( Sur un Principe General utile a 1'expli-
cation des Lois de la Nature V It has indeed been
asserted that the doctrine of the latens processus of
Francis Bacon involves the principle of continuity 6 , but
I think that this doctrine, like that of the natures of
substances is merely a vague statement of the principle
of causation.
Failure of the Law of Continuity.
There are certain requisite cautions which must be
given as to the application of the principle of continuity.
In the first place, where this principle really holds true,
it may seem to fail owing to our imperfect means of
observation. Though a physical law may never admit of
perfectly abrupt change, there is no limit to the approach
which it may make to abruptness. When we warm a
piece of very cold ice, the absorption of heat, the tem-
perature, and the dilatation of the ice vary according to
apparently simple laws until we come to the zero of the
Centigrade scale. Everything is then changed ; an enor-
mous absorption of heat takes place without any rise of
temperature, and the volume of the ice decreases as it
changes into water. Unless most carefully investigated,
this change appears perfectly abrupt ; but accurate ob-
servation seems to show that there is a certain forewarn-
ing ; the ice does not turn into water all at once, but
through a small fraction of a degree the change is gradual.
All the phenomena concerned, if measured very exactly,
would be represented not by angular lines, but con-
tinuous curves, undergoing rapid flexures; and we may
