PREFACE.
sophy which, building on a few material facts, presumes
to assert that it has compassed the bounds of existence,
while it nevertheless ignores the most unquestionable
phenomena of the human mind and feelings.
I have to thank my colleague, Professor Barker, for
carefully revising several of the sheets most abounding in
mathematical considerations. It is approximately certain
that in freely employing illustrations drawn from many
different sciences, I have frequently fallen into errors of
detail. In this respect I must throw myself upon the
indulgence of the reader, who will bear in mind, as I hope,
that the scientific facts are generally mentioned purely for
the purpose of illustration, so that inaccuracies of detail
will not in the majority of cases affect the truth of the
general principles illustrated.
