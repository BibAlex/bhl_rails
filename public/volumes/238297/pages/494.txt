THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
character were manifestations of the one same agent. To
observe with accuracy and convenience we must have
agents under our control, so as to raise or lower their
intensity, to stop or set them in action at will. Just as
Smeaton found it requisite to create an artificial and
governable supply of wind for his investigation of wind-
mills, so we must have constant or governable supplies of
light, heat, electricity, muscular force, or whatever other
agents we are examining.
It is hardly needful to point out too that on the earth's
surface we live under nearly uniform conditions of gravity,
temperature, and atmospheric pressure, so that if we are to
extend our inferences to other parts of the universe where
conditions may be widely different, we must be prepared
to imitate those conditions on a small scale here. We
must have intensely high and low temperatures ; we must
vary the density of gases from approximate vacuum up-
wards ; we must subject liquids and solids to pressures or
strains of almost unlimited amount.
Mental Conditions of Correct Observation.
Every observation must in a certain sense be true, for
the observing and recording of an event is in itself an
event. But before we proceed to deal with the supposed
meaning of the record, and draw inferences concerning the
course of nature, we must take care to ascertain that the
position and feelings of the observer are not to a great
extent the phenomena recorded. The mind of man, as
Francis Bacon said, is like an uneven mirror, and does not
reflect the events of nature without distortion. We need
not take notice of intentionally false observations, nor
of mistakes arising from defective memory, deficient
light, and so forth. Even where the utmost intentional
fidelity and care are used in observing and recording,
