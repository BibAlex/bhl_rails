then, they might have been used to predict or to correct
that most important constant. But if other more direct
methods of experiment give the mechanical equivalent of
heat with superior accuracy, then the experiments on
fluids will be turned to a better use in detecting and
assigning various quantities relating to the theory of
fluids. We will further consider questions of this kind
in succeeding sections.
There are of course many quantities assigned on theo-
retical grounds which we are quite unable to verify with
corresponding accuracy. The thickness of a film of gold
leaf, the average depths of the oceans, the velocity of a
star's approach to or regression from the earth as inferred
from spectroscopic data, or other quantities indirectly
determined (see vol. i. pp. 345-349), might be cases in
point ; but many others might be quoted where direct
verification seems impossible. Newton and many sub-
sequent physicists have accurately measured the lengths
of light undulations, and by several distinct methods we
learn the velocity with which light travels. Since an
undulation of the middle green is about five t en-million ths
of a metre in length, and travels at the rate of nearly
300,000.000 of metres per second, it necessarily follows
that about 600,000,000,000,000 undulations must strike
in one second the retina of an eye which perceives such
light. But how are we to verify such an astounding
calculation by directly counting pulses which recur six
hundred billions of times in a second ?
Discordance of Theory and Experiment.
When a distinct want of accordance is found to exist
between the results of theory and direct measurement,
several interesting questions may arise as to the mode in
which we can account for this discordance. The ultimate
