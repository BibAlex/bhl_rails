292 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE. -
probable hypothesis, I expect a recurrence of white balls.
The mathematician merely reduces this process of thought
to exact numbers. Taking, for instance, the hypothesis
that there are 99 white and one black ball in the urn,
he can calculate the probability that 20 white balls
should be drawn in succession in those circumstances ; he
thus forms a definite estimate of the probability of this
hypothesis, and knowing at the same time the probability
of a white ball reappearing if such be the contents of the
urn, he combines these probabilities, and obtains an exact
estimate that a white ball will recur in consequence of
this hypothesis. But as this hypothesis is only one out
of many possible ones, since the ratio of white and black
balls may be 98 to 2, or 97 to 3, or 96 to 4, and so on,
he has to repeat the estimate for every such possible
hypothesis. To make the method of solving the problem
perfectly evident, I will describe in the next section a
very simple case of the problem, originally devised for the
purpose by Condorcet, which was also adopted by Lacroix a ,
and has passed into the works of De Morgan, Lubbock,
and others.
Simple Illustration of the Inverse Problem.
Suppose it to be known that a ballot-box contains only
four black or w r hite balls, the ratio of black and white balls
being unknown. Four drawings having been made with
replacement, and a white ball having appeared on each
occasion but one, it is required to determine the proba-
bility that a white ball will appear next time. Now the
hypotheses which can be made as to the contents of the
urn are very limited in number, and are at most the
following five :
