THE INDIRECT METHOD OF INFERENCE. 97
proved indirectly, we may say that the process is a
necessary and sufficient one, and the question of its com-
parative excellence or usefulness is not worth discussion.
As a matter of fact I believe that nearly half our logical
conclusions rest upon its employment.
Simple Illustrations.
In tracing out the powers and results of this method, we
will begin with the simplest possible instance. Let us take
a proposition of the very common form, A = AB, say,
A Metal is an Element,
and let us investigate its full meaning. Any person who
has had the least logical training, is aware that we can
draw from the above proposition an apparently different
one, namely,
A Not-element is a Not-metal.
While some logicians, as for instance De Morgan, have
considered the relation of these two propositions to be
purely self-evident, and neither needing nor allowing
analysis, a great many more persons, as I have observed
while teaching logic, are at first unable to perceive the
close connection between them. I believe that a true and
complete system of logic will furnish a clear analysis of
this process which has been called Contrapositive Con-
version ; the full process is as follows :
Firstly, by the Law of Duality we know that
Not-element is either Metal or Not-metal.
Now if it be metal, we know that it is by the premise
an element ; we should thus be supposing that the very
same thing is an element and a not-element, which is
in opposition to the Law of Contradiction. According to
the only other alternative, then, the not-element must be
a not-metaL
