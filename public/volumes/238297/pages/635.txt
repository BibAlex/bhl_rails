THE USE OF HYPOTHESIS. 145
difficulties of conception. We are asked by physical
philosophers to give up all our ordinary prepossessions,
and believe that the interstellar space which seemed so
empty is not empty at all, but filled with something
immensely more solid and elastic than steel. As Dr.
Young himself remarked f , * the luminiferous ether, per-
vading all space, and penetrating almost all substances, is
not only highly elastic, but absolutely solid ! ! ! ' Sir John
Herschel has calculated the amount of force which may be
supposed, according to the undulatory theory of light, to
be exerted at each point in space, and finds it to be
1,148,000,000,000 times the elastic force of ordinary air at
the earth's surface, so that the pressure of the ether upon
a square inch of surface must be about 17,000,000,000,000,
or seventeen billions of pounds s. Yet we live and move
without appreciable resistance through this medium, in-
definitely harder and more elastic than adamant. All our
ordinary notions must be laid aside in contemplating such
an hypothesis ; yet they are no more than the observed
phenomena of light and heat force us to accept. We
cannot deny even the strange suggestion of Dr. Young,
that there may be independent worlds, some possibly
existing in different parts of space, but others perhaps
pervading each other unseen and unknown in the same
space h . For if we are bound to admit the conception of
this adamantine firmament, it is equally easy to admit a
plurality of such. We see, then, that mere difficulties of
conception must not in the least discredit a theory which
otherwise agrees with facts, and we must only reject
hypotheses which are inconceivable in the sense of break-
ing distinctly the primary laws of thought and nature.
