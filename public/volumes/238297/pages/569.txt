We need to take great care that in simplifying u
problem we' do not overlook some circumstance which
from peculiar mathematical conditions is of importance.
Thus in experiments upon the density of the earth we
may treat irregularities of its contour as producing in-
considerable effects. But a like assumption must not be
made concerning irregularities in the strata of the earth
at a short distance below the point of experiment s.
Such is the purely approximate character of all our
operations that it is not uncommon to find the theo-
retically worse method giving truer results than the theo-
retically perfect method. The common pendulum which
is not isochronous is better for practical purposes than the
cycloidal pendulum which is isochronous in theory, but
subject to mechanical difficulties. The spherical form is
not the correct form for a speculum or lense, but it differs
so slightly from the true form, and is so much more easily
produced mechanically, that it is generally best to rest
content with the spherical surface. Even in a six-feet
mirror the difference between the parabola arid the sphere
is only about - - of an inch, a thickness which would

ingenious parallel motion was intended to produce recti-
linear movement of the piston rod. In reality the motion
was always curvilinear, but a certain part of the curve
approximated sufficiently for his purposes to a straight
line.
Approximation to Exact Laws.
Though we can never prove any numerical law with
perfect accuracy, it would be a great mistake to suppose
