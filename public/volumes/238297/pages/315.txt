THE INDUCTIVE OR INVERSE METHOD. 289
is the near approximation of all the orbits of the planets
to a common plane. Daniel Bernouilli roughly estimated
the probability of such an agreement arising from accident
at r^o, the greatest inclination of any orbit to the sun's
equator being i-i2th part of a quadrant. Laplace de-
voted to this subject some of his most ingenious investi-
gations. He found the probability that the sum of the
inclinations of the planetary orbits would not exceed by
accident the actual amount ('914187 of a right angle for
the ten planets known in 1801) to be ~ ("9 141 87), or
about "00000011235. This probability may be combined
with that derived from the direction of motion, and it
then becomes immensely probable that the constitution of
the planetary system arose out of uniform conditions, or,
as we say, from some common cause".
If the same kind of calculation be applied to the orbits
of comets the result is very different y. Of the orbits
which have been determined 48*9 per cent, only are direct
or in the same direction as the planetary motions z . Hence
it becomes apparent that comets do not properly belong
to the solar system, and it is probable that they are stray
portions of nebulous matter which have become accidently
attached to the system by the attractive powers of the
sun or Jupiter.
