EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE, EXPLANATION, Ac. 181
Chemistry, although to a great extent an empirical
science, has not been without prophetical triumphs. The
existence of the metals potassium and sodium was fore-
seen by Lavoisier, and their elimination by Davy was one
of the chief experimenta crucis which established Lavoi-
sier's system. The existence of many other metals which
eye had never seen was almost a necessary inference, and
theory has not been found at fault. No sooner, too, had
a theory of organic compounds been conceived by Pro-
fessor A. W. Williamson than he foretold the formation of
a complex substance consisting of water in which both
atoms of hydrogen are replaced by atoms of acetyle. This
substance, known as the acetic anhydride, was afterwards
produced by Gerhardt. In the subsequent progress of
organic chemistry occurrences of this kind have been mul-
tiplied almost indefinitely. The theoretical chemist by
the classification of his specimens and the manipulation
of his formulas can plan out as it were the creation of
whole series of unknown oils, acids, alcohols, and such
like products, just as a designer might draw out a multi-
tude of patterns. The formation of many such substances
is a matter of course, but there is an interesting predic-
tion given by Hofmann, concerning the possible existence
of new compounds of sulphur and selenium, and even
oxides of ammonium, which it remains for the future to
verify 6 .
Prediction by Inversion of Cause and Effect.
There is one process of experiment which has so often
led to important discoveries as to deserve separate de-
scription and illustration I mean the inversion of Cause
and Effect. Thus if A and B in one experiment produce
C as a consequent, then antecedents of the nature of B
