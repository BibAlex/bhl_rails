In all calculations concerning the average rate of
progress of a community, or any of its operations, the
geometric mean should be employed. For if a quantity
increases 100 per cent, in 100 years, it would not on the
average increase 10 per cent, in each ten years, as the
10 per cent, would at the end of each decade be calculated
upon larger and larger quantities, and give at the end of
100 years much more than 100 per cent., in fact as much
as 159 per cent. The true mean rate in each decade
would be l ^/2~ or about 1-07, that is, the increase
would be about 7 per cent, in each ten years. But
when the quantities differ but little, the arithmetic and
geometric means are approximately the same. Thus the
arithmetic mean of rooo and rooi is 1*0005, an d tne
geometric mean is about 1-0004998, the difference being
of an order inappreciable in almost all scientific or prac-
tical processes. Even in the comparison of standard weights
by Gauss' method of transposition the arithmetic mean may
usually be substituted for the geometric mean which is
the true result.
Regarding the mean in the absence of express qualifica-
tion to the contrary as the common arithmetic mean, we
must still distinguish between its two uses where it
defines with more or less accuracy and probability a
really existing quantity, and where it acts as a mere
representative of other quantities. If I make many
experiments to determine the specific gravity of a homo-
geneous piece of gold there is a certain definite ratio
which I wish to approximate to, and the mean of my
separate results will, in the absence of any reasons to the
contrary, be the most probable approximate result. When
we determine on the other hand the mean density of the
