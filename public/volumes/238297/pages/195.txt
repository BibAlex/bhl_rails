moment, that our most careful inferences can be fulfilled.
All predictions, all inferences which reach beyond their
data, are purely hypothetical, and proceed on the assump-
tion that new events will conform to the conditions
detected in our observation of past events. No experience
of finite duration can be expected to give an exhaustive
knowledge of all the forces which are in operation. There
is thus a double uncertainty ; even supposing the Uni-
verse as a whole to proceed unchanged, we do not really
know the Universe as a whole. Comparatively speaking
we know only a point in its infinite extent, and a moment
in its infinite duration. We cannot be sure, then, that our
observations have not escaped some fact, which will cause
the future to be apparently different from the past ; nor
can we be sure that the future really will be the outcome
of the past. We proceed then in all our inferences to
unexamined objects and times on the assumptions
1 . That our past observation gives us a complete know-
ledge of what exists.
2. That the conditions of things which did exist will
continue to be the conditions of things which will
exist.
We shall often need to illustrate the character of our
knowledge of nature by the simile of a ballot-box, so
often employed by mathematical writers in the theory of
probability. Nature is to us like an infinite ballot-box,
the contents of which are being continually drawn, ball
after ball, and exhibited to us. Science is but the careful
observation of the succession in which balls of various
character usually present themselves ; we register the
combinations, notice those which seem to be excluded from
occurrence, and from the proportional frequency of those
which usually appear we infer the probable character of
future drawings. But under such circumstances certainty
of prediction depends on two conditions :
