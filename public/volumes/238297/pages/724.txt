234 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
' In the course of investigation, I have found myself
compelled to relinquish some preconceived notions ; but
I have not abandoned them hastily, nor, till after a
warm and obstinate defence, I was driven from every

Faraday's life, again, furnishes most interesting illustra-
tions of this tenacity of the philosophical mind. Though
so candid in rejecting some of his theories, there were others
to which he clung through everything. One of his most
favourite notions was finally realised in a brilliant dis-
covery ; another remains in doubt to the present day.
The Philosophic Character of Faraday.
In Faraday's researches concerning the connexion of
magnetism and light, we find an excellent instance of the
pertinacity with which a favourite theory may be held
and pursued, so long as the results of experiment are
simply nugatory and do not clearly negative the notions
entertained. In purely quantitative questions, as we have
seen, the absence of apparent effect can seldom be regarded
as proving the absence of all effect. Now Faraday was
convinced that some mutual relation must exist between
magnetism and light. As early as 1822 he attempted to
produce an effect upon a ray of polarized light, by passing
it through water placed between the poles of a voltaic
battery ; but he was obliged to record that not the slight-
est effect was observable. During forty subsequent years
the subject, we are told f , rose again and again to his mind,
and no failure could make him relinquish his search after
this unknown relation. It was in the year 1845 that he
