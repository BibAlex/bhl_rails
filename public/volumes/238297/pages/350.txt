for instance, that we are investigating the solution of some
salt in water. The first is a purely logical question : Is
there solution, or is there not \ Assuming the answer to
be in the affirmative, we next inquire, Does the solubility
vary with the temperature, or not 1 In all probability
some variation will be found to exist, and we shall have
at the same time an answer to the further question,
Does the quantity dissolved increase, or does it diminish
with the temperature \ In by far the greatest number of
cases salts and substances of all kinds dissolve more freely
the higher the temperature of the water, but there are a
few salts, such as calcium sulphate, which follow the
opposite rule. A considerable number of salts resemble
sodium sulphate in becoming more soluble up to a certain
temperature, and then varying in the opposite direction.
We next require to assign the amount of variation as
compared with that of the temperature, assuming at first
that the increase of solubility is proportional to the in-
crease of temperature. Common salt is an instance of
very slight variation, and potassium nitrate of very con-
siderable increase with temperature. Very accurate ob-
servations will probably show, however, that the simple
law of proportionate variation is only approximately true,
and some more complicated law involving the second,
third, or higher powers of the temperature may ultimately
be established. All these investigations have to be
carried out for each salt separately, since no distinct prin-
ciples by which we may infer from one substance to
another have yet been detected. There is still an in-
definite field for further research open ; for the solubility
of salts would probably vary with the pressure under
which the medium is placed ; the presence of other salts
already dissolved may have effects yet unknown. The
researches already effected as regards the solvent power of
water must be repeated as regards alcohol, ether, carbon
