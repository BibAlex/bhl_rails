pendulum, and the principle of repetition already described
(pp. 339, 353). As regards short intervals of time, it has
already been stated that Sir George Airy was able to
estimate a difference of i\ seconds per day, between two
pendulums with an uncertainty of less than '01 of a second,
or one part in 8,640,000, an exactness, as he truly remarks,
' almost beyond conception 11 '. The ratio between the mean
solar and the sidereal day, too, is known to about one part
in one hundred millions, or to the eighth place of decimals
(P- 337)-
Determinations of weight seem to come next in exact-
ness, owing to the fact that repetition without error is
applicable to them (p. 340). An ordinary good balance
should show about one part in 500,000 of the load x . The
finest balance employed by M. Stas, turned with of a
iJj)
milligramne, when loaded with 2 5 grammes in each pan,
that is, with one part in 825,000 of the load v . But balances
have certainly been constructed to show one part in a
million 2 , and Eamsden is commonly said to have con-
structed a balance for the Eoyal Society, to indicate one
part in seven millions, though this is hardly credible.
Professor Clerk Maxwell takes it for granted that one
part in five millions can be detected, but we ought to
discriminate between what a balance can do when first
constructed, and when in continuous use.
Determinations of lengths, unless performed with extra-
ordinary care, are open to much error in the junction of
the measuring bars. Even in measuring the base iine of
a trigonometrical survey, the accuracy generally attained
is only that of about one part in 60,000, or an inch in the
