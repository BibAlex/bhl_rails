48 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
less amount than these must exist, and we should state
our negative result with corresponding caxition. We can
only disprove the existence of a quantitative phenomenon
by showing deductively, from the laws of nature, that if
present it would amount to a perceptible quantity. As
in the case of other negative arguments (vol. ii. p. 19) we
must demonstrate that the effect would appear, where it-
is by experiment found not to appear.
Limits of Experiment.
It will be obvious that there are many operations of
nature which we are quite incapable of imitating in our
experiments. Our object is to study the conditions under
which a certain effect is produced ; but one of those con-
ditions may involve a great length of time. There are
instances on record of experiments extending over five or
ten years, and even over a large part of a lifetime ; but
such intervals of time are almost nothing to the time
during which nature may have been at work. The con-
tents of a mineral vein in Cornwall may have been under-
going gradual change for a million years or more. All
metamorphic rocks have doubtless endured high tempera-
ture and enormous pressure for almost inconceivable
periods of time, so that chemical geology is generally
beyond the scope of experiment.
Arguments have been continually brought against
Darwin's theory, founded upon the absence of any clear
instance of the production of a new species. During
an historical period of perhaps four thousand years, no
animal, it is said, has been so much domesticated as to
become different in species. It might as well be argued,
as it seems to me, that no geological changes are taking
place, because no new mountain has risen in Great Britain
within the memory of man. Our actual experience of
