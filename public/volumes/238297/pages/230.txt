letters, of which four are i's, two a's, and two 's, the
number of distinct arrangements will be found by
dividing the factorial of 14, by the factorials of 4, 2,.
and 2, the result being 908,107,200. From the letters

Calculation of Number of Combinations.
Although in many questions both of art and science
we need to calculate the number of permutations on
account of their own interest, it far more frequently
happens in scientific subjects that they possess but an
indirect interest. As I have already pointed out, we
almost always deal in the logical and mathematical
sciences with combinations, and variety of order enters
only through the inherent imperfections of our symbols
and modes of calculation. Signs must be used in some
order, and we must withdraw our attention from this order
before the signs correctly represent the relations of things
which exist neither before nor after each other. Now, it
often happens that we cannot choose all the combinations
of things, without first choosing them subject to the
accidental variety of order, and we must then divide by
the number of possible variations of order, that we may
get to the true number of pure combinations.
Suppose that we wish to determine the number of
ways in which we can select three letters out of the
alphabet, without allowing the same letter to be repeated.
At the first choice we can take any one of 26 letters ; at
the next step there remain 25 letters, anyone of which
may be joined with that already taken ; at the third step
there will be 24 choices, so that apparently the whole
