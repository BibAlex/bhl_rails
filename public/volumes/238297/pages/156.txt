130 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
2. The more immediate importance of the machine
seems to consist in the unquestionable proof which it
affords that most comprehensive views of the principles
of reasoning have now been attained, although they were
almost wholly unknown to Aristotle and his followers.
The time must come when the inevitable results of the
admirable writings of the late Dr. Boole must be re-
cognised at their true value, and the plain and palpable
form in which the machine presents those results will,
I hope, hasten the time. Undoubtedly his life marks
an era in the high science of human reason. It may
seem strange that it had remained for him first to set
forth in its full extent the problem of logic, but I am
not aware that any one before him had treated logic
as a symbolic method for evolving from any premises
the description of any class whatsoever as defined by
those premises. His quasi-mathematical system indeed
could not be regarded as a final and complete solution
of the problem. Not only did it require the manipula-
tion of mathematical symbols in a very intricate and
perplexing manner, but the results when obtained were
devoid of demonstrative force, because they turned upon
the employment of unintelligible symbols, acquiring mean-
ing only by analogy. I have also pointed out that he
imported into his system a condition concerning the
exclusive nature of alternatives (p. 83), which is not
necessarily true of logical terms. I shall have to show
in the next chapter that logic is really the basis of
the whole science of mathematical reasoning, so that
Boole completely inverted the true order of proof
when he proposed to infer logical truths by algebraic
processes. It is a wonderful evidence of his mental
power that by methods fundamentally false he should
have succeeded in reaching true conclusions and widen-
ing the sphere of reason.
