the perfect gas with infinitely distant particles x .
Mathematical Principles of Approximation.
The whole subject of the approximate character of
physical science will be rendered more plain if we con-
sider it from a general mathematical point of view.
Throughout quantitative investigations we deal with the
relation of one quantity to certain other quantities, of
which it is a function ; but the subject is quite sufficiently
complicated if we view one quantity as a function of
one other. Now, as a general rule, a function can be
developed or expressed as the sum of certain other quanti-
ties, the values of which depend upon the successive
powers of the variable quantity. Thus, if y be the one
quantity which is regarded as a function of x, then we
may say that
7/ = A + Bx-fCx 2 + Da 3 + Ea 4 +
In this equation, A, B, C, D, &c., are fixed quantities, of
different values in different cases. The terms may be
infinite in number or after a time may cease to have any
value. Any of the co-efficients A, B, C, &c., may be
zero or negative ; but whatever they may be they are
fixed. The quantity x on the other hand may be made
what we like, being variable at our will. Suppose, in the
first place, that x and y are both measurable lengths. Let
us assume that 10> 1 000 part of an inch is the least that we
can take note of. Then when x is one hundredth of an
inch, we have x 2 = 10 * 000 , and if C be less than unity,
the term C x 2 will be inappreciable, being less than we
