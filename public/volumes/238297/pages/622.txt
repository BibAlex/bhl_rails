132 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
inductive method, it would direct us to make an ex-
haustive arrangement of facts in all possible orders.
Given a certain number of specimens in a museum, we
might arrive at the best possible classification by going
systematically through all possible classifications, and,
were we endowed with infinite time and patience, this
would be an effective methjod. It doubtless is the method
by which the first few simple steps are taken in every
incipient branch of science. Before the dignified name
of science is applicable, some coincidences will chance
to force themselves upon the attention. Before there
was a science of meteorology, or any comprehension of the
true conditions of the atmosphere, all observant persons
learned to associate a peculiar clearness of the atmosphere
with coming rain, and a colourless sunset with fine
weather. Knowledge of this kind is called empirical, as
seeming to come directly from experience ; and there is
doubtless a considerable portion of our knowledge which
must always bear this character.
We may be obliged to trust to the casual detection
of coincidences in those branches of knowledge where
we are deprived of the aid of any guiding notions ; but
a very little reflection will show the utter insufficiency
of haphazard experiment, when applied to investigations
of a complicated nature. At the best, it will be the
simple identity, or partial identity, of classes, as illus-
trated in pp. 146-154 of the first volume, which can
be thus detected. It was pointed out that, even when
a law of nature involves only two circumstances, and
there are one hundred distinct circumstances which may
possibly be connected, there will be no less than 4950
pairs of circumstances between which a coincidence may
exist. When a law involves three or more circum-
stances, the possible number of coincidences becomes
vastly greater still. When considering, again, the subject
