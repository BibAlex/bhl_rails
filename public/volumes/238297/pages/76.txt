50 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
This formula expresses that the class A is identical
with the class AB ; and as the latter must be a part at
least of the class B, it implies the inclusion of the class A
in that of B, Thus we might represent our former ex-
ample thus
Mammalia = Mammalian vertebrata.
This proposition asserts identity between a part of the
vertebrata and the mammalia. If it is asked What part 1
the proposition affords no answer except that it is the
part which is mammalian ; but the assertion * mammalia =
some vertebrata' tells us no more.
It is quite likely that some readers may think this
mode of representing the universal affirmative proposition
of the old logic artificial and complicated. I will not
undertake to convince them of the opposite at this point
of the system. My justification for it will be found, not
in the immediate treatment of this proposition, but in
the general harmony which it enables us to discover
between all parts of reasoning. I have no doubt that
this is the point of critical difficulty in the relation of
logical to other forms of reasoning. Grant this mode
of denoting that * all A's are B's, ? and I fear no further
difficulties ; refuse it, and we find want of analogy and
endless complication in every direction. For instance
Aristotle, in accepting inclusion of class in class as
the fundamental relation of logic, was at once obliged
to ignore the existence of the very extensive and all-
important class of propositions denoting the similarity
of one thing with another. It is on general grounds
that I hope to show overwhelming reasons for seeking
to reduce every kind of proposition to the form of an
identity.
I may add that not a few previous logicians have
accepted this view of the universal affirmative proposition.
Boole often employed this mode of expression, and
