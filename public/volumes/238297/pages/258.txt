232 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
We must distinguish comparative from absolute pro-
babilities. In drawing a card casually from a pack, there
is no reason to expect any one card more than a.ny other.
Now, there are four kings and four queens in a pack, so that
there are just as many ways of drawing one as the other,
and the probabilities are equal. But there are thirteen
diamonds, so that the probability of a king is to that of
a diamond as four to thirteen. Thus the probabilities
of each are proportional to their respective numbers of
ways of happening. Now, I can draw a king in four
ways, and not draw one in forty-eight, so that the pro-
babilities are in this proportion, or, as is commonly said,
the odds against drawing a king are forty-eight to four.
The odds are seven to seventeen in favour, or seventeen
to seven against the letters R,o,m,a, accidentally forming
a significant word. The odds are five to three against
two tails appearing in three throws of a penny. Con-
versely, when the odds of an event are given, and the
probability is required, take the number in favour of the
event for numerator, and the sum of the numbers for
denominator.
It is obvious that an event is certain when all the
combinations of causes which can take place produce
that event. Now, if we were to represent the pro-
bability of any such event according to our rule, it would
give the ratio of some number to itself, or unity. An
event is certain not to happen when no possible combina-
tion of causes gives the event, and the ratio by the same
rule becomes that of o to some number. Hence it follows
that in the theory of probability certainty is expressed
by i, and impossibility by o ; but no mystical meaning
should be attached to these symbols, as they merely
express the fact that all or no possible combinations give
the event.
By a compound event, we mean an event which may be
