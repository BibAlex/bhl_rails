in perfect community, none before nor after the others.
In our words and symbols we cannot observe this natural
condition ; we must name one quality first and another
second, just as some one must be the first to sign a petition,
or to walk foremost in a procession. In nature there is
no such precedence.
A little reflection will show that knowledge in the
highest perfection would consist in the simultaneous
possession of a multitude of facts. To comprehend a
science perfectly we should have every fact present with
every other fact. We must write a book and we must
read it successively word by word, but how infinitely
higher would be our powers of thought if we could
grasp the whole in one collective act of consciousness.
Compared with the brutes we do possess some slight
approximation to such power, and it is just conceivable
that in the indefinite future mind may acquire a vast
increase of capacity, and be less restricted to the piece-
meal examination of a subject. But I wish here to
make plain that there is no logical foundation for the
successive character of thought and reasoning unavoidable
under our present mental conditions. The fact that we
must think of one thing first, and another second, is a"
logical weakness and imperfection. We must describe
metal as ' hard and opaque/ or ' opaque and hard/ but
in the metal itself there is no such difference of order ;
the properties are simultaneous and coextensive in
existence.
Setting aside aU grammatical peculiarities which render
a substantive less moveable than an adjective, and dis-

order of words, we may state, as a general law of logic,
that AB is identical with BA.
AB=BA
