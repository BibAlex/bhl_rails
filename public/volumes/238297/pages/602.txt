112 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
rule by which from any regular series of observations we
may, on the principle of the method of least squares,
calculate out with a moderate amount of labour a formula
expressing the variation of the quantity observed, in the
most probable manner. In meteorology three or four
terms are usually sufficient for representing any periodic
phenomenon, but the calculation might be carried to any
higher degree of accuracy. As the details of the process
have been described by Sir John Herschel in his admirable
treatise on Meteonlogy f , I need not further enter into
them.
The reader might be tempted to think that in these
processes of calculation we have an infallible method of
discovering inductive laws, and that my previous state-
ments (Chap. VII.) as to the purely tentative and inverse
character of the inductive process are negatived. Were
there indeed any general method of inferring laws from
facts it would overturn my statement, but it must be
carefully observed that these empirical formulae do not
coincide with natural laws. They are only approximations
to the results of natural laws founded upon the general
principles of approximation. It has already been pointed
out that however complicated be the nature of a curve
we may examine so small a portion of it, or we may ex-
amine it with such rude means of measurement, that its
divergence from an elliptic curve will not be apparent.
As a still ruder approximation a portion of a straight line
will always serve our purpose ; but if we need higher pre-
cision a curve of the third or fourth degree will almost
certainly be sufficient. Now empirical formulae really re-
present these approximate curves, but they give us no
information as to the precise nature of the curve itself to
which we are approximating. In another mode of ex-
pression we may say that we do not learn what function
