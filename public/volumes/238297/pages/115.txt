DISJUNCTIVE PROPOSITIONS. 89
Various Forms of the Disjunctive Proposition.
Disjunctive propositions may occur in a great variety of
forms, of which the old logicians took very insufficient
notice. There may be any number of alternatives each of
which may be a combination of any number of simple
terms, A proposition, again, may be disjunctive in one
or both members. The proposition
Solids or liquids or gases are electrics or conductors of
electricity
is an example of the doubly disjunctive form. The mean-
ing of any such proposition is that whatever falls under
any one or more alternatives on one side must fall under
one or more alternatives on the other side. From what
has been said before, it is apparent that the proposition
A | B = C | D
will correspond to
ab = cd,
each member of the latter being the negative of a
member of the former proposition.
As an instance of a complex disjunctive proposition
I may give Senior's definition of wealth, namely * Wealth
is what is transferable, limited in supply, and either
productive of pleasure or preventive of pain s.'
Let A = wealth
B == transferable
C = limited in supply
D = productive of pleasure
E = preventive of pain.
The definition takes the form
A = BC(D! E);
but if we develop the alternatives by a method to be
afterwards more fully considered, it becomes
A = BODE |- BCDe-h BCdE.
