398 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
of objects into two distinct parts, and each part may be
sub-divided successively by any prominent and well
marked circumstance which is present in a large part of
the genus and not in the other. To refer an object to its
proper place in such an arrangement we have only to note
whether it does or does not possess the successsive critical
circumstances. Dana devised a classification of this kind z
by which to refer any crystal to its place in the series of
six or seven classes already described. If a crystal has all
its edges modified alike or the angles replaced by three or
six similar planes, it belongs to the monometric system ;
if not, we observe whether the number of similar planes
at the extremity of the crystal is three or some multiple
of three, in which case it is a crystal of the hexagonal
system ; and so we proceed with further successive dis-
criminations.
To ascertain the name of a mineral by examination with
the blow-pipe, an arrangement more or less evidently on
the bifurcate plan, has been laid down by Von Kobell a .
Minerals are divided according as they possess or do not
possess metallic lustre ; as they are fusible (including
under fusible substances those which are volatile) or not
fusible in a determinate degree, according as they do or
do not on charcoal give a metallic bead, and so on.
Perhaps the best example to be found of any arrange-
ment simply devised for the purpose of diagnosis, is
