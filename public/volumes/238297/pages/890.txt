slum, and then observing whether it has all the principal
qualities belonging to potassium. He selects from among
the whole number of compounds of potassium that salt,
namely the compound of platinum tetra-chloride and
potassium chloride, which has the most distinctive ap-
pearance, as it is comparatively insoluble and produces
a peculiar yellow and highly crystalline precipitate. Ac-
cordingly whenever this precipitate can be produced by
adding platinum chloride to a solution potassium is pre-
sent. The fine purple or violet colour which potassium
salts usually communicate to the blowpipe flame, had
long been used as a characteristic mark. Some other
elements were readily detected by the colouring of the
blowpipe flame, barium giving a pale yellowish green,
and salts of strontium a bright red. By the use of the
spectroscope the coloured light given off by any incan-
descent vapour is made to give perfectly characteristic
marks of the elements contained in the vapour.
Diagnosis seems to be identical with the process termed
by the ancient logicians abscissio infiniti, the cutting off
of the infinite or negative part of a classification when we
discover by observation that an object possesses a par-
ticular property. At every step in a bifurcate division,
some objects possessing the difference will fall into the
affirmative part or species ; all the remaining objects in
the world fall into the negative part which will be infinite
in extent. Diagnosis consists in the successive rejection
from further notice of those almost infinite classes with
which the specimen in question does not agree.
Index Classifications.
Under the general subject of classification we may
certainly include all arrangements of objects or names,
which we make for the purpose of saving labour in the-
