CHARACTER OF THE EXPERIMENTALIST. 239
conclusive/ In this position the question remains to the
present day ; it may be that the effect was too slight to
be detected, or it may be that the arrangments adopted
were not suited to develope the particular relation which
exists, just as Oersted could not detect electro-magnetism,
so long as his wire was perpendicular to the plane of
motion of his needle. But these are not matters which
concern us further here. We have only to notice the pro-
found conviction in the unity of natural laws, the active
powers of inference and imagination, the unbounded licence
of theorizing, combined above all with the utmost dili-
gence in experimental verification which this remarkable
research manifests.
Reservation of Judgment.
There is yet another characteristic needed in the
philosophic mind ; it is that of suspending judgment
when the data are insufficient. Many people will express
a confident opinion on almost any question which is put
before them, but they thereby manifest not strength, but
weakness and narrowness of mind. To see all sides of a
complicated subject, and to weigh all the different facts
and probabilities correctly, may require no ordinary
powers of comprehension. Hence it is most frequently
the philosophic mind which is in doubt, and the ignorant
mind which is ready with a positive decision. Faraday
has himself said, in a very interesting lecture*, ' Occa-
sionally and frequently the exercise of the judgment
ought to end in absolute reservation. It may be very
distasteful, and great fatigue, to suspend a conclusion ;
but as we are not infallible, so we ought to be cautious ;
we shall eventually find our advantage, for the man who
