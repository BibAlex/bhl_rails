ANALOGY. 303
1 i ) Be found to exist ;
(2) May seem not to exist, but nevertheless may really
exist ;
(3) May actually be non-existent.
In the second case the failure is only apparent, and
arises from our obtuseness of perception, the smallness
of the phenomenon to be noticed, or the disguised cha-
racter in which it appears. I have already pointed out
that the analogy of sound and light seems to fail because
light does not bend round a corner, the fact being that it
does so bend in the phenomena of diffraction, which
present the effect, however, .in such an unexpected and
minute form, that even Newton was misled, and turned
from the correct hypothesis of undulations which he had
partially entertained.
In the third class of cases analogy fails us altogether,
and we expect that to exist which really does not exist.
Thus we fail to discover the phenomena of polarization in
sound travelling through the atmosphere, since air is not
capable of any appreciable transverse undulations. These
failures of analogy are of peculiar interest, because they
make the mind aware of its superior powers. There have
been many philosophers who said that we can conceive
nothing in the intellect which we have not previously
received through the senses. This is true in the sense
that we cannot image them to the mind in the concrete
form of a shape or a colour ; but we can speak of them and
reason concerning them ; in short, we often know them
in everything but a sensuous manner. Accurate investi-
gation shows that all material substances retard the
motion of bodies through them by substracting energy
by impact. By the law of continuity we can frame the
notion of a vacuous space in which there is no resistance
whatever, nor need we stop there ; for we have only to
proceed by analogy to the case where a medium should
