118 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Fallacies analysed by the Indirect Method.
It has been sufficiently shown, perhaps, that we can by
the Indirect Method of Inference extract the whole truth
from any series of propositions, and exhibit it anew in any
required form of conclusion. But it may also need to be
shown by examples that so long as we follow correctly
the almost mechanical rules of the method, we cannot fall
into any of the common fallacies or paralogisms which are
not seldom committed in ordinary discussion. Let us
take the example of a fallacious argument, previously
treated by the Method of Direct Inference (p. 75),
Granite is not a sedimentary rock, ( i )
Basalt is not a sedimentary rock, (2)
and let us ascertain whether any precise conclusion can be
drawn concerning the relation of granite and basalt.
Taking as before
A = granite,
B = sedimentary rock,
C = basalt,
the premises become A = Kb, (i)
C ='Cb. , (2)
Of the eight conceivable combinations of A, B, C, five agree
with these conditions, namely
A6C aBc
Abe abC
abc ;
the description of granite is found to be
A = A6C -I- Abc = A.b(G -I- c),
that is, granite is not a sedimentary rock but is either
basalt or not-basalt. If we want a description of basalt
the answer is of like form
G = A6C [ abC = bC (A | a).
Basalt is a sedimentary rock, and either granite or not-
granite. As it is already perfectly evident that basalt
