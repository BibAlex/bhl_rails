168 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Transition from Perfect to Imperfect Induction.
It is a question of profound difficulty on what grounds
we are warranted in inferring the future from the present,
or the nature of undiscovered objects from those which we
have examined with our senses. We pass from Perfect to
Imperfect Induction when once we allow our conclusion to
pass, at all events apparently, beyond the clata on which it
was founded. In making such a step we seem to gain a
nett addition to our knowledge ; for we learn the nature
of what was unknown. We reap where we have never
sown. We appear to possess the divine power of creating
knowledge, and reaching with our mental arms far beyond
the sphere of our own observation. I shall, indeed, have
to point out certain methods of reasoning in which we
do pass altogether beyond the sphere of the senses, and
acquire accurate knowledge which observation could never
have given; but it is not imperfect induction that ac-
complishes such a task. Of imperfect induction itself, I
venture to assert that it never makes any real addition to
our knowledge, in the meaning of the expression sometimes
accepted. As in other cases of inference it merely unfolds
the information contained in past observations or events ;
it merely renders explicit what was implicit in previous
experience. It transmutes knowledge, but certainly does
not create knowledge.
There is no fact which I shall more constantly keep
before the reader's mind in the following pages than that
the results of imperfect induction, however well authenti-
cated and verified, are never more than probable. We
never can be sure that the future will be as the present.
We hang ever upon the Will of the Creator : and it is only
so far as He has created two things alike, or maintains
the framework of the world unchanged from moment to
