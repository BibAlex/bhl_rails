452 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
general public into the fallacious notion that mathematics
is a perfect science, which accomplishes what it under-
takes in a complete manner. On the contrary, it may be
said that if a mathematical problem were selected by pure
chance out of the whole variety which might be proposed,
the probability is infinitely slight that a human mathe-
matician could solve it. Just as the numbers we can count
or frame to the mind are literally nothing compared with
the numbers which might exist, so the whole accomplish-
ments of a Laplace or a Lagrange are, as it were, the
little corner of the multiplication table, which has really
an indefinite extent.
I have sufficiently pointed out that the rude character
of all our observations prevents us from being aware of
the existence of the greater number of effects and actions
of nature. It must be added that, if we perceived them,
we should usually be incapable of including them in our
theories from want of mathematical power. Some persons
may be surprised that though nearly two centuries have
elapsed since the time of Newton's discoveries, we have
yet no general theory of molecular action. Some approxi-
mations have been made towards such a theory. Joule
and Clausius have measured the velocity of gaseous
atoms, or even determined the distance between the col-
lision of atom and atom. Sir W. Thomson has approxi-
mated to the number of atoms in a given bulk of sub-
stance. Rankine has formed some reasonable hypotheses
as to the actual constitution of atoms, but it would be a
mistake to suppose that these ingenious results of theory
and experiment form any appreciable approach to a com-
plete solution of molecular motions. There is every
reason to believe, judging from the spectra of the elements,
and from other reasons, that even chemical atoms are very
complicated structures. An atom of pure iron is probably
a vastly more complicated system than that of the planets
