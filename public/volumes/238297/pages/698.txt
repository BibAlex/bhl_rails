heavenly bodies. Physicists have accordingly bestowed
a great amount of labour upon the exact estimation of
this density, consisting in the exact comparison of the
gravity of the whole globe with the gravity of some se-
lected body of matter, of which the mass, or what comes
to the same thing, the density compared with water, is
known more or less exactly. But this body of matter may
be variously chosen ; it may consist of a heavy bah 1 of
lead, or a mountain, or a portion of the earth's strata, and
the methods of experiment are so very different in these
different cases that they may be regarded as giving entirely
independent results.
The mutual gravitation of two balls, or other small
objects at the earth's surface, is so exceedingly small com-
pared with their gravitation towards the immense mass
of the earth, that it is usually quite imperceptible, and
although asserted by Newton to exist, on the ground of
theory, was never detected until the end of the i8th
century. Michell attached two small balls to the ex-
tremities of a delicately suspended torsion balance, and
then bringing heavy balls of lead alternately to each side
of these small balls was able to detect a certain slight
deflection of the torsion balance, which was a new verifi-
cation of the theory of gravitation. Cavendish carried
out the experiment with more care, and by estimating
the actual gravitation of the balls by treating the torsion
balance as a pendulum, and then taking into account the
respective distances of the balls from each other and from
the centre of the earth, was able to assign 5*48 (or as re-
computed by Baily, 5*448) as the probable mean density
of the earth. Newton's sagacious guess to the effect that
the density of the earth was between five and six times
that of water, was thus remarkably confirmed. The
same kind of experiment repeated by Reich gave 5 '438.
