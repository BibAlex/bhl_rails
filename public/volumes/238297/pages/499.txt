OBSER VA TWN.
It is now apparent that what we call light is the affection
of the eye by certain vibrations, the less rapid of which
are invisible and constitute the dark rays of radiant heat,
in detecting which we must substitute the thermometer or
the thermopile for the eye. At the other end of the
spectrum, again, the ultra-violet rays are invisible, and
only indirectly brought to our knowledge in the pheno-
mena of fluorescence or photo-chemical action. There is
no reason to believe that at either end of the spectrum an
absolute limit ha,s yet been reached.
Just as our knowledge of the stellar universe is limited
by the power of the telescope and other conditions, so our
knowledge of the minute world has its limit in the powers
and optical conditions of the microscope. There was a
time when it would have been a reasonable induction that
vegetables were motionless, and animals alone endowed
with power of locomotion. We are astonished to dis-
cover by the microscope that minute plants are if any-
thing more active than minute animals. We even find
that mineral substances seem to lose their inactive
character and dance about with incessant motion when
reduced to sufficiently minute particles, at least when sus-
pended in a non-conducting medium f . Mioroscopists will
meet a natural limit to their means of observation when the
minuteness of the objects examined becomes comparable
to the length of light undulations, and the extreme diffi-
culty already encountered in determining the forms of
minute marks on Diatoms appears to be due to this cause.
Of the errors likely to arise in estimating quantities by
the senses I have already spoken (vol. i. p. 320), but there
are some cases in which we actually see things different
from what they are. A jet of water often appears to be
a continuous thread, when it is really a wonderfully or-
