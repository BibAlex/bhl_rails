RESULTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD. 431
appears to represent the probability that our inference
will be mistaken. I demur to the assumption that there
is any necessary truth even in such fundamental laws of
nature as the Indestructibility of Matter, the Conservation
of Force, or the Laws of Motion. Certain it is that men
of science have recognised the conceivability of other laws,
or even investigated their mathematical conditions. Sir
George Airy investigated the mathematical conditions of
a perpetual motion (vol. i. p. 256), and Laplace and New-
ton discussed various imaginary laws of forces incon-
sistent with those so far observed to operate in the
universe (vol. ii. pp. 304, 392).
The laws of nature, as I venture to regard them, are
simply general propositions concerning the correlation of
properties which have been observed to hold true of
bodies hitherto observed. On the assumption that our
experience is of adequate extent, and that no arbitrary
interference takes place, we are then able to assign the
probability, always less than certainty, that the next
object of the same apparent nature will conform to the
same law.
Infiniteness of the Universe.
We may safely accept as a satisfactory scientific hypo-
thesis the doctrine so grandly put forth by Laplace, who
asserted that a perfect knowledge of the universe, as it
existed at any given moment, would give a perfect know-
ledge of what was to happen thenceforth and for ever
after. Scientific inference is impossible, unless we may
regard the present as the necessary outcome of what is
past, and the necessary cause of what is to come. To
the view of Perfect Intelligence nothing is uncertain. The
astronomer can calculate the positions of the heavenly
bodies when thousands of generations of men shall have
