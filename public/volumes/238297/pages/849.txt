CLASSIFICATION. 359
Classification in Crystallography.
One of the most perfect and instructive instances of
classification which we can find is furnished by the science
of crystallography, already briefly noticed (vol. i. p. 153).
The system of arrangement now generally adopted is
conspicuously natural, and is even mathematically perfect.
A crystal consists in every part of similar molecules simi-
larly related to the adjoining molecules, and connected
with them by forces the nature of which we can only
learn by their apparent effects. But these forces are
exerted in space of three dimensions, so that there is a
limited number of suppositions which can be entertained
as to the relations of these forces. In one case each mole-
cule will be similarly related to all those which are next
to it ; in a second case, it will be similarly related to those
in a certain plane, but differently related to those not in
that plane. In the simpler cases the arrangement of
molecules is rectangular ; in the remaining cases oblique
either in one or two planes.
In order to simplify the explanation and conception of
the complicated phenomena which crystals exhibit, an
hypothesis has been invented which is an excellent illus-
tration of the class of Descriptive Hypotheses before men-
tioned (vol. ii. p. 153). Crystallographers imagine that
there are within each crystal certain axes, or lines of
direction, by the comparative length and the mutual
inclination of which the nature of the crystal is deter-
mined and recorded. In one somewhat exceptional class
of crystals there are three such axes lying in one plane,
and a fourth perpendicular to that plane ; but in all
the other classes there are imagined to be only three axes.
Now these axes can be varied in three ways as regards
