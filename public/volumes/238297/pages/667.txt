tion behindhand, the two portions would exactly neutralise
each other. This experiment has recently been performed
with success by Quincke and Konig*. The interference
arising between the waves from the two prongs of a
tuning-fork was also predicted by theory, and proved to
exist by Weber ; indeed it may be observed by merely
turning round a vibrating fork close to the ear u .
It is a plain result of the theory of sound that, if we
move rapidly towards a sounding body, or if it move, rapidly
towards us, the pitch of the sound will be a little more
acute ; and, vice versd, when the relative motion is in the
opposite direction, the pitch will be more grave. It arises
from the less or greater intervals of time between the
successive strokes of waves upon the auditory nerve,
according as the ear moves towards or from the source
of sound relatively speaking. This effect was predicted
by theory, and afterwards verified by the experiments of
M. Buys Ballot, on Dutch railways, and of Mr. Scott
llussell, in England x . Whenever, indeed, one railway
train passes another, on the locomotive of which the
whistle is being sounded, the drop in the acuteness of the
sound may be noticed at the moment of passing. This
change gives the sound a peculiar howling character, which
many persons must have noticed. I have calculated that,
with two trains travelling thirty miles an hour, the effect
would amount to rather more than half a tone, and it
would often amount to a tone. A corresponding effect is
produced in the case of light undulations, when the eye
and the luminous body rapidly approach or recede from
each other. It is shown by a slight change in the refrangi-
bility of the rays of light, and a consequent change in the
place of the lines of the spectrum, which has been made
to give most important and unexpected information con-
