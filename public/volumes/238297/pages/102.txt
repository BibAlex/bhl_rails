76 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
The reader will find it impossible by the rule of substitu-
tion to discover a relation between A and C. Three terms
occur in these premises, namely A, 6, and C ; but they
are so combined that no term occurring in one has its
exact equivalent stated in the other. No substitution
can therefore be made, and the principle holds true.
Fallacy is impossible.
It would be a mistake to suppose that the mere
occurrence of negative terms in both premises render
them incapable of yielding a conclusion. The old rules
of logic informed us that from two negative premises no
conclusion could be drawn, but it is a fact that the rule
in this bare form does not hold universally true ; and I
am not aware that any precise explanation has been
given of the conditions under which it is or is not
imperative. Consider the following example
Whatever is not metallic is not capable of power-
ful magnetic influence, (i)
Carbon is not metallic, (2)
Therefore, carbon is not capable of powerful mag-
netic influence. (3)
Here we have two distinctly negative premises (i) and
(2), and yet they yield a perfectly valid negative con-
clusion (3). The syllogistic rule is actually falsified in
its bare and general statement. In this and many other
cases we can convert the propositions into affirmative
ones which yield a conclusion. To show this let
A = carbon, B = metallic,
C = capable of powerful magnetic influence.
The premises readily take the form
b = be (i)
A = A6 f . (2)
and substitution for b in (2) by means of (i), gives the
conclusion
A = Kbc (3)
