148 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
phenomena to be compared are rare. Thus we prove
that all the musical concords coincide with all the more
simple numerical ratios, by showing that each concord
arises from a simple ratio of undulations, and then show-
ing that each simple ratio gives rise to one of the con-
cords. To examine all the possible cases of discord or
complex ratio of undulation would be impossible. By a
happy stroke of induction Sir John Herschel discovered
that all crystals of quartz which rotate the plane of polar-
ization of light are precisely those crystals which have
plagihedral faces, that is, oblique faces on the corners
of the prism unsymmetrical with the ordinary faces.
This singular relation would be proved by observing that
all plagihedral crystals possessed the power of rotation,
and vice versd all crystals possessing this power were
plagihedral. But it might at the same time be noticed
that -all ordinary crystals were devoid of the power.
There is no reason why we should not observe any of the
four propositions A = AB, B = AB, a = ab, b = ab, all of
which follow from A = B (see p. 133).
Sometimes the terms of the identity may be singular
objects ; thus we observe that diamond is a combustible
gem, and being unable to discover any other that is, we
affirm
Diamond = combustible gem,
In a similar manner we ascertain that
Mercury = metal liquid at ordinary temperatures,
Substance of least density = substance of least atomic
weight.
Two or three objects may occasionally enter into the
induction, as when we learn that
Sodium I potassium = metal of less density than
water,
Venus I Mercury I Mars = major -planet devoid of
satellites.
