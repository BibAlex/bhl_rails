EXCEPTIONAL PHENOMENA. 329
nothing to do but calculate as exactly as possible the
amount of interference, and make allowance for it; the
apparent failure of the law under examination should
then disappear. But in the second case the results may
be much more important. A phenomenon which entirely
fails to be explained by any known laws may indicate the
interference of some wholly new series of natural forces.
The ancients could not help perceiving that the general
tendency of bodies downwards failed in the case of the
loadstone, nor would the doctrine of essential lightness
explain the exception, since the substance drawn upwards
by the loadstone is a heavy metal. We now see clearly
that there was no breach in the perfect generality of the
law of gravity, but that a new form of energy manifested
itself in a conspicuous form in the loadstone for the first
time. In this case the forces concerned, those of gravity
and electrical attraction, have never yet been brought
into correlation with each other.
Other sciences show us that laws of nature, rigorously
true and exact, may often be developed by those who are
ignorant of far more complex phenomena involved in their
application. Newton's comprehension of geometrical
optics was sufficient to explain all the ordinary refractions
and reflections of light. The simple laws of the bending
of rays apply to all rays, whatever the character of the
undulations composing them. Newton suspected the
existence of other classes of phenomena when he spoke of
rays as having sides; but it remained for later experi-
mentalists to show that light is a transverse undulation,
like the bending of a rod or cord.
Dalton's atomic theory is doubtless true of all chemical
compounds, and the essence of it is that the same com-
pound will always be found to contain the same elements
in certain definite proportions. Pure calcium carbonate
contains 48 parts by weight of oxygen to 40 of calcium,
