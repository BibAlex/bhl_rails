THE LOGICAL MACHINE. 129
A = B except in the double form of A = AB and B = AB.
To work the proposition A = B it is therefore necessary to
.press the keys A (subj.), Copula, A (pred.), B (pred.), Full
stop, B (subj.), Copula, A (pred.), B (pred.), Full stop.
The same double operation will be necessary whenever
the proposition is not of the kind called a partial
identity (p. 47). Thus AB = CD, AB = AC, A = B! C,
A I B = C I D, all require to be read from both ends
separately. This is a remarkable fact which some per-
sons may consider as militating against the equational
form of proposition, but I do not think this is really
the case.
Before leaving the subject I may remark that these
mechanical devices are not likely to possess great prac-
tical utility. We do not require in common life to be
constantly solving complex logical questions. Even in
mathematical calculation the ordinary rules of arithmetic
are generally sufficient, and a calculating machine could
only be used with advantage in peculiar cases. But the
machine and abacus have nevertheless two important
uses.
i . I trust that the time is not very far distant when
the predominance of the ancient Aristotelian Logic will
be a matter of history, and the teaching of logic will
be placed on a footing more worthy of its supreme
importance. It will then be found that the solution of
logical questions is an exercise of mind at least as valu-
able and necessary as mathematical calculation. I believe
that these mechanical devices, or something of the same
kind, will then become useful for exhibiting to a class
of students a clear and visible analysis of logical problems
of any degree of complexity, the nature of each step
being rendered plain to the eye. For this purpose I
have already often used the machine or abacus in my
class lectures at the Owens College.
