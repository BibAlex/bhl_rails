226 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
event itself there can be no such uncertainty ; the steam-
vessel either has sunk or has not sunk, and no subsequent
discussion of the probable nature of the event can alter
the fact. Yet the probability of the event will really
vary from day to day, and from mind to mind, according
as the slightest information is gained regarding the vessels
met at sea, the weather prevailing there, the signs of
wreck picked up, or the previous condition of the vessel.
Probability thus belongs to our mental condition, to the
light in which we regard events, the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which is certain in themselves. Many
writers accordingly have asserted that probability is con-
cerned with degree or quantity of belief. De Morgan
says, b ' By degree of probability we really mean or ought
to mean degree of belief/ The late Professor Donkin
expressed the meaning of probability as 'quantity of
belief;' but I have never felt satisfied with such a defini-
tion of probability. The nature of belief is not more
clear to my mind than the notion it is used to define.
But an all-sufficient objection is, that the theory does not
measure what the belief is, but what it ought to be. Few '
minds think in close accordance with the theory, and
there are many cases of evidence in which the belief
existing is habitually different from what it ought to be.
Even if the state of belief in any mind could be measured
and expressed in figures, the results would be worthless.
The very value of the theory consists in correcting and
guiding our belief, and rendering our states of mind and
consequent actions harmonious with our knowledge of
exterior conditions.
This objection has been clearly perceived by some of
those who still used quantity of belief as a definition of
probability. Thus De Morgan adds ' Belief is but another
name for imperfect knowledge/ Professor Donkin has
b 'Formal Logic,' p. 172.
