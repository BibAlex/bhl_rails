OBSERVATION. 11
There long appeared to be a strong presumption that
all comets moved in elliptic orbits, because no comet had
been proved to move in any other kind of path. The
theory of gravitation admitted of the existence of comets
moving in hyperbolic orbits, and the question arose
whether they were really non-existant or were only
beyond the bounds of easy observation. From reason-
able suppositions Laplace calculated that the probability
was at least 6000 to i against a comet which comes
within the -planetary system sufficiently to be visible at
the earth's surface, presenting an orbit which could be
discriminated from a very elongated ellipse or parabola, in
the part of its orbit within the reach of our telescopes 11 .
In short, the chances are very much in favour of our
seeing elliptic rather than hyperbolic comets. Laplace's
views have been confirmed by the discovery of six hyper-
bolic comets, which appeared in the years 1729, 1771,
1774, 1818, 1840, and 1843!, and, as only about 800
comets altogether have been recorded, the proportion of
hyperbolic ones is quite as large as should be expected.
Some remarkable speculations have recently been pub-
lished by Mr. A. S. Davies, as to the probable character of
the orbits of comets, which, after moving freely through
*pace, become attached to this planetary system k .
When we attempt to estimate the numbers of objects
which may have existed, we must make large allowances
for the limited sphere of our observations. Thus pro-
bably not more than 4000 or 5000 comets have been
seen in historical times, but making allowance for the
absence of observers in the southern hemisphere, and
for the small probability that we see any considerable
