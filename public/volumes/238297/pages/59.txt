Abstract Terms.
Comparison of different objects,' arid analysis of the
complex resemblances and differences which they present,
lead us to the conception of abstract qualities. We learn
to think of one object as not only different from another,
but as differing in some particular point, such as colour,
or weight, or size. We may then convert points of
agreement or difference into separate objects of thought
called qualities, and denoted by abstract terms. Thus
the term redness means something in which a number
of objects agree as to colour, and in virtue of which they
are called red. Redness forms, in fact, the intensive
meaning of the term red.
Abstract terms are strongly distinguished from general
terms by possessing only one kind of meaning ; for as
they denote qualities there is nothing which they can in
addition imply. The adjective 'red' is the name of red
objects, but it implies the possession by them of the
quality redness ; but this latter term has one single
meaning the quality alone. Thus it arises that abstract
terms are incapable of number or plurality. Red objects
are numerically distinct each from each, and there are a
multitude of such objects ; but redness is a single exis-
tence . which runs through all those objects, and is the
same in one as it is in another. It is true that we may
speak of rednesses, meaning different kinds or tints of
redness, just as we may speak of colours, meaning dif-
ferent kinds of colours. But in distinguishing kinds,
