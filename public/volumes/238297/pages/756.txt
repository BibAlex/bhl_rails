yet lasts so minute a fraction of a second, that it would
be hopeless to attempt to detect and separate the two
opposite induced currents, which are nearly simultaneous
and exactly neutralise each other. Thus an apparent
failure of analogy is explained away, and we are furnished
with another instance of a phenomenon incapable of obser-
vation and yet theoretically known to exist 8 .
Perhaps the most extraordinary and fundamental case '
of the detection of unsuspected continuity is found in the
discovery of Cagniard de 3a Tour and Professor Andrews,
that the liquid and gaseous conditions of matter are only
remote points in a continuous course of change. Nothing
is at first sight more apparently distinct than the physical
condition of water and aqueous vapour. At the boiling-
point there is an entire breach of continuity, and the gas
produced is subject to laws incomparably more simple
than the liquid from which it arose. But Cagniard de la
Tour showed that if we maintain a liquid under sufficient
pressure its boiling point may be indefinitely raised, and
yet the liquid will ultimately assume the gaseous con-
dition with but a small increase of volume. Professor
Andrews, recently following out a similar course of in-
quiry, has shown that liquid carbonic acid may, at a par-
ticular temperature (3O*92 C.), and under the pressure of
74 atmosphere, be at once in a state indistinguishable
from that of liquid and gas. At higher pressures carbonic
acid may be made to pass from a palpably liquid state to
a truly gaseous state without any abrupt change whatever.
The subject is one of some complexity, because as the
pressure is greater the abruptness of the change from
liquid to gas gradually decreases, and finally vanishes.
As similar phenomena or an approximation to them
have been observed in various other liquids, there is
little doubt that we may make a wide generalization,
