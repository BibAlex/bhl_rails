CHAPTER V.
DISJUNCTIVE PROPOSITIONS.
IN the previous chapter I have exhibited various forms
of deductive reasoning by the process of substitution, so
far as they can be treated without the use of disjunctive
propositions ; but we cannot long defer the consideration
of this more complex class of identities. General terms
arise, as we have seen (p. 29), from classifying or men-
tally uniting together all objects which agree in certain
qualities, the value of this union consisting in the fact
that the power of knowledge is multiplied thereby. In
forming such classes or general notions, we overlook or
abstract the points of difference which exist between the
objects joined together, and fix our attention only on the
points of agreement. But every process of thought may
be said to have its inverse process, which consists in
undoing the effects of the direct process. Just as division
undoes multiplication, and evolution undoes involution,
so we must have a process which undoes abstraction, or
the operation of forming general notions. This inverse
process will consist in distinguishing the separate objects
or minor classes which are the constituent parts of any
wider class. When we mentally unite together certain
objects visible in the sky and call them planets, we shall
afterwards need to distinguish the contents of this general
notion, which we do in the disjunctive proposition
A planet is either Mercury or Venus or the Earth or
or Neptune.
