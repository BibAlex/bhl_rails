EXPERIMENT. 33
Failure in the Simplification of Experiments.
In some cases it seems to be impossible to carry out the
rule of varying one circumstance at a time. When we
attempt to obtain two instances or two forms of experi-
ment in which a single circumstance shall be present or
absent, it may be found that this single circumstance
entails one or more others. Benjamin Franklin's experi-
ment concerning the comparative absorbing powers of
different colours is well known. ' I took,' he says, ' a
number of little square pieces of broadcloth from a tailor's
pattern card, of various colours. They were black, deep
blue, lighter blue, green, purple, red, yellow, white,
and other colours and shades of colour. I laid them all
out upon the snow on a bright sunshiny morning. In a
few hours, the black being most warmed by the sun, was
sunk so low as to be below the stroke of the sun's rays ;
the dark blue was almost as low ; the lighter blue not
quite so much as the dark ; the other colours less as they
were lighter. The white remained on the surface of the
snow, not having entered it at all/ This is a very elegant
and apparently simple experiment ; but when Leslie had
completed his series of researches upon the nature of heat,
he came to the conclusion that the colour of a surface has
very little effect upon the radiating power, the mechanical
nature of the surface appearing to be more influential.
He remarks 1 that c the question is incapable of being posi-
tively resolved, since no substance can be made to assume
different colours without at the same time changing its
internal structure/ More recent investigation has shown
that the subject is one of considerable complication, be-
cause the absorptive power of a surface taay be different
according to the character of the rays which fall upon it ;
