interesting quantitative research P, in which we shall
doubtless at some future time discover the operation of
causes now most mysterious and unaccountable.
The Methods of Accurate Measurement.
In studying the modes by which physicists have ac-
complished very exact measurements, we find that they
are very various, but that they may perhaps be reduced
under the following three classes :
1. The increase or decrease of the quantity to be
measured in some determinate ratio, so as to bring it
within the scope of our senses, and to equate it with the
standard unit, or some determinate multiple or sub-mul-
tiple of this unit.
2. The discovery of some natural conjunction of events
which will enable us to compare directly the multiples of
the quantity with those of the unit, or a quantity related
in a definite ratio to that unit.
3. Indirect measurement, which gives us not the quan-
tity itself, but some other quantity connected with it by
known mathematical relations.
Conditions of Accurate Measurement.
Several conditions are requisite in order that a mea-
surement may be made with great accuracy, and that
the result may be closely accordant when several inde-
pendent measurements are made.
In the first place the magnitude must be exactly defined
by sharp terminations, or precise marks of inconsiderable
thickness. When a boundary is vague and graduated,
like the penumbra in a lunar eclipse, it is impossible to
say where the end really is, and different people will come
