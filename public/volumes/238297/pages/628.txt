138 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
which are, as far as can be foreseen at the moment, most
probable. Each experiment, therefore, which he performs
is that most likely to throw light upon his subject, and
even if it frustrate his first views, it probably tends to
put him in possession of the correct clue.
Requisites of a Good Hypothesis.
There will be no difficulty in pointing out to what
conditions, or rather to what condition an hypothesis must
conform in order to be accepted as valid and probable.
That condition, as I conceive, is the single one of enabling
us to infer the existence of phenomena which occur in our
experience. Agreement with fact is the one sole and
sufficient test of a true hypothesis.
Hobbes, indeed, has named two conditions which he
considers requisite in an hypothesis, namely, (i) That it
should be conceivable and not absurd ; (2) That it should
allow of phenomena being necessarily inferred. Boyle, in
noticing Hobbes' views, proposed to add a third condition,
to the effect that the hypothesis should not be inconsistent
with any other truth or phenomenon of nature 6 . Of
these three conditions, I am inclined to think that the
first cannot be accepted, unless by inconceivable and absurd
we mean self-contradictory or inconsistent with the laws
of thought and nature. I shall have to point out that
some of the most sure and satisfactory theories involve
suppositions which are wholly inconceivable in a certain
sense of the word, because the mind cannot sufficiently
extend its ideas to frame a notion of the actions supposed
to exist. That the force of gravity should act instan-
taneously between the most distant parts of the planetary
system, or that a ray of violet light should consist of
