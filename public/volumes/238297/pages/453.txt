THE METHOD OF MEANS. 427
mean of all the readings when the moon was on the me-
ridian and the similar mean when she was on the horizon.
The difference of these means was found to be only
00365, yet it was possible to discover even the variation
of this tide according as the moon, was nearer to or further
from the earth, though this difference was only '00056
inch n . It is quite evident that such minute effects could
never be discovered in a purely empirical manner. Having
no information but the series of observations before us,
we could have no clue as to the mode of grouping them
which would give so small a difference. In applying this
method of means in an extensive manner we must gener-
ally then have d priori knowledge as to the periods at
which a cause will act in one direction or the other.
We are sometimes able to eliminate fluctuations and
take a mean result by purely mechanical arrangements.
The daily variations of temperature, for instance, become
imperceptible one or two feet below the surface of the
earth, so that a thermometer placed with its bulb at that
depth would give very nearly the true daily mean tem-
perature. At a depth of twenty feet even the yearly
fluctuations would become nearly effaced, and the thermo-
meter would stand a little above the true mean tempera-
ture of the locality. In registering the rise and fall of the
tide by a tide-guage, it is desirable to avoid the oscilla-
tions arising from surface waves, which is very readily
accomplished by placing the float which marks the level
of the water in a cistern communicating by a small hole
with the sea. Only a general rise or fall of *the level is
then perceptible, just as in the marine barometer the
narrow tube prevents any casual fluctuations and allows
only a continued change of pressure to manifest itself.
