expressed.
Immediate Inference.
Probably the simplest of all forms of inference is that
which has been called Immediate Inference, because it
can be performed upon a single proposition. It consists
in joining an adjective, or other qualifying clause of the
same nature, to both sides of an identity, and asserting
the equivalence of the terms thus produced. For instance,
since
Conductors of electricity = Non-electrics,
it follows that
Liquid conductors of electricity = Liquid non-electrics.
If we suppose that
Plants = Bodies decomposing carbonic acid,
it follows that
Microscopic plants = Microscopic bodies decomposing
carbonic acid.
In general symbols, from the identity
A=B
we can infer the identity
AC = BC.
This is but a case of plain substitution ; for by the first
Law of Thought it must be admitted that
AC -AC,
and if in the second side of this identity we substitute
for A its equivalent B, we obtain
In like manner from the partial identity
A = AB
we may obtain
AC = ABC
by an exactly similar form of substitution ; and in every
