310 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
with the degree of esteem proportionate to its proba-
bility. We go through the same steps as before.
(1) We frame an hypothesis.
(2) We deduce the probability of various series of pos-
sible consequences.
(3) We compare the consequences with the particular
facts, and observe the probability that such facts would
happen under the hypothesis.
The above processes must be performed for every con-
ceivable hypothesis, and then the absolute probability of
each will be yielded by the principle of the inverse
method (p. 279). As in the case of certainty we accept
that hypothesis which certainly gives the required results,
so now we accept as most probable that hypothesis which
most probably gives the results ; but we are obliged to
entertain at the same time all other hypotheses with
degrees of probability proportionate to the probabilities
that they would give the results.
So far we have treated only of the process by which
we pass from special facts to general laws, that inverse
application of deduction which constitutes induction.
But the direct employment of deduction is often com-
bined with the inverse. No sooner have we established
a general law, than the mind rapidly draws other particular
consequences from it. In geometry we may almost seem
to infer that because one equilateral triangle is equi-
angular, therefore another is so. In reality it is not
because one is that another is, but because all / are. The
geometrical conditions are perfectly general, and by what is
sometimes called parity of reasoning whatever is true of
one equilateral triangle, so far as it is equilateral, is true
of all equilateral triangles.
Similarly, in all other cases of inductive inference,
where we seem to pass from some particular instances to
a new instance, we go through the same process. We
