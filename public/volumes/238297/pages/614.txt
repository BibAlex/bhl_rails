124 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
observation will become perceptible or great under ex-
treme circumstances. When the variable in our empirical
formula is small, we are justified in overlooking the exist-
ence of higher powers, and taking only two or three of
them. But as the variable increases, those higher powers
gain in importance, and in time will yield the principal
part of the value of the function.
This is no mere theoretical inference. Excepting the
few great primary laws of nature, such as the law of
gravity, the conservation of energy, &c., there is hardly
any natural law which we can trust in circumstances
widely different from those with which we are practically
acquainted. From the expansion or contraction, fusion
or vaporisation of substances by heat at the surface of the
earth, we can form a most imperfect notion of what would
happen near the centre of the earth, where the pressure
must almost infinitely exceed anything possible in our
experiments. The physics of the earth again give us
a feeble, and probably often a misleading, notion of a body
like the sun, in most parts of which an almost incon-
ceivably high temperature is united with an inconceivably
high pressure. If, as is probable, there are in the realms
of space many nebulae consisting of incandescent and
unoxydized vapours of metals and other elements, so
highly heated perhaps that chemical composition is out
of the question, we are hardly able to treat them as
subjects of scientific inference. Hence arises the great
importance of any experiments in which we can investi-
gate the properties of substances under extreme circum-
stances of cold or heat, density or rarity, intense electric
excitation, &c. It should be observed that this insecurity
in extending our inferences wholly arises from the purely
approximate character of our measurements. Had we
the power of appreciating indefinitely small quantities,
we should by the principle of continuity discover some
