METHOD OF VARIATIONS. 51
Fowler has well re marked a , the observation of variations
is really an integration of a supposed infinite number of
applications of the so-called method of difference, that
is of experiment in its perfect form.
In induction we aim at establishing a general law, and
if we deal with quantities that law must really be expressed
more or less obviously in the form of an equation, or it.
may be in more than one equation. We treat as before of
conditions, and of what happens under those conditions.
But the conditions will now vary, not in quality, but
quantity, and the effect will also vary in quantity, so that
the result of quantitative induction is always to arrive at
some mathematical expression involving the quantity of
each condition, and expressing the quantity of the result.
In other words, we wish to know what function the effect
is of its conditions. We shall find that it is one thing to
obtain the numerical results, and quite another thing to
detect the law obeyed by those results, the latter being an
operation of an inverse and tentative character.
The Variable and the Variant.
Almost every series of quantitative experiments is
directed to obtain the relation between the different
values of one quantity which is varied at will, and an-
other quantity which is caused thereby to vary. We
may conveniently distinguish these as respectively the
variable and the variant. When we are examining the
effect of heat in expanding bodies, heat, or one of its
dimensions, temperature, is the variable, length the
variant. If we compress a body to observe how much
it is thereby heated, pressure, or it may be the dimensions
of the body, forms the variable, heat the variant. In
thermo-electric pile we make heat the variable and the
