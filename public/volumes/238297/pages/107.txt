DISJUNCTIVE PROPOSITIONS. 81
Expression of the Alternative Relation.
In order to represent disjunctive propositions with
convenience we require a sign of the alternative or dis-
junctive relation, equivalent to one meaning at least of
the little conjunction or so frequently used in common
language. I propose to use for this purpose the sym-
bol -I- . In my first logical Essay I followed the example
of Dr. Boole and adopted the common sign + ; but this sign
should not be employed unless there exists exact analogy
between mathematical addition and logical alternation;
We shall find that the analogy is of a very partial cha-
racter, and that there is such profound difference between
a logical and a mathematical term as should prevent our
uniting them by the same symbol. Accordingly I have
chosen a sign I , which seems aptly to suggest whatever
degree of analogy may exist without implying more.
The exact meaning of the symbol we will now proceed to
investigate and determine.
Nature of the Alternative Relation.
Before treating disjunctive propositions it is indis-
pensable to decide whether the alternatives shall be
considered exclusive or unexclusive. By exclusive alter-
natives we mean those which cannot contain the same
things. Thus
Matter is solid, or liquid, or gaseous ;
but the same portion of matter cannot be at once solid and
liquid, properly speaking ; still less can we suppose it to
be solid and gaseous, or solid, liquid and gaseous all at
the same time. Many examples on the other hand can
readily be suggested in which two or more alternatives
may hold true of the same object. Thus
Luminous bodies are self-luminous or luminous by
reflection.
