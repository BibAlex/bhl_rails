304 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
The accidents connected with the number seven have mis-
led the human intellect throughout the historical period.
Pythagoras imagined a connection between the seven
planets, and the seven intervals of the monochord. The
alchemists were never tired of drawing inferences from
the coincidence in numbers of the seven planets and the
seven metals, not to speak of the seven days of the
week.
A singular circumstance was pointed out concerning
the dimensions of the earth, sun, and moon ; the sun's
diameter was almost exactly no times as great as the
earth's diameter, while in almost exactly the same ratio
the mean distance of the earth was greater than the sun's
diameter, and the mean distance of the moon from the
earth was greater than the moon's diameter 1 . The agree-
ment was so close that it might have proved more than
casual, but its fortuitous character is sufficiently shown
by the fact, that the coincidence ceases to be remarkable
when we adopt the amended dimensions of the planetary
system.
A considerable number of the elements have atomic
weights, which are apparently exact multiples of that
of hydrogen. If this be not a law to be ultimately ex-
tended to all the elements, as supposed by Prout, it is a
most remarkable coincidence. But, as I have observed,
we have no means of absolutely discriminating accidental
coincidences from those which imply a deep producing
cause. A coincidence must either be very strong in
itself, or it. must be corroborated by some explanation or
connection with other laws of nature. Little attention
was ever given to the coincidence concerning the dimen-
sions of the sun, earth, and moon, because it was not very
strong in itself, and had no apparent connexion with the
