166 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
are certainly in favour of a discovery being occasionally
made in this manner. But the greater the tact and
industry with which a physicist applies himself to the
study of nature, the greater is the probability that he
will meet with fortunate accidents, and will turn them
to good account. Thus it comes to pass that, in the
refined investigations of the present day, genius united to
extensive knowledge, cultivated powers and indomitable
industry, constitute the characteristics of the great dis-
coverer.
Empirical Observations subsequently Explained.
The second great portion of scientific knowledge consists
of facts which have been first learnt in a purely empirical
manner, but have afterwards been shown to follow from
some law of nature, that is, from some highly probable
hypothesis. Facts are said to be explained when they are
thus brought into harmony with other facts, or bodies of
general knowledge. There are few words more familiarly
used in scientific phraseology than this word explanation,
and it is necessary to decide exactly what we mean by it,
since the question touches the very deepest points con-
cerning the nature of science. Like most terms referring
to mental actions, the verbs to explain, or to explicate,
involve material similes. The action is ex plicis plana
redder e, to take out the folds, and render a thing plain or
even. Explanation thus renders a thing clearly compre-
hensible in all its points, so that there is nothing left
outstanding or obscure.
Every act of explanation consists in detecting and
pointing out a resemblance between facts, or in showing
that a greater or less degree of identity exists between
apparently diverse phenomena. This resemblance may be
of any extent and depth ; it may be a general law of
