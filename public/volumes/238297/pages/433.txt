ANALYSIS OF QUANTITATIVE PHENOMENA. 407
displaced ; the third method in fact is adopted. To make
all the calculations in the frequent weighings requisite in
chemical analysis would be exceedingly laborious, hence
the correction is usually neglected. But when the chemist
wishes to weigh a quantity of gas contained in a glass
globe for the purpose of determining its specific gravity,
the correction becomes of much importance. Hence
chemists avoid at once the error, and the labour of cor-
recting it, by attaching to the opposite scale of the balance
a sealed glass globe of exactly equal capacity to that
containing the gas to be weighed, noting only the dif-
ference of weight when the globe is full and empty. The
correction, being exactly the same for both globes, may be
entirely neglected e .
A device of nearly the same kind is employed in the
construction of galvanometers which measure the force of
an electric current by the deflection of a suspended
magnetic needle. The resistance of the needle is partly
due to the directive influence of the earth's magnetism,
and partly to the torsion of the thread. But the former
force may often be inconveniently great as well as
troublesome to determine for different inclinations. Hence
it is customary to connect together two exactly equal
needles, with their poles pointing in opposite directions,
one needle being within and another without the coil of
wire. As regards the earth's magnetism, the needles are
now astatic or indifferent, the tendency, of one needle
being exactly balanced by that of the other.
An elegant instance of the elimination of a disturbing
force by compensation is found in Faraday's researches
upon the magnetism of gases. To observe the magnetic
attraction or repulsion of a gas seems impossible unless we
enclose the gas in an envelope, probably best made of
