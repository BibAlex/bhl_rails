106 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
(1) Is there any constant relation between the variable
and variant \
(2) What is the empirical formula expressing this re-
lation ?
(3) What is the rational formula expressing the law of
nature involved ?
Probable Connexion of Varying Quantities.
We find it stated in Mr. Mill's System of Logic a that
' Whatever phenomenon varies in any manner whenever
another phenomenon varies in some particular manner,
is either a cause or an effect of that phenomenon, or is
connected with it through some fact of causation/ This
assertion may be considered true when it is interpreted
with sufficient caution ; but it might otherwise lead us into
great errors. There is nothing whatever in the nature of
things to prevent the existence of two variations which
should apparently follow the same law, and yet have no
connexion with each other. One binary star might be
going through a revolution which, so far as we could tell,
was of apparently equal period with that of another
binary star, and according to tfce above rule the motion
of one would be the cause of the motion of the other,
which would not be really the case. Two astronomical
clocks might conceivably be made so nearly perfect that,
for several years, no difference could be detected, and we
might then infer that the motion of one clock was the
cause or effect of the motion of the other. This matter
really requires the most careful discrimination. We must
always bear in mind that the continuous quantities of
space, time, force, &c., which we measure, are made up of
an infinite number of infinitely small units. We may
then meet with two variable phenomena which follow
