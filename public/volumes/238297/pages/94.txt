our formulae to express either of the syllogisms Darii or
Ferio. Consider the example
Some metals are of less density than water (i)
All bodies of less density than water will float
upon its surface (2)
Some metals will float upon its surface. (3)
Let A = some metals
B = body of less density than water
C = floating on the surface of water ;
then the propositions are evidently as before,
A = AB (i)
B = BC; (2)
hence A = ABC. (3)
Thus the syllogism Darii does not really differ from Bar-
bara. If the reader prefer it, we can readily employ a
distinct symbol for the indefinite sign of quantity.
Let P = some
Q = metal,
B and C having the same meanings as before. Then the
premises become
PQ = PQB (i)
B = BC; (2)
hence, by substitution, as before,
PQ = PQBC. (3)
Except that the formulae look a little more complicated
there is no difference whatever.
The mood Ferio is of exactly the same character as
Darii or Barbara, except that it involves the use of a
negative term. Take the example
Bodies which are equally elastic in all directions do
not doubly refract light,
Some crystals are bodies equally elastic in all direc-
tions; therefore some crystals do not doubly
refract light.
Assigning the letters as follows
