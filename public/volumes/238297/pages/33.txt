INTRODUCTION.
for it gives to all the formulae of reasoning a dual
character. It asserts also that b'etween presence or
absence, existence or non-existence, affirmation or ne-
gation, there is no third alternative. As Aristotle said,
there can be no mean between opposite assertions : we
must either affirm or deny. Hence the somewhat incon-
venient name by which it has been generally known
The Law of Excluded Middle.
It may be held that these laws are not three inde-
pendent and distinct laws, they rather express three
different aspects of the same truth, and each law doubt-
less presupposes and implies the other two. But it has
not hitherto been found possible to state these characters
of identity and difference in less than the three-fold
formula. The reader may perhaps desire some infor-
mation as to the mode in which these laws have been
stated, or the way in which they have been regarded,
by philosophers in different ages of the world. Abundant
information on this and many other points of logical
history will be found in Ueberweg's * System of Logic/
of which an excellent translation has been published by
Mr. T. M. Lindsay d . I must confess however that the
history of logical doctrines has seemed to me one of the
most confusing and least beneficial studies in which a
person can engage ; and over-abundant attention perhaps
has been paid to it by Hamilton, Mansel, and many
German logicians.
The Nature and Authority of the Laws of Identity
and Difference.
I must at least allude to the profoundly difficult
question concerning the nature and authority of these
