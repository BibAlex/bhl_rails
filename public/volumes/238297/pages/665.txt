EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE, EXPLANATION, &c. 175
when the space intervening between the plates is filled
with a substance of intermediate refractive power, another
phenomenon predicted by theory and verified by experi-
ment as Sir John Herschel has described. There is hardly
a limit to the number of other complicated effects of
the interference of rays of light under different circum-
stances which might be deduced from the mathematical
expressions, if it were worth while, or which, being
previously observed can be explained, as in an interesting
case observed by Sir John Herschel and explained by
AiryP.
By a somewhat different effort of scientific foresight,
Fresnel discovered that any solid transparent medium
might be endowed with the power of double refraction by
mere compression. For as he attributed the peculiar re-
fracting power of crystals to the unequal elasticity in
different directions, he inferred that unequal elasticity,
if artificially produced, would give similar phenomena.
With a powerful screw and a piece of glass, he then pro-
duced not only the colours due to double refraction, but
the actual duplication of images. Thus, by a great scien-
tific generalisation, are the apparently unique properties
of Iceland spar shown to belong to all transparent sub-
stances under certain conditions q .
All other predictions in optical science are, however,
thrown into the shade by the theoretical discovery of
conical refraction by the late Sir W. II . Hamilton, of
Dublin. In investigating the passage of light through
certain crystals, Hamilton found that Fresnel had slightly
misinterpreted his own formulas, and that, when rightly
understood, they indicated a phenomenon of a kind never
witnessed. A small ray of light sent into a crystal of
arragonite in a particular direction, becomes spread out
