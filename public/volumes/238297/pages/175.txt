INDUCTION. 149
Induction of Partial Identities.
We found in the last section that the simple identity of
two classes is almost always discovered not by direct
observation of the fact, but by first establishing two
partial identities. There are also a great multitude of
cases in which the partial identity of one class with an-
other is the only relation to be discovered. Thus the most
common of all inductive inferences consists in establishing
the fact that ah 1 objects having the properties of A have
also those of B, or that A = AB. To ascertain the truth
of a proposition of this kind it is merely necessary to
assemble together, mentally or physically, all the objects
included under A, and then observe whether B is present
in each of them, or, which is the same, whether it would
be impossible to select from among them any not-B.
Thus, if we mentally assemble together all the heavenly
bodies which move with apparent rapidity, that is to say
the planets, we find that they all possess the property of
not scintillating. We cannot analyse any vegetable sub-
stance without discovering that it contains carbon and
hydrogen, but it is not true that ah 1 substances containing
carbon and hydrogen are vegetable substances.
The great mass of scientific truths consists of propo-
sitions of this form A AB. Thus in astronomy we
learn that all the planets are spheroidal bodies; that
they ah 1 revolve in one direction round the sun ; that
they all shine by reflected light ; that they all obey
the law of gravitation. But of course it is not to be
asserted that all bodies obeying the law of gravitation,
or shining by reflected light, or revolving in a particular
direction, or being spheroidal in form, are planets. In
other sciences we have immense numbers of propositions
of the same form, as for instance that all substances in
