THE THEORY OF PROBABILITY. 227
well said that the quantity of belief is ' always relative
to a particular state of knowledge or ignorance ; but it
must be observed that it is absolute in the sense of not
being relative to any individual mind ; since, the same
information being presupposed, all minds ought to dis-
tribute their belief in the same way/ c Dr. Boole, too,
seemed to entertain a like view, when he described the
theory as engaged with ' the equal distribution of ignor-
ance,' d but we may just as well say that it is engaged
with the equal distribution of knowledge.
I prefer to dispense altogether with this obscure word
belief, and to say that the theory of probability deals with
quantity of knowledge, an expression of which a precise
explanation and measure can presently be given. An
event is only probable when our knowledge of it is
diluted with ignorance, and exact calculation is needed
to discriminate how much we do and do not know. The
theory has been described by some as professing to evolve
knowledge out of ignorance ; but as Professor Donkin has
admirably remarked, it is really f a method of avoiding
the erection of belief upon ignorance/ e It defines rational
expectation by measuring the comparative amounts of
knowledge and ignorance, and teaches us to regulate our
action with regard to future events in a way which will,
in the long run, lead to the least amount of disappointment
and injury. It is, as Laplace as happily expressed it, good
sense reduced to calculation.
This theory appears to me the noblest creation of
human intellect, and it passes my conception how two
men possessing such high intelligence as Auguste Comte
and J. S. Mill, could have been found depreciating it,
or even vainly attempting to question its validity. To
