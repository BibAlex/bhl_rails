308 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
(2) Deducing consequences from that law.
(3) Observing whether the consequences agree with the
particular facts under consideration.
In very simple cases of inverse reasoning, hypothesis
may sometimes seem altogether needless. Thus, to take
numbers again as a convenient illustration, I have only
to look at the series,
i, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, &c.,
to know at once that the general law is that of geo-
metrical progression ; I need no successive trial of vari-
ous hypotheses, because I am familiar with the series,
and have long since learnt from what general formula
it proceeds. In the same way a mathematician becomes
acquainted with the integrals of a number of common
formulae, so that we have no need to go through any pro-
cess of discovery. But it is none the less true that when-
ever previous reasoning does not furnish the knowledge,
hypotheses must be framed and tried. (See p. 142.)
There naturally arise two different cases, according as
the nature of the subject admits of certain or only pro-
bable deductive reasoning. Certainty, indeed, is but a
singular case of probability, and the general principles of
procedure are always the same. Nevertheless, when
certainty of inference is possible the process is simplified.
Of several mutually inconsistent hypotheses, the results of
which can be certainly compared with fact, but one hypo-
thesis can ultimately be entertained. Thus in the inverse
logical problem, two logically distinct conditions could not
yield the same series of possible combinations. Accord-
ingly in the case of two terms we had to choose one of
seven different kinds of propositions, or in the case of
three terms, our choice lay among 192 possible distinct
hypotheses (pp. 1 54- 1 64). Natural laws, however, are often
quantitative in character, and the possible hypotheses are
then infinite in variety.
