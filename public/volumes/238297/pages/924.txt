the consequent results of the law of gravitation must
have been entirely a matter of free choice.
Chalmers has most distinctly pointed out that the
existing collocations of the material world are at least
as important as the laws which the objects obey. He
remarks that a certain class of writers entirely over-
look the distinction, and forget that mere laws without
collocations would have afforded no security against a
turbid and disorderly chaos b . Mr. J. S. Mill has recog-
nised the truth of Chalmers' statement, without draw-
ing the proper inferences from it. He says d of the dis-
tribution of matter through space, 'We can discover
nothing regular in the distribution itself; we can reduce
it to no uniformity, to no law/ More lately the Duke
of Argyle in his well known work on the 'Reign of Law*
has drawn attention to the profound distinction between
laws and collocations of causes.
The original conformation of the material universe was,
so far as we can possibly tell, free from all restriction.
There was unlimited space in which to frame it, and an
unlimited number of material particles, each of which
could be placed in any one of an infinite number of
different positions. It must also be added that each
particle might be endowed with any one of an infinite
number of degrees of vis viva acting in any one of an
infinitely infinite number of different directions. /The
problem of Creation was, then, what a mathematician
would call an indeterminate problem, and it was ^inde-
terminate in an infinitely infinite number of ways. In-
finitely numerous and various universes might then
have been fashioned by the various distribution of the
