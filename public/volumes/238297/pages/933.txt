RESULTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD. 443
It is far from impossible, again, that the planetary
system may be invaded by bodies of greater mass than
any comets. The sun seems to be placed in so extensive a
portion of empty space, that its own proper motion would
not bring it to the nearest known star (a Centauri) in less
than 139,200 years. But in order to be sure that this
long interval of undisturbed life is granted to our globe,
we must prove that there are no stars moving so as to
meet us, and no dark bodies of considerable size flying
through intervening space unknown to us. The intrusion
of comets into our system, and the fact that many of them
have hyperbolic paths, is sufficient to show that the sur-
rounding parts of space are occupied by multitudes of
dark bodies of some size. It is quite probable that small
suns might have cooled sufficiently to become non-
luminous ; for even if we discredit the theory that the
variation of brightness of periodic stars is due to the
revolution of dark companion stars, yet there is our own
globe as an unquestionable example of a smaller body
which has cooled below the luminous point.
AltogetherYthen, it is a mere assumption that the
Uniformity of Nature involves the unaltered existence
of our own globe.) There is no kind of catastrophe which
is too great or too sudden to be theoretically consistent
with the reign of law.\ /For all that our science can tell,
human history may be 'closed in the next instant of timel
The world may be dashed to pieces against some intruding
body; it may be involved in a nebulous atmosphere of
hydrogen to be exploded a second afterwards ; it may be
scorched up or dissipated into vapour by some great ex-
plosion in the sun ; there might even be within the globe
itself some secret cause of disruption, which only needs
time for its manifestation.
There are even some indications, as already noticed
(vol. ii. p. 327), that some violent disturbances have
