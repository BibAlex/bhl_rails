INTRODUCTION. 25
such, great value to the modern methods of mechanical
construction, according to which all the parts of a
machine are exact facsimiles of a fixed pattern. All
the rifles used, in the British army are constructed on
the interchangeable system, so that any one part of any
one rifle can be substituted indifferently for the same
part of another. A bullet fitting one rifle will fit all
others of the same bore. Sir J. Whitworth has extended
the same system to the screws and screw-bolts used in
connecting together the parts of machines, by establishing
a series of standard screws.
Anticipations of the Principle of Substitution.
In such a subject as logic it is hardly possible to put
forth any opinions or principles which have not been
in some degree previously entertained. The germ at
least of every doctrine will be found in earlier writers,
and novelty must arise chiefly in the mode of harmonising
and developing ideas. When I first proposed to employ
the process and name of substitution in logic r , I believe
that I was led to do so from analogy with the familiar
mathematical process of substituting for a symbol its value
as given in an equation. In writing- my first logical essay
I had a most imperfect conception of the importance
and generality of the process, and I described, as if they
were of equal importance, a number of other laws which
now seem to be but particular cases of the one general
rule of substitution.
My second essay, the Substitution of Similars, was
written shortly after I had become aware of the great
simplification which may be effected by a proper appli-
cation of the principle of substitution. I was not then
acquainted with the fact that the German logician
