COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS. 219
elements often combine in many different proportions,
and some of them, especially carbon, have the power of
forming an almost endless number of compounds, it
would hardly be, possible to assign any limit to the
number of chemical compounds which may be formed.
There are branches of physical science, therefore, of which
it is unlikely that scientific men, with all their industry,
can ever obtain a knowledge in any appreciable degree
approaching to completeness.
Higher Orders of Variety.
The consideration of the facts already given in this
chapter will not produce an adequate notion of the pos-
sible variety of existence, unless we consider the com-
parative numbers of combinations of different orders. By
a combination of a higher order, I mean a combination
of groups, which are themselves combinations of simpler
groups. The almost unlimited number of compounds
of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, described in organic
chemistry, are combinations of a second order, for the
atoms are groups of groups. The wave of sound pro-
duced by a musical instrument may be regarded as a
combination of motions ; the body of sound proceeding
from a large orchestra is therefore a complex aggregate
of sounds each in itself a complex combination of move-
ments. All literature may be said to be developed
out of the difference of white paper and black ink.
From the almost unlimited number of marks which
might be chosen we select twenty-six customary letters.
The pronounceable combinations of letters are probably
some trillions in number. Now, as a sentence is a cer-
tain selection of words, the possible sentences must be
indefinitely more numerous than the words of which
it may be composed. A book is a combination of
