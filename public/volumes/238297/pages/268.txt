242 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
or to the supposed laws of nature, and every reasoner may
be assumed to be dealing plainly, and putting forward the
whole force of evidence which he possesses in its favour.
If he brings but one argument, and its probability a is
small, then in the formula i (i a)(i c) both a and c
are small, and the whole expression has but little value.
The whole effect of an argument thus turns upon the
question whether other arguments remain so that we can
introduce other factors (i 6), (i c), &c., into the above
expression. In a court of justice, in a publication having
an express purpose, and in many other cases, it is doubtless
right to assume that the whole evidence considered to
have any value as regards the conclusion asserted, is
put forward.
To assign the antecedent probability of any proposi-
tion, may be a matter of great difficulty or impos-
sibility, and one with which logic and the theory of pro-
bability has little concern. From the general body of
science or evidence in our possession, we must in each
case make the best judgment we can. But in the absence i
of all knowledge the probability should be considered = ^,
for if we make it less than this we incline to believe it
false rather than true. Thus before we possessed any
means of estimating the magnitudes of the fixed stars, the
statement that Sirius was greater than the sun had
a probability of exactly ^ ; for it was as likely that it
would be greater as that it would be smaller ; and so of
any other star. This indeed was the assumption which
Michell made in his admirable speculations. It might
seem indeed that as every proposition expresses an agree-
ment, and the agreements or resemblances between phe-
nomena are infinitely fewer than the differences (p. 52),
every proposition should in the absence of other informa-
tion be infinitely improbable, or c = o. But in our logical
