ACCORDANCE OF QUANTITATIVE THEORIES, &c. 213
tween 1855 and 1858. The theory of gravitation alone
cannot account for such a continued decrease of period ;
hence the hypothesis has been started that there is a
resisting medium filling the space through which the
comet passes. This hypothesis is a deus ex machind
for explaining this solitary phenomenon, and cannot pos-
sess any validity or probability unless it can be shown
that other phenomena are deducible from it. Many per-
sons have identified this medium with that through which
heat undulations pass, but I am not aware that there is
anything in the undulatory theory of light to show that
the medium would oifer resistance to a moving body. If
Professor Balfour Stewart can prove that a rotating disc
experiences resistance even in a perfectly vacuous receiver,
here is an experimental fact which distinctly supports the
hypothesis. But in the mean time it is open to question
whether other known agents, for instance electricity, may
not be brought in, and I have tried to show that if, as
seems highly probable, on other grounds, the tail of a
comet is an electrical phenomenon, it is almost a neces-
sary result of the theory of the conservation of energy
that the comet shall exhibit a loss of energy manifested
in a diminution of its mean distance from the sun and
its period of revolution k . If so, the residual phenomenon
seems to confirm an hypothesis as to the nature of the
comet itself, rather than that of the medium through
which it moves.
In other cases residual phenomena have involved im-
portant inferences not recognised at the time. Newton
showed how the velocity of sound in the atmosphere
could be calculated by a theory of pulses or undulations
from the observed tension and density of the air. He
inferred that the velocity in the ordinary state of the
