cipal axis, but more or less rapidly in the direction of this
axis, so that the isothermal surface is an ellipsoid of revo-
lution round that axis.
Nearly the same statement may be made concerning
the third or hexagonal or rhombohedral system of
crystals, in which there are three axes lying in one plane
and meeting at angles of 60, while the fourth axis is
perpendicular to the other three. The hexagonal prism
and the rhombohedron are the two commonest forms
assumed by crystals of this system, and in ice, quartz,
and calc-spar, we have abundance of beautiful specimens
of the various forms produced by the modification of the
primitive form. Calc-spar alone is said to crystallize in
at least 700 varieties of forms. Now of all the crystals
belonging both to this and the dimetric class, we know
that a ray of light passing in the direction of the prin-
cipal axis will be refracted singly as in a crystal of the
regular system ; but in every other direction the light
will suffer double refraction being separated into two rays,
one of which obeys the ordinary law of refraction, but the
other a much more complicated law. The other physical
properties vary in an analogous manner. Thus calc-spar
expands by heat in the direction of the principal axis, but
contracts by a small quantity in directions perpendicular
to it. So closely indeed are these various physical pro-
perties correlated that Mitscherlich, having observed the
law of expansion in calc-spar, was enabled to predict that
the double refracting power of the substance would be de-
creased by a rise of temperature, as was proved by expe-
riment to be the case.
In the fourth system, called the trimetric, rhombic, or
right prismatic system, there are three axes, at right
angles, but all unequal in length. It may be asserted
in general terms that the mechanical properties vaiy in
such crystals in every direction, and heat spreads so that
