water, and mercury, the temperature of the maximum
density of water (39'ioi Fahr. or 4*o Cent.), the latent
heats of water and steam, the boiling-point of water
under standard pressure, the melting and boiling-points
of mercury, and so on.
Astronomical Constants.
The third great class consists of numbers possessing far
less generality because they refer, not to the universal
properties of matter, but to the special forms and dis-
tances in which matter has been disposed in the part of
the universe open to our examination. We have, first of
all, to define the magnitude and form of the earth, its mean
density, the constant of aberration of light expressing the
relation between the earth's mean velocity in space and
the velocity of light. From the earth, as our observatory,
we then proceed to lay down the mean distances of the
sun, and of the planets from the same centre ; all the
elements of the planetary orbits, the magnitudes, densities,
masses, periods of axial rotation of the several planets
are by degrees determined with growing accuracy. The
same labours must be gone through for the satellites.
Catalogues of comets with the elements of their orbits,
as far as ascertainable, must not be omitted.
From the earth's orbit as a new base of observations,
we next proceed to survey the heavens and lay down the
apparent positions, magnitudes, motions, distances, periods
of variation, &c. of the stars. All catalogues of stars from
those of Hipparchus and Tycho, are full of numbers ex-
pressing rudely the conformation of the visible universe.
But there is obviously no limit to the labours of astrono-
mers ; not only are millions of distant stars awaiting their
first measurements, but those already registered require
endless scrutiny as regards their movements in the three
