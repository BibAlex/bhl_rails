CLASSIFICATION. 409
and there will be an immense number of forms finely
graduated in their resemblances. Exact and distinct
classification will then be almost impossible, and the
wisest course will be not to attempt arbitrarily to distin-
guish forms closely related in nature, but to allow that
there exist transitional forms of eveiy degree, to mark out
if possible the extreme limits of the family relationship,
and perhaps to select the most generalized form, or that
which presents the greatest number of close resemblances
to others of the family, as the type of the whole.
Mr. Darwin, in his most interesting work upon Orchids,
points out that the tribe of Malaxese are distinguished
from Epidendreae by the absence of a caudicle to the
pollinia, but as some of the MalaxeaB have a minute cau-
dicle the division really breaks down in the most essential
point.
'This is a misfortune,' he remarks h , 'which every natu-
ralist encounters in attempting to classify a largely de-
veloped or so-called natural group, in which, relatively to
other groups, there has been little extinction. In order
that the naturalist may be enabled to give precise and
clear definitions of his divisions, whole ranks of interme-
diate or gradational forms must have been utterly swept
away : if here and there a member of the intermediate
ranks has escaped annihilation, it puts an effectual bar to
any absolutely distinct definition/
In other cases a particular plant or animal may perhaps
have transmitted its form from generation to generation
almost unchanged, or, what comes to the same result,
those forms which diverged in character from the parent
stock, may have proved unsuitable to their circumstances,
and may have perished sooner or later. We shall then
find a particular form standing apart from all others, and
marked by various distinct characters. Occasionally we
