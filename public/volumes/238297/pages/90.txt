show that every equation of the form y = mx + c is
equivalent to or represented by a straight line ; it is also
easily proved that the same equation is equivalent to one
of the form Ax + By + = o, and vice versa. Hence it
follows that every equation of the first degree is equivalent
to or represents a straight line e .
Inference with a Simple and a Partial Identity.
A form of reasoning somewhat different from that last
considered consists in inference between a simple and a
partial identity. If we have two propositions of the
form
A = B,
we may then substitute for B in either proposition its
equivalent in the other, getting in both cases A = BC ;
in this we may if we like make a second substitution for
B, getting
A = AC.
Thus, since 'Mont Blanc is the highest mountain in
Europe, and Mont Blanc is deeply covered with snow/ we
infer by an obvious substitution that ' The highest moun-
tain in Europe is deeply covered with snow.' These pro-
positions when rigorously stated fall into the form above
exhibited.
This form of inference is constantly employed when for
a term we substitute its definition, or vice versa. The
very purpose of a definition is in fact to allow a single
term to be employed in place of a long descriptive phrase.
Thus when we say ' Circles are curves of the second
degree/ we may substitute the definition of a circle,
getting ' A plane curve, all points of whose perimeter are
at equal distances from a certain fixed point, is a curve of
