OLASSIFICA TION. 4 1 1
tion. From time to time the notions of naturalists have
been greatly widened, especially in the case of Australian
animals and plants, by the discovery of unexpected com-
binations of organs, and such events must often happen
in the future. If indeed the time shall come when all
the forms of plants are discovered and accurately de-
scribed, the science of Systematic Botany will then be
placed in a new and more favourable position, as remarked
by Alphonse Decandolle k .
It ought, I think, to be allowed that though the genea-
logical classification of plants or animals is doubtless the
most natural and instructive of all, it is" 3 not necessarily
the best for all purposes. There may be correlations of
properties important for medicinal, or other practical
purposes, which do not correspond to the correlations of
descent. We must regard the bamboo as a tree rather
than a grass, although it is botanically a grass. For
legal purposes we may still with advantage continue to
treat as fish, the whale, seal, and other cetaceae. We
must class plants together according as they are Arctic,
or Alpine, or belong to the temperate, sub-tropical or
tropical regions. There may be some causes of likeness
apart from hereditary relationship, and in a logical and
practical point of view we must not attribute exclusive
excellence to any one method of classification.
Classification l>y Types.
Perplexed by the difficulties arising in natural history
from the discovery of intermediate forms, naturalists have
resorted to what they call classification by types. In-
stead of forming one distinct class defined by the invari-
able possession of certain assigned properties, and rigidly
including or excluding objects according as they do or
