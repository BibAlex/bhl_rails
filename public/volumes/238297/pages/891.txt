discovery of an object. Even such apparently trivial and
arbitrary arrangements as alphabetical or other indices,
are really classifications subject to all the principles of
the subject. No such arrangement can be of any use
unless it involves some correlation of circumstances, so
that knowing one thing we learn another. If we merely
arrange letters in the pigeon-holes of a secretaire we
establish a correlation, for all letters in the first hole will
be written by persons, for instance, whose names begin
with A, and so on. Knowing then the initial letter of
the writer's name we know also the place of the letter, and
the labour of search is thus reduced to one twenty-sixth
part of what it w r ould be without any arrangement.
Now the purpose of a mere catalogue is to discover the
place in which an object is to be found, but the art of
cataloguing involves logical considerations of some interest
and importance. We want to establish a correlation be-
tween the place of an object and some circumstance about
the object which shall enable us readily to refer to it ;
this circumstance therefore should be that which will
most readily dwell in the memory of the searcher. A
piece of poetry, for instance, will be best remembered, in
all probability, by the first line of the piece, according
to the laws of the association of ideas, and the name of
the author will be the next most definite circumstance ;
a catalogue of poetry should therefore be arranged alpha-
betically according to the first word of the piece, or the
name of the author, or, still better, in both ways. It
would be wholly absurd and impossible to arrange poems
according to their subjects, so vague and mixed are these
found to be when the attempt is made.
It is a matter of considerable literary importance to
decide upon the best mode of cataloguing books, so that
any required book in a library shall be most readily
found. Books may be classified in a great number of
