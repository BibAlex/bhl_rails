THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF PHENOMENA. 353
merely of a heavy body suspended freely at an invari-
able distance from a fixed point, it is the most simple
in construction ; and yet all the highest problems of phy-
sical measurement depend upon its careful use. Its
excessive value arises from two circumstances, which
render it at once most accurate and indispensable.
(1) The method of repetition is eminently applicable
to it, as already described (p. 339.)
(2) Unlike any other instrument, it connects together
three different variable quantities, those of space, time,
and force.
In most works on natural philosophy it is shown, that
when the oscillations of the pendulum are infinitely small,
the square of the time occupied by an oscillation is directly
proportional to the length of the pendulum, and indirectly
proportional to the force affecting it, of whatever kind.
The whole theory of the pendulum is contained in the
formula, first given by Huyghens in his Horologium Oscil-
latorium,
time of oscillation =3- 141 59. . x A / length f P endulum
V force.
The quantity 3-14159 is the constant ratio of the circum-
ference and radius of a circle, and is of course known with
accuracy. Hence, any two of the three quantities con-
cerned being given, the third may be found ; or any two
being maintained invariable, the third will be invariable.
Thus a pendulum of invariable length suspended at the
same place, where the force of gravity may be considered
uniform, furnishes a theoretically perfect measure of time.
The same invariable pendulum being made to vibrate at
different points of the earth's surface, and the time of,
vibration being astronomically determined, the force of
gravity becomes accurately known. Finally, with a known
force of gravity, and time of vibration ascertained by refer-
ence to the stars, the length is determinate.
