174 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
alone, aided by analogy, could never lead to their dis-
covery. To divine these enigmas we must be guided
by theoretical ideas founded on a true hypothesis. The
theory of luminous vibrations presents this character, and
these precious advantages ; for to it we owe the discovery
of optical laws the most complicated and most difficult to
divine/
Physicists who embraced the barren emission theory
had nothing but their own native capacity and quickness
of observation to rely upon. Fresnel having once seized
the conditions of the true undulatory theory, as previously
stated by Young, was enabled by the mere manipulation
of his mathematical symbols to foresee many of the com-
plicated phenomena of light. Who could possibly suppose,
or even believe on the ground of mere common sense, that
by stopping a large portion of the rays passing through a
circular aperture, the illumination of a point upon a
screen behind the aperture might be many times multi-
plied. Yet this paradoxical effect was predicted by Fresnel,
and verified both by himself, and in a careful repetition of
the experiment in later years, by Billet. Comparatively
few persons even now are aware that in the very middle
point of the shadow of an opaque circular disc is a point
of light sensibly as bright as if no disc had been inter-
posed. This startling fact was deduced from Fresnel's
theory by Poisson, and was then verified experimentally
by Arago. Airy, again, was led by pure theory to pre-
dict that Newton's rings would present a modified appear-
ance if produced between a lens of glass and a plate of
rnetal. This effect happened to have been observed fifteen
years before by Arago, unknown to Airy ; but another
prediction of Airy, that there would be a further modifica-
tion of the rings when made between two substances of
very different refractive indices, was verified by subsequent
trial with a diamond. A reversal of the rings takes place
