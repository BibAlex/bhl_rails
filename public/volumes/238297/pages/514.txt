24 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
and in another when air is absent. The inquiry branches
out into two lines, and we ought to try in both cases
whether cutting off a supply of heat by conduction pre-
vents its evolution in friction. Now the same branching
out of the inquiry occurs with regard to every circum-
stance which enters into the experiment. Regarding
only four circumstances, say A, B, C, D, we ought to test
not only the combinations
ABCD, ABCd, ABcD, A&CD, aBCD,
but we ought really to go through the whole of the combi-
nations given in the fifth column of the Logical Abece-
darium. The effect of the absence of each condition should
be tried both in the presence and absence of every other
condition, and every variety of selection of those conditions.
Perfect and exhaustive experimentation would, in short,
consist in examining natural phenomena in all their pos-
sible combinations and registering all relations between
conditions and results which are found capable of exist-
ence. Experimentation would thus resemble the exclusion
of contradictory combinations carried out in the Indirect
Method of Inference (chapter vi. vol. i. p. 95), except that
the exclusion of any combination is grounded not on prior
logical premises, but on d posteriori results of actual trial.
The reader will readily perceive, however, that "such
exhaustive investigation is practically impossible, because
the number of requisite experiments would be immensely
great. Four circumstances only would require sixteen
experiments ; twelve circumstances would require 4096,
and the number increases as the powers of two. The
result is that the experimenter has to fall back upon his
own tact and experience in selecting those variations
which are most likely to yield him significant facts. It
is at this point that logical rules and forms begin to fail
in giving aid. The logical rule is Try all possible com-
