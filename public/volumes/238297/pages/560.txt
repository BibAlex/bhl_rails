with its vibrations, the energy of those vibrations will be
unlimited, and may fracture any body.
Let us now consider what will happen if the strokes be
not exactly at the same intervals as the vibrations of the
body, but, say, a very little slower. Then a succession of
strokes will meet the body in nearly but not quite the
same position, and their effects will be accumulated.
Afterwards the strokes will begin to fall when the body
is in the opposite phase. Thus imagine that one pen-
dulum moving exactly from one extreme point to another
in a second, should be struck by another pendulum which
makes 61 beats in a minute ; then, if the pendulums
commence together, they will at the end of 30 1 beats be
moving in opposite directions. Hence whatever energy
was communicated in the first half minute will be neutra-
lized by the opposite effect of that given in the second
half . The effect of the strokes of the second pendulum
will therefore be alternately to increase and decrease the
vibrations of the first, so that a new kind of vibration will
be produced running throtigh all its phases in 61 seconds.
An effect of this kind was actually observed by Ellicott,
a member of the Royal Society, in the case of two clocks v .
He found that through the wood-work by which the
clocks were connected a slight impulse was transmitted,
and each pendulum alternately lost and gained momentum.
Each clock, in fact, tended to stop the other at regular in-
tervals, and in the intermediate times to be stopped by
the other. Many of the most important disturbances in
the planetary system depend upon the same principle ; for
if one planet happens always to pull another in the same
direction in similar parts of their orbits, the effects, how-
ever slight, will be accumulated, and a disturbance of large
ultimate amount and of long period will be produced. The
