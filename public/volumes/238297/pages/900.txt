410 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
may meet with specimens of a race which was formerly
far more common but is now undergoing extinction, and
is nearly the ]ast of its kind. Thus we may explain the
occurrence of exceptional forms such as are found in the
Amphioxus. The Equisetaceae perplex botanists by their
want of affinity to other orders of A erogenous plants.
This doubtless indicates that their genealogical con-
nexion with other plants must be sought for in the
most distant past ages of geological development.
Constancy of character, as Mr. Darwin has said 1 , is
what is chiefly valued and sought after by naturalists ;
that is to say naturalists wish to find some distinct family-
mark, or group of characters by which they may clearly
recognise the relationship of descent between a large
group of living forms. It is accordingly a great relief to
the mind of the naturalist when he comes upon a defi-
nitely marked group, such as the Diatomaceae, which are
clearly separated from their nearest neighbours the De-
midiacese by their siliceous framework and the absence of
chlorophyll. But we must no longer think that because
we fail in detecting constancy of character the fault is
in our classificatory sciences. Where gradation of charac-
ter really exists, we must devote ourselves to defining and
registering the degrees and limits of that gradation. The
ultimate natural arrangement will often be devoid of strong
lines of demarcation.
Let naturalists, too, form their systems of natural
classification with all care they can, yet it will certainly
happen from time to time that new and exceptional forms
of animals or vegetables will be discovered, and will
require the modification of the system. A natural system
is directed, as we have seen, to the discovery of empirical
laws of correlation, but these laws being purely empirical
will frequently be falsified by more extensive investiga-
