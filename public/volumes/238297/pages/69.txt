CHAPTER III.
PROPOSITIONS.
WE now proceed to consider the variety of forms of
propositions in which the truths of science must be
expressed. I shall endeavour to show that, however
diverse these forms may be, they all admit the application
of the one same principle of influence, that what is true
of one thing or circumstance is true of the like or same.
This principle holds true whatever be the kind or manner
of the likeness, provided proper regard be had to its
degree. Propositions may assert an identity of time,
space, manner, quantity, degree, or any other circumstance
in which things may agree or differ.
We find an instance of a proposition concerning time
in the following : ' The year in which Newton was bom,
was the year in which Galileo died/ This proposition
expresses an approximate identity of time between two
events ; hence whatever is true of the year in which
Galileo died is true of that in which Newton was born,
and vice versd. ' Tower Hill is the place where Raleigh
was executed' expresses an identity of place ; and what-
ever is true of the one spot is true of the spot otherwise
defined, but in reality the same. In ordinary language
we have many propositions obscurely expressing identities
of number, quantity, or degree. ' So many men, so many
minds,' is a proposition concerning number or an equa-
tion ; whatever is true of the number of men is true of
the number of minds, and vice versd. ' The density of
Mars is (nearly) the same as that of the Earth/ * The force
