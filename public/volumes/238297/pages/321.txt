THE INDUCTIVE OR INVERSE METHOD. 295
General Solution of the Inverse Problem.
In the instance of the inverse method described in the
last section, a very few balls were supposed to be in the
ballot-box for the purpose of simplifying the calculation.
In order that our solution may apply to natural phe-
nomena, we must render our hypothesis as little arbitrary
as possible. Having no a priori knowledge of the con-
ditions of the phenomena in question, there is no limit
to the variety of hypotheses which might be suggested.
Mathematicians have therefore had recourse to the most
extensive suppositions which can be made, namely, that
the ballot-box contains an infinite number of balls ; they
have thus varied the proportion of white balls to black
balls continuously, from the smallest to the greatest
possible proportion, and estimated the aggregate proba-
bility which results from this comprehensive supposition.
To explain their procedure, let us imagine that, instead
of an infinite number, the ballot-box contained a large
finite number of balls, say 1000. Then the number of
white balls might be i or 2 or 3 or 4, and so on, up
to 999. Supposing that three white and one black ball
have been drawn from the urn as before, there is a certain
very small probability that this would have occurred in
the case of a box containing one white and 999 black
balls ; there is also a small probability that from such a
box the next ball would be white. Compound these
probabilities, and we have the probability that the next
ball really will be white, in consequence of the ex-
istence of that proportion of balls. If there be two
white and 998 black balls in the box, the probability
is greater, and will increase until the balls are supposed
to be in the proportion of those drawn. Now 999 different
hypotheses are possible, and the calculation is to be made
for each of these, and their aggregate taken as the final
