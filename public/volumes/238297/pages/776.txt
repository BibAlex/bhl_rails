Analogy as a Guide in Discovery.
There can be no doubt that discovery is most frequently
accomplished by following up hints received from analogy,
as Jeremy Bentham remarked a . Whenever a phenomenon
is perceived, the first impulse of the mind is to connect it
with the most nearly similar phenomenon. If we could
ever meet a thing wholly sui generis, presenting no
analogy to anything else, we should be incapable of
investigating its nature, except by purely haphazard
trial. The probability of success by such a process is so
slight, that it is preferable to follow up the slightest clue.
As I have pointed out already (vol. ii. p. 24), the possible
modifications of condition in experiments are usually in-
finite in number, and infinitely numerous also are the
hypotheses upon which we may proceed. Now it is self-
evident that, however slightly superior the probability of
success by one course of procedure may be over another,
the most probable one should always be adopted first.
The chemist having discovered what he believes to be
a new element, will have an infinite variety of modes of
treating and investigating it. If in any one of its qualities
the substance displays a resemblance to an alkaline metal,
for instance, he will naturally proceed to try whether it
possesses other properties common to the alkaline metals.
Even the apparently simplest phenomenon presents so
many points for notice that we have a choice at each
moment from among many hypotheses.
It would be difficult to find a more instructive instance
of the way in which the mind is guided by analogy than
in the description by Sir John Herschel of the course of
thought by which he was led to anticipate in theory one
of Faraday's greatest experimental discoveries. Sir John
