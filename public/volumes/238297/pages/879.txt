CLASSIFICATION. 389
Mr. Bentham also gives a bifurcate arrangement of
animals after the method proposed by Dumeril in his
* Zoologie Anal ytique/ this naturalist being distinguished
by his clear perception of the logical importance of the
method.
A more recent binary classification of the animal king-
dom as regards the larger classes may be found in Pro-
fessor Eeay Greene's ' Manual of the Ccelenterata/ p. 18.
Does Abstraction imply Generalization ?
Before we can acquire a sound comprehension of the
subject of classification we must answer a very difficult
question, namely, whether logical abstraction does or does
not always imply generalization. It comes to exactly the
same thing if we ask whether a species may be coexten-
sive with its genus, or whether, on the other hand, the
genus must contain more than the species. To abstract
logically is, as we have seen (vol. i. p. 33), to overlook or
withdraw our notice from some point of difference. When-
ever we form a class we abstract, for the time being, the
differences of the objects so united in respect of some
common quality. If, for instance, we class together a
great number of objects as dwelling-houses, we overlook
or abstract the fact that some dwelling-houses are con-
structed of stone, others of brick, wood, iron, &c. Very
often at least the abstraction of a circumstance increases
the number of objects included under a class according to
the law of the inverse relation of the quantities of exten-
sion and intension (vol. i. p. 32). Dwelling-house is a
wider term than brick dwelling-house. House, or building,
is more general still than dwelling-house. But the ques-
tion before us is, whether abstraction always increases the
number of objects included in a class, which amounts to
asking whether the law of the inverse relation of logical
quantities is always true. The interest of the question
