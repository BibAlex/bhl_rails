444 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
between permutations and combinations, a subject upon
which I may seem to have dwelt with unnecessary pro-
lixity in previous pages (pp. 200216). The order in
which we add quantities together does not affect the
amount of the sum, so that if there be three positive
and five negative causes of error in operation, it does not
matter in which order they are considered as acting.
They may be indifferently intermixed in any arrange-
ment, and yet the result will be the same. The reader
should not fail to notice how laws or principles which
appeared to be absurdly simple and evident when first
noticed, reappear in the most complicated and mysterious
processes of scientific method. The fundamental Laws
of Identity and Difference gave rise to the Logical Abe-
cedarium, which, after abstracting the character of the
differences, led to the Arithmetical Triangle (p. 214).
The Law of Error is defined by an infinitely high line
of that triangle, and the law proves that the mean is the
most probable result, and that divergencies from the
mean become much less probable as they increase in
amount. Now the comparative greatness of the numbers
towards the middle of each line of the Arithmetical
Triangle is entirely due to the indifference of order in
space or time, which was first prominently pointed out
as a condition of logical relations, and the symbols in-
dicating them (pp. 4042), and which was afterwards
shown to attach equally to numerical symbols, the deri-
vatives of logical terms (pp. 180, 181).
Verification of the Law of Error.
The theory of error which we have been considering
rests entirely upon an assumption, namely that when
known sources of disturbances are allowed for, there yet
remain an indefinite, possibly an infinite number of other
