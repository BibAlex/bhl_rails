THE THEORY OF PROBABILITY. 231
Three combinations give 2 tails. Probability f.
One combination gives 3 tails. Probability -J-.
We could apply the same considerations to the ima-
ginary causes of the difference of stature, the combina-
tions of which were shown in p. 213, There are alto-
gether 128 ways in which seven causes can be combined
together. Now, twenty-one of these combinations give
an addition of two inches, so that the probability of a
person under the circumstances being five feet two inches
is Y~* The probability of five feet three inches is ~^ ;
of five feet one inch is ~ ; of five feet r ~-g, and so on.
Thus the eighth line of the Arithmetical Triangle gives all
the probabilities arising out of the combinations of seven
causes or things.
Rules for the Calculation of Probabilities.
I will now explain as simply as possible the rules
for calculating probabilities. The principal rule is as
follows : /
Calculate the number of events which may happen /
independently of each other, and which are as far as
is known equally probable. Make this number the de-
nominator of a fraction, and take for the numerator the
number of such events as imply or constitute the hap-
pening of the event, whose probability is required.
Thus, if the letters of the word Roma be thrown down
casually in a row, what is the probability that they will
form a significant Latin word ? The possible arrange-
ments of four letters are 4x3x2x1, or 24 in number
(p. 201), and if all the arrangements be examined, seven
of these will be found to have meaning, namely Roma,
ramo, or am, mom, maro, armo, and amor. Hence the
probability of a significant result is -/^. f
