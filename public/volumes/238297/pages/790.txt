300 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
by Lord Rosse's telescope possesses some analogy to what
would happen in a system revolving in a dense retard-
ing medium. Let us once ascertain by the spectroscope
that there is a dense envelope of gas, and the forms of
those bodies are at once brought into harmony with the
laws of matter on this globe. Viewing such worlds as
we do from a fixed distant point, they appear variously
distorted according to the laws of perspective ; but when
we find in many objects forms which might have pro-
ceeded from the same object variously inclined to the
line of vision, analogy will aid us in determining the
real form. Thus when we see an apparent nebulous
ring, we may be unable to decide whether it is really
a ring of matter or a spherical shell, of which the ob-
liquely seen edges are alone apparent. But if elsewhere
we discover, as did Lord Rosse, another nebula present-
ing the distinct appearance of a ring seen edgeways, we
may infer with some probability from one case to the
other. By similar processes of comparison and analogical
reasoning, we may in time assign with much confidence
the absolute forms of many classes of celestial objects.
In speculations concerning the physical condition of
other planets and heavenly bodies, we must often depend
upon analogies of a very weak character. We may be
said to know that the moon has mountains and valleys,
plains and ridges, volcanoes, and streams of lava, and,
in spite of the absence of air and water, the rocky sur-
face of the moon presents so many familiar appearances
that we do not hesitate to compare them with the features
of our own globe. We infer with high probability that
Mars has polar snow and an atmosphere absorbing blue
rays like our own ; Jupiter undoubtedly possesses a cloudy
atmosphere, possibly not unlike a magnified copy of that
surrounding the earth, but our tendency to adopt an-
