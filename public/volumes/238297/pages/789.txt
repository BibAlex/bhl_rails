ANALOGY. 299
long ago as 1591, that the stars may be suns attended
perhaps by planets like our earth. This is the most
probable first assumption, supported in some degree by
very recent spectrum observations, which show the simi-
larity of light derived from many stars with that of the
sun. But at the same time we learn by the prism that
there are nebulae and stars in conditions widely different
from anything known in our system. In the course of
time the analogy may perhaps be restored to comparative
completeness by the discovery of many suns in various
stages of nebulous condensation. The history of the evo-
lution of our own world may, as it were, be traced back
in bodies less developed, or traced forwards in systems
more advanced towards the dissipation of energy, and the
extinction of life. As in a great workshop, we may per-
haps see the material work of Creation as it has variously
progressed through thousands of millions of years.
By the careful delineation and classification of the
nebulas and stellar systems, we may hope in time to find
some parallel even to that apparently space-filling system
of the Milky Way. Michell pointed out that the Pleiades
form a remarkable group of worlds, and he thought that
it might present an analogy to the sun and its immediate
neighbours. The observations of the Herschels and other
more recent astronomers, show that we really belong to
a vast stratum of worlds of a peculiar split form, in-
cluding countless myriads of stars of various sizes. The
belief in analogy is irresistible, and astronomers have
already looked into the depths of space, hoping to find
distant nebulous specks which might resemble the sup-
posed form of the Milky Way, and extend our know-
ledge to a higher order of universes. Such expectations
are probably premature, or even unfounded ; neverthe-
less in the forms of the nebulae we may find much in-
struction. The spiral form disclosed in many bodies
