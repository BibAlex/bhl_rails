CLASSIFICATION. 349
is to be selected, to the exclusion of all others. This
erroneous notion probably proceeds also in part from the
limited powers of thought and the inconvenient mechani-
cal conditions under which we labour. If we arrange the
books in a library catalogue, we must arrange them in
some one order ; if we compose a treatise on mineralogy,
the minerals must be successively described in some one
arrangement ; if we describe even such simple things as
geometrical figures, they must be taken in some fixed
order. We shall naturally therefore select that classification
which appears to be most convenient and instructive for
our principal purpose. But it does not follow that this
system of classification possesses any exclusive excellence,
and there will be usually many other possible arrange-
ments, each valuable in its own way. A perfect intel-
lect would not confine itself to one order of thought,
but would simultaneously regard a group of objects as
classified in all the ways of which they are capable.
Thus the elements may be classified according to their
atomicity into the groups of Monads, Dyads, Triads,
Tetrads, Pentads, and Hexads, and this is probably the
most instructive classification ; but it does not prevent
us from also classifying them according as they are
metallic or non-metallic, solid, liquid or gaseous at ordi-
nary temperatures, useful or useless, abundant or scarce,
ferro-magnetic or diamagnetic, and so on.
Mineralogists have spent a great deal of labour in
trying to discover a so-called natural system of classifi-
cation for minerals. They have constantly encountered
the difficulty that the chemical composition did not
run together with the crystallographic form, and the
various physical properties of the mineral. Substances
identical in the form of their crystals, especially those
belonging to the first or cubica] system of crystals, were
often found to have 110 resemblance in chemical compo-
