COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS. 221
various duration and succession, and the scheme would be
easy of execution if needed.
Let us calculate the number of combinations of dif-
ferent orders which may arise out of the presence or
absence of a single mark, say A. Thus in
i A i Ai ran i i m i \ i
we have four distinct varieties. Form them into a group
of a higher order, and consider in how many ways we
may vary that group by omitting one or more of the
component parts. Now, as there are four parts, and any
one may be present or absent, the possible varieties will
be 2 x 2 x 2 x 2, or 16 in number. Form these into a new
whole, and proceed again to create variety by omitting
any one or more of the sixteen. The number of pos-
sible changes will now be 2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2,
or 2 16 , and we can repeat the process again and again if
we wish. It will be easily seen that we are imagining
the creation of objects, whose numbers are represented
in the series of expressions
2
2 2
222
2222, and so on.
At the first step we have 2 ; at the next 2 2 , or 4 ;
2
at the third 2 2 , or 16, numbers of very moderate amount.
Let the reader calculate the next term, and he will
be surprised to find it leap up to 65,536. But at the
next step he has to calculate the value of 65,536
two's multiplied together, and it is so great that we
could not possibly compute it, the mere expression of
the result requiring 19,729 places of figures. But go
one step more and we pass the bounds of all reason.
The sixth order of the powers of two becomes so
great, that we could not even express the number of
