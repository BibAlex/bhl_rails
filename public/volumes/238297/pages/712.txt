222 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
record may remain of more than the hundredth part.
There is nothing intrinsically absurd except that which
proves contrary to logic and experience. The truest
theories involve suppositions which are most inconceiv-
able, and no limit can really be placed to the freedom of
framing hypotheses. Kepler is an extraordinary instance
to this effect. No minor laws of nature are more firmly
established than those which he detected concerning the
orbits and motions of planetary masses, and on these
empirical laws the theory of gravitation was founded.
Did we not know by his own writings the multitude of
errors into which he fell, we might have imagined that
he had some special faculty of seizing on the truth. But,
as is well known, he was full of chimerical notions ; his
most favourite and long entertained theory was founded
on a fanciful analogy between the planetary orbits and
the regular solids. His celebrated laws were the outcome
of a lifetime of speculation, for the most part vain and
groundless. We know this with certainty, because he
had a curious pleasure in dwelling upon erroneous and
futile trains of reasoning, which most other persons care-
fully consign to oblivion. But Kepler's name was des-
tined to immortality, on account of the patience with
which he submitted his hypotheses to comparison with
observation, the candour with which he acknowledged
failure after failure, and the perseverance and ingenuity
with which he renewed his attack upon the riddles of
nature.
Next after Kepler perhaps Faraday is the physical
philosopher who has afforded us the most important mate-
rials for gaining an insight into the progress of discoverv,
by recording erroneous as well as successful speculations.
The recorded notions, indeed, are probably at the most a
tithe of the fancies which arose in his active brain. As
Faraday himself said ' The world little knows how
