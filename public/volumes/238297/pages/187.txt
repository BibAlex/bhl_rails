INDUCTION.
161
the combinations of three terms, forming the premises
of fifteen essentially different kinds of arguments. The
following table contains a statement of these conditions,
together with the number of combinations which are
contradicted or destroyed by each, and the number of
logically distinct variations of which the law is capable.
There might be also added, as a sixteenth case, that case
where no special logical condition exists, so that all the
eight combinations remain.

There are sixty-three series of combinations derived from
self-contradictory premises, which with the above 192 series
and the one case where there are no conditions or laws at
all, make up the whole conceivable number of 256 series.
We learn from this table, for instance, that two pro-
positions of the form A = AB, B = BC, which are such
as constitute the premises of the old syllogism Barbara,
negative or render impossible four of the eight combi-
nations in which three terms may be united, and that
these propositions are capable of taking twenty-four vari-
ations by transpositions of the terms or the introduction
