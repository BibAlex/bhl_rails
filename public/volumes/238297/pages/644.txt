154 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
the meaning of the word. Thus if we are to speak of
what constitutes electricity, we must search for the
nearest analogy, and as electricity is chiefly characterised
by the rapidity and facility of its movements, the notion
of a fluid of a very subtle character presented itself as
most appropriate. There is the single fluid and the
double fluid theory of electricity, and a great deal of
discussion has been uselessly spent upon them. The fact
is that if these theories be understood as more than con-
venient modes of describing the phenomena, they are
grossly invalid. The analogy extends only to the rapidity
of motion, and the fact that a phenomenon occurs suc-
cessively at different points of the body. The so-called
^electric fluid adds nothing to the weight of the conductor,
and to suppose that it really consists of particles of matter
would be even more absurd than to reinstate the Corpus-
cular theory of light. An infinitely closer analogy exists
between electricity and light undulations, which are about
equally rapid in propagation ; and while we shall probably
~ continue for a long time to talk of the electric fluid, there
can be no doubt that this expression merely represents
some phase of molecular motion, some wave of disturbance
propagating itself at one time through material con-
ductors, at another time through the ethereal basis of
light. The invalidity of these fluid theories is moreover
shown in the fact that they have not led to the invention
of a single new experiment. When we speak of heat as
^flowing from one body to another, we likewise use a
descriptive hypothesis merely ; for Lambert's theory of
the fluid motion of heat is no better than the Corpuscular
theory of light.
Among these merely descriptive hypotheses I should
be inclined to place Newton's theory of Fits of Easy
Reflection and Refraction. That theory has been since ex-
ploded by actual discordance with fact, but even when
