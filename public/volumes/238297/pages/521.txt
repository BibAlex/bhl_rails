EXPERIMENT. 31
If we want to prove that oxygen is necessary to life, we
must not put a rabbit into a vessel from which the oxygen
has been exhausted by a burning candle. We should then
have not only an absence of oxygen, but an addition of
carbonic acid, which may have been the destructive agent.
For a similar reason Lavoisier avoided the use of atmo-
spheric air in experiments on combustion, because air was
not a simple substance, and the presence of nitrogen might
impede or even alter the effect of oxygen. As Lavoisier
expressly remarks f , 'In performing experiments, it is a
necessary principle, which ought never to be deviated
from, that they be simplified as much as possible, and that
every circumstance capable of rendering their results com-
plicated be carefully removed/ It has also been well said
by CuvierS that the method of physical inquiry consists in
isolating bodies, reducing them to their utmost simplicity,
and in bringing each of their properties separately into
action, either mentally or by experiment.
The electro-magnet has been of the utmost service in
the investigation of the magnetic properties of matter, by
allowing of the production or removal of a most powerful
magnetic force without disturbing any of the other ar-
rangements of the experiment. Many of Faraday's most
valuable experiments would have been frustrated had it
been necessary to introduce a heavy permanent magnet,
which could not be suddenly moved without shaking the
whole apparatus, disturbing the air, producing currents
by differences of temperature, &c. The electro-magnet is
perfectly under control, and its influence can be brought
into action, reversed, or stopped by merely touching a
button. Thus Faraday was enabled to prove the rotation
of the plane of circular polarized light by the fact that a
certain light ceased to be visible when the electric current
