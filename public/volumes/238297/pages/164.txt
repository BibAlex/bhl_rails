we pass from either of the above propositions to the
assertion that the class of immortal men is zero, or con-
tains no objects.
It is really a question of words to what processes we
shall or shall not apply the name ' inference/ and I have
no wish to continue the trifling discussions which have
already taken place upon the subject. We shall not
commit any serious error, provided that we always bear
in mind that two propositions may be connected together
in four different ways. They may be
1 . Tautologous or identical, involving the same relation
between the same terms and classes, and only differing in
the order of statement ; thus ' Victoria is the Queen of
England' is tautologous with 'The Queen of England
is Victoria/
2. Grammatically equivalent, in which the classes or
objects are the same and similarly related, and the only
difference is in the words ; thus ' Victoria is the Queen
of England' is grammatically equivalent to 'Victoria is
England's Queen/
3. Equivalent in qualitative and quantitative form,
the classes being the same, but viewed in a different
manner.
4. Logically equivalent, when the classes and relations
are different, but involve the same knowledge of the
possible combinations.
