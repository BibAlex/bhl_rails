74 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
that which Archbishop Thomson has called ' immediate
inference by the sum of several predicates/ and his
example will serve my purpose well 1 . He describes
copper as 'A metal, of a red colour, and disagreeable
smell and taste, all the preparations of which are
poisonous, which is highly malleable, ductile, and tena-
cious, with a specific gravity of about 8.83.' If we
assign the letter A to copper, and the succeeding letters
of the alphabet in succession to the series of predicates,
we have nine distinct statements, of the form
A = AB (i) A = AC (2) A = AD (3) A = AK (9).
We can readily combine these propositions into one by
substituting for A in the second side of (i) its expression
in (2). We thus get
A = ABC,
and by repeating the process over and over again we
obtain the single proposition
A = ABCDEFGHIJK.
But Dr. Thomson is mistaken in supposing that we can
obtain in this manner a definition of copper. Strictly
speaking, the above proposition is only a description of
copper, and all the ordinary descriptions of substances
in scientific works may be summed up in this form.
Thus we may assert of the organic substances called
Paraffins that they are all saturated hydrocarbons, in-
capable of uniting with other substances, produced by
heating the alcoholic iodides with zinc, and so on. It
may be shown that no amount of ordinary description
can be equivalent to definition.
Fallacies.
I have hitherto been engaged in showing that all the
forms of reasoning of the old syllogistic logic, and an
indefinite number of other forms in addition, may be
