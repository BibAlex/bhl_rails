PRINCIPLES OF NUMBER.
NOT without much reason did Pythagoras represent the
world as ruled by number. Into almost all our acts of
clear thought number enters, and in proportion as we can
define numerically we enjoy exact and useful knowledge
of the Universe. The science of numbers, too, the study of
the principles and methods of reasoning in number, has
hitherto presented the widest and most practicable train-
ing in logic. So free and energetic has been the study of
mathematical forms, compared with the forms and laws of
logic, that mathematicians have passed far in advance of
any pure logicians. Occasionally, in recent times, they have
condescended to apply their great algebraic instruments
to a reflex advancement of the primary logical science. It
is thus that we chiefly owe to profound mathematicians,
such as Sir John Herschel, Dr. W he well, Professor De
Morgan or Dr. Boole, the regeneration of logic in the
present century, and I entertain no doubt that it is in
maintaining a close alliance with the extensive branches of
quantitative reasoning that we must look for still further
progress in our comprehension of qualitative inference.
I cannot assent, indeed, to the common notion that
