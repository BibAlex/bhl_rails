or grammatical point of view. But grammatical usage
readily sanctions the free conversion of adjectives into
substantives, and vice versd ; we may avail ourselves of
this latitude without in any way prejudging the meta-
physical difficulties which may be involved. Here, as
throughout this work, I shall devote my attention to
truths which I can exhibit in a clear and formal manner,
believing that, in the present condition of logical science,
this will lead to much greater advantage than discussion
upon the metaphysical questions which may underlie any
part of the subject.
Every noun or term denotes an object, and usually im-
plies the possession by that object of certain qualities or
circumstances common to all the objects denoted. There
are certain terms, however, which imply the absence of
qualities or circumstances attaching to other objects. It
will be convenient to employ a special mode of indicating
these negative terms, as they are called. If the general
name A denotes an object or class of objects possessing
certain defined qualities, then the term Not-A will denote
any object which does not possess the whole of those
qualities ; in short, Not-A is the sign for anything which
differs from A in regard to any one or more of the assigned
qualities. If A denote ' transparent object,' Not-A will
denote 'not transparent object/ Brevity and facility of
writing and reading are of no slight importance in a system
of notation, and it will therefore be desirable to substitute
for the negative term Not-A a briefer mode of expression.
The late Prof, de Morgan represented negative terms by
small Roman letters, or sometimes by small italic letters k ,
and as the latter seem to be highly convenient, I shall use
a, b, c, d, e, . . . p, q, r, &c., as the negative terms corre-
sponding to A, B, C, D, E, . . . P, Q, K, &c. Thus if A
means ' fluid/ a will mean ' not-fluid/ and so on.
