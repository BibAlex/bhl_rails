long assumed by astronomers as being about 95,274,000
miles, this result being deduced by Bessel from the ob-
servations of the transit of Venus, which occurred in 1769,
and which were found to give the solar parallax, or what
is the same thing, the apparent size of the earth as seen
from the sun, as equal to S"'5j8. Now, dividing the
mean distance of the sun and earth by the number of
seconds in 8 m . 1 3 s . 3 we find the velocity of light to be about
192,000 miles per second.
Nearly the same result was obtained in an apparently
very different manner. The aberration of light is the
apparent change in the direction of a ray of light owing
to the composition of its motion with that of the earth's
motion round the sun. If we know the amount of aber-
ration and the mean velocity of the earth we can very
simply estimate that of light which is thus found to be
191,102 miles (166,072 geographical miles) per second.
Now this determination depends upon an entirely new
physical quantity, that of aberration, which is ascertained
by direct observation of the stars, so that the close accord-
ance of the estimates of the velocity of light as thus arrived
at by different methods might seem to leave little room
for doubt, the difference being less than one per cent.
Nevertheless, experimentalists were not satisfied until
they had succeeded in actually measuring the velocity of
light by direct experiments performed upon the earth's
surface. Fizeau, by a rapidly revolving toothed wheel,
estimated the velocity at 195,920 miles per second. As
this result differed by about one part in sixty from esti-
mates previously accepted, there was thought to be room
for further investigation. The revolving mirror, previously
used by Mr. Wheatstone in measuring the velocity of elec-
tricity, was now applied in a more refined manner by
Fizeau and by Foucault to determine the velocity of
light. The latter physicist finally came to the startling
