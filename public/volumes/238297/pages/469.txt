being both assumed equal to unity, in order to simplify
the calculations. In the same figure are inserted eleven
dots, whose heights above the base line are proportional
to the numbers in the eleventh line of the Arithmetical
Triangle, thus representing the comparative probabilities
of errors of various amounts arising from ten equal causes
of error. It is apparent that the correspondence of the
general and the special Law of Error is almost as close as
can be exhibited in the figure, and the assumption of a
greater number of equal causes of error would render the
correspondence far more close.
It may be explained that the ordinates, for instance
NM, nm, n'm', represent values of y in the equation ex-
pressing the Law of Error. The occurrence of any one
definite amount of error is infinitely improbable, because
an infinite number of such ordinates might be drawn.
But the probability of an error occurring between certain
definite limits is finite, and is represented by a portion
of the area of the curve. Thus the probability that an
error, positive or negative, not exceeding unity will occur,
is represented by the area ~M.mnn'm', in short, by the area
standing upon the line nn'. Since every observation
must either have some definite error or none at all, it
follows that the whole area of the curve should be con-
sidered as the unit expressing certainty, and the proba-
bility of an error falling between particular limits will
then be expressed by the ratio which the area of the
curve between those limits bears to the whole area of
the curve.
Derivation of the Law of Error from Simple
Logical Principles.
It is worthy of notice that this Law of Error, abstruse
though the subject may seem, is really founded upon the
simplest principles. It arises entirelv out of the difference
