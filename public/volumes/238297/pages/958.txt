468 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
its sign by passing, as mathematicians say, either through
zero or through infinity. In the latter case there must be
one intermediate value of the variable for which the
variant is indifferently negative infinity and positive in-
finity. Mathematicians may shirk the difficulty, but they
cannot make this common result of mathematical principles
appear otherwise than contradictory to our common
rtions of space.
The hypothesis that there is a Creator at once all
powerful and all benevolent is surrounded, as it must
seem to every candid investigator, with difficulties verging
closely upon logical contradiction, j The existence of the
smallest amount of pain and evil would seem to show that
He is either not perfectly benevolent, or not all-powerful.
No one can have lived long without experiencing sorrow-
ful events of which the significance is inexplicable. But
if we cannot succeed in avoiding contradiction in our
notions of elementary geometry, can we expect that the
ultimate purposes of existence shall present themselves to
us with perfect clearness ? i I can see nothing to forbid
the notion that in a higher state of intelligence much that
is now obscure may become clear. } We perpetually find
ourselves in the position of finite minds attempting in-
finite problems, ; and can we be sure that where we see
contradiction, an infinite intelligence might not discover
perfect logical harmony'?
From science, modestly pursued, with a due conscious-
ness of the extreme finitude of our intellectual powers,
there can arise only nobler and wider notions of the pur-
pose of Creation. Our philosophy will be an affirmative
one, not that false and negative one of Auguste Comte,
which has usurped the name, and misrepresented the
tendencies of a true positive philosophy. Our science will]
not deny the existence of things because they cannot be
weighed and measured. It will rather lead us to believe
