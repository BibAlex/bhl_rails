106 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
problem it is best to form, in the first place, a complete
series of all the combinations of terms involved in it.
If there be two terms A and B, the utmost variety of
combinations in which they can appear are
AB
A.b
aB
ab.
The term A appears in the first and second ; B in the
first and third ; a in the third and fourth ; and b in the
second and fourth. Now if we have any premise, say
A = B,
we must ascertain which of these combinations would be
rendered self-contradictory by substitution ; the second
and third would have to be struck out, and there would
remain
AB
ab.
Hence we draw the following inferences
A = AB, B = AB, a = ab, b = ab.
Exactly the same method must be followed where a
question involves a greater number of terms. Thus by
the Law of Duality the three terms A, B, 0, give rise to
eight conceivable combinations, namely
ABC (a)
ABc (ft)
AbC (7)
Abe (8)
aBC (e)
abC (?)
ale. (0)
The development of the term A is formed by the first four
of these ; for B we must select (a), (ft), (e), () ; C consists
of (a), (7), W ; b of (7), (J), (,), (0), and so on.
