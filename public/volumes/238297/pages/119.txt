DISJUNCTIVE PROPOSITIONS. 93
A = gem
B = rare stone
C = beautiful stone,
the proposition ( i ) is of the form
A = B | C
hence AB = B -|- BC
and AC = BC -I- C ;
but these inferences are not equivalent to the false ones
(2) and (3).
We can readily represent such disjunctive reasoning, when
it is valid, by expressing the inconsistency of the alterna-
tives explicitly. Thus if we resort to our instance of
Water is either salt or fresh,
and take A = Water
B = salt
C = fresh,
then the premise is apparently of the form
A = AB | AC ;
but in reality there are the unexpressed conditions that
* what is salt is not fresh/ and ' what is fresh is not salt ; '
or, in letter-terms,
B = Be
C = 60.
Now, if we substitute these descriptions in the original
proposition, we obtain
A = ABc | A6C ;
uniting B to each side we infer
AB = ABc l- AB6C
or AB = ABc ;
that is,
Water which is salt is water salt and not fresh.
I should weary the reader if I attempted to illustrate
the multitude of forms which disjunctive reasoning may
take ; and as in the next chapter we shall be constantly
treating the subject, I must here restrict myself to a single
