THE THEORY OF PROBABILITY. 229
in one direction. But as we do not previously know in
which way a preponderance will exist, we have no more
reason for expecting head than tail. Our state of know-
ledge will be changed, indeed, should we throw up the
coin many times in succession and register the result.
Every throw gives us some slight information as to the
probable tendency of the coin, and in subsequent calcula-
tions we must take this into account. In other cases
experience might show that we had been entirely mis-
taken ; we might expect that a die would fall as often
on each of the six sides as on each other one in the long
run ; trial might show that the die was a loaded one,
and fell much the most often on a particular face. The
theory would not have misled us : it treated correctly
the information we had, which is all that any theory
can do.
It may be asked, Why spend so much trouble in calcu-
lating from imperfect data, when a very little trouble
would enable us to render a conclusion certain by actual
trial \ Why calculate the probability of a measurement
being correct, when we can try whether it is correct ?
But I shall fully point out in later parts of this work
that in measurement we never can attain perfect coin-
cidence. Two measurements of the same base line in a
survey may show a difference of some inches, and there
may be no means of knowing which is the better result.
A third measurement would probably agree with neither.
To select any one of the measurements, would imply that
we knew it to be the most nearly correct one, which we
do not. In this state of ignorance, the only guide is the
theory of probability, which proves that in the long run
the mean of different quantities will come most nearly to
the truth. In all other scientific operations whatsoever, per-
fect knowledge is impossible, and when we have exhausted
all our instrumental means in the attainment of truth,-
