344 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
ment free from all the errors of construction, which affect
human instruments. The rotation of the earth, too, by
variously affecting the apparent velocity of ingress or
egress of Venus, as seen from different places, discloses
the amount of the parallax. It has been sufficiently
shown that by rightly choosing the moments of obser-
vation, the planetary bodies may often be made to reveal
their relative distance, to measure their own position, to
record their own movements with a high degree of ac-
curacy. With the improvement of astronomical instru-
ments, such conjunctions become less necessary to the
progress of the science, but it will always remain ad-
vantageous to choose those moments for observation
when instrumental errors enter with the least effect.
In other sciences, exact quantitative laws can occasion-
ally be obtained without instrumental measurement, as
when we learn the exactly equal velocity of sounds of
different pitch, by observing that a peal of bells or a
musical performance is heard harmoniously at any dis-
tance to which the sound penetrates ; this could not be
the case, as Newton remarked, if one sound overtook
the other. One of the most important principles of the
atomic theory, was proved by implication, before the use
of the balance was introduced into chemistry. Wenzel
observed, before 1777, that when two neutral substances
decompose each other, the resulting salts are also neutral.
In mixing sodium sulphate and barium nitrate, we
obtain insoluble barium sulphate and neutral sodium
nitrate. This result could not follow unless the nitric
acid, requisite to saturate one atom of sodium, were
exactly equal to that required by one atom of barium,
so that an exchange could take place without leaving
either acid or base in excess d .
A very important principle of mechanics may also be
