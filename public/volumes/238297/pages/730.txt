240 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
rests in his position is not so far from right as he who,
proceeding in a wrong direction, is ever increajiipg his
distance/
Arago presented a conspicuous example of Jhis high
quality of mind, as Faraday remarks ; for whenihe made
known his curious discovery of the relation of Mijagnetic
needle to a revolving copper plate, a number ojKipposed
men of science in different countries gave iB^diate and
confident explanations of it, which were all wrong. But
Arago, who had both discovered the phenomenon and
personally investigated its conditions, declined to put
forward publicly any theory at all.
*At the same time we must not suppose that the truly
philosophic mind can tolerate a state of doubt, while a
chance of decision remains open. In science nothing like
compromise is possible, and truth must be one. Hence,
doubt is the confession of ignorance, and must involve
a painful feeling of incapacity. But doubt lies between
error and truth, so that if we choose wrongly we are
further away than ever from our goal.
Summing up, then, it would seem as if the mind of
the great discoverer must combine almost contradictory
attributes. He must be fertile in theories and hypotheses,
and yet full of facts and precise results of experience.
He must entertain the feeblest analogies, and the merest
guesses at truth, and yet he must hold them as worthless
till they are verified in experiment. When there are any
grounds of probability he must hold tenaciously to an
old opinion ; and yet he must be prepared at any moment
to relinquish it when a single clearly contradictory fact is
encountered. 'The philosopher,' says Faraday k , ' should
be a man willing to listen to every suggestion, but deter-
mined to judge for himself. He should not be biassed by
k Bence Jones, 'Life of Faraday/ vol. i. p. 225.
