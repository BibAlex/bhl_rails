98 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
He showed that if a string is affected by two kinds of
vibrations, we may consider each to be going on as if the
other did not exist. We cannot perceive that the sound-
ing of one musical instrument prevents or even modifies
the sound of another, so that all sounds would seem to
travel through the air, and act upon the ear in independ-
ence of each other. An exactly similar assumption is
made in the theory of tides, which are really great waves.
One wave is produced by the attraction of the moon, and
another by the attraction of the sun, and the question
arises, whether when these waves coincide, as at the time
of spring tides, the joint wave will be simply the sum of
the separate waves. On the principle of Bernouilli this
will be so, because the tides on the ocean are almost
indefinitely small compared with the depth of the ocean.
The principle of Bernouilli, however, is only approxi-
mately true. A wave never is exactly the same when
another wave is interfering with it, but the less the dis-
placement of particles due to each wave, the less in a still
higher degree is the effect of one wave upon the other.
In recent years Helmholtz was led to suspect that some
of the phenomena of sound might after all be due to
resultant effects overlooked by the assumption of previous
physicists. He investigated the secondary waves which
would arise from the interference of considerable disturb-
ances, and was able to show that certain summation or
resultant tones ought to be heard, and experiments subse-
quently devised for the purpose showed that they might
be heard.
Throughout the mechanical sciences the Principle of the
Superposition of Small Motions is of fundamental im-
portance y, and it may be thus explained. Suppose
that two forces, acting from the points B and C, are
simultaneously moving a body A. Let the force acting
