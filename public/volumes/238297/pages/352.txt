326 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
3 . At what velocity ?
4. Is this velocity variable or uniform ?
5. If variable, according to what law ?
6. Is the direction uniform \
7. If not, what is the form of the apparent path ?
The successive answers to such questions in the case of
certain binary stars, have afforded a proof that the
motions are due to a central force coinciding in law with
gravity, and doubtless identical with it. In other cases
the motions are usually so small that it is exceedingly
difficult to distinguish them with certainty. A coincidence
of motions in some constellations has been pointed out
by Mr. Proctor, and the parallactic effect due to the sun's
proper motion has been surely detected ; but the time is
yet far off when any general results as regards stellar
motions can be established.
The variation in the brightness of stars opens an un-
limited field for curious observation. There is riot a star
in the heavens concerning which we might not have to
determine
1 . Does it vary in brightness ?
2. Is the brightness increasing or decreasing ?
3. Is the variation uniform, that is, simply proportional
to time 1
4. If not, according to what law does it vary ?
In a majority of cases the change will probably be
found to have a periodic character, in which case several
other questions will arise, such as
5. What is the length of the period ?
6. Are there minor periods within the principal
period ?
7. What is the form or law of variation within the
period ?
8. Is there any change in the amount of variation ?
