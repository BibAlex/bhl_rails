of recording with an observation the value or degree of
confidence with which they regard it, freely estimated
according to the impression of success or failure in accuracy
immediately after the observation. This value is usually
expressed in a decimal scale, so that 10 denotes the
highest degree of satisfaction with the result, and i the
least degree. Before taking the mean of the observations
each number is multiplied by its weight or value, and the
sum of the products is divided by the sum of the weights.
Thus if a, 6, c, &c., be the observed numbers, and w, w' 9 iv",
&c., the weights, then the most probable mean is
aw + lw' + cw"+ .... . p , . .,, , , , .
^, 1ms -formula, it will be observed, is
identical in form with that for finding the centre of
gravity of particles of different weights arranged in a
straight line. When we regard w, w f , w", &c., as all equal,
it becomes identical with the formula for the ordinary
mean. This method of weighting observations, now of
much importance in astronomical and other very exactly
quantitative investigations, appears to have been first pro-
posed by Roger Cotes, the editor of the * Principia/ as
pointed out by De Morgan 11 .
The practice of giving weights would open the way to
much error and abuse, if the weights were assigned when
the mean was being drawn, and when the divergence of
some results from the others would be likely to become
the guide. As a general rule the weights must be as-
signed at the moment of observation, and afterwards
rigidly maintained, and they must be assigned not from
regard to the apparent intrinsic accuracy of the result,
but the extrinsic circumstances which seem to render it
valuable. An observed result, in short, must be discre-
dited, not because it is divergent, but because there were
other reasons to suppose that it would be divergent.
