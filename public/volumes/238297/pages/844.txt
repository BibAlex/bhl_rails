in some cases and not in others. Now the name correla-
tion requires to be used with the same qualification.
Things are correlated (con, relata) when they are so re-
lated or bound to each other that where one is the other
is, and where one is not the other is not. Throughout
this work we have then been dealing with correlations.
In geometry the occurrence of three equal angles in a
triangle is correlated with the existence of three equal
sides ; in physics gravity is correlated with inertia ; in
botany exogenous growth is correlated with the posses-
sion of two cotyledons, or the production of flowers with
that of spiral vessels. But it is in the classificatory
sciences especially that the word correlation has been em-
ployed.
We find it stated that in the class Mammalia the
possession of two occipital condyles, with a well-ossified
basi-occipital, is correlated with the possession of man-
dibles, each ram us of which is composed of a single piece
of bone, articulated with the squamosal element of the
skull, and also with the possession of mammas and non-
nucleated red blood-corpuscles. Professor Huxley remarks d
that this statement of the character of the class mammalia
is something more than an arbitrary definition ; it is a
statement of a law of correlation or co-existence of animal
structures, from which most important conclusions are
deducible. It involves a generalization to the effect that
in nature the structures mentioned are always found
associated together. This simply amounts to saying that
the formation of the class mammalia involves an act of
inductive discovery, and results in the establishment of
certain empirical laws of nature. Professor Huxley has
excellently expressed the mode in which discoveries of this
kind enable naturalists to make deductions or predictions
