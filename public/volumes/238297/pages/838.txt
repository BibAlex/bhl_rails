348 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Professor Huxley has defined the process of classifica-
tion in the following terms b . * By the classification of any
series of objects, is meant the actual or ideal arrange-
ment together of those which are like and the separation
of those which are unlike ; the purpose of this arrange-
ment being to facilitate the operations of the mind in
clearly conceiving and retaining in the memory the cha-
racters of the objects in question/
This statement is doubtless correct, so far as it goes,
but it does not include all that Professor Huxley himself
implicitly treats under classification. He is fully aware
that deep correlations, or in other terms deep uniformi-
ties or laws of nature, will be disclosed by any well
chosen and profound system of classification. I should
therefore propose to modify the above statement, as fol-
lows : ' By the classification of any series of objects, is
meant the actual or ideal arrangement together of those
which are like and the separation of those which are
unlike, the purpos'e of this arrangement being, primarily,
to disclose the correlations or laws of union of proper-
ties or circumstances, and, secondarily, to facilitate the
operations of the mind in clearly conceiving and retain-
ing in the memory the characters of the objects in
question/
Multiplicity of Modes of Classification.
In approaching the question how any given group
of objects may best be classified, let it be remarked that
there must generally be an unlimited number of modes
of classifying any group of objects. Misled, as we shall
see, by the problem of classification in the natural sciences,
philosophers often seem to think that in each subject
there must be one essentially natural classification which
