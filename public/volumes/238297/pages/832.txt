342 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
considered as little short of the miraculous when first
perceived. The electric telegraph was a visionary dream
among mediaeval physicists ; it has hardly yet ceased to
excite our wonder; to our descendants centuries hence
it will probably appear inferior in ingenuity to some
inventions which they will possess. Now every strange
phenomenon may be a secret spring which, if rightly
touched, will open the door to new chambers in the palace
of nature. To refuse to believe, then, in the occurrence of
anything new and strange would be to neglect the most
precious chances of discovery. We may say with Hooke
that ' the believing strange things possible may perhaps
be an occasion of taking notice of such things as another
would pass by without regard as useless/ We are not,
therefore, to shut our ears even to such apparently absurd
stories as those concerning second sight, clairvoyance,
animal magnetism, ode force, table-turning, or any of the
popular delusions which from time to time are current.
The facts recorded concerning these matters are facts in
some sense or other, and they demand explanation, either
as new natural phenomena, or as the results of combined
credulity and imposture. Most of the statements con-
cerning the supposed phenomena referred to have been,
or by careful investigation would doubtless be, referred to
the latter head, and the absence of any appearance of
scientific ability or care in many of those who describe
them, is sufficient to cast a doubt upon their value. It is
mainly upon this ground, and not on account merely of
the strangeness and intrinsic improbability of the state-
ments made that we should hesitate to accept them. Cer-
tainly in the obscure phenomena of mind, those relating
to memory, dreams, somnambulism, and other peculiar
actions or states of the nervous system, there are many
inexplicable and almost incredible facts, and it is equally
unphilosophical to believe or to disbelieve without clear
