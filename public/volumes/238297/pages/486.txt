460 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
found and original remarks concerning the theory generally.
In Lubbock and Drink water's work on ' Probability,' in the
Library of Useful Knowledge, we have a very concise but
good statement of a number of important problems. The
Rev. W. A. Whitworth has given, in an interesting little
work entitled ' Choice and Chance,' a number of good illus-
trations of the calculations both in the theories of Com-
binations and Probabilities. In Mr. Todhunter's admirable
History we have an exhaustive critical account of almost all
writings upon the subject of probability down, to the cul-
mination of the theory in Laplace's works. In spite of the
existence of these and some other good English works, there
seems to be a want of an easy and yet pretty complete
introduction to the study of the theory of probabilities.
Among French works the ' Traite Elementaire du Cal-
cul des Probabilites/ by S. F. Lacroix, of which several
editions have been published, and which is not difficult
to obtain, forms probably the best elementary treatise.
Poisson's ' Eecherches sur la Probabilite des Jugements,'
(Paris, 1837), commences with an admirable investigation
of the grounds and methods of the theory. While La-
place's great ' Theorie Analytique des Probabilites ' is of
course the ' Principia' of the subject, his 'Essai Philo-
sophique sur les Probabilites ' is a popular discourse, and
is one of the most profound and interesting essays ever
published. It should be familiar to every student of
logical method, and has lost little or none of its import-
ance by lapse of time.
Detection of Constant Errors.
The Method of Means is absolutely incapable of elimi-
nating any error which is always the same, and which
always lies in one direction. We sometimes require to be
aroused from a false feeling of security, and to be urged
