DEDUCTIVE REASONING. 61
other case the rule will be found capable of verification by
the principle of inference. The process when performed as
here described will be found free from the liability to
error which I have shown a to exist in Immediate Inference
by added Determinants, as described by Dr. Thomson 13 .
Inference with Two Simple Identities.
One of the most common forms of inference, and one to
which I shall especially direct attention, is practised with
two simple identities. From the two statements that
'London is the capital of England' and 'London is the
most populous city in the world/ we instantaneously draw
the conclusion that ' The capital of England is the most
populous city in the world/ Similarly, from the identities
Hydrogen = Substance of least density
Hydrogen = Substance of least atomic weight,
we infer
Substance of least density = Substance of least atomic
weight.
The general form of the argument is exhibited in the
symbols
B = A (i)
B=C (2)
hence A = C. (3)
We may describe the result by saying that terms
identical with the same term are identical with each
other ; and it is impossible to overlook the analogy to the
first axiom of Euclid that f things equal to the same thing
are equal to each other/ It has been very commonly sup-
posed that this was a fundamental principle of thought
incapable of reduction to anything simpler. But I enter-
tain no doubt that this form of reasoning is only one case
