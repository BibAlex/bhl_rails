104 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
the sum of the approximate numbers 34*70, 52*693, 80* i,
is 1 67 '5 within less than "07. So far as I know Mr.
Sandeman is the only mathematician who has traced out
the rules of approximate arithmetic, and his directions are
worthy of careful attention c . Although the accuracy of
measurement has so much advanced since the time of
Leslie, it is not superfluous to repeat his protest against
the unfairness of affecting by a display of decimal frac-
tions a greater degree of accuracy than the nature of the
case requires and admits d . I have known a scientific
man to register the barometer to a second, of time when
the nearest quarter of an hour would have been amply
sufficient. Chemists often publish results of analysis to
the ten-thousandth or even the millionth part of the
whole, when in all probability the processes employed can-
not be depended on beyond the hundredth part. It is
seldom desirable to give more than one place of figures of
uncertain amount ; but it must be allowed that a nice per-
ception of the degree of accuracy possible and desirable is
requisite to save misapprehension and needless computa-
tion on the one hand, and to secure all attainable exact-
ness on the other hand.
