THE INDIRECT METHOD OF INFERENCE. 107
Now if we want to investigate completely the meaning
of the premises
A - AB (i)
B = BC, (2)
we examine each of the eight combinations as regards
each premise ; (7) and ($) are contradicted by ,(i), and (ft)
and () by (2), so that there remain only
ABQ ()
aBC ( e )
abC (v)
abc. (0)
To describe any term under the conditions of the premises
(i) and (2), we have only to draw out the proper com-
binations from this list ; thus A is represented only by
ABC or
A = ABC,
similarly c = abc.
For B we have two alternatives thus stated,
B = ABC I aBC ;
and for b we have
b = abC [ abc.
When we have a problem involving four distinct terms
we need to double the number of combinations, and as
we add each new term the combinations become twice as
numerous. Thus
A, B produce four combinations
A, B, C, eight
A, B, C, D sixteen
A, B, C, D, E thirty-two
A, B, C, D, E, F sixty-four
and so on.
I propose to call any such series of combinations the
Logical Abecedarium. It holds in logical science a posi-
tion of importance which cannot be exaggerated. As we
proceed from logical to mathematical considerations it will
