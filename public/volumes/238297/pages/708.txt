218 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
research. They can only mean that the greater the pecu-
niary and material assistance given to men of science, the
greater is the result which the available genius of the
country may be expected to produce. Money and oppor-
tunities of study can no more produce genius than sun-
shine and moisture can generate living beings ; the inex-
plicable germ is wanting in both cases. But, just as
when the germ is present, the plant will grow more or
less vigorously according to the circumstances in which
it is placed, so it may be allowed that pecuniary assist-
ance may favour the development of intellect. Public
opinion however is not discriminating, and is likely to
interpret the agitation for the endowment of science as
meaning that science can be evolved from money or
labour.
All such notions are, I believe, radically erroneous. In
no branch of human affairs, neither in politics, war,
literature, industry, nor science, is the influence of genius
less considerable than it used to be. It is quite possible
that the extension and organization of scientific study,
assisted by the printing press and the accelerated means
of communication, has increased the rapidity with which
new discoveries are made known, and their details worked
out by many heads and hands. A Darwin now no sooner
propounds original ideas concerning the evolution of ani-
mated creatures, than those ideas are discussed and illus-
trated, and applied by other naturalists in every part of
the civilized world. In former days his labours and dis-
coveries would have been hidden for decades of years in
scarce manuscripts, and generations would have passed
away before his theory had enjoyed the same amount of
criticism and corroboration as it has already received in
fifteen years. But the general result is that the genius
of Daiwin is more valuable, not less valuable, than it
would formerly have been. The advance of military
