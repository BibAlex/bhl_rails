ANALYSIS OF QUANTITATIVE PHENOMENA. 401
dilations of a simple character, or, what is better still,
tabulate a series of such calculations for general use,
and the correction for temperature can be made with
ah 1 desired accuracy. The height of the mercury in the
barometer is also affected by capillary attraction, which
depresses it by a constant amount depending on the
diameter of the tube. The requisite corrections can be
estimated with accuracy sufficient for most purposes, more
especially as we can check the correctness of the reading
of a barometer by comparison with a perfect standard
barometer, and introduce if need be an index error
including both the error in the affixing of the scale
arid the effect due to capillarity. But in constructing
the standard barometer itself we must take greater pre-
cautions ; the capillary depression depends somewhat
upon the quality of the glass, the absence of air, and
the perfect cleanliness of the mercury, so that we cannot
with confidence assign the exact amount of the effect.
Hence a standard barometer is constructed with a wide
tube, sometimes even an inch in diameter, so that the
capillary effect may be rendered of little account 1 '.
Gay Lussac made barometers in the form of a siphon so
that the capillary forces acting equally at the upper and
lower surfaces should balance and destroy each other,
but the method fails in practice because the lower surface,
being open to the air, becomes sullied and subject to a
different force of capillarity.
In a great many mechanical experiments friction is
an interfering condition, and drains away a portion of
the energy intended to be operated upon in a definite
manner. We should of course reduce the friction in the
first place to the lowest possible amount, but as it cannot
be altogether prevented, and is not calculable with cer-
tainty from any general laws, we must determine it
