heat, disregarded the heat absorbed by the box containing
the water heated and by other parts of the apparatus,
otherwise he would in Dr. Joule's opinion, have come
nearly to the correct result.
It is surprising to learn the number of causes of error
which enter into even the simplest experiment, when we
strive to attain the most rigid accuracy. Thus we cannot
perform the simple experiment of compressing a portion
of gas in a bent tube by a column of mercury, in order to
test the truth of Boyle's Law, without paying regard to,
( i ) the variations of atmospheric pressure, which are com-
municated to the gas through the mercury; (2) the
compressibility of mercury, which causes the column of
mercury to vary in density ; (3) the" temperature of the
mercury throughout the column ; (4) the temperature of
the gas which is with difficulty maintained invariable ;
(5) the expansion of the glass tube containing the gas.
Although Regnault took all these circumstances into ac-
count in his accurate examination of the law , there is no
reason for supposing that he exhausted the sources of
inaccuracy.
All the earlier investigations concerning the nature of
waves in elastic media proceeded upon the assumption
that waves of different length would travel with equal
speed. Newton's theory of sound had led him to this
conclusion, and experiment, or indeed the commonest
observations (see vol. i. p. 344) had sufficiently verified the
inference. When the undulatory theory came to be
applied at the commencement of this century to explain
the phenomena of light, a great difficulty was encountered.
The angle at which a ray of light is refracted in entering
a denser medium depends, according to that theory, on the
velocity with which the wave travels, so that if all waves
of light were to travel with equal velocity in the same
