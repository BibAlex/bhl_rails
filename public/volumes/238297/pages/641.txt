THE USE OF HYPOTHESIS. 151
then a ray of light, falling on the surface of a transparent
medium, will suffer an increase in its velocity of motion-
perpendicular to the surface, and the familiar law of sines
is the necessary consequence. This remarkable expla-
nation of the law of refraction had doubtless a very strong
effect in leading Newton to entertain the corpuscular
theory, and he appears to have thought that the analogy
between the propagation of the rays of light and the
motion of bodies was perfectly exact, whatever might be
the actual nature of lightP. It is highly remarkable, again,
that Newton was able to give, by his corpuscular theory,
a plausible explanation of the inflection of light as dis-
covered by Grimaldi. The theory would indeed have
been a very probable one could Newton's own law of
gravity have been applied ; but this was excluded, be-
cause the particles of light, in order that they may move
in straight lines, must be assumed devoid of any influence
upon each other.
The Huyghenian or Undulatory theory of light was
also able to explain the same phenomena, but with one
remarkable difference. If the undulatory theory be true,
light must move more slowly in a dense refracting medium
than in a rarer one ; but the Newtonian theory assumed
that the attraction of the dense medium caused the par-
ticles of light to move more rapidly than in the rare medium.
On this point, then, there was a complete discrepancy
between the two theories, and observation was required
to show which theory was to be preferred. Now by
simply cutting a uniform plate of glass into two pieces,
and slightly inclining one piece so as to increase the
length of the path of a ray passing through it, experi-
menters have been able to show that the light does move
