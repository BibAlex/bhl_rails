forbidden by the nature of space. A classification is essen-
tially a mental not a material thing.
Discovery of Marks or Characteristics.
Although the chief purpose, of classification is to disclose
the deepest and most general resemblances of the objects
classified, yet the practical value of any particular system
will partly depend upon the ease with which we can refer
an object to its proper class, and thus infer concerning it
all that is known generally of that class. This operation
of discovering to which class of a system a certain speci-
men or case belongs is generally called Diagnosis, a
technical term very familiarly used by physicians, who
constantly require to diagnose or determine the nature
of the disease from which a patient is suffering. Now
every class is defined by certain specified qualities or cir-
cumstances, the whole of which are present in every object
contained in the class, and not all present in any object
excluded from it. These defining circumstances ought
to consist of the deepest and most important circum-
stances, by which we vaguely mean those probably
forming the conditions with which the minor circum-
stances are correlated. But it will often happen that the
so-called important points of an object are not those which
can most readily be observed. Thus the two great classes
of phanerogamous plants are defined respectively by the
possession of two cotyledons or seed-leaves, and one coty-
ledon. But when a plant comes to our notice and we
want to refer it to the right class, it will often happen
that we have no seed at all to examine, in order to dis-
cover whether there be one seed-leaf or two in the germ.
Even if we have a seed it will often be very small, and a
careful^dissection under the microscope will be requisite to
ascertain the number of cotyledons. Occasionally the
