244 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
the most rudimentary notion of what constitutes reasoning
and science.
At the same time there can be no doubt that practi-
cally what we find to be true of many similar objects will
probably be true of the next similar object. This is the
result to which an analysis of the Inverse Method of
Probabilities leads us, and, in the absence of any precise
data from which we may calculate probabilities, we are
usually obliged to make a rough assumption that similars
in some respects are similars in other respects. Thus it
comes to pass that a very large part of the reasoning
processes in which scientific men are engaged, seems to
consist in detecting similarities between objects, and then
rudely assuming that the like similarities will be detected
in other cases.
Distinction of Generalization and Analogy.
There is no distinction but that of degree between what
is known as reasoning by generalization and reasoning by
analogy. In both cases from certain observed resemblances
we infer, with more or less probability, the existence of
other resemblances. In generalization the resemblances
have great extension and usually little intension, whereas
in analogy we rely upon the great intension, the extension
being of small amount (vol. i. p. 31). If we find that the
qualities A and B are associated together in a great
many instances, and have never been found separate, it is
highly probable that on the next occasion when we meet
with A, B will also be found to be present, and vice versa.
Thus wherever we meet with an object possessing gravity,
it is found to possess inertia also, nor have we met with
any material objects possessing inertia without discovering
that they also possess gravity. The probability has there-
fore become very great, as indicated by the rules founded
