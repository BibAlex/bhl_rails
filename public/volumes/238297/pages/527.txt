EXPERIMENT. 37
any 'known means ; but it seems almost certain that some
series of elements, for instance Iodine, Bromine, and Chlo-
rine, are really compounds of a simpler substance. We
must doubtless look to the production of intensely high
temperatures, as yet quite beyond our means, for the de-
composition of these so-called elements. But it may very
possibly be found that, in this age and part of the uni-
verse, the dissipation of energy has so far proceeded that
there are no sources of heat left to us sufficiently intense
to effect the decomposition of the supposed elements.
Interference of Unsuspected Conditions.
It may often happen that we are not aware of all the
conditions under which our researches are made. Some
substance may be present or some power may be in action,
which escapes the most vigilant examination. Not being
aware of its existence, we are of course unable to take
proper measures to exclude it, and thus determine the
share which it may have in the results of our experiments.
There can be little doubt that the alchemists were often
misled and encouraged in their vain attempts by the un-
suspected presence of traces of gold and silver in the
substances they proposed to transmute. Lead, as drawn
from the smelting furnace, almost always contains some
silver, and gold is associated with many other metals.
Thus small quantities of noble metal would often appear
as the result of experiment and raise delusive hopes.
In more than one case the unsuspected presence of
common salt in the air has caused great trouble. In
the early experiments on electrolysis it was founpl that,
when water was decomposed, an acid and an alkali were
produced at the poles, together with oxygen and hy-
drogen. In the absence of any other explanation for this
singular result, some chemists rushed to the conclusion
