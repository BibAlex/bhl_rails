28 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
in which the form and nature of the substance are all
important.
It is interesting to observe how carefully Newton, in
his researches on the spectrum, observed and proved the
indifference of many circumstances by actual trial. He
says b : ' Now the different magnitude of the hole in the
window-shut, and different thickness of the prism where
the rays passed through it, and different inclinations of
the prism to the horizon, made no sensible changes in the
length of the image. Neither did the different matter of
the prisms make any : for in a vessel made of polished
plates of glass cemented together in the shape of a prism,
and filled with water, there is the like success of the ex-
periment according to the quantity of the refraction/ But
in the latter statement, as I shall afterwards remark
(vol. ii. p. 42), Newton assumed an indifference which does
not exist, and fell into an unfortunate mistake.
In the science of sound it is shown that the pitch of a
sound depends solely upon the number of impulses in a
second, and the material exciting those impulses is a
matter of perfect indifference. Thus whatever medium,
whether air or water, or any gas or liquid, be forced into
the Siren, the sound produced is the same ; and the
material of which an organ-pipe is constructed does not
at all affect the pitch of its sound.
In the science of statical electricity it is an important
circumstance that the interior of a conducting body is a
matter of indifference, resting in a neutral state, while the
change is confined to the conducting surface. A hollow
sphere takes exactly the same charge as a solid sphere of
metal.
Some of Faraday's most elegant and successful re-
searches were devoted to the exclusion of conditions
