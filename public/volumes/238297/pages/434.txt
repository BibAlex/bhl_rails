glass. But any such envelope is sure to be more or less
affected by the magnet, so that it becomes difficult to
distinguish between three forces which enter the problem ;
namely, the magnetism of the gas in question, that of the
envelope, and that of the surrounding atmospheric air.
Faraday avoided all difficulties by employing two exactly
equal and similar glass tubes connected together, and so
suspended from the arm of a torsion balance that the
tubes were in similar parts of the magnetic field. One
tube being filled with nitrogen and the other with oxygen,
it was found that the oxygen seemed to be attracted and
the nitrogen repelled. The suspending thread of the
balance was then turned until the force of torsion restored
the tubes to their original places, where the magnetism of
the tubes as well as that of the surrounding air, being
exactly the same and in the opposite direction upon the
two tubes, could not produce any interference. The force
thus required to restore the tubes was measured by the
amount of torsion of the thread, and it indicated correctly
the comparative attractive powers of oxygen and nitrogen.
The oxygen was then withdrawn from one of the tubes,
and a second experiment made, so as to compare a vacuum
with nitrogen. No force was now required to maintain
the tubes in their places, so that nitrogen was found to
be, approximately speaking, indifferent to the magnet,
that is, neither magnetic nor diamagnetic, while oxygen
was proved to be positively magnetic f . It required the
highest experimental skill on the part of Faraday and
Tyndall, to distinguish between what is apparent and real
in magnetic attraction and repulsion.
Experience alone can absolutely decide when a com-
pensating arrangement is conducive to accuracy. As a
general rule mechanical compensation is the last resource,
