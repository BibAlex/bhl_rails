METHODS OF MEASUREMENT.
CHAPTEK XIII.
THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF PHENOMENA.
As physical science advances, it becomes more and
more accurately quantitative. Questions of simple logical
Fact after a time resolve themselves into questions of
degree, time, distance, or weight. Forces hardly suspected
to exist by one generation, are clearly recognised by the
next, and precisely measured by the third generation.
But one condition of this rapid advance is the invention
of suitable instruments of measurement. We need what
Francis Bacon called Instantice citantes, or evocantes,
methods of rendering minute phenomena perceptible to
the senses ; and we also require Instantice radii or curri-
culi, that is measuring instruments 3 . Accordingly, the
introduction of a new instrument often forms an epoch in
the history of science. As Davy said, ' Nothing tends so
much to the advancement of knowledge as the application
of a new instrument. The native intellectual powers of
men in different times, are not so much the causes of the
different success of their labours, as the peculiar nature
of the means and artificial resources in their possession 13 '.
