THE THEORY OF PROBABILITY. 235
tide, or an earthquake and a storm, the probability of
A or B happening is not the sum of their separate proba-
bilities. For by the Laws of Thought we develop A | B
into AB | Kb I aB, and substituting a and /3, the proba-
bilities of A and B respectively we obtain a./3 + a.(i ft) +
(i a) ./3 or a + /3 a . /3. But if events are incompossible or
incapable of happening together, like a clear sky and rain,
or a new moon and a full moon, then the events are not
really A or B but A not-B, or B not-A or in symbols
Ab | aB. Now if we take
IUL probability of Ab
v = probability of aB,
then we may add simply, and probability of Ab ] aB = /m -f v.
Let the reader observe that since the combination AB
cannot exist, the probability of Ab is not the product of
the probabilities of A and b.
But when certain combinations are logically impossible,
it is no longer allowable to substitute the probability of
each term for the term, because the multiplication of r
probabilities presupposes the independence of the events.
A large part of the late Dr. Boole's Laws of Thought is
devoted to an attempt to overcome this difficulty and
produce a General Method in Probabilities, by which from
certain logical conditions and certain given probabilities it
would be possible to deduce the probability of any other
combinations of events under those conditions. Boole
pursued his task with wonderful ingenuity and power, but
after spending much study on his work, I am compelled to
adopt the conclusion that his method is fundamentally
erroneous. As pointed out by Mr. Wilbrahams, Boole
obtains his results by an arbitrary assumption, which is
only the most probable, and not the only possible assump-
