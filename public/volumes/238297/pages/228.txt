202 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
The reader will see that the numbers which we reach in
questions of permutation, increase in a more extraordinary
manner even than in combination. Each new object or
term doubles the number of combinations (p. 195), but
increases the permutations by a factor continually
growing. Instead of2x2x2x2x we have
2x3x4x5x and the products of the latter
expression indefinitely exceed those of the former. These
products of continually increasing factors are constantly
employed, as we shall see, in questions both of permu-
tation and combination. They are technically called
factorials, that is to say, the product of all integer
numbers, from unity up to any number n, is the factorial
of n, and is often indicated symbolically by jj*. I give
below the factorials up to that of fifteen :
6 = 1.2.3
24 = 1.2 . 3.4
120 = i . 2 5
720 = i . 2 .... 6
5,040 = |_7_
40,320 = !_?_
362,880 - |_9_
3,628,800 = |io
39,916,800 = | ii
479,001,600 = I 12
6,227,020,800 = |][_3
87,178,291,200 = |4
1,307,674,368,000 = |5
The factorials up to [36 are given in Rees' * Cyclopaedia/
art. Cipher, and the logarithms of products up to [265
are given at the end of the table of logarithms published
under the superintendence of the Society for the Diffusion
of Useful Knowledge (p. 215). To express the factorial
[265 would require 529 places of figures.
Many writers have from time to time remarked upon
