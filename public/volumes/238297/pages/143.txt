THE INDIRECT METHOD OF INFERENCE. 117
In these combinations the only A which appears is
joined to c, and similarly C is joined to a, or A is incon-
sistent with C.
A more complex argument, also given by De Morgan f ,
contains five terms, and is as stated below, except that I
have altered the letters.
' Every A is one only of the two B or C ; D is both B
and C, except when B is E, and then it is
neither ; therefore no A is D/
A little reflection will show that these premises are
capable of expression in the following symbolic forms
A = ABc + AJO, (i)
De = DeBC, (2)
DE=DE6c. (3)
As five letters, A, B, C, D, E, enter into, these premises it
is requisite to treat their thirty-two combinations, and it
will be found that fourteen of them remain consistent with
the premises, namely
ABcdE " aRCVe abCdE
KEcde aBCdE abCde
AbCdE aRCde abcDft
AbCde aBcdE abcdft
aBcde abode.
Now if we examine the first four combinations, all of
which contain A, we find that they none of them contain
D ; or again if we select those which contain D, we have
only two, thus
D = aBCDe I a&cDE.
Hence it is clear that no A is D, and vice versa no D is A.
We might also draw many other conclusions from the
premises ; for instance
DE = a&cDE,
or D and E never meet but in the absence of A, B, and C.
