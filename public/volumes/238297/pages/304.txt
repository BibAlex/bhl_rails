278 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
By a similar mode of reasoning we every day arrive,
and validly arrive, at conclusions approximating to cer-
tainty. Whenever we observe a perfect resemblance
between two objects, as, for instance, two printed pages,
two engravings, two coins, two foot-prints, we are warranted
in asserting that they proceed from the same type, the
same plate, the same pair of dies, or the same boot. And
why 1 Because it is almost impossible that with different
types, plates, dies, or boots some minute distinction of
form should not be discovered. It is barely possible for
the hand of the most skilful artist to make two objects
alike, so that mechanical repetition is the only probable
explanation of exact similarity. We can often establish
with extreme probability that one document is copied
from another. Suppose that each document contains
10,000 words, and that the same word is incorrectly
spelt in each. There is then a probability of less than
i in 10,000 that the same mistake should be made in
each.
If we meet with a second error occurring in each docu-
ment, the probability is less than i in 10,000 x 9999, that
such two coincidences should occur by chance, and the
numbers grow with extreme rapidity for more numerous
'coincidences. We cannot indeed make any precise calcu-
lations without taking into account the character of the
errors committed, concerning the conditions of which we
have no accurate means of estimating probabilities.
Nevertheless, abundant evidence may thus be obtained
as to the derivation of documents from each other. In
the examination of many sets of logarithmic tables, six
remarkable errors were found to be present in all but
two, and it was proved that tables printed at Paris, Berlin,
Florence, Avignon, and even in China, besides thirteen
sets printed in England, between the years 1633 and
1822, were derived directly or indirectly from some
