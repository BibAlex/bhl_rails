INTRODUCTION.
nising the operation of Law and of Design. In the
material framework of this world, substances and forces
present themselves in definite and stable combinations.
All things are not in perpetual flux, as ancient philoso-
phers held. Element remains element ; iron changes not
into gold, nor oxygen into hydrogen. With suitable pre-
cautions we can calculate upon finding the same thing
again endowed with the same properties. The con-
stituents of the globe, indeed, appear in almost endless
combinations ; but each combination bears its fixed cha-
racter, and when resolved is found to be the compound of
definite substances. Misapprehensions must continually
occur, owing to the limited extent of our experience.
We can never have examined and registered possible ex-
istences so thoroughly as to be sure that no new ones will
occur and frustrate our calculations. The same outward
appearances may cover any amount of hidden differences
which we have not yet suspected. To the variety of
substances and powers diffused through nature at its
creation, we must not suppose that our brief experience
can assign a limit ; and the necessary imperfection of our
knowledge should be ever borne in mind.
Yet there is much to give us confidence in science.
The wider our experience, the more minute our examina-
tion of the globe, the greater the accumulation of well-
reasoned knowledge, the fewer must become the failures
of inference compared with the successes. Exceptions to
the prevalence of Law are gradually reduced to Law
themselves. Certain deep similarities have been detected
among the objects around us, and have never yet been
found wanting. As the means of examining distant parts
of the universe have been acquired, those similarities have
been traced there as here. Other worlds and stellar
systems may be almost incomprehensively different from
ours in magnitude, condition and disposition of parts, and
