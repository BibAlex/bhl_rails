282 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
shall ultimately recognise the same fundamental principles
of mechanical science which are true on earth.
Generalization is the great prerogative of the intellect,
but it is a power only to be exercised safely with much
caution and after long training. Every rnind must gene-
ralize, but there are the widest differences in the depth of
the resemblances discovered and the care with which the
discovery is verified. There seems to be an innate power of
insight which a few men have possessed pre-eminently,
and which enabled them, with no exemption indeed from
labour or temporary error, to discover the one in the
many. Minds of excessive acuteness may exist, which
have yet only the powers of minute discrimination, and of
storing up, in the treasure-house of memory, vast accumu-
lations of words and incidents. But the power of dis-
covery belongs to a more restricted class of minds. La-
place said that, of all inventors who had contributed the
most to the advancement of human knowledge, Newton
and Lagrange appeared to possess in the highest degree
the happy tact of distinguishing general principles among
a multitude of objects enveloping them, and this tact
he conceived to be the true characteristic of scientific
genius .
