TERMS. 35
from each other, either by their various shapes and sizes,
or, in the absence of such marks, by occupying simul-
taneously different parts of space. In substance they are
one ; as regards the properties of space they are many.
We need not further pursue this distinction between
unity and plurality until we come to consider the prin-
ciples of number in a subsequent chapter.
Collective Terms.
We must clearly distinguish between the collective and
the general meaning of terms. The same name may be
used to denote the whole body of existing objects of a
certain kind, or any one of those objects taken separately.
1 Man ' may mean the aggregate of existing men, which we
sometimes describe as mankind ; it is also the general
name applying to any man. The vegetable kingdom is
the name of the whole aggregate of plants, but * plant '
itself is a general name applying to any one or other
plant. Every material object may be conceived as divi-
sible into parts, and is therefore collective as regards
those parts. The animal body is made up of cells and
fibres, a crystal of molecules ; wherever physical division,
or as it has been called partition, is possible, there we
deal in reality with a collective whole. Thus the greater
number of general terms are at the same time collective
as regards each individual whole which they denote.
It need hardly be pointed out that we must not infer
of a collective whole what we know of the parts, nor of
the parts what we know only of the whole. The relation
of whole and part is not one of identity, and does not
allow of substitution. There may nevertheless be qualities
or circumstances which are true alike of the whole and its
parts. Thus a number of organ pipes tuned in unison
produce an aggregate of sound which is of exactly the same
