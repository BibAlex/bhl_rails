remote from their condensing points. Now, it is found
that if we compare liquids for instance, different kinds
of alcohols not at equal temperatures, "but at points
equally distant from their respective boiling-points, the
laws and coefficients of expansion are nearly equal. The
vapour-tensions of liquids also are much more nearly
equal, when thus compared at corresponding points,
and the boiling-points themselves appear to be simply
related to the chemical composition in many cases. No
doubt the progress of investigation will often enable us
to discover generality, where we at present only see
variety and puzzling complexity.
In some cases substances exhibit the same physical pro-
perties in the liquid as in the solid state. Lead has a
high refractive power, whether in solution, or in solid salts,
crystallized, or vitreous. The magnetic power of iron is
conspicuous, whatever be its chemical condition ; indeed,
the magnetic properties of substances, though varying
with temperature, seem not to be greatly affected by
physical changes. Colour, absorptive power for heat or
light rays, and a few other properties are also often the
same both in liquids and gases. Iodine and bromine
possess a deep colour whenever they are chemically un-
combined. Nevertheless, we can seldom argue safely
from the properties of a substance in one condition to that
in another condition. Ice is an insulator, water a con-
ductor of electricity, and the same contrast exists in most
other substances. The conducting power of a liquid for
electricity increases with the temperature, while that of a
solid decreases. By degrees we may learn to distinguish
between those properties of matter which depend upon
the intimate construction of the chemical molecule, and
those which depend upon the contact, conflict, mutual
attraction, or other relations of distinct molecules. The
properties of a substance with respect to light seem gene-
