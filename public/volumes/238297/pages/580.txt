90 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
but those of reflection and refraction, and the only diffi-
culty consisted in developing their full consequences.
There is one instructive result of the theory of error
which should always be borne in mind, namely that when
a large variable error is combined with a small variable
error, the uncertainty of the final result, as measured by
its probable error, is scarcely at all affected by the small
variable error s . Accordingly our efforts at accuracy must
be devoted to the sources of error in the order of their
magnitude. There is no use in making instruments to
measure the heat of the sun with the last degree of
accuracy, when the varying transparency of the atmo-
sphere produces uncertainties of far greater amount. It
is needless to observe a comet or other heavenly body with
the very finest instruments if it appears low down on the
horizon, where the atmospheric refraction is not accurately
determinate. In short, minuter variable sources of error
may be entirely neglected, so long as those of a consider-
ably greater amount remain beyond our powers of correc-
tion.
Discovery of Hypoihetically Simple Laws.
In some branches of science we meet with natural laws
of a simple character which are in a certain point of view
exactly true and. yet can never be manifested as exactly
true in natural phenomena. Such, for instance, are the
laws concerning what is called a perfect gas. The gaseous
state of matter is that in which the general properties of
matter are exhibited in the simplest and most general
manner. There is much advantage accordingly in ap-
proaching the question of molecular mechanics from this
side. But when we ask the question What is a gas ?
the answer must be a hypothetical one. Finding that
