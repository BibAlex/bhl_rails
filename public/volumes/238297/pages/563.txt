THEORY OF APPROXIMATION. 73
theoretical point of view, the planets never move according
to those laws. Even if we could observe the motions of a
planet, of a perfect globular form, free from all perturbing
or retarding forces, we could never perfectly prove that it
moved in an ellipse. To prove the elliptical form we
should have to measure infinitely small angles, and in-
finitely small fractions of a second ; we should have to
perform impossibilities. All we can do is to show that
the motion of an unperturbed planet approaches very
nearly to the form of an ellipse, and the more nearly the
more accurately our observations are made. But if we go
on to assert that the path is an ellipse we pass beyond
our data, and make an assumption which may be more or
less probable, but cannot be proved, in the strict sense of
that term.
But, secondly, as a matter of fact no planet does move
in a perfect ellipse, or manifest the truth of Kepler's laws
exactly. The very law of gravity prevents its own results
from being clearly exhibited, because the mutual pertur-
bations of the planets distort the elliptical paths. Those
laws again hold exactly true only of infinitely small
planetary bodies, and when two great globes, like the sun
and Jupiter, attract each other, the law must be modified.
The periodic time is then shortened in the ratio of the
square root of the number expressing the sun's mass, to
that of the sum of the numbers expressing the masses of
the sun and planet, as was shown by Newton a . Even at
the present day discrepancies exist between the observed
dimensions of the planet's orbits and their theoretical
magnitudes, after making allowance for all disturbing
causes b . Nothing, in fact, is more certain in scientific
method than that approximate coincidence can alone be
expected. In the measurement of continuous quantity
