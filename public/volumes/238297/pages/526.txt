36 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
We can hardly realize now the importance of the in-
vention of the air-pump, previous to which it was exceed-
ingly difficult to make any experiment except under the
ordinary pressure of the atmosphere. The Torricellian
vacuum had been employed by the philosophers of the
Accademia del Cimento to show the behaviour of water,
smoke, sound, magnets, electric substances, &c., in vacuo,
but their experiments were often unsuccessful from the
difficulty of excluding air .
Among the most constant circumstances under which
we live is the force of gravity, which does not vary,
except by a slight fraction of its. amount, in any part
of the earth's crust or atmosphere to which we can
attain. Now this force is often sufficient to overbear and
disguise various actions ; for instance, the mutual gravi-
tation of small bodies. It was an interesting experi-
ment of Plateau to withdraw substances from the action
of gravity by suspending them in liquids of exactly the
same specific gravity. Thus a quantity of oil poured
into the middle of a suitable mixture of alcohol and
water, assumes a spherical shape which, on being made to
rotate, becomes spheroidal, and then successively sepa-
rates into a ring and a group of spherules. Thus we
have at least an illustration of the mode in which the
planetary system may have been produced?, though it is
to be remembered that the extreme difference of scale
prevents our arguing with confidence from the experiment
to the conditions of the nebular theory.
It is possible that the so-called elements are elementary
only to us, because we are restricted to temperatures at
whi|h they are fixed. Lavoisier carefully defined an
element as a substance which cannot be decomposed by
' Essayes of Natural Experiments made in the Accademia del Cimento.
