DEDUCTIVE REASONING. 71
The great importance of this process of inference arises
from the fact that the conclusion is more simple and
general than either of the premises, and contains as much
information as both of them put together. It is on this
account constantly employed in inductive investigation,
as will afterwards be more fully explained, and it is the
natural mode by which we arrive at a conviction of the
truth of simple identities as existing between classes of
numerous objects.
Inference of a Limited from Two Partial Identities.
We have just considered arguments which are of the
type treated by Aristotle in the first figure of the
syllogism. But there are two other types of argument
which employ a pair of partial identities. If our premises
are, as shown in these symbols,
B = AB (i)
B = CB, (2)
we may substitute for B either by (i) in (2) or by (2) in
(i), and by both modes we obtain the conclusion
AB = CB, (3)
a proposition of the kind which we have called a limited
identity (p. 51). Thus, for example,
Potassium = potassium metal (i)
Potassium = potassium floating on water ; (2)
hence
Potassium metal = potassium floating on water. (3)
Now this is really a syllogism of the mood Darapti in the
third figure, except that we obtain a conclusion of a much
more exact character than the old syllogism gives. From
the premises ' Potassium is a metal ' and ' Potassium floats
on water,' Aristotle would have inferred that ' Some
metals float on water/ But if inquiry were made what
the some metals are, the answer would certainly be ' Metal
which is potassium.' Hence Aristotle's conclusion simply
