THE INDIRECT METHOD OF INFERENCE. 99
logic gives the inference without the use of any geo-
metrical reasoning. I conceive however that v logic gives
the inference only by an indirect process. De Morgan
claims 'to see identity in every A is B and every not-B
is not-A, by a process of thought prior to syllogism/
But whether prior to syUogism or not, I claim that it
is not prior to the laws of thought and the process of
substitutive inference by which it may be undoubtedly
demonstrated.
Employment of the Contrapositive Proposition.
We can frequently employ the contrapositive form of
a proposition by the method of substitution ; and certain
moods of the ancient syllogism, which we have hitherto
passed over, may thus be satisfactorily comprehended
in our system. Take for instance the following syllogism
in the mood Camestres :-
' Whales are not true fish : for they do not respire
water, whereas true fish do respire water.'
Let us take
A = whales,
B = true fish,
C = respiring water.
The premises are of the form
A = Ac, (i)
B = BC. (2)
Now, by the process of contraposition we obtain from (2)
c = be,
and we can substitute this expression for c in (i), ob-
taining
A = Abe,
or ' Whales are not true fish, not respiring water/
The mood Cesare does not really differ from Camestres
except in the order of the premises, and it could be
exhibited in an exactly similar manner.
