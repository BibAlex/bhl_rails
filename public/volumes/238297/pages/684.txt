attributed to various inconsiderable sources of error in the
experimental processes. The strict method of procedure
is to calculate, if possible, the probable error of the mean
of the observed results (vol. i. p. 451), and then observe
whether the theoretical result falls within the limits of
probable error. If it does, and if, as we may say, the
experimental results agree as well with theory as they
agree with each other, then the probability of the theory
is much increased, and we may employ the theory with
more confidence in the anticipation of further results.
The probable error, it should be remembered, gives a
measure only of the effects of incidental and variable
sources of error, but in no way or degree indicates the
amount of fixed causes of error. Thus, if the mean results
of any two modes of determining a quantity are so far
apart that the limits of probable error do not overlap, we
may infer the probable existence of some overlooked source
of permanent error in one or both modes. We will further
consider in a subsequent section the accordance or dis-
cordance of measurements.
Quantities determined by Theory and verified by
Measurement.
One of the most satisfactory tests of a theory consists
in its application not only to predict the nature of a
phenomenon, and the circumstances in which it may be
observed, but also to assign the precise quantity of the
phenomenon. If we can subsequently apply accurate
instruments and measure the amount of the phenomenon
witnessed, we have an excellent opportunity of verifying
or negativing the theory. It was in this manner that
Newton first attempted to verify his theory of gravitation.
He knew approximately the velocity produced in falling
bodies at the earth's surface, and if the law of the inverse
