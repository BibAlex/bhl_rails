272 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
atmosphere to prevent the existence of undulations in-
comparably more rapid than aDy of which we are con-
scious, we may infer, by the principle of continuity, that
such undulations probably exist.
There are many habitual actions which we perform we
know not how. So rapidly are many . acts of mind ac-
complished that analysis seems impossible. We can only
investigate them when in process of formation, observing
that the best formed habit or instinct is slowly and con-
tinuously acquired, and it is in the early stages that we
can perceive the rationale of the process.
Let it be observed that this principle of continuity
must be held of much weight only in exact physical
laws, those which doubtless repose ultimately upon the
simple laws of motion. If we fearlessly apply the prin-
ciple to all kinds of phenomena, we may often be right in
our inference, but also often wrong. Thus, before the
development of spectrum analysis, astronomers had ob-
served that the more they increased the powers of their
telescopes the more nebulae they could resolve into dis-
tinct stars. This result had been so often found true
that they almost irresistibly assumed that all the nebuloe
would be ultimately resolved by telescopes of sufficient
power ; yet Mr. Huggins has in recent years proved by
the spectroscope, that certain nebulae are actually gaseous,
and in a truly nebulous state. Even one such observation
is a real exception sufficient to invalidate previous in-
ferences as to the constitution of the universe.
The principle of continuity must have been continually
employed in the inquiries of Galileo, Newton, and other
experimental philosophers, but it appears to have been
distinctly formulated for the first time by Leibnitz. He
at least claims to have first spoken ' of the law of con-
tinuity ' in a letter to Bayle, printed in the ' Nouvelles de
la Republique des Lettres/ an extract from which is
