subject to these curious transmutations. Sometimes a
crystal embedded in a matrix is entirely dissolved away,
and subsequently a new kind of mineral is gradually
deposited in the cavity as in a mould. Quartz is thus
found cast in many forms wholly unnatural to it. A
still more perplexing case sometimes occurs. Carbonate
of lime is one of the substances capable of assuming
two distinct forms of crystallization, in which it bears
respectively the names of calcite and arragonite. Now
arragonite, while retaining its outward form unchanged,
may undergo an internal molecular change into calcite,
as indicated by the altered cleavage. Thus we may come
across crystals apparently of arragonite, which seem to
break all the laws of crystallography, by possessing the
cleavage of an entirely different system of crystallization.
Some of the most invariable and certain laws of nature
are disguised by interference of unlooked-for causes.
While the barometer was yet a new and curious subject
of investigation, its theory, as stated by Torricelli and
Pascal, seemed to be contradicted by the fact that in
a well-constructed instrument the mercury would often
stand far above 31 inches in height. Boyle showed h
that the mercury could be made to rise as much as 75
inches in a perfectly cleansed tube, or about two and a
half times as high as could be due to the pressure of
the atmosphere. Many absurd theories about the pres-
sure of imaginary fluids were in consequence put forth 5 ,
and the subject was involved in much confusion until
the adhesive or cohesive force between glass and mercury,
when brought into perfect contact, was pointed out as
the real interfering cause.
Guy-Lussac, again, observed that the temperature of
boiling water was very different in some kinds of vessels
