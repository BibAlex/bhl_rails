specially applicable to these brandies of science. What
more I may be able to say upon the subject will be better
said, if ever, when I am able to take up the closely-
connected subject of Scientific Nomenclature, Terminology,
and Descriptive Representation. In the meantime, 1 have
wished to show, in a negative point of view, that natural
classification in the animal and vegetable kingdoms is a
special problem, and that the special methods and diffi-
culties to which it gives rise are not those common to all
cases of classification, as so many physicists have sup-
posed. Genealogical resemblances are only a special case
of resemblances in general.
Unique or Exceptional Objects.
In framing a system of classification in almost any
branch of science, we must expect to meet with unique
or peculiar objects, which are so called because they seem
to stand alone, having few analogies with other objects.
They may also be said to be sui generis, each unique ob-
ject forming, as it were, a class by itself; or they are
called nondescript, because in thus standing apart it is
difficult to find terms in which to explain their properties.
The rings of Saturn, for instance, form a unique object
among the celestial bodies. We have indeed considered
this and many other instances of unique objects in the
preceding chapter, on Exceptional Phenomena. Apparent,
Singular, and Divergent Exceptions especially, are analo-
gous in nature to unique objects.
In the classification of the elements, Carbon stands
apart as a substance entirely unique in its powers of
producing compounds. It is considered to be a quadri-
valent element, and it obeys all the ordinary laws of
chemical combination. Yet it manifests powers of affinity
in such an exalted degree that the substances in which it
