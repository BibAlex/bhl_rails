CHARACTER OF THE EXPERIMENTALIST. 227
Archimedes, and the ' Principia ' forms the true Novum
Organum of scientific method. The laws which he
actually established are great, but his example of the
manner of establishing them is greater still. There is
hardly a progressive branch of physical and mathe-
matical science, excepting perhaps chemistry and elec-
tricity, which has not been developed from the germs of
true scientific procedure which he disclosed in the * Prin-
cipia' or the ' Opticks/ Overcome by the success of his
theory of universal gravitation, we are apt to forget that
in his theory of sound he originated the mathematical
investigation of waves and the mutual action of particles ;
that in his Corpuscular theory of light, however mistaken,
he first ventured to apply mathematical considerations to
molecular attractions and repulsions ; that in his prismatic
experiments he showed how far experimental verification
could be pushed ; that in his examination of the coloured
rings named after him, he accomplished the most remark-
able instance of minute measurement yet known, a mere
practical application of which by M. Fizeau was recently
deemed worthy of a medal by the Royal Society. We
only learn by degrees how complete was his scientific
insight ; a few words in his third law of motion display his
acquaintance with the fundamental principles of modern
thermodynamics and the conservation of energy, while
manuscripts long overlooked prove that in his inquiries
concerning atmospheric refraction he had overcome the
main difficulties of applying theory to one of the most
complex of physical problems.
After all, it is only by examining the way in which he
effected discoveries, that we can rightly appreciate his
greatness. The ' Principia ' treats not of gravity so much
as of forces in general, and the methods of reasoning
about them. He investigates not one hypothesis only,
but mechanical hypotheses in general. Nothing so much
