GENERALIZA TfON 245
on the Inverse Method of Probabilities (vol. i. pp. 276-
312), that whenever in the future we meet an object pos-
sessing either one of the properties of gravity and inertia,
it will be found on examination to possess the other of
these properties. This is a clear instance of the employ-
ment of generalization.
In analogy, on the other hand, we reason from likeness
in many points to likeness in other points. The qualities
or points of resemblance are now numerous, not the
objects. At the poles of Mars are two white spots
which resemble in many respects the white regions of
ice and snow at the poles of the earth. There probably
exist no other similar objects with which to compare
these, yet the exactness of the resemblance enables us
to infer, with high probability, that the spots on Mars
would be found to consist of ice and snow, if we could
examine them.
In short, many points of resemblance imply many more.
From the appearance and behaviour of those white spots
we infer that they have all the chemical and physical
properties of frozen water. The inference is of course only
probable, and based upon the improbability that aggregates
of many qualities should be formed in a like manner in
two or more cases, without being due to some single
uniform condition or cause. In reasoning by analogy,
then, we observe that two objects ABODE and
A' B' C' D' E' have many like qualities, as indicated
by the identity of the letters, and we infer that, since the
first has another quality, X, we shall also discover this
quality in the second case by sufficiently close examina-
tion. As Laplace says, ' Analogy is founded on the
probability that similar things have causes of the same
kind, and produce the same effects. The more perfect this
similarity, the greater is this probability' 13 . The nature
