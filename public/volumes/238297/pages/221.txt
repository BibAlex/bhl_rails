THE VARIETY OF NATURE, OR THE DOCTRINE OF
COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS.
NATURE may be said to be evolved from the monotony
of non-existence by the creation of diversity. It is plau-
sibly asserted that we are conscious only so far as we
experience difference. Life is change, and perfectly uni-
form existence would be no better than non-existence.
Certain it is that life demands incessant novelty, and that
nature though it probably never fails to obey the same
fixed laws, yet presents to us an apparently unlimited
series of varied combinations of events. It is the work of
science to observe and record the kinds and comparative
numbers of such combinations of phenomena, occurring
spontaneously or produced by our interference. Patient
and skilful examination of the records may then disclose
the laws imposed on matter at its creation, and enable us
more or less successfully to predict, or even to regulate,
the future occurrence of any particular combination.
The Laws of Thought are the first and most important
of all the laws which govern the combinations of pheno-
mena ; and, even though they be binding on the rnind,
they may also be regarded as verified in the external
world. The Logical Abecedarium develops the utmost
variety of things and events which may occur, and it
is evident that as each new quality is introduced, the
number of combinations is doubled. Thus four qualities
may occur in 1 6 combinations ; five qualities in 3 2 ; six
qualities in 64 ; and so on. In general language, if n be
