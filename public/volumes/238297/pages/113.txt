DISJUNCTIVE PROPOSITIONS. 87
qualities is wanting, the combined term will not apply.
Hence the negative of the whole term is
o
Not-malleable or not-dense or not-metallic.
In the above the conjunction or must clearly be inter-
preted as unexclusive ; for there may readily be objects
which are both not-malleable, and not-dense, and perhaps
not-metallic at the same time. If in fact we were required
to use or in a strictly exclusive manner, it would be
requisite to specify seven distinct alternatives in order to
describe the negative of a combination of three single
terms. The negatives of four or five terms would consist
of fifteen or thirty-one alternatives. This consideration
alone is sufficient to prove that the meaning of or can-
not be always exclusive in common language.
Expressed symbolically, we may say that the negative
of
ABC
is not- A or not-B or not-C ;
that is, a [ b [ c.
Reciprocally the negative of
P I- Q I R
is pqr.
Every disjunctive term, then, is the negative of a
combined term, and vice versa.
Apply this result to the combined term AAA, and its
negative is
a -I- a [ a.
Now since AAA is by the Law of Simplicity equivalent to
A, so a -I- a -\- a must be by the Law of Unity equivalent
to a. Each law thus necessarily presupposes the other.
Symbolic expression of the Law of Duality.
We may now employ our symbol of alternation to express
in a clear and formal manner the third Fundamental Law
