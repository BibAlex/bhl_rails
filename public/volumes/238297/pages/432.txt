remains the method of correction which was beautifully
carried out by Regnault in his determination of the latent
heat of steam. He employed two calorimeters, made in
exactly the same way and alternately used to condense a
certain amount of steam, so that while one was measuring
the latent heat, the other calorimeter was engaged in
determining the corrections to be applied, whether on
account of radiation and conduction from the vessel or
on account of heat reaching the vessel by means of the
connecting pipes d .
4. Method of Compensation.
There are many cases in which a cause of error cannot
conveniently be rendered null, and is yet beyond the
reach of the third method, that of calculating the requisite
correction from independent observations. The magnitude
of an error may be subject to continual variations, on
account of change of weather, or other fickle circumstances
beyond our control. It may either be impracticable to
observe the variation of those circumstances in sufficient
detail, or, if observed, the calculation of the amount of
error may be subject to doubt. In these cases, and only
in these cases, it will be desirable to invent some artificial
mode of counterpoising the variable error against an equal
error subject to exactly the same variation.
We cannot weigh any object with great accuracy unless
we make a correction for the weight of the air displaced
by the object, and add this to the apparent weight. In
very accurate investigations relating to standard weights,
it is usual to note the barometer and thermometer at the
time of making a weighing, and, from the measured bulks
of the objects compared, to calculate the weight of air
