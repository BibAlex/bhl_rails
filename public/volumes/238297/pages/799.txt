EXCEPTIONAL PHENOMENA. 309
It ought to be clearly understood that in no case is a
law of nature really thwarted or prevented from being
fulfilled. The effects of a law may be disguised and
hidden from our view in some instances in others the
law itself may be rendered inapplicable altogether but
if a law is applicable it must be carried out. Every
law of nature must therefore be stated with the utmost
generality of all the instances really coming under it.
Babbage proposed to distinguish between universal prin-
ciples, which do not admit of a single exception, such
as that every number ending in 5 is divisible by five,
and general principles which are more frequently obeyed
than violated, as that 'men will be governed by what
they believe to be their interest 3 / But in a scientific
point of view general principles must be universal as
regards some distinct class of objects, or they are not
principles at all. If a law to which exceptions exist is
stated without allusion to those exceptions, the state-
ment is erroneous. I have no right to say that 'All
liquids expand by heat/ if I know that water below
4 C. does not ; I ought to say, ' All liquids, except water
below 4 C., expand by heat;' and every new exception
discovered will falsify the statement until inserted in it.
To speak of some laws as being generally true, meaning
not universally but in the majority of cases, is a hurt-
ful abuse of the word, but is quite usual. General should
mean that which is true of a whole genus or class, and
every true statement must be true of some assigned or
assignable class.
Imaginary or False Exceptions.
When a supposed exception to a law of nature is
brought to our notice, the first inquiry ought properly
