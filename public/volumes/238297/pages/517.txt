of indifference, arid the form of the surface is the condition
of such colours a .
Nearly the same may be said of the colours exhibited
by thin plates and films. The rings and lines of colour
will be of the same character whatever may be the
nature of the substance ; nay, a void space, such as a crack
in glass, would produce them even though the air were
withdrawn by an air-pump. The conditions are simply
the existence of two reflecting surfaces separated by a very
small space, though it should be added that the refractive
index of the intervening substance has some influence on
the exact nature of the colour produced at any point.
When a ray of light passes close to the edge of an
opaque body, a portion of the light appears to be bent
towards it, and produces coloured fringes within the
shadow of the body. Newton attributed this inflexion of
light to the attraction of the opaque body for the supposed
particles of light, although he was aware that the nature
of the surrounding medium, whether air or other pellucid
substance, exercised no apparent influence on the pheno-
mena. Gravesande proved however that the character of
the fringes is exactly the same, whether the body be dense
or rare, .compound or elementary. A wire has exactly the
same effect as a hair of the same thickness. Even the
form of the obstructing edge was subsequently shown to
be a matter of indifference by Fresnel, and the interference
spectrum, or the spectrum seen when light passes through
a fine grating is absolutely the same whatever be the form
or chemical nature of the bars forming the grating. Thus
it appears that the stoppage of a portion of a beam of
light is the sole necessary condition for the diffraction
or inflexion of light ; and the phenomenon is shown to
bear no analogy to the reflection and refraction of light,
