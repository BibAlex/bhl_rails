THE LAW Off ERROR. 437
the necessary calculations would much reduce the utility
of the theory.
By a process of reasoning, which it would be undesirable
to attempt to follow in detail in this place, it is shown
that, under these conditions, the most probable result of
any series of recorded observations is that which makes \
the sum of the squares of the errors the least possible. *
Let a, 1), c, &c., be the results of observation, and x the
quantity selected as the most probable, that is the most
free from unknown errors : then we must determine x so
that (a - xf + (I- x) 2 4- (c - x) 2 + . . . . shall be the least
possible quantity. Thus we arrive at the celebrated
Method of Least Squares, as it is usually called, which
appears to have been first distinctly put in practice by
Gauss in 1795, while Legendre first published in 1806 an
account of the process in his work, entitled, ' Nouvelles
Methodes pour la determination des Orbites des Cometes.'
It is worthy of notice, however, that Roger Cotes had
long previously recommended a method of equivalent
nature in his tract, ' Estimatio Erroris in Mixta Mathesi d .'
Herschel's Geometrical Proof.
A second method of demonstrating the Principle of
Least Squares was proposed by Sir John Herschel, and
although only applicable to geometrical notions, it is re-
markable as showing that from whatever point of view
we regard the subject, the same principle will be detected.
After assuming that some general law must exist, and
that it is subject to the general principles of proba-
bility, he supposes that a ball is dropped from a high
point with the intention that it shall strike a given mark
on a horizontal plane. In the absence of any known
causes of deviation it will either strike that mark, or, as
d De Morgan, 'Penny Cyclopaedia,' art. Least Squares.
