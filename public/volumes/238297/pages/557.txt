METHOD OF VARIATIONS. 67
Professor Piazzi Smyth and Mr. E. J. Stone, that the
temperature of the earth's surface as indicated by sunken
thermometers gives some evidence of a like period. The
existence of a periodic cause having once been established,
it is quite to be expected, according to the principle of
forced vibrations, that its influence will be more or less
considerable in all meteorological phenomena.
Perhaps the most mysterious part of these investiga-
tions is that which refers the phenomena to the planetary
configurations as an ulterior cause. Professor Balfour
Stewart, with Messrs. Warren de la Kue and Loewy,
by laborious researches discovered a periodic change of
584 days in the sun spots, coincident with changes in the
relative positions of the Earth, Jupiter, and Venus. It
has since been rendered probable by the researches of
Dr. Kirk wood and others, that Schwabe's eleven -year
period is due to the action of Mercury. Several other
periods of more or less importance have been supposed to
exist, but the subject is yet open to much more inquiry.
Integrated Variations.
In considering the infinite variety of modes in which
one effect may depend upon another, we must set apart in
a distinct class those which arise from the accumulated
effects of a constantly acting cause. When water runs out
of a cistern, the velocity of motion depends, according to
Torricelli's theorem, on the height of the surface of the
water above the vent ; but the amount of water which
leaves the cistern in a given time depends upon the
aggregate result of that velocity, and is only to be
ascertained by the mathematical process of integration.
When one gravitating body falls towards another, the
force of gravity varies according to the inverse square
of the distance ; to obtain the velocity produced we
