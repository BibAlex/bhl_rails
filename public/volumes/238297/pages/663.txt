1759, and though Halley did not live to enjoy the sight,
it was actually detected on the night of Christmas-day,
1758. A second return of the comet was witnessed in
1835 nearly at the time anticipated.
In recent times the discovery of Neptune has been the
most remarkable instance of prevision in astronomical
science. A full account of this discovery may be found
in several works, as for instance Herschel's ' Outlines of
Astronomy' and 'Grant's History of Physical Astronomy/
Chapters xn and xin.
Predictions in the Science of Light.
Next after astronomy the science of physical optics has
furnished the most beautiful and early instances of the
prophetic power of correct theory. These cases are the
more striking because they proceed from the profound
application of mathematical analysis, and show an insight
into the mysterious workings of matter which is sur-
prising to all, but especially to the great majority of men
who are unable to comprehend the methods of research
employed. By its power of prevision the truth of the
undulatory theory of light has been conspicuously proved,
and it is especially to be remarked that even Newton
received no assistance from his Corpuscular theory in the
detection of new experiments. To his followers who
embraced that theory we owe little or nothing in the
science of light, and even the lofty genius of Laplace did
not derive from it a single discovery. As Fresnel himself
remarks :
' The assistance to be derived from a good theory is
not to be confined to the calculation of the forces when
the laws of the phenomena are known. There are certain
laws so complicated and so singular, that observation
