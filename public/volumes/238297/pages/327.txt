THE INDUCTIVE OR INVERSE METHOD. 301
are symptoms of disturbance which would prevent our
placing much reliance on any inference from the prevailing
order of the known planets to those undiscovered ones
which may possibly exist at great distances. These and
all like complications in no way invalidate the theoretic
truth of the formula, but render their sound application
much more difficult.
Erroneous objections have been raised to the theory of
probability, on the ground that we ought not to trust to
our a priori conceptions of what is likely to happen, but
should always endeavour to obtain precise experimental
data to guide us e . This course, however, is perfectly in
accordance with the theory, which is our best and only
guide, whatever data we possess. We ought to be always
applying the inverse method of probabilities so as to take
into account all additional information. When we throw
up a coin for the first time, we are probably quite ignorant
whether it tends more to fall head or tail upwards, and
we must therefore assume the probability of each event
as -^. But if it shows head, for instance, in the first throw,
we now have very slight experimental evidence in favour
of a tendency to show head. The chance of two heads is
now slightly greater than ^, which it appeared to be at
first f , and as we go on throwing the coin time after time,
the probability of head appearing next time constantly
varies in a slight degree according to the character of our
previous experience. As Laplace remarks, we ought
always to have regard to such considerations in common
life. Events when closely scrutinized will hardly ever
prove to be quite independent, and the slightest pre-
ponderance one way or the other is some evidence of
connexion, and in the absence of better evidence should
be taken into account.
