PROPOSITIONS. 53
very perception of an object involves its discrimination
from all other objects. But we may nevertheless be said
to detect resemblance as often as we detect difference.
We cannot, in fact, assert the existence of a difference,
without at the same time implying the existence of an
agreement.
If I compare mercury, for instance, with other metals,
and decide that it is not solid, here is a difference between
mercury and solid things, expressed in a negative propo-
sition ; but there must be implied, at the same time, an
agreement between mercury and the other substances
which are not solid. As it is impossible in the alphabet
to separate the vowels from the consonants without at
the same time separating the consonants from the vowels,
so I cannot select as the object of thought solid things,
without thereby throwing together into another class all
things which are not solid. The very fact of not possess-
ing a quality, constitutes a new quality or circumstance
which may equally be the ground of judgment and classi-
fication. In this point of view, agreement and difference
are ever the two sides of the same act of intellect, and it
becomes equally possible to express the same judgment in
the one or other aspect.
Between affirmation and negation there is accordingly
a perfect balance or equilibrium. Every affirmative propo-
sition implies a negative one, and vice versd. It is even
a matter of indifference, in a logical point of view, whether
a positive or negative term be used to denote a given
quality and the class of things possessing it. If the
ordinary state of man's body be called good health, then in
other circumstances he is said not to be in good health ;
but we might equally describe him in the latter state as
sickly, and in his normal condition he would be not sickly.
Animal and vegetable substances are now called organic,
so that the other substances, forming an immensely greater
