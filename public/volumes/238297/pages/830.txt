stances generally but not of these ; for the properties of
gases, as previously noticed (vol. ii. p. 250), usually admit
of the surest and widest generalizations. Besides, the
preciseness of the ratio of divergence points to the real
observance of the law in a modified manner. We might
endeavour to reduce the exceptions by doubling the atomic
weights of phosphorus and arsenic, and halving those of
mercury and cadmium. But this step has of course been
maturely considered by chemists, and is found to conflict
with all the other analogies of the substances and the
principles of isomorphism. One of the most probable ex-
planations is that phosphorus and arsenic produce vapour
in an allo tropic condition, which might perhaps by intense
heat be resolved into a simple gas of half the density ;
but facts are wholly wanting to support this hypothesis,
and it cannot be applied to the other two exceptions
without supposing that gases and vapours generally are
capable of resolution into something simpler. In short,
chemists can at present make nothing of these anomalies.
As Hofmann distinctly says, ' Their philosophical inter-
pretation belongs to the future . . . They may turn out
to be typical facts, round which many others of the like
kind may come hereafter to be grouped ; and they may
prove to be allied with special properties, or dependent on
particular conditions as yet unsuspected 8 /
The expansion of solids and liquids by heat is also a
general law, in which we cannot expect to find any real
anomalies, any facts indicating too wide generalization,
or even any accidental disturbing causes. The con-
traction of water and several other liquids, even of fusible
inetal, by heat, together with the few cases in which a
solid contracts by heat, must therefore be probably re-
garded as results of the very law of expansion acting in a
