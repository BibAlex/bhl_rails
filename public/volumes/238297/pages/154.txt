128 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
worked upon the keys, the machine analyses or digests
the meaning of it and becomes charged with the know-
ledge embodied in that proposition. Accordingly it is
able to return as an answer any description of a term
or class so far as furnished by that proposition in ac-
cordance with the Laws of Thought. The machine is
thus the embodiment of a true logical system. The com-
binations are classified, selected or rejected just as they
should be by a reasoning mind, so that at each step in
a problem, the abecedarium represents the proper con-
dition of a mind exempt from mistake. It cannot be
asserted indeed that the machine entirely supersedes the
agency of conscious thought ; mental labour is required
in interpreting the meaning of grammatical expressions
and in correctly impressing that meaning on the machine ;
it is further required in gathering the conclusion from
the remaining combinations. Nevertheless the true pro-
cess of logical inference is actually accomplished in a
purely mechanical manner.
It is worthy of remark that the machine can detect
any self-contradiction existing between the premises pre-
sented to it, for it will then be found that one or more
of the terms disappear entirely from the abecedarium.
Thus if we worked the two propositions, A is B, and
A is not-B, and then inquired for a description of A,
the machine would refuse to give it by exhibiting no
combination at all containing A. This result is in agree-
ment with the law which I have explained that every
term must have its negative (p. 88). Accordingly when-
ever any one of the letters A, B, C, D, a, 6, c, d wholly
disappears from the abecedarium, it may be safely inferred
that some self-contradiction has been committed in the
premises.
It ought to be carefully observed that the logical
machine cannot receive a simple identity of the form
