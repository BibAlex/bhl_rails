378 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
and not only this science but almost every other. The
true course evidently is to select, as the provisional unit
of light, some light of convenient intensity, which can be
reproduced from time to time in exactly the same in-
tensity, and which is defined by physical circumstances.
All the phenomena of light may be experimentally investi-
gated relatively to this unit, for instance that obtained
after much labour by Bunsen and Eoscoe a . In after
years it will become a matter of inquiry what is the
energy exerted in such unit of light ; but it may be long
before the relation is exactly determined.
A provisionally independent unit, then, means one which
is assumed and physically defined in a safe and repro-
ducible manner, in order that particular quantities may
be compared inter se more accurately than they can yet
be referred to the primary units. In reality almost all
our measurements are made by such independent units.
Even the unit of mass is practically an independent one,
as we have seen (p. 373).
Similarly the unit of heat ought to be simply the
unit of energy, already described. But a weight can
be measured to the one-millionth part, and temperature
to less than the thousandth part of a degree Fahrenheit,
and to less therefore than the five-hundredth thousandth
part of the absolute temperature, whereas the mechanical
equivalent of heat is probably not known to the thousandth
part. Hence the need of a provisional unit of heat, which
is often taken as that requisite to raise a unit weight of
water (say one gramme) through one degree Centigrade
of temperature, that is from o to i. This quantity of
heat is capable of approximate expression in terms of
time, space, and mass ; for by the natural constant,
determined by Dr. Joule, and called the mechanical
