possible refinement obtained a slightly higher number,
5-660.
A different method of procedure consisted in ascertaining
the effect of a mountain mass in deflecting the plumb-line ;
for ? assuming that we can determine the dimensions and
mean density of the mountain, the plumb-line enables us
to compare its mass with that of the whole earth. The
Mountain Schehallien was selected for such an experiment,
and the observations and calculations performed by Maske-
lyne, Hutton, and Playfair, gave as the most probable
result, 4*713. The difference is considerable and the result
is valuable, because the instrumental operations are of an
entirely different character from those of Cavendish and
Baily's experiments. Sir Henry James' similar determin-
ation from the attraction of Arthur's Seat gave 5*14.
A third distinct method consists in determining the
force of gravity at points elevated above the surface of
the earth on mountain ranges, or sunk below it in mines.
Carlini experimented with a pendulum at the hospice of
Mont Cenis, 6375 feet above the sea, and by comparing
the attractive forces of the earth and the mountains, found
the density to be still smaller, namely, 4*39, or as corrected
by Giulio, 4*950. Lastly, the Astronomer Royal has on
two occasions adopted the opposite method of. observing
a pendulum at the bottom of a deep mine, so as to compare
the density of the strata penetrated with the density of
the whole earth. On the second occasion he carried his
method into effect at the Harton Colliery, 1260 feet deep ;
all that could be accomplished by skill in measurement
and careful consideration of all the causes of error, was
accomplished in this elaborate series of observations 6 (see
vol. i.p. 340). No doubt Sir George Airy was much sur-
prised and perplexed when he found that his new result
