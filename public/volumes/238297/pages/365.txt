THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF PHENOMENA. 339
applicable to moving objects like the heavenly bodies, so
that its use is confined to important trigonometrical
surveys.
The pendulum is the most perfect of all instruments,
chiefly because it naturally admits of almost indefinite
repetition. Since the force of gravity never ceases, one
swing of the pendulum is no sooner ended than the other
is begun, so that the juxtaposition of successive units is
absolutely perfect. Provided that the oscillations be equal,
then one thousand oscillations will occupy exactly one
thousand times as great an interval of time as one oscil-
lation. Not only is the subdivision of time entirely de-
pendent on this fact, but in the accurate measurement of
gravity, and many important determination it is of
the greatest service. In the deepest mine, we could not
observe the rapidity of fall of a body for more than a
quarter of a minute, and the measurement of its velocity
would be difficult, and subject to uncertain errors from
resistance of air, &c. In the pendulum, we have a body
which can be kept rising and falling for many hours, in
a medium entirely under our command or if desirable in
a vacuum. Moreover, the comparative force of gravity at
different points, at the top and bottom of a mine for
instance, can be determined with wonderful precision, by
comparing the oscillations of two exactly similar pendu-
lums, with the aid of electric clock signals. To ascertain
the comparative lengths of vibration of two pendulums, it
is only requisite to swing them one in front of the other,
to record by a clock the moment when they coincide in
swing, so that one hides the other, and then count the
number of vibrations until they again come to similar
coincidence. If one pendulum makes m vibrations and
the other n, we at once have our equation pn = qm ;
which gives the length of vibration of either pendulum in
terms of the other. This method of coincidence, embody-
