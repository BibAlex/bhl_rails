THE METHOD OF MEANS. 421
earth, it is exceedingly unlikely that there is any part of
the earth exactly of that density, and, as the crust is only
about half the mean density, there must be other parts of
greater density. I may also determine the mean specific
gravity of a body composed of iron and gold, so that
there will certainly be no portion possessing the mean
density.
The very different signification of the word 'mean' in
these two uses has been fully explained by M. Quetelet 11 ,
and the importance of the distinction has moreover been
pointed out by Sir John Herschel in reviewing his work*.
It is much to be desired that scientific men would mark
the difference by using the word mean only in the former
sense when it denotes approximation to a definite exist-
ing quantity ; and average, when the mean is only a
fictitious quantity, used for the convenience of thought
and expression. The etymology of this word ' average ' is
somewhat obscure ; but according to De Morgan k it comes
from averia, ' havings or possessions/ especially applied to
farm stock. By the accidents of language averagium
came to mean the labour of farm horses to which the lord
was entitled, and it probably acquired in this manner the
notion of distributing a whole into parts, a sense in which
it was very early applied to maritime averages or contri-
butions of the other owners of cargo to those whose goods
have been thrown overboard or used for the safety of the
vessel.
