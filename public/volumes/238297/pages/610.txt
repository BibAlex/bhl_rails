Interpolation and Extrapolation.
When we have by experiment obtained two or more
numerical results, and endeavour, without further resort
to experiment, to infer and calculate intermediate results,
we are said to interpolate. If we wish to assign by
reasoning results lying beyond the limits of experiment,
we may be said, using an expression of Sir George Airy,
to extrapolate. These two operations are to a certain
extent the same in principle, but differ in practicability.
It is a matter of great scientific importance to appre-
hend precisely how far we can interpolate or extend
experimental results by extrapolation, and on what
grounds we proceed.
In the first place, if the interpolation is to be more
than empirical and speculative, we must have not only
the experimental results, but the laws which they obey
we must in fact go through the complete process of scien-
tific investigation. Having discovered the laws of nature
applying to the case, and verified them by showing that
they agree with the experiments in question, we are then
in a fair position to anticipate the results of any similar
experiments. Our knowledge even now is not certain,
because we cannot completely prove the truth of any
assumed law, and we cannot possibly exhaust all the cir-
cumstances which may more or less affect the result.
Even at the best then our interpolations will partake of
the want of certainty and precision attaching to all our
knowledge of nature. Yet having the supposed laws, our
