5. Method of Reversal.
The fifth method of eliminating error is most potent
and satisfactory whenever it can be applied, but it re-
quires that we shall be able to reverse the apparatus and
mode of procedure, so as to make the interfering cause
act alternately in opposite directions. If we can get two
experimental results, one of which is as much too great as
the other is too small, the error is equal to half the dif-
ference, and the true result is the mean of the two
apparent results. It is an unavoidable defect of the
chemical balance, for instance, that the points of sus-
pension of the pans cannot be fixed at exactly equal
distances from the centre of suspension of the beam.
Hence two weights which seem to balance each other
will never be quite equal in reality. The difference is
detected by reversing the weights, and it may be esti-
mated by adding sufficient small weights to the deficient
side to restore equilibrium, and then taking as the true
weight the geometric mean of the two apparent weights
of the same object. If the difference is small the arith-
metic mean, that is half the sum, may be substituted for
the geometric mean, from which it will not appreciably
differ.
This method of reversal is most extensively employed
in practical astronomy. The apparent elevation of a
heavenly body is observed by a telescope moving upon
a divided circle, upon which the inclination of the
telescope is read off. Now this reading will be erroneous
if the circle and the telescope have not accurately the
same centre. But if we read off at the same time both
ends of the telescope, the one reading will be about as
much too small as the other is too great, and the mean
will be nearly free from error. In practice the observa-
