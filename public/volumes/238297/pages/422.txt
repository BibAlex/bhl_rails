the dilatation by heat. The changes of dimension in the
containing tubes now became a matter of entire indifference,
and the length of a column of mercury at different tem-
peratures was measured as easily as if it had formed a
solid bar. The experiment was carried out by Eegnault
with many improvements of detail, and the absolute
dilatation of mercury, at temperatures between o Cent,
and 350, was determined almost as accurately as was
needful 11 .
The presence of a large and uncertain amount of error
may often render a method of experiment valueless.
Foucault's beautiful mode of demonstrating the rotation
of the earth by the motion of a pendulum was thus
frustrated. The slightest lateral disturbance of the
pendulum gave it an elliptical path with a progressive
motion of the axis of the ellipse, and this motion of an
unknown amount disguised and overpowered that due
to the rotation of the earth 1 . Faraday's laborious ex-
periments on the relation of gravity and electricity were
much obstructed, too, by the fact that it is almost im-
possible to move a large weight of iron or even lead
without generating currents of electricity, either by friction
or induction. To distinguish the electricity directly due
to the action of gravity from the greater quantities
indirectly produced would have been a problem of ex-
cessive difficulty. Baily in his experiments on the density
of the earth was aware of the existence of inexplicable
disturbances which have since been referred to the action
of electricity with much probability k . The skill and
ingenuity of the experimentalist are often exhausted
in devising a form of apparatus in which such causes
of error shall be reduced to a minimum.
