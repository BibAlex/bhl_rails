supposed act of induction, that it would succeed in all
other cases. Professor de Morgan has recorded a proposed
mode of trisecting the angle which could not be dis-
criminated by the senses from a true general solution,
except when it* was applied to very obtuse angles. 8 In
all such cases, it has always turned out either that the
angle was not trisected at all, or that only certain
particular angles could be thus trisected. They were
misled by some apparent or special coincidence, and only
deductive proof could establish the truth and generality
of the result. In this case, deductive proof shows that the
problem, as attempted, is impossible, and that angles
generally cannot be trisected by common geometrical
methods.
Geometrical Reasoning.
This view of the matter is strongly supported by the
further consideration of geometrical reasoning. No skill
and care could ever enable us to verify absolutely any one
geometrical proposition. Eousseau, in his Emile^ tells us
that we should teach a child geometry by causing him to
measure and compare figures by superposition. While a
child was yet incapable of general reasoning, this would
doubtless be an instructive exercise ; but it never could
teach geometry, nor prove the truth of any one proposition.
All our figures are rude approximations, and they may
happen to seem unequal when they should be equal,
and equal when they should be unequal. Moreover,
figures may from chance be equal in case after case, and
yet there may be no general reason why they should be
so. The results of deductive geometrical reasoning are
