square of the radius. This part of the law of gravity
may be considered as due to the properties of space, and
there is a perfect analogy in this respect between gravity
and all other emanating forces or substances, as was pointed
out in a most comprehensive and clear manner by Keill 11 .
Thus the undulations of light, heat, sound, and the attrac-
tions of electricity or magnetism obey the very same law
so far as we can ascertain. If the molecules of a gas or
the particles of matter constituting odour were to start
from a point and move from it in straight lines uniformly,
their distances would increase and their density decrease
according to the same principles.
The other known laws of nature stand in a precisely
similar position. Dal ton's laws of definite combining
proportions never have been, and never can be exactly
proved ; but chemists having shown, to a considerable
degree of approximation, that all the more common
elements combine together as if each element had
atoms of an invariable mass, assume that this is ex-
actly true. They go even further. Prout pointed out
in 1815 that the equivalent weights of the elements
appeared to be simple commensurable numbers ; and
Dumas, Pelouze, Marignac, Erdmann, Stas, and others
have gradually rendered it likely that the atomic weights
of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, and
silver, are in the ratios of the numbers i, 12, 16, 14,
35*5, and 108. Chemists then step beyond their data;
they throw aside their actual experimental numbers, and
assume that the true ratios are not those exactly indicated
by any weighings, but the simple ratios of these numbers.
They boldly assume that the discrepancies are due to
experimental errors, and they are justified by the fact
that the more elaborate and skilful the researches on the
subject, the more nearly their assumption is verified.
