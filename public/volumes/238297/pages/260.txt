234 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
one head in two throws, but in our addition we have
involved the case in which two heads also appear. The
true result is ^ -f ^ x \ or |- , or the probability of head at
the first throw, added to the exclusive probability that if it
does not come at the first, it will come at the second.
Some of the greatest difficulties of the theory and the
subtlest errors arise from the confusion of exclusive and
unexclusive alternatives. I may remind the reader that
the possibility of unexclusive alternatives was a point
previously discussed (p. 81), and to the reasons then given
for considering alternation as logically unexclusive, may be
added the existence of these difficulties in the theory of
probability. The expression
Headfirst throw or head second throw
ought to be interpreted in our logical system as including
both cases at once, and so it is in practice.
Employment of the Logical Abecedarium in questions of
Probability.
When the probabilities of certain events are given, and
it is required to deduce the probabilities of compound
events, the Logical Abecedarium may give assistance, pro-
vided that there are no special logical conditions and all
the combinations are possible. Thus, if there be three
events A, B, C, of which the probabilities are a, (3, y, then
the negatives of those events, expressing the absence
of the events, will have the probabilities i a, i /3, iy.
We have only to insert these values for the letters of the
combinations and multiply, and we obtain the probability
of each combination. Thus the probability of ABC is
a/3 7 ; of Kbc, a(i -/3)(l - 7).
We can now clearly distinguish between the probabilities
of exclusive and unexclusive events. Thus if A and B
are events which may happen together like rain and high
