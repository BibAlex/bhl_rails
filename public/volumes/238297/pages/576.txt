86 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
sphere would offer a resistance proportional to the velocity
of the moving body, and concluded that the path would
have in consequence a logarithmic character. Newton
investigated in a general manner the subject of resisting
media, and came to the conclusion that the resistance was
more nearly proportional to the square of the velocity.
The subject then fell into the hands of Daniel Bernouilli,
who pointed out the enormous resistance of the air in
cases of rapid movement, and calculated that a cannon bah 1 ,
if fired vertically in a vacuum, would rise eight times as
high as in the atmosphere. In more recent times an
immense amount both of theoretical and experimental in-
vestigation has been spent upon the subject, since it is
one of great importance in the art of war. Successive
approximations to the true law have been made, but
nothing like a complete and final solution has been
achieved or even hoped for m .
It is quite to be expected that the earliest experi-
menters in any branch of science will overlook corrections
which afterwards become most apparent. The Arabian
astronomers determined the meridian by taking the
middle point between the places of the sun when at
equal altitudes on the same day. They overlooked the
fact that the sun has its own motion among the stars
in the time intervening between the observations. Newton
thought that the mutual disturbances of the planets might
be disregarded, excepting perhaps the effect of the mutual
attraction of the greater planets, Jupiter and Saturn, near
their conjunction n . The expansion of quicksilver was long
used as the measure of temperature, in ignorance or dis-
regard of the fact that the rate of expansion increases
with the temperature. Rumford, in the first experiment
