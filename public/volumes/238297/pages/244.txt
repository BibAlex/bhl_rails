into account the semitones, it would become apparent that
it is practically impossible to exhaust the variety of
music.
Similar considerations apply to the possible number
of natural substances, though we cannot always give
precisely numerical results. It was recommended by
Hatchett^ that a systematic examination of all alloys
of metals should be carried out, proceeding from the
most simple binary ones to more complicated ternary
or quaternary ones. He can hardly have been aware
of the extent of his proposed inquiry. If we operated
only upon thirty of the known metals, the number of
possible selections of binary alloys would be 435, of
ternary alloys 4060, of quaternary 27,405, without
paying any regard to the varying proportions of the
metals, and only regarding the kind of metal. If we
varied all the ternary alloys by quantities not less than
one per cent., the number of these alloys only would
be 1 1,445,060. An exhaustive investigation of the sub-
ject is therefore out of the question, and unless some
laws, connecting the properties of the alloy and its
components can be discovered, it is not apparent how
our knowledge of them can be ever more than most
incomplete.
The possible variety of definite chemical compounds,
again, is enormously great. Chemists have already ex-
amined many thousands of inorganic substances, and a
still greater number of organic compounds ; r they have
nevertheless made no appreciable impression on the
number which may exist. Taking the number of ele-
ments at sixty- one, the number of compounds contain-
ing different selections of four elements each would
be more than half a million (521,855). As the same
