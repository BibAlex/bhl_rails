figures required in writing it down, without using
about 19,729 figures for the purpose.
The successive orders of the powers of two have then
the following values :
First order .... 2
Second order .... 4
Third order .... 16
Fourth order .... 65,536
Fifth order, number expressed by 19,729 figures.
Sixth order, number expressed by
figures, to express the number
of which figures would require
about . . . . 19,729 figures.
It may give us a powerful notion of infinity to remem-
ber that at this sixth step, having long surpassed all
bounds of conception, we have made no approach to the
goal. Nay, were we to make a hundred such steps, we
should be as far away as ever from actual infinity.
It is well worth observing that our powers of ex-
pression rapidly overcome the possible multitude of
finite objects which may exist in any assignable space.
Archimedes showed long ago, in one of the most won-
derful writings of antiquity/ that the grains of sand
in the world could be numbered, or rather, that if
numbered, the result could readily be expressed in
arithmetical notation. Let us extend his problem, and
ascertain whether we could express the number of
atoms which could exist in the visible universe. The
most distant stars which can now be seen by telescopes
those of the sixteenth magnitude are supposed to
have a distance of about 33,900,000,000,000,000 miles. u
