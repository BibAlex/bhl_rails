CHAPTER XI.
PHILOSOPHY OF INDUCTIVE INFERENCE.
WE have inquired into the nature of the process of
perfect induction, whereby we pass backwards from certain
observed combinations of qualities or events, to the logical
conditions governing such combinations. We have also
investigated the grounds of that theory of probability,
which must be our guide when we leave certainty behind
us, and dilute knowledge with ignorance. There is now
before us the difficult task of endeavouring to decide how,
by the aid of that theory, we can ascend from the facts to
the laws of nature ; and may then with more or less
success anticipate the future course of events. All our
knowledge of natural objects must be ultimately derived
from observation, and the difficult question arises How
can we ever know anything which we have not directly
observed through one of our senses, the apertures of the
mind ? The practical utility of reasoning is to assure
ourselves that, at a determinate, time or place, or under
specified conditions, a certain phenomenon may be ob-
served. When we can use our senses and perceive that
the phenomenon does occur, reasoning is superfluous. If
the senses cannot be used, because the event is in the
future, or out of reach, how can reasoning take their
place ? Apparently, at least, we must infer the unknown
from the known, and the mind must itself create an
addition to the sum of knowledge. But I hold that it is
quite impossible to make any real additions to the con-
