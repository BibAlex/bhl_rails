the fact that mathematical or other certain laws may en-
tirely forbid the existence of some combinations. The
circle may be defined as a plane curve of equal curvature,
and it is a property of it that it contains the greatest area
within the least possible perimeter. May we then con-
template mentally a circle not a figure of greatest possible
area ? Or, to take a still simpler example, a parallelogram
possesses the property of having the opposite angles equal.
May we then mentally divide parallelograms into two
classes according as they do or do not have their opposite
angles equal \ It might seem absurd to do so, because we
know that one of the two species of parallelogram would
be non-existent. But, then, what is the meaning of the
thirty-fourth proposition of Euclid's first book, unless the
student had previously contemplated the existence of
both species as possible. We cannot even deny or dis-
prove the existence of a certain combination without
thereby in a certain way recognising that combination as
an object of thought.
The general conclusion, then, at which I arrive, is in
opposition to that of Mr. Herbert Spencer. I think that
whenever we abstract a quality or circumstance we do
generalize or widen the notion from which we abstract.
Whatever the terms A, B, and C may be, I hold that in
strict logic AB is mentally a wider term than ABC,
because AB includes the two species ABC and ABc. The
term A is wider still, for it includes the four species ABC,
ABc, A6C, Abe. The Logical Abecedarium, in short, is the
only limit of the classes of objects which we must contem-
plate in a purely logical point of view. Whatever notions
be brought before us, we must mentally combine them in
all the ways sanctioned by the laws of thought and ex-
hibited in the Abecedarium, and it is a matter for after
consideration, to determine how many of these combina-
tions exist in outward nature, or how many are actually
