ACCORDANCE OF QUANTITATIVE THEORIES, d-c. 211
must be given, or received, in a definite change of tem-
perature effected in a definite quantity of a standard sub-
stance, such as water. No less than seven almost entirely
distinct modes of determining this constant have been
tried. Dr. Joule first ascertained by the friction of water
that to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water
through one degree centigrade, we must employ energy
sufficient to raise 424 kilograms through the height of one
metre against the force of gravity at the earth's surface.
Joule, Mayer, Clausius h , Favre and other experimentalists
have made various other determinations by less direct
methods, and their results may be thus summed up 1 .
Friction
Mechanical properties of gases . . 426
Work done by a steam engine . . 413
Heat evolved by induced electric currents 452
Heat evolved by electro-magnetic engine 443
Heat evolved in the circuit of a battery 420
Heat evolved by an electric current . 400
Considering the diverse and in many cases difficult
methods of observation, these results exhibit satisfactory
accordance, and their mean (423*9) comes very close to
the number derived by Dr. Joule from the apparently
most accurate method. The constant generally assumed
as the most probable result is 423*55 kilogrammetres,
or gramme metres, if the quantity of water heated iCent.
be one gramme instead of a kilogramme.
