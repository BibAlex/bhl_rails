THE LAW OF ERROR. 455
and J. Cassini, 5 or 6 seconds. Hal ley, Michell, and
subsequently Sir W. Herschel came to the conclusion
that the brightest stars in the heavens could not have
real discs of a second, and were probably much less in
diameter. It would of course be absurd to take the mean
of quantities which differ more than 240 times ; and as
the tendency has always been to smaller estimates, there
is a considerable indication in favour of the smallest P.
In the case of many experiments and measurements we
shall know on which side there is a tendency to error.
Thus the readings of a thermometer always tend to rise as
the age of the instrument increases, and no drawing of
means will correct this result. Barometers, on the other
hand, are always likely to read too low instead of too high,
owing to the imperfection of the vacuum, or the action of
capillary attraction. If the mercury be perfectly pure and
no considerable error be due to the measuring apparatus,
the best barometer will be that which gives the highest
result.
When we have reasonable grounds for supposing that
certain experimental results are liable to grave errors, we
should exclude them in drawing a mean. If we want to
find the most probable approximation to the velocity of
sound in air, it would be absurd to go back to the old
experiments which made the velocity from 1200 to 1474
feet per second ; for we know that the old observers did
not guard against errors arising from wind and other
causes. Old chemical experiments are absolutely valueless
as regards quantitative results. The old chemists found
the atmosphere to differ in composition nearly ten per
cent, in different places, whereas modern accurate experi-
menters find very slight variations. Any method of
measurement which we know to avoid a source of error
is far to be preferred to others which trust to probabilities
