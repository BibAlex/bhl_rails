16 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
luminous by auroral currents of electricity, or by the
passage of meteoric stones.
There are many phenomena in meteorology and other
similar sciences, in which some occurrences depend on
others for their visibility. Thus in estimating the com-
parative numbers of meteors seen in different months of
the year, it is essential to take account of the varying
frequency of cloudy weather or else of the different
duration of the daylight which hides all but the most
splendid meteors. Observations of the comparative fre-
quency of various kinds of clouds will be complicated by
the fact that dense rain clouds necessarily hide those more
delicate cirrous clouds which appear in the higher parts
of the atmosphere. Most of the visible phenomena of
comets probably arise from some substance which, existing
previously invisible, becomes condensed or electrified sud-
denly into a visible form. Sir John Herschel attempted
to explain the production of comet tails in this manner by
evaporation and condensation 1 ".
Negative Arguments founded on the N on- observation of
Phenomena.
From what has been suggested in preceding sections, it
will plainly appear that the non-observation of a pheno-
menon is not generally to be taken as proving its non-
occurrence. As there are sounds which we cannot hear,
rays of light which we cannot feel, indefinite multitudes
of worlds which we cannot see, and infinite myriads of
minute organisms of which not the most powerful micro-
scope can give us a view, we must as a general rule
interpret our experience in an affirmative sense only.
Accordingly when inferences have been drawn from the
non-occurrence of particular facts or objects, more ex-
