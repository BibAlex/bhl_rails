CLASSIFICATION. 421
duce a limb, and in appearance there is no analogy. But
it was suggested by Blumeiibaeh that the healing of a
wound in the higher animals really represents in a lower
degree the power of reproducing a limb. That this is
true may be shown by adducing _ a multitude of inter-
mediate cases, each adjoining pair of which are clearly
analogous, so that we pass gradually from one extreme to
the other. Darwin holds, moreover, that any such re-
storation of parts is closely connected with that perpetual
replacement of the particles which causes every organized
body to be after a time entirely new as regards its con-
stituent substance. In short, we approach to a great
generalization under which all the phenomena of growth,
restoration, and maintenance of organs are effects of one
and the same power x . It is perhaps still more sur-
prising to find that the complicated process of sexual
reproduction in the higher animals may be gradually
traced down to a simpler and simpler form, which at last
becomes undistinguishable from the budding out of one
plant from the stem of another. By a great generalization
we may regard all the modes of reproduction of organic
life as alike in their nature, and varying only in com-
plexity of development y.
Limits of Classification.
Science can extend only so far as the power of accurate
classification extends. If we cannot detect resemblances,
and assign their exact character and amount, we cannot
have that generalized knowledge which constitutes science;
we cannot infer from case to case. It will readily be
