THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF PHENOMENA. 335
length and thinness of the supporting thread. Forces so
minute as the attraction of gravitation between two balls,
or the magnetic and diamagnetic attraction of common
liquids and gases, may thus be made apparent, and even
measured. The common chemical balance, too, is capable
theoretically of indefinite sensibility 8 .
The third mode of measurement, which may be called
the Method of Eepetition, is of such great importance and
interest that we must consider it in a separate section. It
consists in multiplying both magnitudes to be compared
until some multiple of the first is found to coincide very
nearly with some multiple of the second. If the multipli-
cation can be effected to an indefinite extent, without the
introduction of countervailing errors, the accuracy with
which the required ratio can be determined is unlimited,
and we thus account for the extraordinary precision with
which intervals of time in astronomy are compared to-
gether.
The fourth mode of measurement in which we equate
submultiples of two magnitudes is comparatively seldom
employed, because it does not conduce to accuracy. In
the photometer, perhaps, we may be said to use it ; we
compare the intensity of two sources of light, by placing
them both at such distances from a given surface, that the
light falling on the surface is tolerable to the eye, and
equally intense from each source. Since the intensity of
rays diminishes, as the inverse squares of the distances,
the relative intensities of the luminous bodies are propor-
tional to the squares of their distances. The equality of
intensity of two rays of similarly coloured light, may be
most accurately ascertained in the mode suggested by
Arago, namely, by causing the rays to pass in opposite
directions through two nearly flat lenses pressed together.
