CHARACTER OF THE EXPERIMENTALIST. 221
research disclose the laws of nature they embody. Ex-
haustive classification in all possible orders is out of the
question, because the possible orders are practically in-
finite in number. It is before the glance of the philoso-
phic mind that facts must display their meaning, and fall
into logical order. The natural philosopher must there-
fore have, in the first place, a mind of impression-
able character, which is readily affected by the slightest
exceptional phenomenon. His associating and identifying
powers must be great, that is, a single strange fact must
suggest to his mind whatever of like nature has pre-
viously come within his experience. His imagination
must be active, and bring before his mind multitudes of
relations in which the unexplained facts may possibly
stand with regard to each other, or to more common facts.
Sure and vigorous powers of deductive reasoning must
then come into play, and enable him to infer what will
happen under each supposed condition. Lastly, and
above all, there must be the love of certainty leading
him diligently and with perfect candour, to compare his
speculations with the test of fact and experiment.
Freedom of Theorizing.
It would be a complete error to suppose that the great
discoverer is one who seizes at once unerringly upon the
truth, or has any special method of divining it. In all
probability the errors of the great mind far exceed in
number those of the less vigorous one. Fertility of
imagination and abundance of guesses at truth are among
the first requisites of discovery ; but the erroneous guesses
must almost of necessity be many times as numerous as
those which prove well founded. The weakest analogies,
the most whimsical notions, the most apparently absurd
theories, may pass through the teeming brain, and no
