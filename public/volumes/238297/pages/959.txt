RESULTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD.
that the wonders and subtleties of possible existence sur-
pass all that our mental powers allow us clearly to per-
ceive, The study of abstract logical and mathematical
forms has seemed to convince me that even space itself is
no requisite condition of conceivable existence. Every-
thing, we are told by materialists, must be here or
there, nearer or further, before or after. I deny this
and point to logical relations as my proof.
There formerly seemed to me to be something highly
mysterious in the denominators of the binomial expansion
(vol. i. p. 216) which are reproduced in that strange
natural constant e, or
I 1.2 1.2.3
and in many results of mathematical analysis. I now
perceive, as already partiaUy explained (vol. i. pp. 40-42,
1 80, 1 8 1, 443, 444), that they arise out of the fact
that the relations of space do not apply to the logical
conditions which govern the numbers of combinations as
contrasted to those of permutations. So far am I from
accepting Kant's doctrine that space is a necessary form
of thought, that I regard it as an accident, and an im-
pediment to pure logical reasoning. Material existences
must exist in space no doubt, but intellectual existences
may be neither in space nor out of space ; they may have
110 relation to space at all, just as space itself has no re-
lation to time. For all that I can see, then, there may be
intellectual existences to which both time and space are
nullities.
Now among the most unquestionable rules of Scientific ,
Method is that first law that (Whatever phenomenon is, is. /
We must ignore no existence whatever ; we may variously
interpret or explain its meaning and origin, but if a phe-
nomenon does exist it demands some kind of explanation.
If then there is to be a competition for scientific recog-
