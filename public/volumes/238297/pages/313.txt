THE INDUCTIVE OR INVERSE METHOD. 287
countenances his objections , otherwise I should not have
thought them of much weight. Certainly Laplace accepts
Michell's views P, and if Michell be in error, it is in the
methods of calculation, not in the general validity of his
conclusions.
Similar calculations might no doubt be applied to the
peculiar drifting motions which have been detected by
Mr. B. A. Proctor in some of the constellations <i. Against
a general tendency of stars to move in one direction by
chance, the odds are very great. It is on a similar ground
that a considerable proper motion of the sun is found to
exist with immense probability, because on the average
the fixed stars show a tendency to move apparently from
one point of the heavens towards that diametrically op-
posite. The sun's motion in the contrary direction would
explain this tendency, otherwise we must believe that
myriads of stars accidentally agree in their direction of
motion, or are urged by some common force from which the
sun is exempt. It may be said that the rotation of the
earth is proved in like manner, because it is immensely
more probable that one body would revolve than that
the sun, moon, planets, comets, and the whole of the stars
of the heavens should be whirled round the earth daily,
with a uniform motion superadded to their own peculiar
motions. This appears to be nearly the reason which led
Gilbert, one of the earliest English Copernicans, and in
every way an admirable physicist, to admit the rotation
of the earth, while Francis Bacon denied it r .
In contemplating the planetary system, we are struck
with the similarity in direction of nearly all its move-
