400 yards P. It is probable that Mr. Stone's arrangement
of the pile might be usefully employed in other delicate
thermometric experiments subject to considerable disturb-
ing influences.
Determination of Maximum Points.
We employ the method of means in a certain number
of observations directed to determine the moment at which
a phenomenon reaches its highest point in quantity. In
noting the place of a fixed star at a given time there is
no difficulty in ascertaining the point to be observed, for a
star in a good telescope presents an exceedingly small disc.
In observing a nebulous body which from a bright centre
fades gradually away on all sides, it will not be possible
to select with certainty the middle point. In many such
cases the best method is not to select arbitrarily the sup-
posed middle point, but points of equal brightness on
either side, and then take the mean of the observations of
these two points for the centre. As a general rule, a
variable quantity in reaching its maximum increases at a
less and less rate, and after passing the highest point be-
gins to decrease by insensible degrees. The maximum may
indeed be defined as that point at which the increase or
decrease is insensibly small. Hence it will usually be the
most indefinite point in the whole course, and if we can
accurately measure the phenomenon we shall best deter-
mine the place of the maximum by determining points on
either side at which the ordinates are equal. There is
