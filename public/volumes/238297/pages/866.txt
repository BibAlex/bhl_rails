376 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
itself of all names and other vestiges of antiquity which
are not actually useful at the present day.
Among those ancient expressions which may well be
excepted from such considerations and ever retained in
use, are the ' Five Words' or ' Five Predicables ' which
were described by Porphyry in his ' Introduction to Aris-
totle's Organum.' Two of them indeed, namely Genus
and Species, are the most venerable names in philosophy,
having probably been first employed in their present
logical meanings by Socrates. In the present day it
requires some mental effort, as Mr. Georges Lewes has
remarked / to see anything important in the invention
of notions now so familiar as those of Genus and Species.
But in reality the introduction of such terms showed the
rise of the first germs of logic and scientific method :
it showed that men were beginning to analyse their pro-
cesses of thought.
The Five Predicables are Genus, Species, Difference,
Property, and Accident, or in the original Greek yevos,
6^09, $ia(popa, 'idlov, (rv/uL^e/BtjKo^. Of these, Genus may be
taken to mean any class of objects which is regarded as
broken up into two minor classes, which form Species
of it. The Genus is defined by a certain number of
qualities or circumstances which belong to all objects
included in the class, and which are sufficient to mark
out these objects from all others which we do not intend
to include. Interpreted as regards intension, then, the
Genus is a group of qualities ; interpreted as regards
extension, it is a group of objects possessing those
qualities. If now another quality be taken into account
which is possessed by some of the objects and not by
the others, this quality becomes a Difference which divides
the Genus into two Species. We may interpret the Species
