planet appears ; so that the total variety of conjunctions is
2 8 i 8 or 247.
If an organ has twelve stops, we find in the thirteenth
line the numbers of combinations which we can draw,
0, i, 2, 3, &c., at a time; the total number of modes of
varying the sound is no less than 2 12 i or 4095 m . If a
number be the product of n prime factors, we find in the
n+ I th line the numbers of divisors, being the "product of
1, 2, 3, or more of the prime factors ; and the whole
number of divisors of the number is the sum of the
numbers in the line, subtracting unity, or z n i.
One of the most important scientific uses of the arith-
metical triangle, consists in the information which it gives
concerning the comparative frequency of divergencies from
an average. Suppose, for the mere sake of argument,
that all persons were naturally of equal stature of five
feet, but enjoyed during youth seven independent chances
of growing one inch in addition. Of these seven chances,
one, two, three, or more, may happen favourably to any
individual, but as it does not matter what the chances
are, so that the inch is gained, the question really turns
upon the number of combinations of o, i, 2, 3, &c.,
things out of seven. Hence the eighth line of the triangle
give us a complete answer to the question, as follows :
Out of every 128 people-
Feet. Inches.
One person would have the stature of 5 o
7 persons ., 5 i
21 persons 52
35 persons 53
35 persons 54
21 persons 55
7 persons 5 6
i person 57
