The actual occurrence of black and white balls in the
drawings renders the first and last hypotheses out of the
question, so that we have only three left to consider.
If the box contains three white and one black, the
probability of drawing a white each time is f , and a black
^ ; so that the compound event observed, namely, three
white and one black, has the probability f x f x f x i, by
the rule already given (p. 233). But as it is indifferent
to us in what order the balls are drawn, and the black
ball might come first, second, third, or fourth, we must
multiply by four, to obtain the probability of three white
and one black in any order, thus getting f|.
Taking the next hypothesis of two white and two
black balls in the urn, we obtain for the same proba-
bility the quantity ^ x 1 x l x l x 4, or g-J, and from the
third hypothesis of one white and three black we deduce
likewise ^ x x ^ x f x 4, or f^. According, then, as we
adopt the first, second, or third hypothesis, the proba-
bility that the result actually noticed would follow is ff,
~, and 6 \. Now it is certain that one or other of these
hypotheses must be the true one, and their absolute
probabilities are proportional to the probabilities that the
observed events would follow from them (see p. 279). All
we have to do, then, in order to obtain the absolute pro-
bability of each hypothesis, is to alter these fractions in
a uniform ratio, so that their sum shall be unity, the
expression of certainty. Now since 27 + 16 + 3 = 46,
this will be effected by dividing each fraction by 46 and
