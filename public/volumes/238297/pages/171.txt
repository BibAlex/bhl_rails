INDUCTION. 145
The difficulty becomes much greater when more terms
enter into the combinations. It would be no easy matter
to point out the complete conditions fulfilled in the com-
binations

After some trouble the reader may discover that the
principal laws are C = e, and A = A.e ; but he would hardly
discover the remaining law, namely that BD = BDe.
The difficulties encountered in the inductive investi-
gations of nature, are of an exactly similar kind.
We seldom observe any great law in uninterrupted and
undisguised operation. The acuteness of Aristotle and
the ancient Greeks, did not enable them to detect that all
terrestrial bodies tend to fall towards the centre of the
earth. A very few nights of observation would have con-
vinced an astronomer viewing the solar system from its
centre, that the planets travelled round the sun ; but the
fact that our place of observation is one of the travelling
planets, so complicates the apparent motions of the other
bodies, that it required all the industry and sagacity of
Copernicus to prove the real simplicity of the planetary
system. It is the same throughout nature ; the laws may
be -simple, but their combined effects are not simple, and
we have no clue to guide us through their intricacies. ' It
is the glory of God/ said Solomon, ' to conceal a thing, but
the glory of a king to search it out/ The laws of nature
are the invaluable secrets which God has hidden, and it is
the kingly prerogative of the philosopher to search them
out by industry and sagacity.
