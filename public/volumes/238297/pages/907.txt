CLASSIFICATION. 417
With the progress of botany intermediate and ad-
ditional divisions have gradually been introduced. Ac-
cording to the Laws of Botanical Nomenclature adopted
by the International Botanical Congress, held at Paris u
in August, 1867, n I GSS than twenty-one names of classes
are recognised namely, Kingdom, Division, Sub-division,
Class, Sub-class, Cohort, Sub-cohort, Order, Sub-order,
Tribe, Sub-tribe, Genus, Sub-genus, Section, Sub-section,
Species, Sub-species, Variety, Sub- variety, Variation,
Sub-variation. It is allowed by the authors of this
scheme, that the definition or degree of importance to be
attributed to any of these terms may vary in a certain
degree according to individual opinion. The only point
on which botanists are not allowed discretion is as to
the order of the successive sub-divisions ; the division of
genera into tribes, or of tribes into orders ; any inversion,
in short, of the arrangement being inadmissible. There is
no reason to suppose that even the above list is complete
and inextensible. The Botanical Congress itself recognised
the distinction between variations according as they are
Seedlings, Half-breeds, or Lusus Natures. The compli-
cation of the inferior classes is increased again by the
existence of hybrids, arising from the fertilization of one
species by another deemed a distinct species, nor can we
place any limit to the minuteness of discrimination of
degrees of breeding short of an actual pedigree of descent.
It will be evident to the reader that in the remarks
upon classification as applied to the Natural Sciences,
given in this and the preceding sections, I have not in the
least attempted to treat the subject in a manner adequate
to its extent and importance. A volume would be insuf-
ficient for tracing out the principles of scientific method
u ' Laws of Botanical Nomenclature,' by Alphonse Decandolle, trans-
lated from the French, 1868, p. 19.
