EXPERIMENT.
WE now come to consider the great facilities which we
enjoy for examining the possible combinations of proper-
ties and phenomena when objects are within our reach
and capable of manipulation. We are said to experiment,
when we bring substances together under various con-
ditions of temperature, pressure, electric disturbance,
molecular attraction, &c., and then record the changes
observed.
If we denote by A a certain group of antecedent con-
ditions, and by X a certain series of subsequent phe-
nomena, our object will usually be to ascertain a law of
the form A = AX, the meaning of which is that where A is
X will happen, and we may sometimes rise to the still
simpler and higher law A = X, meaning that where A is,
and only where A is, X will happen (see vol. i. pp. 146,
149.)
The great object of the art of experiment is to ascertain
exactly those circumstances or conditions which are re-
quisite for the happening of any event X. Now the cir-
cumstances which might be enumerated as present in the
very simplest experiment are very numerous, in fact
almost infinite. Bub two sticks together and consider
what would be an exhaustive statement of the conditions.
There are the form, hardness, organic structure, and all
the chemical qualities of the wood ; the pressure and velo-
city of the rubbing ; the temperature, pressure, and all the
chemical qualities of the surrounding air ; the proximity
