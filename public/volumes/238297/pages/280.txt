254 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
is seen moving in the sky, or its constituent particles
illumine the heavens with their tails of fire. We cannot
explain the present movements of such a body without
supposing its prior existence, with a determinate amount
of energy and direction of motion ; nor can we validly
suppose that our task is concluded when we find that it
came wandering to our solar system through the un-
measured vastness of surrounding space. Every event
must have a cause, and that cause again a cause, until
we are lost in the obscurity of the past, and are driven
to the belief in one First Cause, by whom the whole
course of nature was determined.
Fallacious Use of the Term Cause.
The words Cause and Causation have given rise to in-
finite trouble and obscurity, and have in no slight degree
retarded the progress of science. From the time of
Aristotle, the work of philosophy has been often de-
scribed as the discovery of the causes of things, and
Francis Bacon adopted the notion when he said a ' vere
scire esse per causas scire! Even now it is not uncom-
monly supposed that the knowledge of causes is some-
thing different from 'other knowledge, and consists, as it
were, in getting possession of the keys of nature. A
single word may thus act as a spell, and throw the
clearest inteUect into confusion, as I have often thought
that Locke was thrown into confusion when endeavouring
to find a meaning for the word power, , b In Mr. Mill's
' System of Logic ' the term cause seems to have re-
asserted its old noxious power. Not only does Mr. Mill
treat the Laws of Causation as almost co-extensive with
a 'Novum Organum/ bk. ii. Aphorism 2.
