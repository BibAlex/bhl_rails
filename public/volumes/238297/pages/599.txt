QUANTITATIVE INDUCTION. 109
When we have the power of varying the quantity of a
cause entirely at our will it is easy to discover whether
a certain effect is due to that cause or not. We can then
make as many regular or irregular changes as we like,
and it is quite incredible that the supposed effect should
by chance go through exactly the corresponding series of
changes unless by dependence. Thus, if we have a bell
ringing in vacuo, the sound increases as we let in the air,
and it decreases again as we exhaust the air. Tyndall's
singing flames evidently obeyed the directions of his own
voice ; and Faraday when he discovered the relation of
magnetism and light found that, by making or breaking
or reversing the current of the electro-magnet, he had
complete command over a ray of light, proving beyond all
reasonable doubt the dependence of cause and effect. In
such cases it is the perfect coincidence in time between
the change in the effect and that in the cause which raises
a high improbability of casual coincidence.
It is by a very simple case of variation that we infer
the existence of a material connexion between two bodies
moving with exactly equal velocity, such as the locomotive
engine and the train which follows it. Elaborate observa-
tions were requisite before astronomers could all be con-
vinced that the red hydrogen flames seen during solar
eclipses belonged to the sun, and not to the moon's atmo-
sphere as Flamsteed assumed. As early as 1706, Captain
Stannyan noticed a blood red streak in an eclipse which
he witnessed at Berne, and he asserted that it belonged
to the sun ; but his opinion was not finally established
until photographs of the eclipse in i86o a taken by Mr.
De la Eue, showed that the moon's dark body gradually
covered the red prominences on one side, and uncovered
those on the other, in short, that these prominences
moved precisely as the sun moved and not as the moon
moved.
