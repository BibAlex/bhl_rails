sible to trace a line among the points which will approxi-
mate to the true law more nearly than the points them-
selves. The accompanying figure sufficiently explains
itself.
VARIABLE
Perkins employed this graphical method with much
care in exhibiting the results of his experiments on the
compression of water k . The numerical results were
marked upon a sheet of paper very exactly ruled at
intervals of one-tenth of an inch, and the original marks
were left in order that the reader might judge of the
correctness of the curve drawn, or choose another for
himself. Regnault carried the method to perfection by
laying off the points with a small screw dividing engine * ;
and he then formed a table of results by drawing a con-
tinuous curve, and measuring its height for equidistant
values of the variable.
Not only does a curve drawn in this manner enable
us to assign by measurement numerical results more free
from accidental errors than any of the numbers obtained
directly from experiment, but the form of the curve
sometimes indicates the class of functions to which our
results belong
