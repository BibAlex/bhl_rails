232 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
ghens was not satisfied with an unverified theory. He
calculated what might be expected to happen when a
crystal of calc-spar was cut in various directions, and he
says, * I have examined in detail the properties of the
extraordinary refraction of this crystal, to see if each
phenomenon which is deduced from theory would agree
with what is really observed. And this being so, it is
no slight proof of the truth of our suppositions and prin-
ciples ; but what I am going to add here confirms them
still more wonderfully ; that is, the different modes of
cutting this crystal, in which the surfaces produced give
rise to refraction exactly such as they ought to be, and as
I had foreseen them, according to the preceding theory.'
The supremacy of Newton's mistaken corpuscular doc-
trine of light caused the theories and experiments of
Huyghens to be disregarded for more than a century;
but it is not easy to imagine a more beautiful or successful
application of the true method of inductive investigation,
theory guiding experiment, and yet wholly relying on
experiment for confirmation.
Candour and Courage of the Philosophic Mind.
Perfect readiness to reject a theory inconsistent with
fact is, then, a primary requisite of the philosophical mind.
But it would be a mistake to suppose that this candour
has anything akin to fickleness ; on the contrary, readiness
to reject a false theory may be combined with a peculiar
pertinacity and courage in maintaining an hypothesis as long
as its falsity is not actually apparent. There must, indeed,
be no prejudice or bias distorting the mind, and causing
it to under-estimate or pass over the unwelcome results of
experiment. There must be that scrupulous honesty and
flexibility of mind, which assigns an adequate value to all
