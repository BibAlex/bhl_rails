tical with capillary attraction, which is capable of inter-
fering with the pressure of aqueous vapour and aiding its
condensation?. There are many cases of so-called catalytic
or surface action, such as the extraordinary power of animal
charcoal for attracting organic matter, or of spongy pla-
tinum for condensing hydrogen, which can only be con-
sidered as exalted cases of a much more general power of
attraction. ' The number of substances which are decom-
posed by light in a striking manner is very limited ; but
many other substances, such as vegetable colours, are
affected by long exposure ; on the principle of continuity
we might well expect to find that all kinds of matter are
more or less susceptible of change by the incidence of light
rays 2 . It is the opinion of Mr. Justice Grove that wherever
an electric current passes there is a tendency to decom-
position, a strain on the molecules, which when sufficiently
intense leads to disruption. Even a metallic conducting
wire may be regarded as tending to decomposition. Davy
was probably correct in describing electricity as chemical
affinity acting on masses, or rather, as Grove suggests,
creating a disturbance through a chain of particles a .
Laplace went so far as to suggest that all chemical phe-
nomena may be regarded as the results of the Newtonian
law of attraction, applied to atoms of various mass and
position ; but the time is probably long distant when the
progress of molecular philosophy and of mathematical
methods will enable such a generalization to be verified
or refuted.
The Law of Continuity.
Under the title Law of Continuity we may place many
applications of the general principle of reasoning, that
