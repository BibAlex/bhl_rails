151 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
The Rejection of the Mean Result.
We ought always to bear ID mind that the mean of any
series of observations is the best, that is, the most probable
approximation to the truth, only in the entire absence of
any knowledge to the contrary. The selection of the
mean rests entirely upon the probability that wholly un-
known causes of error will in the long run fall as often in
one direction as the opposite, so that in drawing the mean
they will balance each other. If we have any presumption
to the contrary, any reason to suppose that there exists a
tendency to error in one direction rather than the other,
then to choose the mean would be to ignore that tendency.
Thus we may certainly approximate to the length of the
circumference of a circle, by measuring the perimeters of
inscribed and circumscribed polygons of an equal and large
number of sides. The correct length of the circular line
undoubtedly lies between the lengths of the two perimeters,
but it does not follow that the mean is the best approxi-
mation. It may in fact be shown upon mathematical
principles that the circumference of the circle is very
nearly equal to the perimeter of the inscribed polygon,
together with one-third part of the difference between
the inscribed and circumscribed polygons of the same
number of sides. Having this knowledge we ought of
course to act upon it, instead of upon vague grounds of
probability.
We may often perceive that a series of measurements
tends towards an extreme limit rather than towards a
mean. Thus in endeavouring to obtain a correct estimate
of the apparent diameter of the brightest fixed stars, we
should find a continuous diminution in estimates as the
powers of observation increased. Kepler assigned to
Sirius an apparent diameter of 240 seconds : Tycho Brahe
made it 126; Gassendi 10 seconds; Galileo, Hevelius,
