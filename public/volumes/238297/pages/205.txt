PRINCIPLES OF NUMBER. 179
but their nature is restricted. Concrete number thus
implies the same consciousness of difference as abstract
number, but it is mingled with a groundwork of similarity
expressed in the logical terms. There is similarity or
identity so far as logical terms enter ; difference so far as
the terms are merely numerical.
The reason of the important Law of Homogeneity
will now be apparent. This law asserts that in every
arithmetical calculation the logical nature of the things
numbered must remain unaltered. The specified logical
agreement of the things numbered must not be affected by
the unspecified numerical differences. A calculation would
be palpably absurd which, after commencing with length,
gave a result in hours. It is in reality equally absurd in
a purely arithmetical point of view to deduce areas from
the calculation of lengths, masses from the combination of
volume and density, or momenta from mass and velocity.
It must remain for subsequent consideration in what sense
we may truly say that two linear feet multiplied by two
linear feet give four superficial feet, but arithmetically it
is absurd, because there is a change of unit.
As a general rule we treat in each calculation only
objects of one nature. We do not, and cannot properly
add, in the same sum yards of cloth and pounds of sugar.
We cannot even conceive the result of adding area to velo-
city, or length to density, or weight to value. The unit
numbered and added must have a basis of homogeneity,
or must be reducible to some common denominator.
Nevertheless it is quite possible, and in fact common, to
treat in one complex calculation the most heterogeneous
quantities, on the condition that each kind of object is
kept distinct, and treated numerically only in conjunction
with its own kind. Different units, so far as their
logical differences are specified, must never be substituted
one far the other. Chemists continually use equations
