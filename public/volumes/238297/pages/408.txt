and thus consisting of the sum of the ratios between the
numbers of permutations and combinations of o, i, 2, 3, 4,
&c. things.
Tables of prime numbers and of the factors of composite
numbers must not be forgotten.
Another vast and in fact infinite series of numerical
constants contains those connected with the measure-
ment of angles, and embodied in trigonometrical tables,
whether as natural or logarithmic sines, cosines, and
tangents. It should never be forgotten that though
these numbers find their chief employment in connexion
with trigonometry, or the measurement of the sides of a
right-angled triangle, yet the numbers themselves arise
out of simple numerical relations bearing no special rela-
tion to space.
Foremost among trigonometrical constants is the well
known number TT, usually employed as expressing the
ratio of the circumference and the diameter of a circle ;
from TT follows the value of the arcual or natural unit
of angular value as expressed in ordinary degrees (see
p. 358).
Among other mathematical constants not uncommonly
used may be mentioned tables of factorials (p. 202), tables
of Bernouillfs numbers, tables of the error function d ,
which latter are indispensable not only in the theory of
probability but also in several other branches of science.
It should also be clearly understood that the mathe-
matical constants and tables of reference already in our
possession, although very extensive, are only an infinitely
small part of what might be formed. With the progress
of science the tabulation of new functions will be con-
tinually demanded, and it is worthy of consideration
whether public money should not be constantly available
