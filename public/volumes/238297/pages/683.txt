ACCORDANCE OF QUANTITATIVE THEORIES, &c. 193
take the mean of all those in which the effect to be mea-
sured is present, and compare it with the mean of the
remainder in which the effect is absent, or acts, it may
be, in the opposite direction. The difference will then
represent the amount of the effect, or double the amount
respectively. Thus, in the case of the atmospheric tides,
we take the mean of all the observations when the moon
was on the meridian, and compare it with the mean of all
observations when she was on the horizon. In this case
we trust to chance that all other effects will lie about
as often in one direction as the other in the drawing of
each mean, and will neutralise themselves. It will be a
great advantage, however, to be able to decide by theory
when each principal disturbing effect is present or absent ;
for the means may then be so drawn as surely to separate
each such effect, leaving only very minor and casual di-
vergences to the law of error. Thus, if there be three
principal effects, and we draw means giving respectively
the sum of all three, the sum of the first two, and the
sum of the last two, then we gain three simple equations,
by the solution of which each quantity is determined.
Explained Results of Measurement.
The second class of measured phenomena contains those
which, after being determined in a direct and purely empi-
rical application of measuring instruments, are afterwards
shown to agree with some hypothetical explanation. Such
results are turned to their proper use, and several dif-
ferent advantages may arise from the comparison. The
correspondence with theory will seldom or never be abso-
lutely precise ; and, even if it be so, the coincidence must
be regarded as accidental. If the divergences between
theory and experiment be comparatively small, and vari-
able in amount and direction, they may often be safely
