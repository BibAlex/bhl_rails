THE USE OF HYPOTHESIS. 143
The Second Requisite Consistency with established
Laivs of Nature.
In the second place an hypothesis must not be contra-
dictory to what we believe to be true concerning Nature.
It must not involve self-inconsistency which is opposed to
the highest and simplest laws, namely, those of Logic.
Neither ought it to be irreconcileable with the simple
laws of motion, of gravity, of the conservation of energy,
or any parts of physical science which we consider to be
established beyond reasonable doubt. Not that we are
absolutely forbidden to adopt such an hypothesis, but if
we do so we must be prepared to disprove some of the
best demonstrated truths in the possession of mankind.
The fact that conflict exists means that the conse-
quences of the theory are not verified if previous dis-
coveries are correct, and we must therefore show that
previous discoveries are incorrect before we can verify
our theory.
An hypothesis will be exceedingly improbable, not to
say invalid, if it supposes a substance or agent to act in a
manner unknown in other cases; for it then fails to be
verified in our knowledge of that substance or agent.
Several physicists, especially Euler and Grove, have sup-
posed that we might dispense with any ethereal basis of
light, and infer from the interstellar passage of rays that
there was some kind of rare gas occupying space. But if
so, that gas must be excessively rare, as we may infer
from the apparent absence of an atmosphere around the
moon, and from many other facts and laws known to us
concerning gases and the atmosphere ; and yet at the same
jime it must possess an elastic force at least a billion
jfenes as great as atmospheric air at the earth's surface, in
order to account for the extreme rapidity of the light
