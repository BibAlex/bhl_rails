THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF PHENOMENA. 331
The moving globe itself is the real standard clock, and the
transit instrument the finger of the clock, while the stars
are the hour, minute, and second marks, none the less
useful or accurate because they are disposed at unequal
intervals. The photometer is a simple instrument, by
which we compare the relative intensity of rays of light
falling upon a given spot. The galvanometer shows the
comparative intensity of electric currents passing through
a wire. The calorimeter guages the quantity of heat
passing from a given object. But no such instruments
furnish the standard unit in terms of which our results are
to be expressed. In one peculiar case alone does the same
instrument combine the unit of measurement and the
means of comparison. A theodolite, mural circle, sextant,
or other instrument for the measurement of angular mag-
nitudes has no need of an additional physical unit ; for
the very circle itself, or complete revolution, is the natural
unit to which all greater or lesser amounts of angular
magnitude are referred.
The result of every measurement is to make known the
purely numerical ratio existing between the magnitude
to be measured, and a certain other magnitude, which
should, when possible, be a fixed unit or standard magni-
tude, or at least an intermediate unit of which the value
can be ascertained in terms of the ultimate standard. But
though a ratio is the required result, an equation is the
mode in which the ratio is determined and expressed. In
every measurement we equate some multiple or submul-
tiple of one quantity, with some multiple or submultiple
of another, and equality is always the fact which we
ascertain by the senses. By the eye, the ear, or the touch,
we judge whether there is a discrepancy or not between
two lights, two sounds, two intervals of time, two bars of
metal. Often indeed we substitute one sense for the other,
as when the efflux of time is judged by the marks upon
