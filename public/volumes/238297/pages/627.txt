THE USE OF HYPOTHESIS. 137
failed to observe that the inverse use of deduction con-
stitutes induction.
Even Francis Bacon was not wholly unaware of the
value of hypothetical anticipation. In one or two places
he incidentally acknowledges it, as when he remarks that
the subtlety of nature surpasses that of reason, adding
that 'axioms abstracted from particular facts in a careful
and orderly manner, readily suggest and mark out new
particulars/
The true course of inductive procedure is that which
has yielded all the more lofty and successful results of
science. It consists in Anticipating -Nature, in the sense
of forming hypotheses as to the laws which are probably
in operation ; and then observing whether the combi-
nations of phenomena are such as would follow from the
laws supposed. The investigator begins with facts and
ends with them. He uses such facts as are in the first
place known to him in suggesting probable hypotheses ;
deducing other facts which would happen if a particular
hypothesis is true, he proceeds to test the truth of his
notion by fresh observations or experiments. If any
result prove different from what he expects, it leads him
either to abandon or to modify his hypothesis ; but every
new fact may give some new suggestion as to the laws in
action. Even if the result in any case agrees with his
anticipations, he does not regard it as finally confirmatory
of his theory, but proceeds to test the truth of the theory
by new deductions and new trials.
The investigator in such a process is assisted by the
whole body of science previously accumulated. He may
employ analogy, as I shall point out, to guide him in the
choice of hypotheses. The manifold connexions between
one science and another may give him strong clues to the
kind of laws to be expected, and he thus always selects
out of the infinite number of possible hypotheses those
