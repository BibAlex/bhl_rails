RESULTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD. 439
some oversight or erroneous simplification in these theo-
retical calculations may afterwards be discovered ; but as
the present state of scientific knowledge is the only ground
on which erroneous interpretations of the uniformity of
nature and the reign of law are founded, I am right in
appealing to the present state of science in opposition to
these interpretations. Now the theory of heat places us
in the dilemma either of believing in Creation at an assign-
able date in the past, or else of supposing that some
inexplicable change in the working of natural laws then
took place. Physical science gives no countenance to the
notion of infinite duration of matter in one continuous
course of existence. And if in time past there has been
a discontinuity of law, why may there not be a similar
event awaiting the world in the future. Infinite ingenuity
could have implanted some agency in matter so that it
might never yet have made its tremendous powers mani-
fest. We have a very good theory of the conservation of
energy, but the foremost physicists do not deny that there
may possibly be forms of energy, neither kinetic nor poten-
tial, and therefore of unknown nature 1 .
We can imagine reasoning creatures dwelling in a world
where the atmosphere was a mixture of oxygen and in-
flammable gas like the fire-damp of coal mines. If devoid
of fire, they might have lived on through long ages in
complete unconsciousness of the tremendous forces which a
single spark could call into play. In the twinkling of an
eye new laws might have come into action, and the poor
reasoning creatures who were so confident in their know-
ledge of the uniform conditions of their world, might have
had no time even to speculate upon the overthrow of all
their theories. Can we with our finite knowledge be
sure that such an overthrow of our theories is impossible 1
