THE LA W OF ERROR. 447
parison, the larger errors being less frequent than theory
would indicate.
We may also regard the experiments enumerated in
the chapter on Probabilities (p. 238), as forming an em-
pirical verification of the theory of error.
Remarks on the General Law of Error.
The mere fact that the Law of Error allows of the
possible existence of errors of every assignable amount
shows that it is only approximately true. We may fairly
say that in measuring a mile it would be impossible to
commit an error of a hundred miles, and the length of life
would never allow of our committing an error of one
million miles. Nevertheless the general Law of Error
would assign a probability for an error of that amount or
more, but so small a probability as to be utterly incon-
siderable, and almost inconceivable. All that can, or in fact
need, be said in defence of the law is, that it may be made
to represent the errors in any special case to a very close
approximation, and that the probability of large and prac-
tically impossible errors, as given by the law, will be so
small as to be entirely inconsiderable. And as we are
dealing with error itself, and our results pretend to no-
thing more than approximation and probability, an in-
definitely small error in our process of approximation is
of no importance whatever.
The Probable Mean Result as defined ~by the Law
of Error.
One immediate result of the Law of Error, as thus stated,
is that the mean result is the most probable one ; and
when there is only a single variable this mean is found by
the familiar arithmetical process. An unfortunate error
