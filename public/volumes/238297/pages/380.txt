354 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
In the first use all astronomical observations depend
upon it. In the second employment it has been almost
equally indispensable. The primary principle that gravity
is equal in all matter was proved by Newton's and Gauss'
pendulum experiments. The torsion pendulum of Mich ell,
Cavendish, and Baily, depending upon exactly the same
principles as the ordinary pendulum, gave the density of
the earth, one of the foremost natural constants. Kater
arid Sabine, by pendulum observations in different parts
of the earth, ascertained the variation of gravity, whence
comes a determination of the earth's ellipticity. The laws
of electric and magnetic attraction have also been deter-
mined by the method of vibrations, which is in constant
use in the measurement of the horizontal force of terres-
trial magnetism.
We must not confuse with the ordinary use of the
pendulum its application by Newton, to show the absence
of internal friction against space r , or to ascertain the laws
of motion and elasticity 8 . In such cases the extent of
vibration is the quantity measured, and the principles of
the instrument are different.
Attainable Accuracy of Measurement.
It is a matter of some interest to compare the degrees
of accuracy, which can be attained in the measurement of
different kinds of magnitude. Few measurements of any
kind are exact to more than six significant figures*, but it
is seldom that. such a point of accuracy can be hoped for.
Time is the magnitude which seems to be capable of the
most exact discrimination, owing to the properties of the
