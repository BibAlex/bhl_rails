QUANTITATIVE INDUCTION. 117
and almost always desirable, to call in the aid of space-
representations. Every equation involving two variable
quantities . corresponds to some kind of plane curve, and
every plane curve may be represented symbolically in an
equation of a more or less complex character, containing
two unknown quantities. Now in an experimental re-
search we obtain a number of values of the variant cor-
responding to an equal number of values of the variable ;
but all the numbers are affected by more or less error,
and the values of the variable will often be * irregularly
disposed. Even if the numbers were absolutely correct
and disposed at regular intervals, there is, as we have
seen, no direct mode of discovering the law, but the dif-
ficulty of discovery is much increased by the uncertainty
and irregularity of the results.
Under such circumstances, the best mode of proceeding
is to procure or prepare a paper divided into small equal
rectangular spaces, a convenient size for the spaces being
one-tenth of an inch square. The values of the variables
being marked off along the scale formed by the lowest
horizontal line, a point is marked for each corresponding
value of the variant perpendicularly above that of the
variable, and at such a height as corresponds to the
amount of the variant.
The exact scale of the drawing is not of much im-
portance, but it may require to be adjusted according to
circumstances, and different values must often be attri-
buted to the upright and horizontal divisions, so as to
make the variations conspicuous, but not excessive. If
now a curved line be drawn through all the extremities
of the ordinates, it will probably exhibit many irregular
inflections, owing to the errors which affect all the numbers.
But, when the results are numerous, it soon becomes ap-
parent which results are more divergent than others, and
guided by a so-caUed sense of continuity, it becomes pos-
