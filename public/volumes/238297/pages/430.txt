the resistance of the air by operating in a vacuum.
Consequently this resistance has to be ascertained
by appropriate and tedious series of experiments,
which should be made if possible upon each pendulum
employed.
The exact definition of the standard of length is one
of the most important, as it is one of the most difficult
questions in physical science, and the different practice of
different nations introduces wholly needless confusion.
Were all standards constructed so as to give the true
length at a fixed uniform temperature, for instance the
freezing-point, then any two standards could be compared
without the interference of temperature by bringing them
both to exactly the same fixed temperature. Unfortu-
nately the French metre is defined by a bar of platinum
at oC, while our yard is defined by a bronze bar at 62R
It is quite impossible, then, to make a comparison of the
yard and metre without the introduction of a correction,
either for the expansion of platinum or bronze, or both.
Bars of metal differ too so much in their rates of expansion
according to their molecular condition that it is dangerous
to infer from one bar to another.
When we come to use instruments with great accuracy
there are many minute sources of error which must be
guarded against. If a thermometer has been graduated
when perpendicular, it will read somewhat differently
when laid down, as the pressure of a column of mercury
is removed from the bulb. The reading may also be
somewhat altered if it has recently been raised to a
higher temperature than usual, if it be placed under a
vacuous receiver, or if the tube be unequally heated as
compared with the bulb. For these minute causes of
error we may have to introduce troublesome corrections,
unless we adopt the simple mode of using the thermometer
in circumstances of position, &c. exactly similar to those
