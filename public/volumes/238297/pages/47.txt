INTRODUCTION. 21
General Formula of Logical Inference.
The one supreme rule of inference consists, as I have
said, in the direction to affirm of anything whatever is
known of its like, equal or equivalent. The Substitution
of Similars is a phrase which seems aptly to express the
power of mutual replacement existing between any two
objects which are to a sufficient degree like or equivalent.
It is a matter for further investigation to point out when
and for what purposes a degree of similarity less than
complete identity is sufficient to warrant substitution.
For the present we think only of the exact sameness
expressed in the form
A = B.
Now if we take the letter to denote any third con-
ceivable object, and use the sign^in its stated meaning
of indefinite relation, then the general formula of all
inference may be thus exhibited :
From A = B^C
we may infer A ^ C
or, in words In whatever relation a thing stands to a
second thing, in the same relation it stands to the like or
equivalent of that second thing. The identity between A
and B allows us indifferently to place A where B was or
B where A was, and there is no limit to the variety of
special meanings which we can bestow upon the signs
used in this formula consistently with its truth. Thus if
we first specify only the meaning of the sign *o*, we may
say that if C is the weight of B, then C is also the weight
of A. Similarly
If is the father of B, C is the father of A ;
If C is a fragment of B, C is a fragment of A ;
If C is a quality of B, C is a quality of A ;
If C is a species of B, C is a species of A ;
If C is the equal of B, C is the equal of A ;
and so on ad infinitum.
