GENERALIZATION. 259
that qualities variable in degree will be found in every
substance in a greater or less degree.
It is highly remarkable that Newton, whose method of
investigation was logically perfect, seemed incapable of
generalizing arid describing his own procedure. His
3elebrated ' Bules of reasoning in Philosophy/ described
it the commencement of the third book of the ' Principia/
*re of very questionable truth, and still more questionable
value.
Extreme Instances of Properties.
Although, as we have seen, substances usually differ
ly m degree as regards th'Ir physical properties, great
Qterest may attach to particular substances which mani-
est a property in a Conspicuous and intense manner.
Sveiy branch of physic Science has usually been de-
eloped from the attention forcibly drawn to some sin-
ular substance. Just as the loadstone disclosed mag-
etism and amber frictional electricity, so did Iceland
oar point out the existence of double refraction, and
Jlphate of quinine the phenomenon of fluorescence.
pien one such startling instance has drawn the attention
the scientific world, numerous less remarkable cases of
ie phenomenon will soon be detected, and it will pro-
ibly prove that the property in question is actually
nversal to all matter. Nevertheless, the extreme in-
arices retain their interest, partly in a historical point of
jew, partly because they furnish the most convenient
1 bstances for experiment.
"Francis Bacon was fully aware of the value of such
amples, which he called Ostensive Instances or Light-
ing, Free or Predominant Instances. ' They are those '
says, < which show the nature under investigation
ked, m an exalted condition/or in the highest degree
