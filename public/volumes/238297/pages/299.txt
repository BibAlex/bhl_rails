PHILOSOPHY OF INDUCTIVE INFERENCE. 273
with my assumed piece. But in trying to identify iron, I
am always open to mistake. Nor is this liability to mis-
take a matter of speculation only v .
The history of chemistry shows that the most confident
inferences may have been falsified by the confusion of one
substance with another. Thus strontia was never discri-
minated from baryta until Klaproth and Hatiy detected
differences between some of their properties x . Accordingly
chemists must often have inferred concerning strontia
what was only true of baryta, and vice versd. There is
now no doubt that the recently discovered substances,
coesium and rubidium were long mistaken for potassium v .
Other elements have often been confused together, for
instance, tantalum and niobium ; sulphur and selenium ;
cerium, lanthanum, and didymium ; yttrium and erbium.
Even the best- established laws of physical science do
not exclude false inference. No law of nature has been
better established than that of universal gravitation, and
we believe with the utmost confidence that any body
capable of affecting the senses will attract other bodies,
and fall to the earth if not prevented. Euler remarks
that, although he had never made trial of the stones
which compose the church of Magdeburg, yet he had
not the least doubt that all of them were heavy, and
would fall if unsupported. But he adds, that it would
be extremely difficult to give any satisfactory explanation
of this confident belief 2 . The fact is, that the belief ought
not to amount to certainty until the experiment has been
tried, and in the meantime a slight amount of uncer-
