58 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
in a wedge-shaped glass, so that we have at a single
glance an infinite variety of thicknesses in view. As
Newton himself remarked, a red liquid viewed in this
manner is found to have a pale yellow colour at the
thinnest part, and it passes through orange into red,
which gradually becomes of a deeper and darker tint 1 '.
The effect may be noticed even in a common conical wine-
glass. The prismatic analysis of light from such a wedge-
shaped vessel discloses the reason, by exhibiting the pro-
gressive absorption of different rays of the spectrum as
investigated by Dr. J. H. Gladstone k .
A moving body may sometimes be made to mark out
its own course, like a shooting star which leaves a tail
behind it. Thus an inclined jet of water exhibits in the
clearest manner the parabolic path of a projectile. In
Wheatstone's Kaleidophone the curves produced by the
combination of vibrations of different ratios are shown by
placing bright reflective buttons on the tops of wires of
various forms. The motions are performed so quickly
that the eye receives the impression of the path as a com-
plete whole, just as a burning stick whirled round pro-
duces a continuous circle. The laws of electric induction
are beautifully shown when iron filings are brought under
the influence of a magnet, and fall into curves correspond-
ing to what Faraday called the Lines of Magnetic Force.
When Faraday tried to define what he meant by his
lines of force, he was obliged to refer to the filings. ' By
magnetic curves/ he says 1 , * I mean lines of magnetic
forces which would be depicted by iron filings/ Robison
had previously produced similar curves by the action of
frictional electricity 111 , and from a mathematical investiga-
