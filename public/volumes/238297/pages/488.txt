4G2 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
If we measure over and over again the same angular
magnitude by the same divided circle, maintained in
exactly the same position, it is evident that the same
mark in the circle will be the criterion in each case, and
any error in the position of that mark will equally affect
all our results. But if in each measurement we use a
different part of the circle, a new mark will come into 'use,
and as the error of each mark can hardly be in the same
direction, the average result will be nearly free from
errors of division. It will be still better to use more
than one divided circle.
Even when we have no clear perception of the points of
our apparatus at which fixed error is likely to enter, we
may with advantage vary the construction of our appa-
ratus with the hope that we shall accidentally detect
some latent imperfection. Baily's purpose in repeating
the experiments of Michell and Cavendish on the density
of the earth, was not merely to follow the same course
and verify the previous numbers, but to try whether
variations in the size and substance of the attracting
balls, the mode of suspension, the temperature of the sur-
rounding air, &c., would yield different results. He per-
formed no less than 62 distinct series, comprising 2153
experiments, and he carefully classified and discussed the
results so as to disclose the utmost differences. Again, in
experimenting upon the resistance of the air to the mo-
tion of a pendulum, Baily employed no less than 80
pendulums of various forms and materials, in order to
ascertain exactly upon what conditions the resistance de-
pends. Regnault, in his exact researches upon the dilata-
tion of gases made arbitrary changes in the magnitude of
parts of his apparatus. He thinks that if, in spite of such
modification the results are unchanged, the errors are
probably of inconsiderable amount"; but in reality it is
