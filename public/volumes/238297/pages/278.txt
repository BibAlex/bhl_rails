reasoning, yet a diversity arises . in their application.
Similarity of conditions between the events from which
we argue, and those to which we argue, must always be
the ground of inference ; but this similarity may have
regard either to time or place, or the simple logical
combination of events, or to any conceivable junction of
circumstances involving quality, time, and place. Having
met with many pieces of substance possessing ductility,
and a bright yellow colour, and having discovered, by
perfect induction, that they all possess in addition a high
specific gravity, and a freedom from the corrosive action
of acids, we are led to expect that every piece of substance,
possessing like ductility, and a similar yellow colour, will
have an equally high specific gravity, and a like freedom
from corrosion by acids. This is a case of the co-existence
of qualities ; for the character of the specimens examined
alters not with time or place.
In a second class of cases, time will enter as a prin-
cipal ground of similarity. When we hear a clock
pendulum beat moment ' after moment, at equal in-
tervals, and with a uniform sound, we confidently expect
that the stroke will continue to be repeated uniformly.
A comet having appeared several times at nearly equal
intervals, we infer that it will probably appear again
at the end of another like interval. A man who has
returned home evening after evening for many years,
and found his house standing, may, on like grounds,
expect that it will be standing the next evening, and on
many succeeding evenings. Even the continuous exist-
ence of an object in an unaltered state, or the finding
again of that which we have hidden, is but a matter of
inference to be decided by experience.
A still larger and more complex class of cases involves
the relations of space, in addition to those of time and
quality. Having observed that every triangle drawn upon
