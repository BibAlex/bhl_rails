36 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
pitch as each separate sound. In the case of substantial
terms, certain qualities may be present equally in each
minutest part as in the whole. The chemical nature of
the largest mass of pure carbonate of lime in existence is
the same as the nature of the smallest particle. In the
case of abstract terms, again, we cannot draw a distinction
between whole and part ; what is true of redness in any
case is always true of redness, so far as it is merely red.
Synthesis of Terms.
We continually combine simple terms together so as to
form new terms of more complex meaning. Thus, to
increase the intension of meaning of a term we write it
with an adjective or a phrase of adjectival nature. By
joining ' brittle ' to ' metal/ we obtain a combined term,
'brittle metal,' which denotes a certain portion of the
metals, namely such as are selected on account of pos-
sessing the quality of brittleness. As we have already seen,
'brittle metal' possesses less extension and greater in-
tension than metal. Nouns, prepositional phrases, parti-
cipial phrases and subordinate propositions may also be
added to terms so as to increase their intension and
decrease their extension.
In our symbolic language we need some mode of
indicating this junction of terms, and the most convenient
device will be the simple juxtaposition of the distinct
letter-terms. Thus if A mean brittle, and B mean metal,
then AB will mean brittle metal. Nor need there be any
limit to the number of letters thus joined together, or the
complexity of the notions which they may represent.
Thus if we take the letters
P = metal,
Q = white,
E, = monovalent,
