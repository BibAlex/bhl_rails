272 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
discontinuous quantity or numbers, however, allow of cer-
tainty ; for I may establish beyond doubt, for instance, that
the difference of the squares of 1 7 and 1 3 is the product
of 17 + 13 and 17-13, and is therefore 30 x 4, or 120.
Inferences which we draw concerning natural objects
are never certain except in a hypothetical point of
view. It might seem, indeed, to be certain that iron is
magnetic, or that gold is incapable of solution in nitric
acid ; but, if we carefully investigate the meanings of
these statements, they will be found to involve no cer-
tainty but that of consciousness and that of hypothetical
inference. For what do I mean by iron or gold \ If I
choose a remarkable piece of yellow substance, call it
gold, and then immerse it in a liquid which I call nitric
acid, and find that there is no change called solution,
then consciousness has certainly informed me that with
my meaning of the terms, ' Gold is insoluble in nitric
acid. 5 I may further be certain of something else ; for if
this gold and nitric acid remain what they were, I may be
sure there will be no solution on again trying the experi-
ment, If I take other portions of gold and nitric acid,
and am sure that they really are identical in properties
with the former portions, I can be certain that there will
be no solution. But at this point my knowledge becomes
purely hypothetical ; for how can I be sure without trial
that the gold and acid are really identical in nature with
what I formerly called gold and nitric acid. How do
I know gold when I see it ? If I judge by the appa-
rent qualities colour, ductility, specific gravity, &c., I
may be misled, because there may always exist a sub-
stance which to the colour, ductility, specific gravity, and
other specified qualities, joins others which we do not
expect. Similarly, if iron is magnetic, as shown by an
experiment with objects answering to those names, then
all iron is magnetic, meaning all pieces of matter identical
