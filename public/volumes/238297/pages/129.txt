THE INDIRECT METHOD OF INFERENCE. 103
the premises are plainly of the form
A - B, (i)
= 60. (2)
Now by the Indirect method we obtain from (i) the
Contrapositive
b = a,
and inserting in (2) the equivalent for b we have
C = aO, (3)
or ' the letter w is not a vowel/
Miscellaneous Examples of the Method.
We can apply the Indirect Method of Inference how-
ever many may be the terms involved or the premises
containing those terms. As the working of the method
is best learnt from examples, I will take a case of two
premises forming the syllogism Barbara : thus
Iron is a metal ( i )
Metal is element. (2)
If we want to ascertain what inference is possible con-
cerning the term Iron, we develop the term by the Law
of Duality. Iron must be either metal or not-metal ; iron
which is metal must be either element or riot-element ;
and similarly iron which is not-metal must be either
element or not-element. There are then altogether four
alternatives among which the description of iron must be
contained ; thus
Iron, metal, element, (a)
Iron, metal, not-element, (/3)
Iron, not-metal, element, (7)
Iron, not-metal, not-element. (J)
Our first premise informs us that iron is a metal, and if
we substitute this description in (7) and (S) we shall have
self -contradictory combinations. Our second premise
