PRINCIPLES OF NUMBER.
our principle of substitution always holds true. We may
say in the most general manner that In whatever relation
one quantity stands to another, it stands in the same relation
to the equal of that other. In this axiom we sum up a
number of axioms which have been stated in more or less
detail by algebraists e . Thus, * If equal quantities be
added to equal quantities, the sums will be equal/ To
explain this, let
a = b, c = d.
Now a + c, whatever it means, must be identical with
itself, so that
a + c = a + c.
In one side of this equation substitute for the quantities
their equivalents, and we have the axiom proved
a + c = b + d.
The similar axiom concerning subtraction is equally evi-
dent, for whatever a c may mean it is equal to a c,
and therefore by substitution to b d. Again, * if equal
quantities be multiplied by the same or equal quantities,
the products will be equal/ For evidently
ac = ac,
and if for c in one side we substitute its equal d, we have
ac = ad,
and a second similar substitution gives us
ac = bd.
We might prove a like axiom concerning division in an
exactly similar manner. I might even extend the list of
axioms and say that f Equal powers of equal number are
equal/ For certainly, whatever a x a x a may mean, it is
equal to a x a x a ; hence by our usual substitution
axaxa = bxbxb,
or a 3 = b' 3 .
The truth will hold of roots, that is to say,
y^=t/T,
