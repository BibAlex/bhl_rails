190 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
number we are only at the first step of an extensive
series of generalizations. A number is general as compared
with the particular things numbered, so we may have
general symbols for numbers, or general symbols not for
numbers, but for the relations between undetermined num-
bers. There is, in fact, an unlimited hierarchy of successive
generalizations.
Numerically Definite Reasoning.
It was first discovered by Prof, de Morgan that many
arguments are valid which combine logical and numerical
reasoning, although they could in no way be included in
the ancient logical formulas. He developed the doctrine
of the 'Numerically Definite Syllogism,' fully explained
in his 'Formal Logic' (pp. 141-170). Dr. Boole also
devoted considerable' attention to the determination of
what he called ' Statistical Conditions/ meaning the
numerical conditions of logical classes. In a paper pub-
lished among the Memoirs of the Manchester Literary and
Philosophical Society, Third Series, vol. IV. p. 330
(Session 1869-70), I have pointed out that we can apply
arithmetical calculation to the Logical Abecedarium.
Having given certain logical conditions and the numbers of
objects in certain classes, we can either determine the
number of objects in other classes governed by those con-
ditions, or can show what further data are required to
determine them. As an example of the kind of questions
treated in numerical logic, and the mode of treatment, I
give the following problem suggested by De Morgan, with
my mode of representing its solution f .
f It has been pointed out to me by Mr. A. J. Ellis, F.R.S., that my
solution, as given in the Memoirs of the Manchester Philosophical Society,
does not exactly answer to the conditions of the problem, and I therefore
substitute above a more satisfactory solution.
