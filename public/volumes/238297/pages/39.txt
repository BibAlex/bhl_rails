number of vibrations belonging to a sound of that pitch.
To measure a sound of the same pitch is as good as to
measure the sound itself.
Sir David Brewster, in a somewhat similar manner,
succeeded in measuring the refractive index of irregular
fragments of transparent minerals. It was a troublesome,
and sometimes impracticable work to grind the minerals
into prisms, so that their powers of refracting light could
be directly observed ; but he fell upon the ingenious device
of forming a liquid possessing exactly the same refractive
power as the transparent fragment under examination.
The moment when this equality was attained could be
known by the fragments ceasing to reflect or refract light
when immersed in the liquid, so that they became almost
invisible in it. The refractive power of the liquid being
then measured gives that of the solid ; and a more beau-
tiful instance of representative measurement, depending
immediately upon the principle of inference, could not
be found *.
Throughout the various logical processes which we are
about to consider Deduction, Induction, Generalisation,
Analogy, Classification, Quantitative Reasoning we shall
find the one same principle operating in a more or less
disguised form.
Deduction and Induction.
The processes of inference always depend on the one
same method of substitution ; but they may nevertheless
be distinguished according as the results are inductive or
deductive. As generally stated, deduction consists in
