adopted the generalization that all substances could exist
in all three states. A certain number of gases, such as
oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, have resisted all efforts
to liquefy them, and it now seems probable from the ex-
periments of Dr. Andrews that they are limiting excep-
tions. Dr. Andrews finds that above 88 Fahr. carbonic
acid cannot be liquefied by any pressure he could apply,
whereas below this temperature liquefaction is always
possible. By analogy it becomes highly probable that
even hydrogen might be liquefied if cooled to a sufficiently
low temperature. We must modify our previous views,
and either assert that 'below a certain critical temperature
every gas may be liquefied, or else we must assume that
a highly condensed gas is, when above the critical temper-
ature, undistinguishable from a liquid. At the same time
we receive an explanation of a remarkable exception pre-
sented by liquid carbonic acid to the general rule that
gases expand more by heat than liquids. This liquid
carbonic acid was found by Thilorier in 1835 to expand
more than four times as much as air ; but by the light of
Dr. Andrews' experiments we may learn to regard the
liquid as rather a highly condensed gas than an ordinary
liquid, and it is actually possible to reduce the gas to the
apparently liquid condition without any abrupt conden-
sation P.
It is an empirical law of the planetary system that all
the bodies composing it revolve from west to east ; that
law is broken, as we have seen, in the cases of one planet
and several satellites, probably by the interference of an
accidental disturbing force. The law also fails to be
true of comets, which, taken as a whole, appear to move
according to no single uniform law. This exception, how-
ever, is one of limitation only, for in all probability comets,
although at present members of our system, have not
