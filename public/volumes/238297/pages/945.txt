RESULTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD. 455
'Ninth Bridgwater Treatise P/ Mr. Babbage has pointed
out that if we had power to follow and detect the minutest
effects of any disturbance, each particle of existing matter
must be a register of all that has happened. ' The track
of every canoe of every vessel that has yet disturbed
the surface of the ocean, whether impelled by manual
force or elemental power, remains for ever registered
in the future movement of all succeeding particles which
may occupy its place. The furrow which it left is, indeed,
instantly filled up by the closing waters ; but they draw
after them other and larger portions of the surrounding
element, and these again, once moved, communicate mo-
tion to others in endless succession/ We may even say
that ' The air itself is one vast library, on whose pages
are for ever written all that man has ever said or even
whispered. There, in their mutable but unerring charac-
ters, mixed with the earliest, as well as the latest sighs
of mortality, stand for ever recorded, vows unredeemed,
promises unfulfilled, perpetuating in the united move-
ments of each particle, the testimony of man's changeful
will".'
When we read truthful reflections such as these, we
may congratulate ourselves that we have been endowed
with minds which, rightly employed, can form some esti-
mate of their incapacity, to trace out and account for
all that proceeds in the simpler actions of material nature.
It ought to be added that, wonderful as is the extent
of physical phenomena open to our investigation, intel-
lectual phenomena are yet vastly more extensive. Of
this I might present one satisfactory proof were space
available by pointing out that the mathematical functions
employed in the calculations of physical science, form an
infinitely small fraction of the functions which may be
