INTRODUCTION. 11
The Process of Inference.
The fundamental action of our reasoning faculties
consists in inferring or carrying to a new instance of a
phenomenon whatever we have previously known of its
like, analogue, equivalent or equal. Sameness or identity
presents itself in all degrees, and is known under various
names ; but the great rule of inference embraces all
degrees, and affirms that so far as there exists samene^--
identity or likeness, what is true of one thing will be tnn-.
of the other. The great difficulty of reasoning doubtless
consists in ascertaining that there does exist a sufficient
degree of likeness or sameness to warrant an intended
inference ; and it will be our main task to investigate the
conditions under which the inference is valid. In this
place I wish to point out that there is something common
to all acts of inference however different their apparent
forms. The one same rule lends itself to the most diverse
applications.
The simplest possible case of inference, perhaps, occurs
in the use of a pattern, example, or, as it is commonly
called, a sample. To prove the exact similarity of two
portions of commodity, w r e need not bring one portion
beside the other. It is sufficient that we cut a sample
which exactly represents the texture, appearance, and
general nature of one portion, and according as this
sample agrees or not with the other, so will the two
portions of commodity agree or differ. Whatever is true
as regards the colour, texture, density, material of the
sample will be true of the goods themselves. In such
cases likeness of quality is the condition of inference.
Exactly the same mode of reasoning holds true of
magnitude and figure. To compare the size of two
objects, we need not lay them alongside each other. A
