416 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
made a number of measurements which are equally good
in his opinion, and it is quite apparent that in using an
instrument or apparatus of considerable complication the
observer will not necessarily be able to judge whether
slight causes have affected its operation or not.
In this question, as indeed throughout inductive logic,
we deal only with probabilities. There is no infallible
mode of arriving at the absolute truth, which lies beyond
the reach of human intellect, and can only be the distant
object of our long continued and painful approximations.
Nevertheless there is a mode pointed out alike by common
sense and the highest mathematical reasoning, which is
more likely than any other, as a general rule, to bring us
near the truth . The apia-rov jmerpov, or the aurea mediocritas,
was highly esteemed in the ancient philosophy of Greece
and Rome ; but it is not probable that any of the ancients
should have been able clearly to analyse and express the
reasons why they advocated the mean as the safest course.
But in the last two centuries this apparently simple
question of the mean has been found to afford a field for
the exercise of the utmost mathematical skill. Roger
Cotes, the editor of the ' Principia/ appears to have had
some insight into the value of the mean ; but profound
mathematicians such as De Moivre, Daniel Bernoulli!, La-
place, Lagrange, Gauss, Quetelet, De Morgan, Airy, Leslie,
Ellis and others have hardly exhausted the subject.
Several uses of the Mean Result.
The elimination of errors of unknown sources, is almost
always accomplished by the simple arithmetical process
of taking the mean, or, as it is often called, the average
of several discrepant numbers. To take an average is to
add the several quantities together, and divide by the
number of quantities thus ndded, which gives a quotient
