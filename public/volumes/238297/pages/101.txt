DEDUCTIVE REASONING. 75
readily and clearly explained on the single principle of
substitution. It is now desirable to show that the same
principle would prevent us falling into fallacies. So long
as we exactly observe the one rule of substitution of
equivalents it will be impossible to commit a paralogism,
or to break any one of the elaborate rules of the ancient
system. One rule is thus proved to be as powerful as
the six, eight, or more rules by which the correctness of
syllogistic reasoning was guarded.
It was a fundamental rule, for instance, that two nega-
tive premises could give no conclusion. If we take the
propositions-
Granite is not a sedimentary rock, (i)
Basalt is not a sedimentary rock, (2)
we ought not to be able to draw any inference concerning
the relation of granite and basalt. Taking our letter-
terms thus
A = granite
B = sedimentary rock
C = basalt,
the premises may be expressed in the form
A - B (i)
C - B. (2)
We have in this form two statements of difference ; but
the principle of inference can only work with a statement
of agreement or identity (p. 62). Thus our rule gives
us no power whatever of drawing any inference.
It is to be remembered, indeed, that we claim the
power of always turning a negative proposition into an
affirmative one ; and it might seem that the old rule of
negative premises would be thus circumvented. Let us
try. The premises (i) and (2) when affirmatively stated
(see p. 54), will take the form
A = Kb (i)
