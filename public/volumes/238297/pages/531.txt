EXPERIMENT. 41
rie tic substances he took the greatest precautions against
the presence of any disturbing substance in the copper
wire, wax, paper, and other articles used in suspending
the test objects. It was his invariable custom to try
the effect of the magnet upon the apparatus in the absence
of the object of experiment, and without this preliminary
trial no confidence could be placed in the results b . Tyndall
has also employed the same mode for testing the freedom
of electro-magnetic coils from iron, and was thus enabled
to obtain them devoid of any cause of disturbance . It is
well worthy of notice that in the very infancy of the
science of magnetism, the acute experimentalist Gilbert
correctly accounted for the opinion existing in his day
that magnets would attract silver, by pointing out that
the silver contained ironA
Even when we are not aware by previous experience of
the probable presence of a special disturbing agent, we
ought not to assume the absence of unsuspected inter-
ference. If, then, an experiment is of really high im-
portance, so that any considerable branch of science rests
upon it, we ought to try it again and again, in as varied
conditions as possible. We should intentionally disturb
the apparatus in various ways, so as if possible to hit by
accident upon any peculiar weak points. Especially when
our results are more regular and accordant than we have
fair grounds for anticipating, ought we to suspect some
peculiarity in the apparatus which causes it to measure
some other phenomenon than that in question, just as
Foucault's pendulum almost invariably indicates the re-
volution of the axes of its own elliptic path instead of the
revolution of the globe.
It was in this cautious spirit that Baily acted in his
