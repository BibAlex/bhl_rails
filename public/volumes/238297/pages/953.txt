RESULTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD. 463
of phenomena there can be no causal or genetic connexion.'
Living forms as we now regard them are essentially
variable. Now from constant mechanical causes constant
effects would ensue. If vegetable cells are formed on
geometrical principles, being first spherical, and then by
mutual compression dodecahedral, then all cells should
have similar forms. In the Foraminifera and some other of
the more lowly organisms, we do seem to observe the pro-
duction of complex forms on pure geometrical principles.
But from similar causes acting according to similar laws
and principles, only similar results could be produced. If
the original life-germ of each creature is a simple particle
of protoplasm, unendowed with any distinctive forces, then
the whole of the complex phenomena of animal and vege-
table life are effects without causes. Protoplasm may be
chemically the same substance, and the germ-cell of a
man and of a fish may be apparently the same, so far as
the microscope can decide ; but if certain cells produce
men and others as uniformly produce a given species of
fish, there must be a hidden constitution determining the
extremely different results. If this were not so, the
generation of every living creature from the uniform
germ would have to be regarded as a distinct act of
arbitrary creation.
! Theologians have dreaded the establishment of the
theories of Darwin and Spencer, as if they thought that
those theories could explain everything upon the purest
mechanical and material principles, and exclude all notions
of design.^ They do not see that those theories have
opened up more questions than they have closed. I The
doctrine of evolution gives a complete explanation of no
single living form. ) While showing the general principles
which prevail in the variation of living creatures, it only
points out the infinite complexity of the causes and cir-
cumstances which have led to the present state of things.
