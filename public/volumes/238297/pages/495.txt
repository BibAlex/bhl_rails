OBSERVATION.
tendencies to error exist, and fallacious opinions arise in
consequence.
It is exceedingly rare to find persons who can with /
perfect fairness estimate and register facts for and against/
their own peculiar views and theories. Among uncultivated
observers the tendency to remark favourable and forget
unfavourable events is so great, that no reliance can be
placed upon their supposed observations. Thus arises the
enduring fallacy that the changes of the weather coincide
in some way or other with the changes of the moon,
although exact and impartial registers give no countenance
to the fact. The whole race of prophets and quacks live
upon the overwhelming effect of one success, compared
with hundreds of failures which are unmentioned .and
forgotten. As Bacon says, * Men mark when they hit, and
never mark when they miss/ We should do well to bear
in mind the ancient story, quoted by Bacon, of one who
in Pagan times was shown a temple with a picture of all
the persons who had been saved from shipwreck, after
paying their vows. When asked whether he did not now
acknowledge the power of the gods, ' Aye/ he answered ;
' but where are they painted that were drowned after their
vows ? '
If indeed we could estimate the amount of lias existing
in any particular observations, it might be treated like one
of the forces of the problem, and the true course of ex-
ternal nature might still be rendered apparent. But the
feelings of an observer are usually too indeterminate, so
that whenever there is reason to suspect any considerable
amount of bias, rejection is the only safe course. As re-
gards facts casually registered in past times, the capacities
and impartiality of the observer are so little known that
we should spare no pains to replace these statements by a
new appeal to nature. An indiscriminate medley of truth
and absurdity, such as Francis Bacon has collected in his
