CHARACTER OF THE EXPERIMENTALIST. 235
gained the first success ; on August soth he began to
work with common electricity, vainly trying glass, quartz,
Iceland spar, &c. Several days of labour gave no result,
yet he did not desist. Heavy glass, a transparent medium
of great refractive powers, composed of borate of lead, was
now tried, by being placed between the poles of a powerful
electro-magnet, while a ray of polarized light was trans-
mitted through it. When the poles of the electro-magnet
were arranged in certain positions with regard to the
substance under trial, no effects were apparent; but at
last Faraday happened fortunately to place a piece of
heavy glass so that contrary magnetic poles were on the
same side, and now an effect was witnessed. The glass
was found to have the power of twisting the plane of
polarization of the ray of light.
All Faraday's recorded thoughts upon this great experi-
ment are replete with curious interest. He attributes his
success to the opinion, almost amounting to a conviction,
that the various forms, under which the forces of matter
are made manifest, have one common origin, and are so
directly related and mutually dependent that they are
convertible. ' This strong persuasion/ he says, ( extended
to the powers of light, and led to many exertions having
for their object the discovery of the direct relation of light
and electricity. These ineffectual exertions could not
remove my strong persuasion, and I have at last suc-
ceeded/ He describes the phenomenon in somewhat figu-
rative language as the magnetization of a ray of light,
and also as the illumination of a magnetic curve or line
of force. He has no sooner got the effect in one case,
than he proceeds, with his characteristic comprehensive-
ness of research, to test the existence of a like phenomenon
in all the substances available. He finds that not only
