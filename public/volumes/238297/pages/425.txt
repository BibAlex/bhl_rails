ANALYSIS OF QUANTITATIVE PHENOMENA, 399
for atmospheric refraction, nutation, aberration, pre-
cession, instrumental irregularities, &c., and can with
difficulty be detected among these phenomena of various
magnitude. But, as Galileo long ago suggested, all
such difficulties would be avoided by the differential
observation of stars, which though apparently close
together are really far separated on the line of sight.
Two such stars in close apparent proximity will be sub-
ject to almost exactly equal errors, so that all we
need do is to observe the apparent change of place of
the nearer star as referred to the more distant one.
A good telescope furnished with an accurate micrometer
is alone needed for the application of the method.
Huyghens appears to have been the first observer who
actually tried to employ the method practically P, but
it was not until 1835 that the improvement of telescopes
and micrometers enabled Struve to detect in this way
the parallax of the star a Lyrae.
It is one of the many advantages of the observation
of transits of Venus for the determination of the solar
parallax that the refraction of the atmosphere affects
in an exactly equal degree the planet and the portion
of the sun's face over which it is passing. Thus the
observations are strictly of a differential nature.
By the process of substitutive weighing it is possible
to ascertain the equality or inequality of two weights
with almost perfect freedom from error. If two weights
A and B be placed in the scales of the best balance
we cannot be sure that the equilibrium of the beam
indicates exact equality, because the arms of the beam
may be unequal or unbalanced. But if we take B out
and put another weight C in, and equilibrium still
exists, it is apparent that the same causes of erroneous
