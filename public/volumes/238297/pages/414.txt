measured before we possess the materials for a true
inductive treatment.
Illustrations of the Complication of Effects.
It is easy to bring forward a multitude of instances to
show that a phenomenon is seldom to be observed simple
and alone. A more or less elaborate process of analysis
is almost always necessary. Thus if an experimentalist
wishes to observe and measure the expansion of a liquid
by heat, he places it in a thermometer tube and registers
the rise of the column of liquid in the narrow tube. But
he cannot heat the liquid without also heating the . glass,
so that the change observed is really the difference between
the expansions of the liquid and the glass. More minute
investigation will show the necessity perhaps of allowing
for further effects, namely the compression of the liquid
or the expansion of the bulb due to the increased pressure
of the column as it becomes lengthened.
In a great many cases an observed effect wih 1 be ap-
parently at least the simple sum of two separate and
independent effects. The heat evolved in the combustion
of oil is partly due to the carbon and partly to the
hydrogen. A measurement of the heat yielded by the two
jointly, cannot inform us how much proceeds from the
one and how much from the other. If by some separate
determination we can ascertain how much the hydrogen
yields, then by mere subtraction we learn what is due
to the carbon ; and vice versa. The heat conveyed by a
liquid, may be partly conveyed by true conduction, partly
by convection. The light dispersed in the interior of a
liquid consists both of what is reflected by floating
particles and what is due to true fluorescence a ; and we
must find some mode of determining one portion before
we can learn the other.
