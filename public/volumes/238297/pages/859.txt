CLASSIFICATION. 309

AbcDe abcDe.
They are now classified, so that those containing A stand
first, and those devoid of A second, but no other property
seems to be correlated with A. Let us alter this arrange-
ment and group the combinations as follows :
ABCdE A&CDE
ABcde AbcDe
aBCdE a&CDE
aEcde abcDe.
It requires very little examination to discover that, in the
first group, B is always present and D absent, whereas in
the second group, B is always absent and D present. This
is the result which follows from a law of the form B = d
(see vol. i. p. 157), so that in this mode of arrangement
we readily discover a close correlation between two letters.
Altering the groups again as follows :
ABCcZE ABcde
aBCdE aBcde
A&CDE AbcDe
a&CDE abcDe,
we discover another evident correlation between C and E.
Between A and the other letters, or between the two pairs
of letters B, D and 0, E there is no logical connexion
whatever.
This example may perhaps seem tedious, but it will be
found instructive in this way. We are classifying only
seven objects or combinations, in each of which only five
qualities are considered. There are only two laws of cor-
relation between four of those five qualities, and those
laws are of the simplest logical character. Yet the reader
would hardly discover what those laws were, and confi-
