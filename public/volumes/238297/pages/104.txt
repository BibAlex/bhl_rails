78 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
we might inadvertently but fallaciously infer that, ' Fixed
stars are not subject to gravity/ To reduce the premises
to symbolic form, let
A = planet
B = fixed star
C = subject to gravity ;
then we have the propositions
A = AC (i)
B = Ba. (2)
The reader will try in vain to produce from these
premises by legitimate substitution any relation between
B and C ; he could not then commit the fallacy of
asserting that B is not C.
There remain two other kinds of paralogism, com-
monly known as the fallacy of Four Terms and the Illicit
Process of the Minor term. They are so evidently impos-
sible while we obey the rule of the substitution of equi-
valents, that it is not necessary to give any illustrations.
When there are four distinct terms in two propositions
there could be no opening for a substitution. As to the
Illicit Process of the Minor it consists in a flagrant sub-
stitution for a term of another wider term which is not
known to be equivalent to it, and which is therefore
forbidden by our rule to be substituted for it.
