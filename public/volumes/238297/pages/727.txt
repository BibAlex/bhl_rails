CHARACTER OF THE EXPERIMENTALIST. 237
and in such things as these, experiment is the best test
of such consistency/
He executed many difficult and tedious experiments,
which are described in the 24th Series of Experimental
Researches ; but the result was nil. And yet he con-
cludes, ' Here end my trials for the present. The results
are negative ; they do not shake my strong feeling
of the existence of a relation between gravity and elec-
tricity, though they give no proof that such a relation
exists.'
He returned to the work when he was ten years older,
and in 18589 recorded many remarkable reflections and
experiments. He was much struck by the fact that elec-
tricity is essentially a dual force, and it had always been
a peculiar conviction of Faraday that no body could be
electrified positively without some other body becoming
electrified negatively ; some of his researches had been
simple developments of this necessary relation. But ob-
serving that between two mutually gravitating bodies
there was no apparent circumstance to determine which
shall be positive and which negative, he does not hesitate
to call in question an old opinion. ' The evolution of one
electricity would be a new and very remarkable thing.
The idea throws a doubt on the whole ; but still try, for
who knows what is possible in dealing with gravity.'
We cannot but notice the candour with which he thus
in his laboratory book acknowledges the doubtfulness
of the whole thing, and is yet prepared as a forlorn
hope to frame experiments in opposition to all his pre-
vious experience of the course of nature. For a time
his thoughts flow on as if the strange detection were
already made, and he had only to trace out its conse-
quences throughout the universe. ' Let us encourage our-
selves by a little more imagination prior to experiment/
he says, and then he reflects upon the infinity of actions
