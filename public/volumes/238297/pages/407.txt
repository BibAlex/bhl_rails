rapidly grow in complexity, and the powers of scientific
prediction are correspondingly augmented.
The late Mr. Babbage c proposed the formation of a
complete collection of all the constant numbers of nature ;
but such a collection would be almost coextensive with
the whole mass of scientific literature. Almost all numbers
occurring in works on Chemistry, Mineralogy, Physics,
Astronomy, &c. are natural constants, and it would be
impracticable to give in any one w^ork more than a
selection of the more important numbers.
Our present object will be to classify these constant
numbers roughly, according to their comparative gener-
ality and importance, under the following heads :
(1) Mathematical constants.
(2) Physical constants.
(3) Astronomical constants.
(4) Terrestrial numbers.
(5) Organic numbers.
(6) Social numbers.
Mathematical Constants.
At the head of the list of natural constants must come
those which express the necessary relations of numbers
to each other. The ordinary Multiplication Table is the
most familiar and the most important of such series of
constants, and is, theoretically speaking, infinite in extent.
Next we must place the Arithmetical Triangle, the sig-
nificance of which has already been pointed out (p. 206.)
Tables of logarithms also contain vast series of natural
constants, arising out of the relations of pure numbers.
At the base of all logarithmic theory is the mysterious
natural constant commonly denoted by E, e, or e, being
equal to the infinite series T + - + + -f - + . ,
