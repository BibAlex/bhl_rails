an indefinite extent of logical arguments immediately
deducible from the principle of substitution of which
the ancient syllogism forms but a small and not even
the most important part.
The Logic of Relatives.
There is a difficult and important branch of logic
which may be called the Logic of Relatives. If I argue,
for instance, that because Daniel BernouUi was the son
of John, and John the brother of James, therefore Daniel
was the nephew of James, it is not possible to prove
this conclusion by any simple logical process. We re-
quire at any rate to assume that the son of a brother is
a nephew. A simple logical relation is that which exists
between properties and circumstances of the same object
or class. But objects and classes of objects may also be
related according to aU the properties of time and space.
I believe it may be shown, indeed, that where an inference
concerning such relations is drawn, a process of substi-
tution is really employed and an identity must exist ;
but I wih 1 not undertake to prove the assertion in this
work. The relations of time and space are logical
relations of a complicated character demanding much
abstract and difficult investigation. The subject has been
treated with such great ability by Professors Peirce x ,
De Morgan y, Ellis z , and Harley, that I will not in the
