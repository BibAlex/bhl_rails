construction of the thermometer, and it has recently been
advanced by the introduction of the thermo-electric pile.
Chemistry has been created chiefly by the careful use of
the balance, which forms a unique instance of an instru-
ment remaining substantially in the form in which it was
first applied to scientific purposes by Archimedes. The
balance never has been and probably never can be im-
proved, except in details of construction. On the other
hand, the torsion balance, introduced by Coulomb towards
the end of last century, has rapidly become essential in
many branches of investigation. In the hands of Caven-
dish and Baily, it gave a determination of the earth's
density ; applied in the galvanometer, it gave a delicate
measure of electrical forces, and was essential to the
introduction of the thermo-electric pile. This balance is
made by simply suspending any light rod by a thin wire
or thread attached to the middle point. And we owe to
it almost all the more delicate investigations in the theo-
ries of heat, electricity, and magnetism.
Though we can now take note of the millionth of an
inch in space, and the millionth of a second in time, we
must not overlook the fact that in other operations of
science we are yet in the position of the Chaldaaans. Not
many years have elapsed since the magnitudes of the
stars, meaning the amount of light they send to the
observer's eye, were guessed at in the rudest manner, and
the astronomer adjudged a star to this or tfi&t order of
magnitude by a rough comparison with other stars of the
same order. To the late Sir John Herschel we owe an
attempt to introduce an uniform method of measurement
and expression, bearing some relation to the real photo-
metric magnitudes of the stars d . Previous to the re-
