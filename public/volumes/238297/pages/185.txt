INDUCTION. 159
varieties may not be equivalent to others ; and trial
shows, in fact, that AB = ABC is exactly the same in
meaning as Ac = Kbc or Be = Bca. Thus the law in
question has but eight varieties of distinct logical mean-
ing. I now ascertain by actual deductive reasoning which
of the 256 series of combinations result from each of
these distinct laws, and mark them off as soon as found.
I now proceed to some other form of law, for instance
A = ABC, meaning that whatever has the qualities of A has
those also of B and C. I find that it admits of twenty-
four variations, all of which are found to be logically
distinct ; the combinations being worked out, I am able
to mark off twenty-four more of the list of 256 series. I
proceed in this way to work out the results of every form of
law which I can find or invent. If in the course of this
work I obtain any series of combinations which had been
previously marked off, I learn at once that the law is
logically equivalent to some law previously treated. It
may be safely inferred that every variety of the ap-
parently new law will coincide in meaning with some
variety of the former expression of the same law. I
have sufficiently verified this assumption in some cases
and have never found it lead to error. Thus just as
AB = ABC is equivalent to Ac = A&c, so we find that
ab = ab(j is equivalent to ac==acB.
Among the laws treated were the two A = AB and
A = B which involve only two terms, because it may of
course happen that among three things two only are
in special logical relation, and the third independent ; and
the series of combinations representing such cases of
relation are sure to occur in the complete enumeration.
All single propositions which I could invent having been
treated, pairs of propositions were next investigated.
Thus we have the relations, 'All A's are B's and all
B's are C's/ of which the old logical syllogism is the
