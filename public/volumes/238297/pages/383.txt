CHAPTER XIV.
UNITS AND STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT.
INSTRUMENTS of measurement are, as we have seen,
only means of comparison between one magnitude and
another, and as a general rule we must assume some
one arbitrary magnitude, in terms of which all results
of measurement are to be expressed. Mere ratios be-
tween any series of objects will never tell us their
absolute magnitudes ; we must have at least one ratio
for each, and we must have one absolute quantity. The
number of ratios n are expressible in n equations, which
will contain at least n + i quantities, so that if we
employ them to make known n magnitudes, we must
have one magnitude known. Hence, whether we are
measuring time, space, density, weight, mass, energy, or
any other physical quantity, we must refer to some con-
crete standard, some actual object, which if once lost and
irrecoverable, all our measures lose their absolute mean-
ing. This concrete standard is in all, except two, cases
absolutely arbitrary in point of theory, and its selection
a question of practical convenience.
Of the two cases in which a natural standard unit is
ready made for us, one case is that of number itself.
Abstract number needs no special unit ; for any object
by existing or being thought of as separate from other
objects (p. 176), furnishes us with a unit, and is the only
standard required.
