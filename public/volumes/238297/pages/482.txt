for the elimination of the error. As Flamsteed says <i, ' Om
good instrument is of as much worth as a hundred in-
different ones/ But an instrument is good or bad only in
a comparative sense, and no instrument gives invariable
and truthful results. Hence we must always ultimately
fall back upon general probabilities for the selection of the
final mean, when our other precautions are exhausted.
Very difficult questions sometimes arise when one or
more results of a method of experiment diverge widely
from the mean of the rest. Are we or are we not to ex-
clude them in adopting the supposed true mean result of
the method. The drawing of a mean result rests, as I
have frequently explained, upon the assumption that every
error acting in one direction will probably be balanced by
other errors acting iri an opposite direction. If then we
know or can possibly discover any causes of error not
agreeing with this assumption, we shall be justified in
excluding results which seem to be affected by this cause.
In reducing large series of astronomical observations, it is
not uncommon to meet with numbers differing from others
by a whole degree or half a degree, or some considerable in-
tegral quantity. These are errors which could hardly arise
in the act of observation or in instrumental irregularity ;
but they might readily be accounted for by misreading
of figures or mistaking of division marks. It would be
absurd to trust to chance that such mistakes would
balance each other in the long run, and it is therefore
better to correct arbitrarily the supposed mistake, or
better still, if new observations can be made, to strike
out the divergent numbers altogether. When results
come sometimes too great or too small in a regular
manner, we should suspect that some part of the instru-
ment slips through a definite space, or that a definite
cause of error enters at times, and not at others. We
