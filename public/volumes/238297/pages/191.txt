INDUCTION. 165
data afforded by the objects which have been examined. j
If I judge that a distant star obeys the law of gravity,
it must be because all other material objects sufficiently
known to me obey that law. If I venture to assert that
all ruminant animals have cloven hoofs, it is because all
ruminant animals which have come to my notice have
cloven hoofs. On the other hand I cannot safely say
that all cryptogamous plants possess a purely cellular
structure, because some such plants have a partially
vascular structure. The probability that a new crypto-
gam will be cellular only can be estimated, if at all, on the
ground of the comparative numbers of known cryptogams
which are and are not cellular. Thus the first step in
every induction will consist in accurately summing up
the number of instances of a particular object or pheno-
menon which have fallen under our observation. Adams
and Leverrier, for instance, must have inferred that the
undiscovered planet Neptune would obey Bode's law,
because all the planets knoivn at that time obeyed it. On
what principles and on what circumstances the passage
from the known to the apparently unknown is warranted,
must be carefully discussed in the next section, and in
various parts of this work.
It would be a great mistake, however, to suppose that
Perfect Induction is in itself useless. Even when the
enumeration of objects belonging to any class is complete,
and admits of no inference to unexamined objects, the
enumeration of our knowledge in a general proposition is
a process of so much importance that we may consider it
practically necessary. In many cases we may render our
investigations exhaustive ; all the teeth or bones of an
animal ; all the cells in a minute vegetable organ ; all the
caves in a mountain side ; all the strata in a geological
section ; all the coins in a newly found hoard, may be so
completely scrutinized that we may make some general
