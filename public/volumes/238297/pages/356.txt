330 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
equals the object, as in surveying land, or determining a
weight by the balance. The requisites of accuracy now
are: (i) That 'we can repeat unit after unit of exactly
equal magnitude ; (2) That these can be joined together
so that the aggregate shall really be the sum of the
parts. The same conditions apply to subdivision, which
may be regarded as a multiplication of subordinate units.
In order to measure to the thousandth of an inch, we
must be able to add thousandth after thousandth without
error in the magnitude of these spaces, or in their con-
junction.
The condenser electrometer, as remarked by Thomson
and Tait % is a good example of an instrument unfitted to
give any sure measure of electro-motive force, because the
friction between the parts of the condenser often produces
more electricity than the original quantity which was to
be measured.
Measuring Instruments.
To consider the mechanical construction of scientific
instruments, is no part of my purpose in this book. I
wish to point out merely the general purpose of such
instruments, and the methods adopted to carry out that
purpose with great precision. In the first place we must
distinguish between the instrument which effects a com-
parison between two quantities, and the standard mag-
nitude which often forms one of the quantities compared.
The astronomer's clock, for instance, is no standard of the
efflux of time ; it serves but to subdivide, with approxi-
mate accuracy, the interval of successive passages of a
star across the meridian, which it may effect perhaps to
the tenth part of a second, or 8 6 4 1 oir part of the whole.
