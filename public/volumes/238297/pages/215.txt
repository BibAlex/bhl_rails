PRINCIPLES OF NUMBER. 189..
may be discriminated from each other, and similarly with
the people, then there arises a resemblance between the
chairs and people, and this resemblance in number may be
the ground of inference. If on another occasion the chairs
are filled by people again, we may infer that these people
must resemble the others in number, though they need not
resemble them in any other points.
Groups of units are what we really treat in arithmetic.
The number Jive is really 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, but for the sake
of conciseness we substitute the more compact sign 5, or
the name five. These names being arbitrarily imposed in
any one manner, an indefinite variety of relations spring
up between them which are not m the least arbitrary. If
we define four asi + i+i + i, and five asi + i + i + i + i,
then of course it follows i\\&ifive -four + i ; but it would
be equally possible to take this latter equality as a defi-
nition, in which case one of the former equalities would
become an inference. It is hardly requisite to decide how
we define the names of numbers, provided we remember
that out of the infinitely numerous relations of one number
to others, some one relation expressed in an equality
must -be a definition of the number in question and the
other relations immediately become necessary inferences.
In the science of number the variety of classes which
-can be formed is altogether infinite, and statements of
perfect generality may be made subject only to difficulty
or exception at the lower end of the scale. Every existing
number for instance belongs to the class
m + 7;
that is, every number must be the sum of another number
and seven, except of course the first six or seven numbers,
negative quantities not being here taken into account.
Every number is the half of some other, and so on. The
subject of generalization, as exhibited in arithmetical or
mathematical truths, is an indefinitely wide one. In
