52 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
measure electricity as the variant. That one of the two
measured quantities which is an antecedent condition of
the other will be the variable.
It will always be convenient to have the variable en-
tirely under our command. Experiments may indeed be*
made with accuracy, provided we can exactly measure the
variable at the moment when the quantity of the effect is
determined by it. But if we have to trust to the action
of some capricious and very uncertain force, there may be
great difficulty in making exact measurements, and those
results may not be disposed over the whole range of
quantity in a convenient manner. It is one prime object
of the experimenter, therefore, to obtain a regular and
governable supply of the cause or force which he is in-
vestigating. To determine correctly the efficiency of wind-
mills, when the natural winds were constantly varying in
force, would be exceedingly difficult. Smeaton, therefore,
in his experiments on the subject, created a uniform arti-
ficial wind of the required force by moving his models
against the air on the extremity of a revolving arm b .
The velocity of the wind could thus be rendered greater
or less, it could be maintained uniform for any length of
time, and its amount could be exactly ascertained. In
determining the laws of the chemical action of light it
would be out of the question to employ the rays of the
sun, which vary in intensity with the clearness of the
atmosphere, and with every passing cloud. One great
source of difficulty in photometry and the experimental
investigation of the chemical action of light consists in
obtaining a perfectly uniform and governable source of
light rays c .
