THEORY OF APPROXIMATION. 103
differ only by an imperceptible quantity. To the car-
penter anything less than the hundredth part of an inch
is non-existent ; there are few arts or artists to which the
hundred-thousandth of an inch is of any account. Since
all coincidence between physical magnitudes is judged by
one or other sense, we must be restricted to a knowledge
of apparent equality.
In reality even apparent equality is rarely to be ex-
pected. More commonly experiments will give only
probable equality, that is results will come so near to
each other that the difference may be ascribed to un-
important disturbing causes. Thus physicists often assume
quantities to be equal provided that they fall within the
limits of probable error of the processes employed. We
cannot expect observations to agree with theory more
closely than they agree with each other, as Newton re-
marked of his investigations concerning Halley's Comet.
Arithmetic of Approximate Quantities.
Considering that almost all the quantities which we
treat in physical and social science are approximate only,
it seems desirable that some attention should be paid in
the teaching of arithmetic to the correct interpretation
and treatment of approximate numerical statements. We
ought carefully to distinguish between 2*5 when it means
exactly two and a half, and when it means, as it usually
does, anything between 2*45 and 2*55 It would be better
in the latter case to write the number as 2*5 .... and we
might then distinguish 2*50 .... as meaning anything
between 2*495 . . . . and 2*505. When approximate
numbers are added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided,
it becomes a matter of some complexity to determine
the degree of accuracy of the result. There are few
persons, for instance, who could assert straightway that
