seems to fail at several points. If past time be infinite,
why may not matter have been created infinite also 1 It
would be most reasonable, again, to suppose the matter
destroyed in any time to be proportional to the matter
then remaining, and not to the original quantity ; under
this hypothesis even a finite quantity of original matter
could never wholly disappear from the universe. For like
reasons we cannot hold that the doctrine of the Conserva-
tion of Energy is really proved, or can ever be proved to
be absolutely true, however probable it may be regarded
on many grounds.
Tendency to Hasty Generalization.
In spite of all the powers and advantages of generali-
zation, men require no incitement to generalize ; they are
too apt to draw hasty and ill-considered inferences. As
Francis Bacon said, our intellects want not wings, but
rather weights of lead to moderate their course 1 . The
process is inevitable to the human mind ; it begins with
childhood and lasts through the second childhood. The
child that has once been hurt fears the like result on all
similar occasions, and can with cti^ficulty be made to dis-
tinguish between case and case. It is caution and dis-
crimination in the adoption of general conclusions that we
chiefly have to learn, and the whole experience of life is
one continued lesson to this effect. Baden Powell has
excellently described this strong natural propensity to
hasty inference, and the fondness of the human mind for
tracing resemblances real or fanciful. * Our first induc-
tions/ he says k , 'are always imperfect and inconclusive ;
we advance towards real evidence by successive approxi-
mations : and accordingly we find false generalization the
