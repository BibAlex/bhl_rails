difficulty commence. In entering, any path served him ;
in leaving, he must select certain definite paths, and in
this selection he must either trust to memory of the way
he entered or else make an exhaustive trial of all possible
ways. The explorer entering a new country makes sure
his line of return by barking the trees.
The same difficulty arises in many scientific processes.
Given any two numbers, we may by a simple and infallible
process obtain their product, but it is quite another matter
when a large number is given to determine its factors.
Can the reader say what two numbers multiplied together
will produce the number 8,616,460,799 1 I think it
unlikely that any one but myself will ever know ; for
they are two large prime numbers, and can only be re-
discovered by trying in succession a long series of prime
divisors until the right one be fallen upon. The work
would probably occupy a good computer for many weeks,
but it did not occupy me many minutes to multiply the
two factors together. Similarly there is no direct process
for discovering whether any number is a prime or not ;
it is only by exhaustingly trying all inferior numbers
which could be divisors, that we can show there is none,
and the labour of the process would be intolerable were it
not performed systematically once for all in the process
known as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, the results being
registered in tables of prime numbers.
The immense difficulties which are encountered in the
solution of algebraic equations are another illustration.
Given any algebraic factors, we can easily and infallibly
arrive at the product, but given a product it is a matter
of infinite difficulty to resolve it into factors. Given any
series of quantities however numerous, there is very little
trouble in making an equation which shall have those
quantities as roots. Let a, 6, c, d, &c., be the quantities ;
then (x a) (x b) (x c) (x d) = o
