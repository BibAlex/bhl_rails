146 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Induction of Simple Identities.
Many of the most important laws of nature are ex-
pressible in the form of simple identities, and I can at once
adduce them as examples to illustrate what I have said
of the difficulty of the inverse process of induction. There
are many cases in which two phenomena are usually con-
joined. Thus all gravitating matter is exactly coincident
with all matter possessing inertia ; where one property
appears, the other likewise appears. All crystals of the
cubical system, are all the crystals which do not doubly
refract light. All exogenous plants are, with some ex-
ceptions, those which have two cotyledons or seed-leaves.
A little reflection will show that there is no direct and
infallible process by which such complete coincidences m ;y
be discovered. Natural objects are aggregates of many
qualities, and any one of those qualities may prove to be
in close connection with some others. If each of a
numerous group of objects is endowed with a hundred
distinct physical or chemical qualities, there will be no
less than -^(100x99) or 4950 pairs of qualities, which
may be connected, and it will evidently be a matter of
great intricacy and labour to ascertain exactly which
qualities are connected by any simple law.
One principal source of difficulty is that the finite powers
of the human mind are not sufficient to compare by a
single act any large group of objects with another large
group. We cannot hold in the conscious possession of the
mind at any one moment more than five or six different
ideas. Hence we must treat any more complex group by
successive acts of attention. The reader will perceive by
an almost individual act of comparison that the words
Roma and Mora contain the same letters. He may
perhaps see at a glance whether the same is true of
Causal and Casual, and of Logica and Caligo. To assure
