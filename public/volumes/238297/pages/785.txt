ANALOGY. 295
hardly less important epoch in science than his far more
celebrated theory of gravitation. It opened the way to
all the subsequent applications of mechanical principles to
the insensible motion of molecules. He seemed to have
been frequently, too, upon the brink of another appli-
cation of the same principles which would have advanced
science by at least a century of progress, and made him
the undisputed founder of all the theories of matter. He
expressed opinions at various times that light might be
due to undulatory movements of a medium occupying
space, and in one intensely interesting sentence remarks
that colours are probably vibrations of different lengths,
' much after the manner that, in the sense of hearing,
nature makes use of aerial vibrations of several big-
nesses to generate sounds of divers tones, for the analogy
of nature is to be observed '. He correctly foresaw that
red and yellow light would consist of the longer undula-
tions, and blue and violet of the shorter, while white light
would be composed of an indiscriminate mixture of waves
of various lengths. Newton almost overcame one of the
strongest apparent difficulties of the undulatory theory of
light, namely, the propagation of light in straight lines.
For he observed that though waves of sound bend round
an obstacle to some extent, they do not do so in the same
degree as water-waves 11 . He had but to extend the ana-
logy proportionally to light-waves, and not only would
the difficulty have vanished, but the true theory of dif-
fraction would have been open to him. Unfortunately
he had a preconceived theory that rays of light are bent
from and not towards the shadow of a body, a theory
which for once he did not sufficiently compare with ob-
servation to detect its falsity. I am not aware, too, that
