CHAPTEE XXIX.
EXCEPTIONAL PHENOMENA.
IF science consists in the detection of identity and the
recognition of one uniformity existing in many objects, it
follows almost of necessity that the progress of science
depends upon the study of exceptional phenomena. Such
new phenomena are the raw material upon which we are
to exert our faculties of observation and reasoning, in
order to reduce the new facts beneath the sway of the
laws of nature, either those laws already weU known, or
those to be discovered. Not only are strange and inex-
plicable facts those which are on the whole most likely to
lead us to some novel and important discovery, but they
are also best fitted to arouse our attention. So long as
events happen in accordance with our anticipations, and
the routine of every-day observation is unvaried, there is
nothing to impress upon the mind the smallness of its
knowledge, and the depth of mystery, which may be
hidden in the commonest sights and objects. In early
times the myriads of stars which remained in apparently
fixed relative positions upon the heavenly sphere, re-
ceived far less notice from astronomers than those few
planets whose wandering and inexplicable motions formed
an unsolved riddle. Hipparchus was induced to prepare
the first catalogue of stars, because a single new star had
been added to those nightly visible ; and in the middle
