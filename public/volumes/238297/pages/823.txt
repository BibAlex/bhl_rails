belonging to any part of the spectrum, and it seems pro-
bable that this effect arises from the impact of distinct but
conflicting atoms. Nor is it in light only that we discover
limiting exceptions to the law of forced vibrations ; for if
we closely observe gentle waves lapping upon the stones
at the edge of a lake or other piece of water, we shall
notice that each larger wave in breaking upon a stone
gives rise to a series of waves of a smaller order. Thus
there must be constantly in progress a degradation in the
magnitude of water-waves. The principle of forced vibra-
tions seems then to be too generally stated by Sir John
Herschel, but it must be a very difficult question of me-
chanical theory to discriminate the circumstances in which
it does and does not hold true.
We may sometimes foresee the possible existence of
exceptions yet unknown by experience, and limit the
statement of our discoveries accordingly. Very extensive
inquiries have shown that all substances yet examined
faU into one of two classes ; they are all either ferro-
magnetic, that is, magnetic in the same way as iron, or
they are diamagnetic like bismuth. But it does not
thence follow that every substance must be ferro-magnetic
or diamagnetic. The magnetic properties are shown by
Sir W. Thomson to depend upon the specific inductive
capacities of the substance in three rectangular directions.
If these inductive capacities are all positive, we have a
ferro-magnetic substance ; if negative, a diamagnetic sub-
stance ; but if the specific inductive capacity were posi-
tive in one direction and negative in the others, we should
have an exception to previous experience, and could not
place the substance under either of the present recognised
classes.
So many gases have been reduced to the liquid state,
and so many solids fused, that scientific men rather hastily
