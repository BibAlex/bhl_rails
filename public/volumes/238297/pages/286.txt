260 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
derivatives the Italian cosa, and the French chose, mean
/ simply thing. In the German equivalent ursache, we have
plainly the original meaning of thing before, the sacke
denoting ' interesting or important object/ the English
sake, and ur being the equivalent of the English ere,
before* 1 . We abandon, then, both etymology and philo-
sophy, when we attribute to the laws of causation any
meaning beyond that of the conditions in which an event
may be expected to happen, according to our observation
of the previous course of nature.
I have no objection to use the words cause and
causation, provided they are never allowed to lead us to
imagine that our knowledge of nature can attain to cer-
tainty. I repeat that if a cause is an invariable and
necessary condition of an event, we can never know
certainly whether the cause exists or not. To us, then, a
cause is not to be distinguished from the group of positive
or negative conditions which, with more or less probability,
precede an event. In this sense, there is no particular
difference between knowledge of causes and our general
knowledge of the combinations, or succession of com-
binations, in which the phenomena of nature are presented
to us, or found to occur in experimental inquiry.
Distinction of Inductive and Deductive Results.
We must carefully avoid confusing together inductive
investigations which terminate in the establishment of
general laws, and those which seem to lead directly to
the knowledge of future particular events. That process
only can be called induction which gives general laws,
and it is by the subsequent employment of deduction that
we can alone anticipate particular events. If the ob-
servation of a number of cases shews that alloys of metals
