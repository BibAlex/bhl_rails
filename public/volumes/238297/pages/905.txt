arisen within historical times, and varieties approaching
to sub-species may often be produced by the horticul-
turist in a few years. Such varieties can easily be brought
back to their original form, or, if placed in the original
circumstances, will themselves revert to that form ; but
according to Darwin's views all forms are capable of un-
limited change, and, it might possibly be, unlimited re-
version, if sufficient time and suitable circumstances be
granted.
Many fruitless and erroneous attempts have been made
to establish some rigorous criterion of specific and generic
difference, so that these classes might have a definite value
or rank in all branches of biology. Linnaeus adopted the
view that the species was to be defined as a distinct
Creation saying n , ' Species tot numeramus, quot diversse
format in principio sunt creatae,' or again, * Species tot sunt,
quot diversas formas ab initio produxit Infmitum Ens ;
quae formae, secundum generationis inditas leges, pro-
duxere plures, at sibi semper similes/ Of genera he also
says , ' Genus omne est naturale, in primordio tale crea-
tum/ It was a common doctrine added to and essential
to that of distinct creation that these species could not
produce intermediate and variable forms, so that we find
Linnaeus in another work obliged by the ascertained exis-
tence of hybrids to take a different view; he says^, 'Novas
species immo et genera ex copula diversarum specierum
in regno vegetabilium oriri primo intuitu paradoxum
videtur ; interim observationes sic fieri non ita dissuadent/
Even supposing in the present day that we could assent
to the notion of a certain number of distinct creational
acts, this notion would not help us in the theory of classi-
