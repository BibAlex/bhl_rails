of power ; freed from impediments, or at least by its
strength, predominating over and suppressing them 1 .' He
mentions quicksilver as an ostensive instance of weight or
density, thinking it not much less dense than gold, and
more remarkable than gold as joining density to liquidity.
The magnet is mentioned as an ostensive instance of
attraction k . It would not be very easy to distinguish
clearly between these ostensive instances and those which
he calls Instantiate Monodicae, or Irregulares, or Hetero-
clitae, under which he places whatever is extravagant in
its properties or magnitude, or exhibits least similarity
to other things, such as the sun and moon among the
heavenly bodies, the elephant among animals, the letter
s among letters, or the magnet among stones ^
In optical science great use has been made of the high
dispersive power of the transparent compounds of lead,
that is, the power of giving a long spectrum (vol. i. p. 32).
Dolland having noticed the peculiar dispersive power of
lenses made of flint-glass employed them to produce an
achromatic arrangement. The element strontium presents
a contrast to lead in this respect, being characterized by a
remarkably low dispersive power ; but I am not aware
that this property has yet been turned to account.
Compounds of lead have both a high dispersive and
a high refractive index, and in the latter respect they
proved very useful to Faraday. * Having spent much
labour in preparing various kinds of optical glass, Fara-
day happened to form a compound of lead, silica, and
boracic acid, now known as heavy glass, which possessed
an intensely high refracting power. Many years after-
wards in attempting to discover the action of magnetism
upon light he failed to detect any effect, as has been
