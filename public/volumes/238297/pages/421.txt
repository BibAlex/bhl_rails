ANALYSIS OF QUANTITATIVE PHENOMENA. 395
When a pendulum cannot be made to swing uniformly,
as in experiments upon the force of gravity, it becomes
requisite to resort to the third method, and a correction
is introduced, calculated on theoretical grounds from
the amount of the observed change in the length of
vibration.
It has been mentioned that the apparent expansion
of a liquid by heat, when contained in a thermometer tube
or other vessel, is the difference between the real ex-
pansion of the liquid and that of the containing vessel. The
effects can be accurately distinguished provided that we
can learn the real expansion by heat of any one convenient
liquid ; for by observing the apparent expansion of the
same liquid in any required vessel we can by difference
learn the amount of expansion of the vessel due to any
given change of temperature. When we once know the
change of dimensions of the vessel, we can of course
determine the absolute expansion of any other liquid
tested in it. Thus it became an all-important object in
scientific research to measure with accuracy the absolute
dilatation by heat of some one liquid, and mercury owing
to several circumstances was by far the most suitable.
Dulong and Petit devised a beautiful mode of effecting
this by simply avoiding altogether the effect of the
change of size of the vessel. Two upright tubes full of
mercury were connected by a fine tube at the bottom,
and were maintained at two different temperatures. As
mercury was free to flow from one tube to the other
by the connecting tube, the two columns necessarily
exerted equal pressures by the principles of hydrostatics.
Hence it was only necessary to measure very accurately
by a cathetometer the difference of level of the surfaces
of the two columns of mercury, to learn the difference of
length of columns of equal hydrostatic pressure, which at
once gives the difference of density of the mercury, and
