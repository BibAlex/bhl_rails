EXPERIMENT. 35
perfect experimental treatment, since glass, when strongly
compressed, and so long only as it is compressed in one
direction, becomes capable of doubly-refracting light, and
as there is probably no alteration in the glass but change of
elasticity, we learn that the power of double refraction is
very probably due to a difference of elasticity in different
directions.
Removal of Usual Conditions.
One of the great objects of experiment is to enable us
to judge of the behaviour of substances under conditions
widely different from those which prevail upon the surface
of the earth. We live in an atmosphere which does not
vary beyond certain narrow limits in temperature or
pressure. Many of the powers of nature, such as gravity,
which constantly act upon us, are of almost fixed amount.
Now it will afterwards be shown that we cannot apply a
quantitative law to circumstances much different from those
in which it was observed, without considerable risk of error.
In the other planets, the sun, the stars, or remote parts
of the Universe, the conditions of existence must often be
widely different from what we commonly experience here.
Hence our knowledge of nature must remain very re-
stricted and hypothetical, unless we can subject substances
to very unusual conditions by suitable experiments.
The electric arc is an invaluable means of exposing
metals or other conducting substances to the highest
known temperature. By its aid we learn not only that
all the metals can be vaporized, but that they ah 1 give off
distinctive rays of light. At the other extremity of the
scale, the intensely powerful freezing mixture devised
by Faraday, consisting of solid carbonic acid and ether
mixed in vacuo, enables us to observe the nature of sub-
stances at temperatures immensely below any we meet
with naturally on the earth's surface.
