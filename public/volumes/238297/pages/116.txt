90 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
An example of a still more complex proposition may
be found in De Morgan's writings 11 , and is as follows :
' He must have been rich, and if not absolutely mad was
weakness itself, subjected either to bad advice or to most
unfavourable circumstances/
If we assign the letters of the alphabet in succession,
thus,
A = he
B - rich
C = absolutely mad
D = weakness itself
E = subjected to bad advice
F = subjected to most unfavourable circumstances,
the proposition will take the form
A = AB{C |-D (E|F)},
and if we develop the alternatives, expressing some of
the different cases which may happen, we obtain
A = ABC I- ABcDEF |- ABcDE/t ABcDeF.
Inference by Disjunctive Propositions.
Before we can make a free use of disjunctive propositions
in the processes of inference we must consider how dis-
junctive terms can be combined together or with simple
terms. In the first place, to combine a simple term with
a disjunctive one, we must combine it with every alter-
native of the disjunctive term. A vegetable, for instance,
is either a herb, a shrub, or a tree. Hence an exogenous
vegetable is either an exogenous herb, or an exogenous
shrub, or an exogenous tree. Symbolically stated this
process of combination is as follows
A(B | C) = AB | AC.
Secondly, to combine two disjunctive terms with each
other, combine each alternative of one separately with each
