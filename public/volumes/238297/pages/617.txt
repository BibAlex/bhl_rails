QUANTITATIVE INDUCTION. 127
laboured on the subject without exhausting it, and Brink-
ley and Ivory have since treated it. A closely connected
problem, that regarding the relation between the pressure
and elevation in different strata of the atmosphere, has
received the attention of a long succession of physicists
and was most carefully investigated by Laplace. Yet no
invariable and general law has been detected. The same
may be said concerning the law of human mortality ;
abundant statistics on this subject are available, and many
hypotheses more or less satisfactory have been put for-
ward as to the general form of the curve of mortality,
but it seems to be impossible to discover more than an
approximate law.
It may perhaps be urged that in such subjects no single
invariable law can be expected. The atmosphere may be
divided into several variable strata which by their uncon-
nected changes frustrate the exact calculations of astro-
nomers. Human life may be subject at different ages to
a succession of different influences incapable of reduction
under any one law. The results observed may in fact be
aggregates of an immense number of separate results each
governed by their own separate laws, so that the subjects
may be complicated beyond the possibility of complete
resolution by empirical methods. This is certainly true
of the mathematical functions which must some time or
other be introduced into the science of political economy.
Simple Proportional Variation.
When we first treat numerical results in any novel kind
of investigation, our impression will probably be that one
quantity varies in simple proportion to another, so as
to obey the law y = mx + n. We must learn to distinguish
carefully between the cases where this proportionality is
really, and where it is only apparently true. When con-
