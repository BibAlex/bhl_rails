stances, so that the total weights should be exactly equal
and the centres, of oscillation at the same distance from
the points of suspension. Hence the resistance of the air
became approximately a matter of indifference ; for the
outward size and shape of the pendulums being exactly
the same, the absolute force of resistance would be the
same, so long as the pendulums vibrated with equal
velocity ; and the weights being equal the force would
diminish the velocity in like degree. Hence if any in-
equality were observed in the vibrations of the two pen-
dulums, it must arise from the only circumstance which
was different, namely the chemical character of the matter
within the boxes. No inequality being observed, the
chemical nature of substances can have no appreciable
influence upon the force of gravitation S.
A beautiful experiment was devised by Dr. Joule for
the purpose of showing that the gain or loss of heat by a
gas is connected, not with the mere change of its volume
and density, but with the energy received or given out by
the gas. Two strong vessels, connected by a tube and stop-
cock, were surrounded entirely with water after the air
had been exhausted from one vessel and condensed in the
other to the extent of twenty atmospheres. The whole
apparatus having been brought to a uniform temperature
by agitating the water, and the temperature having been
exactly observed, the stop-cock was opened, so that the
air at once expanded and filled the two vessels uniformly.
The temperature of the water being again noted was
found to be almost entirely unchanged. The experiment
was then repeated in an exactly similar manner, except
that the strong vessels were placed in separate portions
of water. It was then discovered that cold was produced
in the vessel from which the air rushed, and an almost
exactly equal quantity of heat appeared in that to which
