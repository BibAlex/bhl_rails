54 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
part of the globe, are described negatively as inorganic.
But we might, with at least equal logical correctness,
have described the preponderating class of substances as
mineral, and then vegetable and animal substances would
have been non-mineral.
It is plain that any positive term, and its corresponding
negative divide between them the whole universe of
thought : whatever does not fall into one must fall into
o
the other, by the third fundamental Law of Thought,
the Law of Duality. It follows at once that there are
two modes of representing a difference. Suppose that
the things or classes represented by A and B are found
to differ, we may indicate the result of the judgment by
the notation (see p. 20)
A-B.
But we may now represent the same judgment by the
assertion that A agrees with those things which differ from
B, or that A agrees with the not-B's. Using our notation
for negative terms (see p. 17), we obtain
A = A.b
as the expression of the ordinary negative proposition.
Thus if we take A to mean quicksilver, and B solid, then
we have the following proposition :
Quicksilver = Quicksilver not-solid.
There may also be several other classes of negative
propositions, of which no notice was taken in the old logic.
We may have cases where all A's are not-B's, and at the
same time all not-B's are A's ; there may, in short, be a
simple identity between A and not-B, which may be
expressed in the form
A = 6.
An example of this form would be
Conductors of electricity = non-electrics.
We shall also frequently have to deal as results of
