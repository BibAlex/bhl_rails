CHAPTER VII.
INDUCTION.
WE enter in this chapter upon the second great de-
partment of logical method, that of Induction or the
Inference of general from particular truths. It cannot
be said that the Inductive process is of greater importance
than the Deductive process already considered, because the
latter process is absolutely essential to the existence of
the former. Each is the complement and counterpart of
the other. The principles of thought and existence which
underlie them are at the bottom the same, just as subtrac-
tion of numbers necessarily rests upon the same principles
as addition. Induction is, in fact, the inverse operation
to deduction, and cannot be conceived to exist without
the corresponding operation, so that the question of re-
lative importance cannot arise. Who thinks of asking
whether addition or subtraction is the more important
process in arithmetic ? But at the same time much
difference in difficulty may exist between a direct and
inverse operation ; the integral calculus, for instance, is
almost infinitely more difficult than the differential cal-
culus of which it is .the inverse. It must be allowed
that in logic inductive investigations are of a far higher
degree of difficulty, variety, and complexity than any
questions of deduction ; and it is this fact no doubt which
has led some logicians to erroneous opinions concerning
the exclusive importance of induction.
Hitherto we have been engaged in considering how
