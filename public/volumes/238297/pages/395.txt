UNITS AND STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT. 369
The French Government and the present International
Metrical Commission have for obvious reasons decided in
favour of the latter course, and have thus reverted to the
first method of defining the metre by a given bar. As
from time to time the ratio between this assumed
standard metre and the dimensions of the earth becomes
more and more accurately known, we have the better
means of restoring that metre by actual reference to the
globe if required. But until lost, destroyed, or for some
clear reason discredited, the bar metre and not the globe
is the standard. Any of the more accurate measurements
of the English trigonometrical survey might in like
manner be employed to restore our standard yard, in terms
of which the results are recorded 1
The Pendulum Standard.
The third method of defining a standard length, by
reference to the seconds' pendulum, was first proposed by
Huyghens, and was at one time adopted by the English
Government. From the principle of the pendulum (p. 353)
it clearly appears that if the time of oscillation and the
force actuating the pendulum be the same, the length
must be the same. We do not get rid of theoretical
difficulties, for we must practically assume the attraction
of gravity at some point of the earth's surface, say
London, to be unchanged from time to time, and the
sidereal day to be invariable, neither assumption being
absolutely correct so far as we can judge. The pendulum,
in short, is only an indirect means of making one physi-
cal quantity of space depend upon two other physical
quantities of time and force.
The practical difficulties are, however, of a far more
