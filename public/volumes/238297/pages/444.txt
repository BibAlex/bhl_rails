418 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
The significations of the terms Mean
and Average.
Much confusion exists in the popular, or even the
scientific employment of the terms mean and average, and
they are commonly taken as synonymous. It is desirable
to ascertain carefully what significations we ought to
attach to them. The English word mean is exactly equi-
valent to medium, being derived perhaps, through the
French moyen, from the latin medius, which again is un-
doubtedly kindred with the Greek pca-os. Etymologists
believe, too, that this Greek word is connected with the
preposition ^era, the German mitte, and the true English
mid or middle ; so that after all the mean is a technical
term identical in its root with the more popular equivalent
middle.
If we inquire what is a mean in a mathematical point
of view, the true answer is that there are several or many
kinds of means. The old arithmeticians recognised at
least ten kinds, which are stated by Boethius, and even
an eleventh was added by Jordanus d .
The arithmetic mean is the one by far the most
commonly denoted by the term, and that which we may
understand it to signify in the absence of any qualification.
It is the sum of any series of quantities divided by their
number, and may be represented by the formula ^ (a + 1).
But there is also the geometric mean, which is the square
root of the product, *^/cTx~l>, or that quantity the logar-
ithm of which is the arithmetic mean of the logarithms
of the quantities. There is also the harmonic mean,
which is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the
reciprocals of the quantities. Thus if a and I be the
