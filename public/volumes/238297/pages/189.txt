premises corresponding to each. Such a table enables us
by mere inspection to learn the laws obeyed by any set of
combinations of three things, and is to logic what a table
of factors and prime numbers is to the theory of numbers,
or a table of integrals to the higher mathematics. The
table already given (p. 1 6 1 ) would enable a person with
but little labour to discover the law of any combinations.
If there be seven combinations (one contradicted) the law
must be of the eighth type, and the proper variety will be
apparent. If there be six combinations (two contradicted),
either the second, eleventh, or twelfth type applies, and a
certain number of trials will disclose the proper type and
variety. If there be but two combinations the law must
be of the third type, and so on.
The above investigations are complete as regards the
possible logical relations of two or three terms. But
when we attempt to apply the same kind of method to
the relations of four or more terms, the labour becomes im-
practicably great. Four terms give sixteen combinations
compatible with the laws of thought, and the number of
possible selections of combinations is no less than 2 16 or
65,536. The following table shows the extraordinary
manner in which the number of possible logical relations
increases with the number of terms involved.

Number of possible selections of combi-
nations corresponding to consistent or in-
consistent logical relations.

Some years of continuous labour would be required to
ascertain the precise number of types of laws which may
govern the combinations of only four things, and but a
small part of such laws would be exemplified or capable
