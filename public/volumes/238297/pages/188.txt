of negatives. This table then presents the results of
a complete analysis of all the possible logical relations
arising in the case of three terms, and the old syllogism
forms but one out of fifteen typical forms. Generally
speaking every form can be converted into apparently
different propositions ; thus the fourth type A = B, B = BC
may appear in the form A = ABC, a = ab, or again in the
form of three propositions A = AB, B = BC, aB = aBc ; but
all these sets of premises yield identically the same series
of combinations, and are therefore of exactly equivalent
logical meaning. The fifth type, or Barbara, can also be
thrown into the equivalent forms A = ABC, aB = aBC and
A = AC, B = A I aBC. In other cases I have obtained the
very same logical conditions in four modes of statement.
As regards mere appearance and mode of statement, the
number of possible premises would be almost unlimited.
The most remarkable of all the types of logical condition
is the fourteenth, namely A = BC I be. It is that which
expresses the division of a genus into two doubly marked
species, arid might be illustrated by the example ' Com-
ponent of the physical universe = matter, gravitating, or
not-matter (ether), not-gravitating.'
It is capable of only two distinct logical variations,
namely, A BC I be and A = Be I bC. By transposition
or negative change of the letters we can indeed obtain
six different expressions of each of these propositions ;
but when their meanings are analysed, by working out
the combinations, they are found to be logically equiva-
lent to one or other of the above two. Thus the proposi-
tion A = BC I be can be written in any of the following
five other modes,
a = 60 -I- Be, B = CAica, 6=cA|Ca,
C = ABIa6, c=aBtA6.
I do not think it needful at present to publish the
complete table of 193 series of combinations and the
