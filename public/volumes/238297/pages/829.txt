EXCEPTIONAL PHENOMENA. 339
most familiar facts may teem with indications of forces,
now secrets hidden from us, because we have not mind-
directed eyes to discriminate them. The progress of
science will consist in the discovery from time to time
of new exceptional phenomena, and their assignment by
degrees to one or other of the heads already described.
When a new fact proves to be merely a false, apparent,
singular, divergent, or accidental exception, we may gain
a more minute and accurate acquaintance with the effects
of certain laws already known to exist. We have indeed
no addition to what was implicitly in our possession, but,
as already explained, there is much difference between
knowing the laws of nature and perceiving all their com-
plicated effects. Should a new fact prove to be a limiting
or real exception, we have to alter, in part or in whole,
our views of nature and are saved from errors into which
we had fallen. Lastly, the new fact may come under the
sixth class, and may eventually prove to be a novel and
unexplained phenomenon, indicating the existence of
new laws and forces, complicating but not otherwise
interfering with the effects of laws and forces previously
known.
The best instance which I can find of an unresolved ex-
ceptional phenomenon, consists in the anomalous vapour-
densities of phosphorus, arsenic, mercury, and cadmium.
It is one of the most important laws of chemistry, dis-
covered by Gay-Lussac, that equal volumes of gases exactly
correspond to equivalent weights of the substances, and
this holds generally true of any elements which we can
convert into gas or vapour. Unfortunately phosphorus
and arsenic give vapours exactly twice as dense as they
should do by analogy, and mercury and cadmium diverge
in the other direction, giving vapours half as dense as we
should expect. We cannot treat these anomalies as limit-
ing exceptions, and say that the law holds true of sub-
