262 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
respect by the most marked qualities. Of all known
substances water has the highest specific heat, being thus
peculiarly fitted for the purpose of warming and cooling,
to which it is often put. It rises by capillary attraction
to a height more than twice that of any other liquid. In
the state of ice it is nearly twice as dilatable by heat as
any other known solid substance 11 . In proportion to its
density it has a far higher surface tension than any other
substance, being in fact surpassed in absolute tension only
by mercury, and it would not be difficult to extend con-
siderably the list of its remarkable and useful properties.
Under extreme instances we may include cases of re-
markably low powers or qualities, equally with those of
the opposite extreme. Such cases seem to correspond to
what Bacon calls Clandestine Instances, which exhibit a
given nature in the least intensity, and as it were in a
rudimentary state . They may often be important, he
thinks, as allowing the detection of the cause of the pro-
perty by difference. I may add that in some cases they
may be of use in experiments. Thus hydrogen is at once
the least dense of all known substances, and has the least
atomic weight. Liquefied nitrous oxide has the lowest
refractive index of all known fluids?. The compounds of
strontium have the lowest dispersive powers on light. It
will be obvious that a property of very low degree may
prove as curious and valuable a phenomenon as a property
of very high degree.
The Detection of Continuity.
We should always bear in mind that phenomena which
are in reality of a closely similar or even identical nature,
