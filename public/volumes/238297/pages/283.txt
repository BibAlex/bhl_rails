PHILOSOPHY OF INDUCTIVE INFERENCE. 257
ider which a perpetual motion, that is, a perpetual
source of self-created energy might exist. d The larger
part of the philosophic world has long held that in mental
acts there is free will in short, self-causation. It is in
vain to attempt to reconcile this doctrine with that of an
intuitive belief in causation, as Sir W. Hamilton candidly
allowed.
It is quite obvious, moreover, that to assert the exist-
ence of a cause for every event, cannot do more than
remove into the indefinite past the inconceivable fact and
mystery of creation. At any given moment matter and
energy were equal to what they are at present, or they
were not ; if equal, we may make the same inquiry con-
cerning any other moment, however long prior, and we
are thus obliged to accept one horn of the dilemma ex-
istence from infinity, or creation at some moment. This
is but one of the many cases in which we ' are compelled
to believe in one or other of two alternatives, both incon-
ceivable. My present purpose, however, is to point out
that we must not confuse this supremely difficult question
with that into which inductive science inquires on the \
foundation of facts. By induction we gain no certain \
knowledge ; but by observation, and the inverse use of
deductive reasoning, we estimate the probability that an /
event which has occurred was preceded by conditions of/
specified character, or that such conditions wih 1 be followecp
by the event. /
Definition of the Term Cause.
Clear definitions of the word cause have been given by
several philosophers. Hobbes has said, ( A cause is the
sum or aggregate of all such accidents both in the agents
