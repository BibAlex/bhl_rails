RESULTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD. 457
were before almost impracticable. Since the time of
Newton and Leibnitz whole worlds of problems have
been solved which before were hardly conceived as matters
of inquiry. In our own day extended methods of mathe-
matical reasoning, such as the system of quaternions,
have been brought into existence. What intelligent man
will doubt that the recondite speculations of a Cayley
or a Sylvester may possibly lead to some new methods,
at the simplicity and power of which a future age will
wonder, and yet wonder more that to us they were so
dark and difficult. May we not repeat the words of Seneca :
' Veniet tempus, quo ista quse nunc latent, in lucem dies
extrahat, et longioris asvi diligentia : ad inquisitionem
tantorum setas una non sufficit. Veniet tempus, quo pos-
teri nostri tarn aperta nos nescisse mirentur/
The Reign of Law in Mental and Social Phenomena.
After we pass from the so-called physical sciences to
those which attempt to investigate mental and social
phenomena, the same general conclusions will hold true.
No one will be found to deny that there are certain uni-
formities of thinking and acting which can be detected
in reasoning beings,! and so far as we detect such laws
we successfully apply scientific method. But those who
attempt thus to establish social or moral sciences, soon
become aware that they are dealing with subjects of
enormous perplexity. / Take, for instance, the science of
Political Economy. If a science at all, it must be a mathe-
matical science, because it deals with quantities of com-
modities. \ But so soon as we attempt to draw .out the
equations expressing, the laws of variation of demand and
supply, we discover that they must have a complexity
entirely surpassing our powers of mathematical treatment.
