108 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
their periods of variation were the same even to infinitely
small quantities it would be certain, that is infinitely pro-
bable, that they were connected, however unlikely this
might be on other grounds. The general mode of esti-
mating such probabilities is identical with that applied
to other inductive problems. Thus, if the two periods of
variation were assigned by pure chance and entirely inde-
pendently of each other, the probability would be about
one in ten million that they would agree to the one ten-
millionth part ; but if the periods be observed to agree to
less than that part then there is a probability of at least
ten million to one in favour of the opposite hypothesis of
connexion. That any two periods of variation should by
chance become absolutely equal is infinitely improbable ;
hence if, in the case of the moon or any other change, we
could prove absolute coincidence, we should have certainty
of connexion b . With approximate measurements, which
alone are within our power, we must hope for approximate
certainty at the most.
The general principles of inference and probability, ac-
cording to which we treat causes and effects varying in
amount, are exactly ~the same as those by which we
treated simple experiments. Continuous quantity, how-
ever, affords us an infinitely more extensive sphere of
observation, because every different amount of cause,
however little different, ought to be followed by a dif-
ferent amount of effect. If we can measure temperature
to the one hundredth part of a degree centigrade, then
even between o and 100 we have 10,000 possible dis-
tinct trials. If the precision of our measurements is
increased, so that the one thousandth part of a degree
can be appreciated, our trials may be increased tenfold.
The probability of connexion will be proportional to the
accuracy of our measurements.
