348 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE,
heights of the lunar and solar tides, Newton roughly
estimated the comparative forces of the moon's and sun's
gravity at the earth k .
A few years ago it might have seemed impossible that
we should ever measure the velocity with which a star
approaches or recedes from the earth, since the apparent
position of the star is thereby unaltered. But the spec-
troscope now enables us to detect and even measure such
motion with considerable accuracy, by the alteration which
it causes in the apparent rapidity of vibration, and conse-
quently in the refrangibility of rays of light of definite
colour. And while our estimates of the lateral move-
ments of stars depend upon our very uncertain know-
ledge of their distance, the spectroscope gives the motion
in another direction in absolute quantity, irrespective of
all other quantities known or unknown, excepting the
motion of the earth itself 1 .
The rapidity of vibration for each musical tone, hav-
ing been accurately determined by comparison with the
Syren (p. 12), we can use sounds as indirect indications of
rapid vibrations. It is now known that the contraction of
a muscle arises from the periodical contractions of each
separate fibre, and from a faint sound or susurrus which
accompanies the action of a muscle, it is inferred that
each contraction lasts for about ? of a second. Minute

quantities of radiant heat are now always measured indi-
rectly by the electricity which they produce when falling
upon a thermopile. The extreme delicacy of the method
seems to be due to the power of multiplication at several
points in the apparatus. The number of elements or junc-
tions of different metals in the thermopile can be increased
