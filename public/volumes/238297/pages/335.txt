THE INDUCTIVE OR INVERSE METHOD. 309
When deduction is certain, comparison with fact is
needed only to assure ourselves that we have rightly
selected the hypothetical conditions. The law establishes
itself, and no number of particular verifications can add
to its probability. Having once deduced from the prin-
ciples of algebra that the difference of the squares of two
numbers is equal to the product of their sum and dif-
ference, no number of particular trials of its truth will
render it more certain. On the other hand, no finite
number of particular verifications of a supposed law will
render that law certain. In short; certainty belongs only
to the deductive process, and to the teachings of direct
intuition ; and as the conditions of nature are not given
by intuition, we can only be certain that w T e have got a
correct hypothesis when, out of a limited number con-
ceivably possible, we select that one which alone agrees
with the facts to be explained.
In geometry and kindred branches of .mathematics,
deductive reasoning is conspicuously certain, and it would
often seem as if the consideration of a single diagram
yields us certain knowledge of a general proposition.
But in reality all this certainty is of a purely hypothetical
character. Doubtless if we could ascertain that a sup-
posed circle was a true and perfect circle, w could be
certain concerning a multitude of its geometrical pro-
perties. But geometrical figures are physical objects, and
the senses can never assure us as to their exact forms.
The figures really treated in Euclid's ' Elements' are
imaginary, and we never can verify in practice the con-
clusions which we draw with certainty in inference;
questions of degree and probability enter.
Passing now to subjects in which deduction is only
probable, it ceases to be possible to adopt one hypothesis
to the exclusion of the others. We must entertain at the
same time all conceivable hypotheses, and regard each
