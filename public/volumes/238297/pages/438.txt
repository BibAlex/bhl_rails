which any error due to the wrong position of the zero
of the division will be reversed. As the axis of the
needle may not be exactly horizontal, it is now reversed
in the same manner as the transit instrument, the end of
the axis which formerly pointed east being made to point
west, and a new set of readings is taken.
Finally, error may arise from the axis not passing
accurately through the centre of gravity of the bar, and
this error can only be detected and eliminated on re-
versing the magnetic poles of the bar by the application
of a strong magnet. The error is thus made to act in
opposite directions. To ensure all possible accuracy each
reversal ought to be combined with each other reversal,
so that the needle will be observed in eight different
positions by sixteen different readings, the mean of the
whole of which will give the required inclination free
from all eliminable errors k .
There are certain cases of experiment in which a
disturbing cause can with much ease be made to act in
opposite directions, in alternate observations, so that the
mean of the results will be free from disturbance. Thus
in direct experiments upon the velocity of sound in
passing through the air between stations two or three
miles apart, the wind is a cause of error. It will be well,
in the first place, to choose a time for the experiment
when the air is very nearly at rest, and the disturbance
slight, but if at the same moment signal sounds be made
at each station and observed at the other, two sounds will
be passing in opposite directions through the same body
of air and the wind will accelerate one sound almost
exactly as much as it retards the other 1 . Again, in
trigonometrical surveys the apparent height of a point
