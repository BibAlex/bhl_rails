CLASSIFICATION. 373
We have, then, as Mr. Bentham says, three bifid divi-
sions, thus represented :
Vertebrata
Endowed with lungs
i
deprived
1
Endowed with
mammse

mammae
i
Mammifera with wings without wings
Birds Reptiles
It is however quite evident that according to the laws
of thought even this arrangement is incomplete. The
subclass mammifera must either have wings or be deprived
of them ; we must subdivide this class, or assume that
none of the mammifera have wings, which is, as a matter
of fact, the case, the wings of bats not being true wings in
the meaning of the term as applied to birds. Fish, again,
ought to be considered with regard to the possession of
mammas and wings ; and in leaving them undivided we
really imply that they never have mammae nor wings, the
wings of the flying-fish, again, being no exception. If
we resort to the use of our letters and define them as
follows
A = vertebrata,
B = having lungs,
C = having mammae,
D = having wings,
then there are four existent classes of vertebrata which
appear to be thus described-
ABC
ABcD
ABcd
Aft.
But in reality the combinations are implied to be
