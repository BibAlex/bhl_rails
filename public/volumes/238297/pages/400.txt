374 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Subsidiary Units.
Having once established the standard units of time,
space, and density or mass, we might employ them for the
expression of all quantities of such nature. But it is often
found convenient in particular branches of science, to use
multiples or submultiples of the original units, for the ex-
pression of quantities, in a clear and simple manner. We
use the mile rather than the yard when treating of the
magnitude of the globe, and the mean distance of the earth <
and sun is not too ]arge a unit when we have to describe
the distances of the stars. On the other hand, when we are
occupied with microscopic objects, the inch, the line or the
millimetre, become the most convenient terms of expression.
It is allowable for a scientific man to introduce a new
unit in any branch of knowledge, provided that it assists
precise expression, and is carefully brought into relation
with the primary units. Thus Prof. A. W. Williamson
has proposed as a convenient unit in chemical science, an
absolute volume equal to about 11*2 litres, representing
the bulk of one gramme of hydrogen gas at standard
temperature and pressure, or the equivalent weight of any
other gas, such as 16 grammes of oxygen, 14 grammes
of nitrogen, &c. ; in short, the bulk of that quantity of
any one of those gases which weighs as many grammes
as there are units in the number expressing its atomic
weight y . Professor Hofmann has also proposed a new con-
crete unit for chemists, called a crith, to be defined by the
weight of one cubic decimetre or litre of hydrogen gas
at o C. and o'76mm., weighing about 0*0896 grammes z .
Both these units if adopted must be regarded as purely
subordinate units, ultimately defined by reference to the
primary units, and not involving any new assumption.
