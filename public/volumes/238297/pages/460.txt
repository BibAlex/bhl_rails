CHAPTEE XVII.
THE LAW OF ERROR.
To bring error itself under law might seem beyond
human power. He" who errs surely diverges from law,
and it might well be deemed hopeless to suppose that out
of error we can draw truth. One of the most remarkable
achievements of the human intellect is the establishment
of a general theory which not only enables us among dis-
crepant results to approximate to the truth, but to assign
the degree of probability which fairly attaches to this con-
clusion. It would be a gross misapprehension indeed to
suppose that this law is necessarily the best guide under
all circumstances. Every measuring instrument and every
form of experiment may have its own special law of error ;
there may in one instrument be a tendency in one direc-
tion and in another in the opposite .direction. Every pro-
cess has its peculiar liabilities to mistake and disturbance,
and we are never relieved from the necessity of vigilantly
providing against such special difficulties. The general
Law of Error is the best guide only when we have ex-
hausted all other means of approximation, and still find
discrepancies, which are due to entirely unknown causes.
We must treat such residual differences in some way or
other, since they will occur in all accurate experiments,
and as their peculiar nature and origin is assumed to be
unknown, there is no reason why we should treat them
differently in different cases. Accordingly the ultimate
Law of Error must be a uniform and general one.
