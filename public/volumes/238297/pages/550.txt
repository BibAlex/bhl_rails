60 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Such experiments will in many subjects only give the
first hint of the nature of the law in question, but will
not admit of any exact measurements. The parabolic form
of a jet of water may well have suggested to Galileo his
views concerning the path of a projectile ; but it would
not serve now for the exact investigation of the laws
of gravity. It is not likely too that capillary attraction
could be exactly measured by the use of inclined plates
of glass, and the tubes would probably be better for
precise investigation. As a general rule, these collective
experiments would be most useful for popular instruction
and illustration of the laws of science. But when the
curves and figures produced are of a precise and per-
manent character, as in the coloured figures produced by
crystalline plates, they may admit of exact measurement,
and may often be the only mode of approaching the ques-
tion. Newton's rings, diffraction fringes, and other effects
of the interference of light, allow of very accurate
measurements.
Under the class of collective experiments we may per-
haps place those in which we render visible the motions
of a mass of gas or liquid by diffusing some opaque
substance in it. The behaviour of a body of air may
often be studied in a beautiful way by the use of smoke,
as in the production of smoke rings and jets. In the case
of liquids lycopodium powder is sometimes employed. To
detect the mixture of currents or strata of liquid, I em-
ployed exceedingly dilute solutions of common salt and
silver nitrate, which produce a very visible cloud wherever
they come into contact . Atmospheric clouds often reveal
to us the movements of great volumes of air which would
otherwise be quite unapparent.
