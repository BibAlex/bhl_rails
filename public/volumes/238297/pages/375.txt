THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF PHENOMENA. 349
so that the tension of the electric current derived from
the same intensity of radiation is multiplied ; the effect of
the current upon the magnetic needle can be multiplied
within certain bounds, by passing the current many times
round it in a coil ; the excursions of the needle can be
increased by rendering it astatic and increasing the deli-
cacy of its suspension ; lastly, the angular divergence can
be observed, with any required accuracy, by the use of an
attached mirror and distant scale viewed through a tele-
scope (p. 234). Such is the delicacy of this method of
measuring heat, that Dr. Joule succeeded in making a
thermopile which would indicate a difference of - - part
8800
of a degree centigrade m .
A striking case of indirect measurement is furnished by
the revolving mirror of Wheatstone and Foucault, whereby
a minute interval of time is estimated in the form of an
angular deviation. Wheatstone viewed an electric spark
in a mirror rotating so rapidly, that if the duration of the
spark had been more than ^Tooo ^ a secon ^ the point of
light would have appeared elongated to an angular extent
of one-half degree. In the spark, as drawn directly from a
Ley den jar, no elongation was apparent, so that the dura-
tion of the spark was immeasurably smaU ; but when the
discharge took place through a bad conductor, the elonga-
tion of the spark denoted a sensible duration 11 . In the
hands of Foucault the rotating mirror gave a measure
of the time occupied by light in passing through a few
metres of space.
