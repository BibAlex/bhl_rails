464 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Any one of Mr. Darwin's books, admirable though they all
are, consists but in the setting forth of a multitude of
indeterminate problems. He proves in the most beautiful
manner that each flower of an orchid is adapted to some
insect which frequents and fertilizes it, and these adapta-
tions are but a few cases of those immensely numerous
ones which have occurred throughout the life of plants
and animals. But why orchids should have been formed
so differently from other plants J why anything, indeed,
should be as it is, rather than in some of the other in-
finitely numerous possible modes of existence, he can
never showi vThe origin of everything that exists is
wrapped up in the past history of the universe. At
some one or more points in past time there must have
been arbitrary determinations which led to the produc-
tion of things as they are)
Possibility of Divine Interference.
I will now draw the reader's attention to pages 168-17 1
of the first volume. C I there pointed out that all inductive
inference involves the assumption that our knowledge of
what exists is complete,) and that the conditions of things
remain unaltered between the time of our experience and
the time to which our inferences refer. Recurring to the
illustration of a ballot-box, employed in the Chapter on
the Inverse Method of Probabilities, we assume when
predicting the probable nature of the next drawing, that
our previous drawings have been sufficiently numerous to
give us nearly complete knowledge of the contents of the
box ; and, secondly, that no interference with the ballot-
box takes place between the previous and the next draw-
ings. The results yielded by the theory of probabilities
are quite plain. No finite number of casual drawings can
give us sure knowledge of the contents of the box, so that,
