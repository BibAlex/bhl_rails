378 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
It is a peculiar property of equilateral triangles that
they are equiangular, or, vice versd, it is a peculiar pro-
perty of equiangular triangles that they are equilateral.
It is a property of crystals of the regular system that
they are devoid of the power of double refraction, but
this is not a property peculiar to them, because vitreous
and other amorphous transparent solids, such as glass,
together with all liquids and gases, are also devoid of the
same property.
An Accident, the fifth and last of the Predicables, is any
quality, which may or may not belong to certain objects,
and which has no connexion with the classification adopted.
The particular size of a crystal does not in the slightest
degree affect the nature of the crystal, nor does the
manner in which it may be grouped with other crystals ;
these, then, are Accidents as regards a crystallographic
classification. With respect to the chemical composition
of a substance, again, it is an accident whether the sub-
stance be crystallized or not, or whether it be organized
or not. As regards botanical classification the absolute
size of a plant is an accident, due to external circum-
stances. Thus we see that a logical accident is any
quality or circumstance which is not known to be cor-
related with those qualities or circumstances forming
the definition of the species.
The use of the Predicables can be very concisely ex-
plained by our symbols. Thus, let A be any definite
group of qualities and B another quality ; then A will
constitute a genus, and AB, A6 will be species of it, B
being the difference. Let C, D and E be other qualities,
and on examining the combinations in which A, B, C, D, E
occur let them be as follows :
