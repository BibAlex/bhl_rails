248 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
in advance of fact, and assume that all substances are
capable of these three forms. Such a generalization was
accepted by men of the high intellect of Lavoisier 6 and
Laplace f before many of the corroborative facts no win our
possession were known. The reduction of a single comet
beneath the sway of gravity was at once considered suffi-
cient indication that all comets must obey the same power.
Few persons doubted that the same great law extended
over the whole heavens ; certainly the fact that a few
stars out of many millions make manifest the action of
gravity, is now held to be sufficient evidence to establish
the general extension of the laws of Newton over the
sphere of the visible universe.
Value of Generalization.
It might seem that if we know particular facts, there
can be little use in connecting them together by a general
law. The particulars must be more full of useful informa-
tion than an abstract general statement. If we know, for
instance, the properties of an ellipse, a circle, a parabola,
and hyperbola, what is the use of learning all these pro-
perties over again in the general theory of curves of the
second degree 1 If we understand the phenomena of sound
and light and water-waves separately, what is the need of
erecting a general theory of waves, which, after all, is in-
applicable to practice until resolved into particular cases
again ? But, in reality, we never do obtain an adequate
knowledge of particulars until we regard them as cases of
the general. Not only is there a singular delight in dis-
covering the many in the one, and the one in the many,
but there is a constant interchange of light and knowledge.
