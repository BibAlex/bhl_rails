12 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
fraction of those which are in the neighbourhood of our
system, we must accept Kepler's opinion, that there are
more comets in the regions of space than fishes in the
depths of the ocean. When like calculations are made
concerning the numbers of meteors visible to us, it is
astonishing to find that the number of meteors entering
the earth's atmosphere in every twenty-four hours is
probably not less than 4oo,ooo,poo, of which 1^,000
exist in every portion of space equal to that filled by
the earth's globe.
Most serious fallacies may arise from overlooking the
inevitable conditions under which the records of past
events are brought to our notice. Thus it is only the
durable objects manufactured by former races of men,
such as flint implements, which can have come to our
notice as a general rule. The comparative abundance of
iron and bronze articles used by an ancient nation must
not be supposed to be coincident with their comparative
abundance in our museums, because bronze is far the
more durable. There is always a prevailing fallacy that
our ancestors built more strongly than we do, arising from
the fact that the more fragile structures have long since
crumbled away. It is thus that we have few or no relics
of the habitations of the poorer classes among the Greeks
or Romans, or in fact of any past race ;- for the temples,
tombs, public buildings and mansions of the wealthier
classes alone endure. There is an indefinite expanse of
past events necessarily lost to us for ever, and we must
generally look upon records or relics as exceptional in
their character.
Exactly the same considerations apply to geological
relics. We could not generally expect that animals would
