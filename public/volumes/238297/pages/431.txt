ANALYSIS OF QUANTITATIVE PHENOMENA. 405
in which it was graduated c . There is no end to the
number of minute corrections which may ultimately be
required. A very large number of experiments on gases,
standard weights and measures, &c. depend upon the
height of the barometer ; but when experiments in dif-
ferent parts of the world are compared together we ought
to take into account the varying force of gravity, which
even between London and Paris makes a difference of
*oo8 inch of mercury.
The measurement of quantities of heat is a matter of
great difficulty, because there is no known substance
impervious to heat, and the problem is therefore as
difficult as to measure liquids in porous vessels. To
determine the latent heat of steam we must condense a
certain amount of the steam in a known weight of water,
and then observe the rise of temperature of the water.
But while we are carrying out the experiment, part of the
heat will have escaped by radiation or conduction from
the condensing vessel or calorimeter. We may indeed
reduce the loss of heat by using vessels with double sides
and bright surfaces, surrounded with swan's-down wool or
other non-conducting materials ; and we may also avoid
raising the temperature of the water much above that of
the surrounding air. Yet we cannot by any such means
render the loss of heat inconsiderable. Rumford ingeni-
ously proposed to reduce the loss to zero by commencing
the experiment when the temperature of the calorimeter
is as much below that of the air as it is at the end of the
experiment above it. Thus the vessel will first gain and
then lose by radiation and conduction, and these opposite
errors will approximately balance each other. But Reg-
nault has shown that the loss and gain do nojb proceed by
exactly the same laws, so that in very accurate inves-
tigations Rumford's method is not sufficient. There
