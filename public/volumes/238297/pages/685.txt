ACCORDANCE OF QUANTITATIVE THEORIES, &c. 195
square of the distance held true, and the reputed distance
of the moon was correct, he could infer that the moon
ought to fall towards the earth at the rate of fifteen feet
in one minute. Now, the actual divergence of the moon
from the tangent of its orbit appeared to amount only to
thirteen feet in one minute, and there was a discrepancy
of two feet in fifteen, which caused Newton to lay ' aside
at that time any further thoughts of this matter/ Many
years afterwards, probably fifteen or sixteen years, Newton
obtained more precise data from which he could calculate
the size of the moon's orbit, and he then found the dis-
crepancy to be inconsiderable.
His theory of gravitation was then verified so far as
the moon was concerned ; but this was to him only the
beginning of a long course of deductive calculations, each
ending in a verification. If the earth and moon attract
each other, and also the sun and the earth, similarly there
is no reason why the sun and moon should not attract
each other. Newton followed out the consequences of
this inference, and showed that the moon would not move
as if attracted by the earth only, but sometimes faster
and sometimes slower. Comparisons with Flamsteed's
observations of the moon showed that such was the case.
Newton argued again, that as the waters of the ocean are
not rigidly attached to the earth, they might attract the
moon, and be attracted in return, independently of the
rest of the earth. Certain daily motions would then be
caused thereby exactly resembling the tides, and there
were the tides to verify the fact. It was the almost
superhuman power with which he traced out geome-
trically the consequences of his theory, and submitted
them to repeated comparison with experience, which con-
stitutes his pre-eminence over all philosophers b .
