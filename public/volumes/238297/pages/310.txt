284 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
A good instance of this method is furnished by the
agreement of numerical statements with the truth. Thus,
in a manuscript of Diodorus Siculus, as Dr. Young states K ,
the ceremony of an ancient Egyptian funeral is described
as requiring the presence of forty- two persons sitting in
judgment on the merits of the deceased, and in many
ancient papyrus rolls the same number of persons are
found delineated. The probability is but slight that Dio-
dorus, if inventing his statements or writing without
proper information, would have chosen such a number as
forty-two, and though there are not the data for an exact
calculation, Dr. Young considers that the probability in
favour of the correctness of the manuscript and the
veracity of the writer on this ground alone, is at least
100 to i.
It is exceedingly probable that the ancient Egyptians
had exactly recorded the eclipses occurring during long
periods of time, for Diogenes Laertius mentions that 373
solar and 832 lunar eclipses had been observed, and the
ratio between these numbers exactly expresses that which
would hold true of the eclipses of any long period, of
say 1 200 or 1300 years, as estimated on astronomical
grounds h .
It is evident that an agreement between small numbers,
or customary numbers, such as seven, one hundred, a
myriad, &c., is much more likely to happen from chance,
and therefore gives much less presumption of dependence.
If two ancient writers spoke of the sacrifice of oxen, they
would in all probability describe it as a hecatomb, and
there would be nothing remarkable in the coincidence.
On similar grounds, we must inevitably believe in the
human origin of the flint flakes so copiously discovered of
late years. For though the accidental stroke of one stone
