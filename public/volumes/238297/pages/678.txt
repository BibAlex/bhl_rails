observation, although their amounts may be confidently
assigned by theory. There is every reason to believe
that chemical and electric actions of almost indefinitely
small amount, are constantly in progress. The hardest
and most fixed substances, if reduced to sufficiently small
particles, and diffused in pure water, manifest oscillatory
movements which must be due to chemical and electric
changes, so slight that they may go on for years without
affecting appreciably the weight of the particles. The
earth's magnetism must affect more or less every object
which we handle. As Professor Tyndall remarks, 'An
upright iron stone influenced by the earth's magnetism
becomes a magnet, with its bottom a north and its top a
south pole. Doubtless, though in an immensely feebler
degree, every erect marble statue is a true diamagnet,
with its head a north pole and its feet a south pole. The
same is certainly true of man as he stands upon the
earth's surface, for all the tissues of the human body are
diamagnetic 1 .' The sun's light produces a very quick
and perceptible effect upon the photographic plate ; in all
probability it has a much less effect upon a great variety
of substances. We may regard every apparent pheno-
menon as but an exaggerated and conspicuous case of a
process which is, in indefinitely more numerous cases,
beyond the means of observation. Yet in a great pro-
portion of these cases exact calculation will enable us to
estimate the amount of the phenomena, if it is of suf-
ficient interest for us to do so.
