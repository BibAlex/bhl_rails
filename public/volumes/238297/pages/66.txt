40 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
two, seem to obey this law ; we may say that i.i = i, and
o.o = o (taking o to mean absolute zero or i i) ; there
is apparently no other number which combined with itself
gives an unchanged result. I shall point out, however, in
the chapter upon Number, that in reality all numerical
symbols obey this logical principle.
It is curious that this Law of Simplicity, though almost
unnoticed in modern times, was known to Boethius, who
makes a singular remark in his treatise ' De Trinitate
et Unitate Dei' (p. 959). He 'says, ' If I should say sun,
sun, sun, I should not have made three suns, but I should
have named one sun so many times d .' Ancient discussions
concerning the doctrine of the Trinity drew more atten-
tion to subtle questions concerning the nature of unity
and plurality than has ever since been given to them.
It is a second law of logical symbols that order of
combination is a matter of indifference. 'Rich and rare
gems ' are the same as ' rare and rich gems/ or even as
' gems, rich and rare.' Grammatical, rhetorical or poetic
usage may give considerable significance to order of ex-
pression. The limited power of our minds prevents our
grasping many ideas at once, and thus the order of
statement may produce some effect, but not in a strictly
logical manner. All life proceeds in the succession of
time, and we are obliged to write, speak, or even think of
things and their qualities one after the other ; but be-
tween the things and their qualities there need be no such
relation of order in time or space. The sweetness of sugar
is neither before nor after its weight and solubility. The
hardness of a metal, its colour, weight, opacity, mallea-
bility, electric and chemical properties, are all coexistent
and coextensive, pervading the metal and every part of it
d ' Velut si dicam Sol, Sol, Sol, non tres soles effecerim, sed uno toties
prsedicaverim.'
