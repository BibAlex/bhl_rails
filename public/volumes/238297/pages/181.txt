and we arrive at this utmost number of cases by omitting
any one or more of the four. The number of cases to
be considered is therefore 2x2x2x2 or sixteen, since
each may be present or absent ; and these cases are all
shown in the following table, in which the sign o indicates
absence or non-existence of the combination shown at the
left-hand column in the same line, and the mark i its
presence :

Thus in column sixteen we find that all the conceivable
combinations are present, which means that there are no
special laws in existence in such a case, and that the
combinations are governed only by the universal Laws of
Identity and Difference. The example of metals and
conductors of electricity would be represented by the
twelfth column ; and every other mode in which two
things or qualities might present themselves is shown in
one or other of the columns. More than half the cases
may indeed be at once rejected, because they involve the
entire absence of a term or its negative. It has been
shown to be a necessary logical principle that every term
must have its negative (p. 88), and where this is not the
case some inconsistency between the laws or conditions of
combinations must exist. Thus if we laid down the two
following propositions, * Graphite conducts electricity/
and ' Graphite does not conduct electricity/ it would
amount to asserting the impossibility of graphite existing
at all ; or in general terms, A is B and A is not B result
in destroying altogether the combinations containing A.
