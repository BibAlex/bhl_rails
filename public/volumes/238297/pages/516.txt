26 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
sand and all heavy particles collect at the nodes, where
motion is least. But it happily occurred to Faraday to
try the experiment in the exhausted receiver of an air-
pump, and it was then found that the light powder
behaved exactly like heavy powder. A conclusive proof
was thus obtaineofcKat the^ffresence of air was the con-
dition of importance, doubtless because it was thrown into
eddies by the motion of the plate, and thus carried the
Lycopodium to the points of greatest agitation. Sand
was too heavy to be thus carried by the air.
Exclusion of Indifferent Circumstances.
^
From what has been already said it will be apparent that
in the investigation of any new phenomenon the detection
and exclusion of indifferent circumstances is a work of
great importance, because it allows the concentration of
attention upon circumstances which may contain the
principal condition. There will always be a multitude
of things which we are only too ready to neglect, but
many beautiful instances may be given where all the most
obvious circumstances have been shown to have no part in
the production of a phenomenon. Every person would
suppose that the peculiar colours of mother-of-pearl were
due to the chemical qualities of the substance. Much
trouble might have been spent in following out that notion
by comparing the chemical qualities of various iridescent
substances. But Brewster accidentally took an impression
from a piece of mother-of-pearl in a cement of resin and
bees'-wax, and finding the colours repeated upon the
surface of the wax, proceeded to take other impressions
in balsam, fusible metal, lead, gum arabic, isinglass, &c.,
and always found the iridescent colours the same. He
thus proved that the chemical nature is wholly a matter
