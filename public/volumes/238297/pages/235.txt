COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS. 209
On carefully examining these numbers, we shall find
that they are connected with each other by an almost
unlimited series of relations, a few of the more simple
of which may be noticed.
1. Each vertical column of numbers exactly corre-
sponds with an oblique series descending from left to
right, so that the triangle is perfectly symmetrical in its
contents.
2. The first column contains only units; the second
column contains the natural numbers, i, 2, 3, &c. ; the
third column contains a remarkable series of numbers,
i, 3, 6, 10, 15, &c., which have long been called the tri-
angular numbers, because they correspond with the
numbers of balls which may be arranged in a triangular
form, thus
o
O 00
O 00 000
o oo ooo oooo
o oo ooo oooo ooooo
These numbers evidently differ each from the previous
one by the series of natural numbers. Their employment
has been explained, and the first 20,000 of the numbers
calculated and printed by E. de Joncourt in a small
quarto volume, which was published at the Hague, in
1762.
The fourth column contains the pyramidal numbers,
so called because they correspond to the number of equal
balls which can be piled in regular triangular pyramids.
Their differences are the triangular numbers.
The -numbers of the fifth column have the pyramidal
numbers for their differences, but as there is no regular
figure of which they express the contents, they have been
arbitrarily called the trianguli-triangular numbers. The
succeeding columns have, in a similar manner, been said to
