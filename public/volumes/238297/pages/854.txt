364 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
the simple hypothesis that the elasticity and approxima-
tion of the particles vary in the directions of the crystalline
axes allows of the application of deductive reasoning.
The whole of the phenomena are gradually being proved
to be consistent with this hypothesis, so that we have in
this subject of crystallography a beautiful instance of
successful classification, connected with a nearly perfect
physical hypothesis. Moreover this hypothesis was veri-
fied experimentally as regards the mechanical vibrations
of sound by Savart, who found that the vibrations in a
plate of biaxial crystal indicated the existence of varying
elasticity in varying directions.
Classification an Inverse and Tentative Operation.
If all attempts at so-called natural classification be
really attempts at perfect induction, it follows that they
are all subject to the remarks which were made upon the
inverse character of the inductive process, and upon the
difficulty of every inverse operation (vol. i. pp. 14, 15,
140, &c.). There will of necessity be no royal road to the
discovery of the best system, and it will even be im-
possible to lay down any series of rules of procedure to
assist those who are in search of a good arrangement.
The only invariable logical rule which could be stated
would be as follows : Having given certain objects, group
them in every way in which they can be grouped, and
then observe in which method of grouping the coincidence
of properties is most conspicuously manifested. But this
method of exhaustive classification will in almost every
case be impracticable, owing to the immensely great
number of modes in which a comparatively small number
of objects may be grouped together. About sixty-three
elements have been classified by chemists in six principal
groups as Monad, Dyad, Triad, &c. elements, the numbers
