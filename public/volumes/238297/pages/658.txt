168 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
The uniform direction and strength of the trade-winds
were long familiar to mariners, before they were explained
by Halley on hydrostatical principles. The winds were
found to arise from the action of gravity, which causes
any heavy body to displace a lighter one, while the direc-
tion from east to west was also explained as a necessary
result of the earth's rotation. Whatever body moves in
the northern hemisphere from north to south, whether it
be a bird, or a railway train, or a body of air, must tend
towards the right hand, or west. Dove's law of the
winds is to the effect that the winds tend to veer in
the northern hemisphere in the direction N.E.S.W., and
in the southern hemisphere in the direction N.W.S.E.
This tendency was shown by him to be the necessary effect
of the same conditions which apply to the trade-winds.
Whenever, then, any fact is connected by resemblance, law,
theory, hypothesis, or any other process of reasoning, with
other facts, it is explained.
Although the great mass of recorded facts must be
empirical, and awaiting explanation, such knowledge is
of minor value, because it does not admit of extensive and
safe inference. Each recorded result informs us exactly
what will be experienced again in the same circum-
stances, but has no bearing upon what will happen in
other circumstances.
Overlooked Results of Theory.
We must by no means suppose that, even when a
scientific truth is firmly in our possession, all its con-
sequences will be foreseen. Deduction is, as I have
frequently remarked, certain and infallible, in the sense
that each step in deductive reasoning will lead us to some
result, as certain as the law itself. But it does not follow
that every mode of deducing a fact from a law, or a
