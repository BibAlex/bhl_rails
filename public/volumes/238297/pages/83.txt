PROPOSITIONS. 57
Venus, and Venus must differ from Mars. The Earth
differs from Jupiter in density ; therefore Jupiter must
differ from the Earth. Speaking generally, if A ^ B we
shall also have B * A, and these two forms may be con-
sidered expressions of the same difference. But the
reader will notice that the relation of differing things
is not wholly reciprocal. The density of Jupiter does
not differ from that of the Earth in the same way that
that of the Earth differs from that of Jupiter. The change
of sensation which we experience in passing from Venus
to Mars is not the same as what we experience in passing
back to Venus, but just the opposite in nature. The
colour of the sky is lighter than that of the ocean ;
therefore that of the ocean cannot be lighter than that
of the sky, but darker. In these and all similar cases
we gain a notion of direction or character of change,
and results of immense importance may be shown to
rest on this notion. For the present we shall be
concerned with the mere fact of identity existing or
not existing.
Twofold Interpretation of Propositions.
Terms, as we have seen (p. 31), may have a meaning
either in extension or intension ; and according as one
or the other meaning is attributed to the terms of a
proposition, so may a different interpretation be assigned
to the proposition itself. When the terms are abstract
we must read them in intension, and a proposition con-
necting such terms must denote the identity or non-
identity of the qualities respectively denoted by the
terms. Thus if we say
Equality = Identity of magnitude,
the assertion means that the circumstance of being equal
