CLASSIFICATION.
THE extensive subject of Classification has been deferred
to a late part of this treatise, because it involves many
questions of difficulty, and did not seem naturally to fall

is evident also that every general notion, or concept is but

sided rectilinear figures as resembling each other in the
common property of possessing parallel sides. We should
be said to form a class, Trilobite, when we place alongside
