PREFACE. vii
learnt to advocate the use of hypotheses. I take the
extreme view of holding that Francis Bacon, although he
correctly insisted upon constant reference to experience,
had no correct notions as to the logical method by which,
from particular facts, we educe laws of nature. I en-
deavour to show that hypothetical anticipation of nature
is an essential part of inductive inquiry, and that it is the
Newtonian method of deductive reasoning combined with
elaborate experimental verification, which has led to all
the great triumphs of scientific research.
In attempting to give an explanation of this view of
Scientific Method, I have first to show that the sciences of
number_and quantity repose upon and spring from the
simpler and more general science of Logic. The Theory of
Probability, which enables us to estimate and calculate
quantities of knowledge, is then described, and especial
attention is drawn to the Inverse Method of Proba-
bilities, which involves, as I conceive, the true principle
of inductive procedure. No inductive conclusions are more
than probable, and I adopt the opinion that the theory of
probability is an essential part of logical method, so that
the logical value of every inductive result must be deter-
mined consciously or unconsciously, according to the
principles of the inverse method of probability.
The phenomena of nature are commonly manifested in
quantities of time, space, force, energy, &c., and the ob-
servation, measurement, and analysis of the various quan-
titative conditions or results involved, even in a simple
experiment, demand much employment of systematic pro-
cedure. I devote a book, therefore, to a simple and
general description of the devices by which exact measure-
ment is effected, errors eliminated, a probable mean result
attained, and the probable error of that mean ascertained.
I then proceed to the principal, and probably the most
interesting, subject of the book, illustrating successively
