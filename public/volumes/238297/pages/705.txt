ACCORDANCE OF QUANTITATIVE THEORIES, $c. 215
conducted observatories to compare the position of the
principal heavenly bodies as actually observed with what
might have been expected theoretically. This practice
was introduced by Halley when Astronomer .Royal, and
his reduction of the lunar observations gave a series of
residual errors from 1722 to 1739, by the examination
of which the lunar theory was improved. Most of the
greater astronomical variations arising from nutation,
aberration, planetary perturbation were in like manner
disclosed. The precession of the equinox was perhaps
the earliest residual difference observed ; the systematic
divergence of Uranus from its calculated places was one
of the latest, and was the foundation of the remarkable
discovery of Neptune by anticipation. We may also class
under residual phenomena all the so-called proper motions
of the stars. A complete star catalogue, such as that
of the British Association, gives a greater or less amount
of proper motion for almost every star, consisting in the
apparent difference of position of the star as derived from
the earliest and latest good observations. But these
apparent motions are often due, as is expressly explained
by Bally 1 , the author of the catalogue, to errors of obser-
vation and reduction. In many cases the best astronomi-
cal authorities have differed as to the very direction of
the supposed proper motion of stars, and as regards the
amount of the motion, for instance of a Polaris, the most
different estimates have been formed. Eesidual quantities
will of necessity be often so small that their very existence
will be doubtful. Only the gradual progress both of theory
and of accurate measurement will clearly show whether a
discrepancy is to be referred to previous errors of obser-
vation and theory or to some new phenomenon. But
nothing is more requisite for the progress of science than
