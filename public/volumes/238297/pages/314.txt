ments. Newton remarked upon the regularity and uni-
formity of these motions, and contrasted them with the
eccentricity and irregularity of the cometary orbits 8 .
Could we, in fact, look down upon the system from the
northern side, we should see all the planets moving round
from west to east, the satellites moving round their
primaries and the sun, planets, and all the satellites
rotating in the same direction, with some exceptions on
the verge of the system. Now in the time of Laplace
eleven planets were known, and the directions of rotation
were known for the sun, six planets, the satellites of Jupiter,
Saturn's ring, and one of his satellites. Thus there were
altogether 43 motions all concurring, namely :
Orbital motions of eleven planets . .11
Orbital motions of eighteen satellites . .18
Axial rotations . . . . . -14

The probability that 43 motions independent of each
other would coincide by chance is the 42nd power of ^, so
that the odds are about 4,400,000,000,000 to i in favour
of some common cause for the uniformity of direction. This,
probability, as Laplace observes*, is higher than that of
many historical events which we undoubtingly believe.
In the present day, the probability is much increased by
the discovery of additional planets, and the rotation of
other satellites, and it is only slightly weakened by the
fact that some of the outlying satellites are exceptional in
direction, there being considerable evidence of an acci-
dental disturbance in the more distant parts of the
system.
Hardly less remarkable than the uniformity of motion

Saturn as giving two independent movements.
