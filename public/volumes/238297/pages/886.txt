396 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
registered and discriminated accurately by their teeth,
especially by the foremost molars and the hindmost pre-
molars. Some of the teeth, indeed, are occasionally missing,
so that zoologists prefer to trust to those characteristic
teeth which are most constant ^, and to infer from them
not only the arrangement of the other teeth, but the whole
conformation of the animal.
It is a very difficult matter to mark out any boundary-
line between the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and it
may even be doubted whether any rigorous division can
be established. The most fundamental and important
character of a vegetable structure probably consists in
the absence of nitrogen from the constituent membranes.
Supposing this to be the case, the difficulty arises that in
examining minute organisms we cannot ascertain directly
whether they contain nitrogen or not. Some minor but
easily detected circumstance is therefore needed to dis-
criminate between animals and vegetables, and this is
furnished to some extent by the fact that the production
of starch granules is restricted to the vegetable kingdom.
Thus the Desmidiaceae may be safely assigned to the vege-
table kingdom, because they contain starch. But we
must not employ this characteristic negatively ; the Diato-
maceae are probably vegetables, though they do not
produce starch.
Diagnostic Systems of Classification.
We have seen that diagnosis is the process of dis-
covering the place in any system of classes, to which an
object has already been referred by some previous investi-
gation, the object being to avail ourselves of the informa-
tion concerning such an object which has been already
accumulated and recorded. It is obvious that this is a
