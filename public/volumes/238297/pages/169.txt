These numbers are sometimes negative, more often posi-
tive ; sometimes in low terms, but unexpectedly spring-
ing up to high terms ; in absolute magnitude they
are very variable. They seem to set all regularity and
method at defiance, and it is hardly to be supposed that
any one could, from contemplation of the numbers, have
detected the relation between them. Yet they are derived
from the most regular ^and symmetrical laws of relation,
and are of the highest importance in mathematical analysis,
being known as the numbers of Bernouilli.
Compare again the difficulty of decyphering with that
of cyphering. Any one can invent a secret language, and
with a little steady labour can translate the longest letter
into the character. Biit to decypher the letter having no
key to the signs adopted, is a wholly different matter.
As the possible modes of secret writing are infinite in
number and exceedingly various in kind, there is no direct
mode of discovery whatever. Repeated trial, guided
more or less by knowledge of the customary form of cypher,
and resting entirely on the principles of probability, is
the only resource. A peculiar tact or skill is requisite for
the process, and a few men, such as Wallis or Mr. Wheat-
stone, have attained great success.
Induction is the decyphering of the hidden meaning of
natural phenomena. Given events which happen in certain
definite combinations, we are required to point out the
laws which have governed those combinations. Any laws
being supposed, we can, with ease and certainty, decide
whether the phenomena obey those laws. But the laws
which may exist are infinite in variety, so that the chances
are immensely against mere random guessing. The dif-
ficulty is m.uch increased by the fact that several laws will
