PRINCIPLES OF NUMBER. 193
Every logical proposition or equation now gives rise
to a corresponding numerical equation. Sameness of
qualities occasions sameness of numbers. Hence if
A = B
denotes the identity of the qualities of A and B, we may
conclude that
(A) = (B).
It is evident that exactly those objects, and those objects
only, which are comprehended under A must be compre-
hended under B. It follows that wherever we can draw
an equation of qualities, we can draw a similar equation of
numbers. Thus, from
A = B= C
we infer
A = C;
and similarly from
(A) = (B) = (C),
meaning the numbers of A's and C's are equal to the
number of B's, we can infer
(A) = (C).
But, curiously enough, this does not apply to negative
propositions and inequalities. For if
A = B - D
means that A is identical with B, which differs from D, it
does not follow that
(A) = (B) ^ (D).
Two classes of objects may differ in qualities, and yet they
may agree in number. This is a point which strongly
confirms me in the opinion I have already expressed,
that all inference really depends upon equations, not
differences (p. 186).
The Logical Abecedarium thus enables us to make a
complete analysis of any numerical problem, and though
the symbolical statement may sometimes seem prolix, I
conceive that it really represents the course which the
