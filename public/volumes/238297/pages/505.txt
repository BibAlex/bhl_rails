OBSERVATION. 15
pointed out that there is a general tendency for clouds
to disperse at the commencement of night, which is the
time when the full moon rises. Thus the change of the
sky arid the rise of the full moon are likely to attract
attention mutually, and the coincidence in time suggests
the relation of cause and effect. Mr. Ellis proves from
the results of observations at the Greenwich Observatory
that the moon possesses no appreciable power of the kind
supposed, and yet it is remarkable that so acute and
sound an observer as the late Sir John Herschel was
convinced of the connection. In his ' Results of Obser-
vations at the Cape of Good Hope'P, he mentions many
evenings when a full moon occurred with a peculiarly
clear sky.
There is yet a fourth class of cases, in which B is really
the antecedent event, but our perception of A, which is a
consequence of B, may be necessary to bring about our
perception of B. There can be no doubt, for instance,
that upward and downward currents are continually cir-
culating in the lowest stratum of the atmosphere during
the day-time ; but owing to the transparency of the at-
mosphere we have no evidence of their existence until we
perceive cumulous clouds, which are the consequence of
such currents. In like manner an intern* Itratioii of bodies
of air in the higher parts of the atmosphere is probably in
nearly constant progress, but unless threads of cirrous
cloud indicate these motions we remain wholly ignorant of
their occurrence 1. The highest strata of the atmosphere
are wholly imperceptible to us, except when rendered
