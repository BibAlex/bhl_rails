same exact places, and the stability of the system be esta-
blished.
But any such theory of periodic stability is really hypo-
thetical, and does not take into account a multitude of
phenomena resulting in the dissipation of energy, which
may be a really secular process incapable of restoration.
For our present purposes we really need not attempt to
form any opinion on such lofty questions. Any change
which does not present the appearance of a periodic
character will be empirically regarded as a secular change
for the present, so that there will be an abundant supply
of non-periodic variations.
The variations which we produce experimentally will
often be non-periodic. When we communicate heat to a
gas it increases in bulk or pressure, and as fa? as we can
go the higher the temperature the higher the pressure.
Our experiments are of course restricted in temperature
both above and below, but there is every reason to believe
that the bulk being the same, the pressure would never
return to the same point at any two different tempera-
tures. We may of course repeatedly raise and lower the
temperature at regular or irregular intervals entirely at
our will, and the pressure of the gas will vary in like
manner and exactly at the same intervals, but such an
arbitrary series of changes would not constitute Periodic
Variation. It would constitute a succession of distinct
experiments, which would place beyond reasonable doubt
the connexion of cause and effect.
Whenever a phenomenon recurs at equal or nearly
equal intervals, there is, according to the theory of pro-
bability, considerable evidence of connexion, because if
the recurrences were entirely casual it is exceedingly
unlikely that they would happen at equal intervals. Thus
the mere fact that a brilliant comet had appeared in the
years 1301, 1378, 1456, 1531, 1607, and 1682, gave con-
