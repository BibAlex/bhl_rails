and the devices of sorcery and witchcraft often work their
own ends. A man dies on the day which he has always
regarded as his last, from his own fears of the day. An
incantation effects its purpose, because care is taken to
frighten the intended victim, by letting him know his
fate m . In all such cases the mental condition is the cause
of apparent coincidence.
In a second class of cases, the event A may make our
perception of B follow, which would otherwise happen
without being perceived. Thus it was seriously believed
as the result of investigation that more comets appeared
in hot than cold summers. No account was taken of the
fact that hot summers would be comparatively cloudless,
and afford better opportunities for the discovery of
comets 11 . Here the disturbing condition is of a purely
external character. Certain ancient philosophers held
that the moon's rays were cold-producing, mistaking the
cold caused by radiation into space for an effect of the
moon, which becomes visible at the time when the absence
of clouds permits radiation to proceed.
In a third class of cases, our perception of A may make
our perception of B follow. The event B may be con-
stantly happening, but our attention may not be drawn to
it except by our observing A. This case seems to be
illustrated by the fallacy of the moon's influence on clouds.
The origin of this fallacy is somewhat complicated. In
the first place, when the sky is densely clouded the
moon would not be visible at all ; it would be necessary
for us to see the full moon in order that our attention
should be strongly drawn to the fact, and this would
happen most often on those nights when the sky was
cloudless. Mr. W. Ellis , moreover, has ingeniously
