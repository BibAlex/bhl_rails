UNITS AND STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT. 375
Derived Units.
The standard units of time, space, and mass having been
once fixed, it becomes obvious that many kinds of magnitude
are naturally measured by units immediately derived from
one or more of the three principal ones. From the standard
metre of linear magnitude follows in the most obvious
manner the centaire or square metre, the unit of super-
ficial magnitude, and the litre or cube of the tenth part
of a metre, the standard of capacity or volume. Telocity
of motion, again, is expressed by the ratio of the space
passed over, when the motion is uniform, to the time
occupied ; hence the unit velocity will be that of a
body which passes over a unit of space in a unit of time,
say one metre per second. Momentum is measured by
the mass moving, regard being paid both to the amount
of matter and the velocity at which it is moving. Hence
the unit of momentum will be that of a unit volume of
matter of the unit density moving with the unit velocity,
or in the French system, a cubic centimetre of water of
the maximum density moving one metre per second.
An accelerating force is measured by the ratio of the
momentum generated to the time occupied, the force
being supposed to act uniformly. The unit of force will
therefore be that which generates a unit of momentum
in a unit of time, or which causes, in the French system,
one cubic centimetre of water at maximum density to
acquire in one second a velocity of one metre per second.
The force of gravity is the most familiar kind of force,
and as when acting unimpeded upon any substance it
produces in a second a velocity of 9*80868 .... metres
per second in Paris, it follows that the absolute unit
of force is about the tenth part of the force of gravity.
If we employ British weights and measures, the absolute
unit of force is represented by the gravity of about half
