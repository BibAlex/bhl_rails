possible accuracy, so that they can be employed for pur-
poses of reference by all astronomers.
In ascertaining the specific gravities of substances, all
gases are referred to atmospheric air at a given tempera-
ture and pressure ; all liquids and solids are referred to
water. We require to compare the densities of water
and air with great care, and the comparative densities of
any two substances whatever can then be with ease
ascertained.
In comparing a very great with a very small magni-
tude, it is usually desirable to break up the process into
several steps, using intermediate terms of comparison.
We should never think of measuring the distance from
London to Edinburgh by laying down measuring rods
throughout the whole distance. A base of several miles
in length is selected on level ground, and compared on
the one hand with the standard yard, and on the other
with the distance of London and Edinburgh, or any other
two points, by trigonometrical survey. It would be ex-
ceedingly difficult to compare the light of a star with
that of the sun, which would be about thirty thousand
million times greater ; but Sir J. Herschel * effected the
comparison by using the full moon as an intermediate
unit. Wollaston ascertained that the sun gave 801,072
times as much light as the fuU moon, and Herschel
determined that the light of the latter exceeded that of
a Centauri 27,408 times, so that we find the ratio be-
tween the light of the sun and star to be that of about
22,000,000,000 to i.
The Pendulum. '
By far the most perfect and beautiful of all instru-
ments of measurement is the pendulum. Consisting
