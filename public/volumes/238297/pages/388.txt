362 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
body which seems to us to move uniformly is not doing
so, but is subject to fits and starts unknown to us, because
we have no absolute standard of time, then all other
bodies must be subject to exactly the same arbitrary fits
and starts, otherwise there would be a discrepancy be-
tween them disclosing the irregularities. Just as in com-
paring together a number of chronometers, we should
soon detect bad ones by their irregular going, as measured
by the others, so in nature we detect disturbed movement
by its discrepancy from that of other bodies, which we
believe to be undisturbed, and which agree very nearly
among themselves. But inasmuch as the measure of motion
involves time, and the measure of time involves motion,
there must be ultimately an assumption. We may define
equal times, as times during which a moving body under
the influence of no force describes equal spaces s, but all
we can say in its support is, that it leads us into no
known difficulties, and that to the best of our experience,
one freely moving body gives exactly the same results as
any other.
When we inquire where the freely moving body is, no
satisfactory answer can be given. Practically the rotating
globe is sufficiently accurate, and Thomson and Tait say :
* Equal times are times during which the earth turns
through equal angles 11 '. No long time has passed since
astronomers thought it impossible to detect any inequality
in its movement. Poisson was supposed to have proved
that a change in the length of the sidereal day, amounting
to one ten-millionth part in 2500 years, was incompatible
with an ancient eclipse recorded by the Ohaldaeans, and
similar calculations were made by Laplace. But it is now
known that these calculations were somewhat in error,
