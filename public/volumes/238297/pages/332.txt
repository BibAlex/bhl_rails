306 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
In all matters of judicial evidence, we must bear in
mind the necessary occurrence from time to time of un-
accountable coincidences. The Roman jurists refused for
this reason to invalidate a testamentary deed, the wit-
nesses of which had sealed it with the same seal. For
witnesses independently using their own seals might be
found to possess identical ones by accident 11 . It is well
known that circumstantial evidence of apparently over-
whelming completeness will sometimes lead to a mistaken
judgment, and as absolute certainty is never really attain-
able, every court must act upon probabilities of a very
high amount, and in a certain small proportion of cases
they must almost of necessity condemn the innocent
victims of a remarkable conjuncture of circumstances .
Popular judgments usually turn upon probabilities of
far less amount, as when the palace of Nicomedia, and
even the bedchamber of Diocletian, having been on fire
twice within fifteen days, the people entirely refused to
believe that it could be the result of accident. The
Romans believed that there was a fatality connected with
the name of Sextus.
' Semper sub Sextis perdita Roma fuit.'
The utmost precautions wil] not provide against all
contingencies, To avoid errors in important calculations,
it is usual to have them repeated by different computers,
but a case is on record in which three computers made
exactly the same calculations of the place of a star, and
yet all did it wrong in precisely the same manner, for no
apparent reason P.
