them. Inferences pushed far beyond their data soon lose
any considerable probability. De Morgan has said d , ' No
finite experience whatsoever can justify us in saying that
the future shall coincide with the past in all time to come,
or that there is any probability for such a conclusion.' On
the other hand, we gain the assurance that experience
sufficiently extended and prolonged will give us the
knowledge of future events with an unlimited degree of
probability, provided indeed that those events are not
subject to arbitrary interference.
It must be clearly understood that these probabilities are
only such as arise from the mere happening of the events,
irrespective of any knowledge derived from other sources
concerning those events or the general laws of nature.
All our knowledge of nature is indeed founded in like
manner upon observation, and is therefore only probable.
The law of gravitation itself is only probably true. But
when a number of different facts, observed under the most
diverse circumstances, are found to be harmonized under a
supposed law of nature, the probability of the law approxi-
mates closely to certainty. Each science rests upon so
many observed facts, and derives so much support from
analogies or direct connections with other sciences, that
there are comparatively few cases where our judgment of
the probability of an event depends entirely upon a few
antecedent events, disconnected from the general body of
physical science.
Events may often again exhibit a regularity of suc-
cession or preponderance of character, which the simple
formula will not take into account. For instance, the
majority of the elements recently discovered are metals,
so that the probability of the next discovery being that of
a metal, is doubtless greater than we calculated (p. 298).
