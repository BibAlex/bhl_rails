TEE INDUCTIVE OR INVERSE METHOD. 279
common source a . With a certain amount of labour, it
is possible to establish beyond reasonable doubt the rela-
tionship or genealogy of any number of copies of one
document, proceeding possibly from parent copies now
lost. Tischendorf has thus investigated the relations
between the manuscripts of the New Testament now
existing, and the same work has been performed by
German scholars for several classical writings.
Principle 'of the Inverse Method.
The inverse application of the rules of probability
entirely depends upon a proposition which may be thus
stated, nearly in the words of Laplace b . If an event can
be produced ~by any one of a certain number of different
causes, the probabilities of the existence of these causes as
inferred from the event, are proportional to the proba-
bilities of the event as derived from these causes. In other
words, the most probable cause of an event which has
happened is that which would most probably lead to the
event supposing the cause to exist ; but all other possible
causes are also to be taken into account with probabilities
proportional to the probability that the event would have
happened if the cause existed. Suppose, to fix our ideas
clearly, that E is the event, and C x C 2 C 3 are the three
only conceivable causes. If C x exist, the probability is pi
that E would follow ; if C 2 and C 3 exist, the like pro-
babilities are respectively p 2 and p 3 . Then as p 1 is to p 2 , so
is the probability of Ci being the actual cause to the
probability of C 2 being it ; and, similarly, as p 2 is to p 3 , so
is the probability of C 2 being the actual cause to the
probability of C 3 being it. By a very simple mathematical
