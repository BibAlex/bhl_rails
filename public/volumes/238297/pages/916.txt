arise even in a person of ordinary character. As human
knowledge and civilization progress, these characteristic
differences tend to develop and multiply themselves rather
than decrease. Character grows more evidently many-
sided. Two well educated Englishmen are far better dis-

and these are better distinguished, again, than two
Australian aborigines. Thus the complexities of exist-
ing phenomena develop themselves more rapidly than
scientific method can overtake them. In spite of all the
boasted powers of science, we cannot really apply method
to those existences, namely, our own minds and characters,
which are more important to us than all the stars and
nebulae.
