EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE, EXPLANATION, &c. 159
phenomena of light. The rainbow had always struck
the attention of the most careless observers, and there
was no difficulty in perceiving that its conditions of
occurrence consisted in rays of the sun shining upon
falling drops of rain. It was impossible to overlook the
resemblance of the ordinary rainbow to the comparatively
rare lunar rainbow, to the bow which often appears upon
the spray of a waterfall, or even upon beads of dew
suspended on grass and spiders' webs. In all these cases
the uniform conditions are rays of light and round drops
of water. Boger Bacon had noticed these conditions, as
well as the analogy of the rainbow colours to those pro-
duced by crystals a . But the knowledge was empirical
until Descartes and Newton showed how the phenomena
were connected with all the other facts concerning the
refraction of light.
There can be no better instance of an empirical truth
than that detected by Newton concerning the high re-
fractive powers of combustible substances. Newton's
chemical notions were almost as vague as those prevalent
in his day, but he observed that certain ' fat, sulphureous,
unctuous bodies/ as he calls them, such as camphor, oils,
spirit of turpentine, amber, &c., have refractive powers
two or three times greater than might be anticipated from
their densities b . The enormous refractive index of dia-
mond, led him with great sagacity to regard it as also
of the same unctuous or inflammable nature, so that he
may be regarded as predicting the combustibility of the
diamond, afterwards demonstrated by the Florentine
Academicians in 1694. Brewster having entered into a
long investigation of the refractive powers of different
substances, confirmed Newton's assertions, and found that
