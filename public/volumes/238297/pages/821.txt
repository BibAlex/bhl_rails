EXCEPTIONAL PHENOMENA. 331
degree by rays of light falling upon the selenium, points
to a wholly new relation between light and electricity.
The peculiar so-called allotropic changes which sulphur,
selenium, and phosphorus undergo by an alteration in
the amount of latent heat which they contain, will pro-
bably lead at some future time to important inferences
concerning the molecular constitution of solids and liquids.
The curious substance ozone has perplexed many chemists,
and Andrews and Tait thought that it afforded evidence
of the decomposition of oxygen by the electric discharge.
The researches of Sir B. C. Brodie negative this notion,
and afford evidence of the real constitution of the sub-
stance m , which still, however, remains exceptional in its
properties and relations, and affords a hope of important
discoveries in chemical theory.
Limiting Exceptions.
We may pass to cases where exceptional phenomena
are actually irreconcilable with a law of nature previously
regarded as true by philosophers. Error must now be
allowed to have been committed, but it is obvious that
the error may be more or less extensive. It may be that
a law holding rigorously true' of the facts actually under
notice had been extended by generalization to other
series of facts then unexamined. Subsequent investiga-
tion may show the falsity of this generalization, and
the result must be to limit the law for the future to
those objects of which it is really true, while we bring
the other classes of objects under distinct generalizations.
The contradiction to our previous opinions is partial and
not total.
Newton laid down as a result of experiment that every
ray of homogeneous light has a definite refrangibility, which
