164 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
of practical application in science. The purely logical
inverse problem, whereby we pass from combinations to
their laws, is solved in the preceding pages, as far as it
is likely to be for a long time to come ; and it is almost
impossible that it should ever be carried more than a
single step further.
Distinction between Perfect and Imperfect Induction.
We cannot proceed further with advantage, before
noticing the extreme difference which exists between
cases of perfect and those of imperfect induction. We
call an induction perfect when all the objects or combi-
nations of events which can possibly come under the class
treated have been examined. But in the majority of
cases it is impossible to collect together, or in any way to
investigate, the properties of all portions of a substance or
of a]l the individuals of a race. The number of objects
would often be practically infinite, and the greater part of
them might be beyond our reach, in the interior of the
earth, or in the most distant parts of the Universe. In all
such cases induction is said to be imperfect, and affected
by more or less uncertainty. As some writers have fallen
into much error concerning the functions and relative
importance of these two branches of reasoning, I shall
have to point out that
1. Perfect Induction is a process absolutely requisite,
both in the performance of imperfect induction and
in the treatment of large bodies of facts of which
our knowledge is complete.
2. Imperfect Induction is founded on Perfect Induction,
but involves another process of inference of a
widely different character.
It is certain that if I can draw any inference at all
concerning objects not examined, it must be done on tin
