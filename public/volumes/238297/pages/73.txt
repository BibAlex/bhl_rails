PROPOSITIONS. 47
considered such propositions purely accidental, and came
to the extraordinary conclusion, that ' Singulars cannot be

Propositions may also express the identity of extensive
groups of objects taken collectively or in one connected

Potassium = Metallic base of potash ;
Sodium = Metallic base of soda.
It is the work of grammatical analysis to separate the
various propositions often combined in a single sentence.
Logic cannot be properly required to interpret the forms
and devices of language, but to treat the meaning or

Partial Identities.
However numerous and important may be propositions
expressing simple identity of one term or class with
another, there is an almost equally important kind of
proposition which I propose to call a partial identity.
When we say that ' All mammalia are vertebrata/ we do
not mean that mammalian animals are identical with
