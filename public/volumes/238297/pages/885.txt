CLASSIFICATION. 395
examination of the germ would mislead us, for the coty-
ledons may be obsolete, as in Cuscuta, or united together,
as in Clintonia. Botanists therefore seldom actually refer
to the seed for such simple information. Certain other
characters of a plant are closely correlated with the number
of seed-leaves ; thus monocotyledonous plants almost
always possess leaves with parallel veins like those of
grass, while dicotyledonous plants have leaves with reti-
culated veins like those of an oak leaf. In monocotyle-
donous plants, too, the parts of the flower are most often
three or some multiple of three in number, while in dico-
tyledonous plants the numbers four and five and their
multiples prevail. Botanists, therefore, by a glance at the
leaves and flowers can almost certainly refer a plant to its
right class, and can infer not only the number of coty-
ledons which would be found in the seed or young plant,
but also the structure of the stem and the other general
characters and relations of a dicotyledon or a mono-
cotyledon .
Any conspicuous and easily discriminated property
which we thus select for the purpose of deciding to which
class an object belongs, may be called a characteristic. The
logical conditions of a good characteristic mark are very
simple, namely, that it should be possessed by all objects
entering into a certain class, and by none others. The
characteristic may consist either of a single quality or
circumstance, or of a conjunction of such, provided that
they all be constant and easily detected. Thus in the
classification of mammals the teeth are of the greatest
assistance, not because a slight variation in the number
and form of the teeth is of any great importance in the
general economy of the animal, but because such variations
are found by empirical observation to coincide with most
important differences in the general affinities. It is found
that the minor classes and genera of mammals can be
