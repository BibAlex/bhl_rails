302 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
not form any idea of such various creatures, but their
existence is not unlikely P.
We now know that many metals and other elements
never found in organic structures are yet capable of form-
ing compounds, with substances of vegetable or animal
origin. It is therefore just possible that at different tem-
peratures creatures formed of different but analogous com-
pounds might exist, but it would seem indispensable that
carbon should still form the basis of organic structures ;
for we have no analogies to lead us to suppose that in
the absence of that complex element, life can exist. Could
we find globes surrounded by atmospheres resembling our
own in temperature and composition, we should be almost
forced to believe them inhabited, but the probability of
any analogical argument decreases rapidly as the condi-
tion of a globe diverges from that of our own. The Cardi-
nal Nicholas de Cusa held long ago that the moon was
inhabited, but the absence of any appreciable atmosphere
renders the existence of inhabitants highly improbable.
Speculations resting upon weak analogies hardly belong
to the scope of true science, and can only be tolerated as
an antidote to the far worse dogmatism which would
assert that the thousand million of persons on earth, or
rather a small fraction of them, are the sole objects of
care of the Power which designed this limitless Universe.
Failures of Analogy.
So constant is the aid which we derive from the use of
analogy in all attempts at discovery or explanation, that
it is most important to observe in what cases it may lead
us into difficulties. That which we expect by analogy to
exist may
