(4) The Method of Compensation. He may invent some
mode of neutralizing the interfering force by balancing
against it an exactly equal and opposite force of unknown
amount.
(5) The Method of Reversal. He may so conduct the
experiment that the interfering force may act in opposite
directions, in alternate observations, the mean result being
free from interference.
1. Method of Avoidance of Error.
Astronomers always seek opportunities of observation
when errors will have the smallest effect. In spite of
elaborate observations and long continued theoretical
investigation, it is not found possible to assign any
satisfactory law to the refractive power of the atmo-
sphere. Although the apparent change of place of a
heavenly body thus produced, may be more or less
accurately calculated, yet the error depends upon the
temperature and pressure of the atmosphere, and, when
a ray is highly inclined to the perpendicular, the un-
certainty in the refraction becomes very considerable.
Hence astronomers always make their observations, if
possible, when the object is at the highest point of its
daily course, i.e. on the meridian. In some, kinds of
investigation, as, for instance, in the determination of the
latitude of an observatory, the astronomer is at liberty
to select one or more stars out of the countless number
visible. There is an evident advantage in such a case,
in selecting a star which passes close to the zenith,
so that it may be observed almost entirely free from
atmospheric refraction, as was done by Hooke. It
was ingeniously suggested by Wallis that the parallax
of the fixed stars might perhaps be detected by ob-
servations of the greatest azimuth east and west of some
