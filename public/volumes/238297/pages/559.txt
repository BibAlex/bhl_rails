METHOD OF VARIATIONS. 69
alter the intervals of the strokes so that each two suc-
cessive strokes act in opposite manners they will exactly
neutralize each other, and the energy expended will be
turned into heat or sound at the point of percussion.
Exactly similar effects occur in all cases of rhythmical
motion. If the musical note C is sounded in a room con-
taining a piano, the string corresponding to it will be
thrown into vibration, because every successive stroke of
the air-waves upon the string finds it in like position as
regards the vibration, and thus adds to its energy of
motion. But the other strings being incapable of vibrating
with the same rapidity are struck at various periods of
their vibrations, and one stroke will sooner or later be
opposed by one contrary in effect. All phenomena of
resonance arise from this coincidence in time of undu-
lation. The air in a pipe closed at one end, and about
12 inches in length, is capable of vibrating 512 times in
a second. If, then, the note C is sounded in front of the
open end of the pipe, every successive vibration of tire
air is treasured up as it were in the motion of the air.
In a pipe of different length the pulses of air would
strike each other, and the mechanical energy would be
transmuted into heat and become no longer perceptible
as sound.
These accumulated vibrations may sometimes become so
intense as to lead to unexpected results. A glass vessel
if touched with a violin bow at a suitable point may be
fractured with the excess of vibration. In the same way
a suspension bridge may readily be broken down if a com-
pany of soldiers walk across it in steps the intervals of
which happen o agree with the intervals of vibration of
the bridge itself. But if they break the step or march
with very different time, they may have no perceptible
effect upon the bridge. In fact if the impulses com-
municated to any vibrating body are exactly synchronous
