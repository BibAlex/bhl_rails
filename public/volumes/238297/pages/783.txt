ANALOGY. 293
between the forms of mathematical and logical expressions,
we undoubtedly owe the greatest recent advance in logical
science. Boole based his extension of logical processes
entirely upon the notion that logic was an algebra of two
quantities, o and i. His profound genius for the investi-
gation of symbolic methods led him to perceive by analogy
that there must exist a general system of logical deduc-
tion, of which the old logicians had seized only a few stray
fragments. Much mistaken as he was in placing algebra
as a higher science than logic, no one can deny that the
development of the more complex and dependent science
had advanced far beyond that of the simpler science, and
that Boole, in drawing attention to the connexion, made
one of the most important discoveries in the history of
science. As Descartes had wedded algebra and geometry,
so did Boole substantially accomplish the marriage of logic
and algebra.
Analogy in the Theory of Undulations.
There is no class of phenomena which more thoroughly
illustrates alike the power and weakness of analogy than
the waves which agitate every kind of medium. All waves,
whatsoever be the matter through which they pass, obey
certain common principles of rhythmical or harmonic motion,
and the subject therefore presents a vast field for mathema-
tical generalization. At the same time each kind of medium
may allow of waves peculiar in their conditions, so that it
is a beautiful exercise in analogical reasoning to observe
how, in making inferences from one kind of medium to
another, we must make allowance for difference of circum-
stances. The waves of the ocean are large and visible,
and there are the yet greater tidal waves which extend
around the globe. From such palpable cases of rhythmical
