42 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
The late Professor Boole first drew attention, so far as
I know, to this property of logical terms, and he called
it the property of Commutativeness e . He not only stated
the law with the utmost clearness, but pointed out that
it is a Law of Thought rather than a Law of Things.
I shall have in various parts of the following pages to
show how the necessary imperfection of our symbols
expressed in this law clings to our modes of expression,
and introduces complication into the whole body of
mathematical formulae, which are really founded on a
logical basis.
It is of course apparent that the power of commutation
belongs only to terms related in the simple logical mode
of synthesis. No one can confuse 'a house of bricks/
with * bricks of a house/ ' twelve square feet' with ' twelve
feet square/ 'the water of cry stall ization' with 'the
crystallization of water/ All relations which involve
differences of time and space are inconvertible ; the
higher must not be made to change place with the
lower, or the first with the last. For the parties con-
cerned there is all the difference in the world between A
killing B and B killing A. The law of commutativeness
simply asserts that difference of order does not attach to
the connection between the properties and circumstances
of a thing to what I shall call simple logical relations.
