Snowdon ; therefore Ben Nevis is higher than the Wrekin.
But a little consideration discloses much reason for be-
lieving that even in such cases, where equality does not
apparently enter, the force of the reasoning entirely
depends upon underlying and implied equalities.
In the first place, two statements of mere difference do
not give any ground of inference. We learn nothing
concerning the comparative heights of St. Paul's and
Westminster Abbey from the assertions that they both
differ in height from St. Peter's at Rome. Thus we need
something more than mere inequality ; we require one
identity in addition, namely the identity in direction of
the two differences. Thus we cannot employ inequalities
in the simple way in which we do equalities, and, when
we try to express exactly what other conditions are
requisite, we shall find ourselves lapsing into the use of
equalities or identities.
In the second place, every argument by inequalities may
be represented with at least equal clearness and force in
the form of equalities. Thus we clearly express that a
is greater than b by the equation
a = I '+ p, (i)
where p is an intrinsically positive quantity, denoting the
difference of a and b. Similarly we express that b is
greater than c by the equation
b = c + q, (2)
and substituting for b in (i) its value in (2) we have
a = c + q + p. (3)
Now as p and q are both positive, it follows that a is
greater than c, and we have the exact amount of excess
specified. It will be easily seen that the reasoning con-
cerning that which is less than a less will result in an
equation of the form
c a q p.
Every argument by inequalities may then be thrown
