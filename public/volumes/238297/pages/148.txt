122 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
The lower line contains all the combinations which are
inconsistent with either premise ; we have carried out in
a mechanical manner that exclusion of self-contradictories
which was formerly done upon the slate or paper. Ac-
cordingly, from the remaining combinations in the upper
line we can draw any inference which the premises yield.
If we raise the A's we find only one, and that is C, so that
A must be C. If we select the c's we again find only
one which is a and also 6, so that we prove that not-C is
iiot-xl and not-B.
When a disjunctive proposition occurs among the
premises the requisite movements become rather more
complicated. Take the disjunctive argument
A is either B or C or D,
A is not C and not D,
Therefore A is B.
The premises are represented accurately as follows :
A = ABI AC! AD (i)
A = Ac (2)
^
As there are four terms we choose the series of sixteen
combinations and place them on the highest ledge of the
board but one. We raise the a's and lower the b's. But
we are not to reject all the A&'s as contradictory, because
by the first premise A's may be either B's or C's or D's.
Accordingly out of the Afr's we must select the cs, and
out of these again the d's, so that only Kbcd will remain
to be rejected finally. Joining all the other fifteen com-
binations together again we raise the as and lower the
AC's, and thus reject the combinations inconsistent with
(2) ; similarly we reject the AD's which are inconsistent
with (3). It will be found that there remain in addition
to all the eight combinations containing a only one con-
taining A, namely
