172 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
There can be no doubt that this and other predictions of
eclipses attributed to ancient philosophers were due to an
obscure knowledge of the Metonic Cycle, a period of 6585
days, or 223 lunar months, or about 19 years in which a
nearly perfect recurrence of the phases and eclipses of the
moon takes place ; but if so, Thales must have had access
to a long series of astronomical records either those of the
Egyptians or the Chaldeans. There is a well known story
as to the happy use which Columbus made of the power
of predicting eclipses in overawing the islanders of Jamaica
who refused him necessary supplies of food for his fleet.
He threatened to deprive them of the moon's light. ' His
threat was treated at first with indifference, but when the
eclipse actually commenced, the barbarians vied with each
other in the production of the necessary supplies for the
Spanish fleet.'
Exactly the same kind of interest and awe which the
ancients experienced at the prediction of eclipses, has been
felt in modern times concerning the return of comets.
Seneca indeed asserted in most distinct and remarkable
terms that comets would be found to revolve in periodic
orbits and return to sight. The ancient Chaldeans and
the Pythagoreans are also said to have entertained a like
opinion. But it was not until the age of Newton and
Halley that it became possible to calculate the path of a
comet in future years. A great comet appeared in 1682,
a few years before the first publication of the ' Principia,'
and Halley showed that its orbit corresponded with those
of remarkable comets rudely recorded to have appeared
in the years 1531 and 1607. The intervals of time indeed
were not quite equal, but Halley conceived the bold idea
that this difference might be due to the disturbing power
of Jupiter, near which great planet the comet had passed
in the interval 1607-1682. He predicted that the comet
would return about the end of 1758 or the beginning of
