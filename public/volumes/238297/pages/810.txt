have yet been proved to have such axes. It seems likely
that the class would constitute only a singular case of the
more general triclinic system, in which all three axes are
inclined to each other at various angles. Now if the di-
clinic form were merely accidental, and not necessitated
by any general law of molecular constitution, its actual
occurrence would be infinitely improbable, just as it is
infinitely improbable that any star should indicate the
North Pole with perfect exactness.
In the curves denoting the relation between the temper-
ature and pressure of water there is one very remarkable
point entirely single and unique, at which alone water
can remain in the three conditions of gas, liquid, and solid
in the same vessel. It is the point at which three curves
intersect, namely, the steam line showing at what temper-
atures and pressures water is just upon the point of be-
coming gaseous, and other similar lines which show when
ice is just on the point of melting, and when ice is just
about to assume the gaseous state directly.
Divergent Exceptions.
Closely analogous to singular exceptions are those diver-
gent exceptions, in which a phenomenon manifests itself
in very unusual magnitude or character, without however
in any degree becoming subject to peculiar laws. Thus
in throwing ten coins, it happened in four cases out of
2048 throws, that all the coins fell with heads uppermost
(vol. i. p. 238) ; these would usually be regarded as very
singular events, and, according to the theory of proba-
bilities, they would be comparatively very rare ; yet they
proceed only from an unusual conjunction of accidental
events, and from no really exceptional causes. In all classes
of natural phenomena we may expect to meet with similar
divergencies from the average. Sometimes due merely to
