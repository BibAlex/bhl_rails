INTRODUCTION. 15
plication, or the integral calculus rests upon the obser-
vation and remembrance of the results of the differential
calculus, so induction requires a prior knowledge of
deduction. An inverse process is the undoing of the
direct process. A person who enters a maze must either
trust to chance to lead him out again, or he must carefully
notice the road by which he entered. The facts furnished
to us by experience are a maze of particular results ; we
might by chance observe in them the fulfilment of a law,
but this is scarcely possible, unless we thoroughly learn
the effects which would attach to any particular law.
Accordingly, the importance of deductive reasoning is
doubly supreme. Even when we gain the results of in-
duction they would be of little or no use without we
could deductively apply them. But before we can gain
them at all we must understand deduction, since it is the
inversion of deduction which constitutes induction. Our
first task then, in this work, must be to trace out fully the
nature of identity in all its forms of occurrence. Having
given any series of propositions we must be prepared to
develop the whole meaning embodied in them, and the
whole of the consequences which flow from them.
Symbolic Expression of Logical Inference.
In developing the results of the Principle of Inference
we require to use an appropriate language of signs. It
would indeed be quite possible to explain the processes of
reasoning merely by the use of words found in the ordinary
grammar and dictionary. Special examples of reasoning,
too, may seem to be more readily apprehended than general
and symbolic forms. But it has been abundantly proved
in the mathematical sciences that the attainment of truth
depends greatly upon the invention of a clear, brief, and
appropriate system of symbols. Not only is such a
