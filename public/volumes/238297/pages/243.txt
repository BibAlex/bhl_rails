COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS. 217
In dealing a pack of cards, the number of hands, of
thirteen cards each, which can be produced is
52 . 51 5 ..... 40
or 635,013,559,600. But in whist four hands are simul-
taneously held, and the number of distinct deals becomes
so vast that it would require twenty-eight figures to express
it. If the whole population of the world, say one hundred
thousand millions of persons, were to deal cards day and
night, for a hundred million of years, they would not in
that time have exhausted one hundred-thousandth part of
the possible deals. Now, even with the same hands the
play may be almost infinitely varied, so that the complete
variety of games which may exist is almost incalculably
great. It is in the highest degree improbable that any
one game of whist was ever exactly like another, except
by intention.
The end of novelty in art might well be dreaded, did
we not find that nature at least has placed no attainable
limit, and that the deficiency will lie in our inventive
faculties. It would be a cheerless time indeed when all
possible varieties of melody were exhausted, but it is
readily shown that if a peal of twenty-four bells had been
rung continuously from the so-called beginning of the
world to the present day, no approach could have been
made to the completion of the possible changes. Nay,
had every single minute been prolonged to 10,000 years,
still the task would have been unaccomplished. P As
regards ordinary melodies, the eight notes of a single
octave give more than 40,000 permutations, and two
octaves more than a million millions. If we were to take
