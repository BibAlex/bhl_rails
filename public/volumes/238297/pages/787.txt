ANALOGY. 297
instead of being coincident with the direction of vibration,
as it would be in the case of transverse sound undulations.
Thus the laws of elastic forces appear to be essentially
different in application to the luminiferous ether and to
ordinary solid bodies \
Between light and heat, forms of energy, which at first
sight appear so different, a perfect analogy has gradually
been established. Not only do rays of light and heat
obey exactly the same laws of reflection and refraction,
but they are subject to exactly the same laws of absorp-
tion and polarization. Wherever a light-ray is deficient
in the solar spectrum, a heat-ray is also missing. It is
now considered that light is but the influence of heat-rays
of certain wave-lengths upon the eye, so that we may in
fact cease to distinguish radiant heat and rays of light.
Heat in- the radiant condition is, of course, to be distin-
guished from the molecular vibration also called heat,
and from the potential energy which it produces when
absorbed by substances, and rendered latent.
Use of Analogy in Astronomy.
We shall be much assisted in gaining a true apprecia-
tion of the value of analogy in its feebler degrees, by con-
sidering how much it has contributed to the progress of
astronomical science. Our point of observation is so fixed
with regard to the universe, and our means of examining
distant bodies is so restricted, that we are obliged in
many cases to be guided by limited and apparently feeble
resemblances. In many cases the result has been con-
firmed by subsequent direct evidence of the most
forcible character.
