METHOD OF VARIATIONS. 59
tion of the forms of such curves we may infer that mag-
netic and electric attractions obey the general law of
emanation, that of the inverse square of the distance. In
the electric brush we have another similar exhibition of
the laws of electric attraction.
There are several branches of science in which col-
lective experiments have been used with great ad-
vantage. Lichtenberg's electric figures, produced by
scattering electrified powder on an electrified resin cake,
so as to show the condition of the latter, suggested to
Chladni the notion of discovering the state of vibration of
plates by strewing sand upon them. The sand collects at
the points where the motion is least, and we gain at a
glance a comprehension of the general form of undulation
of the whole plate. To this method of experiment we owe
the beautiful observations of Savart. The exquisite
coloured figures exhibited by plates of crystal, when ex-
amined by polarized light, afford a more complicated
example of the same kind of investigation. They led
Brewster and Fresnel to a successful explanation of the
properties of the optic axes of crystals. The unequal
conduction of heat in crystalline substances has also been
shown in a similar manner, by spreading a thin layer of
wax over the plate of crystal, and applying heat to a
single point. The wax then melts in a circular or elliptic
area according as the rate of conduction is uniform or not.
Nor should we forget that Newton's rings were an early
and most important instance of investigations of the same
kind, showing the effects of interference of light undula-
tions of all magnitudes at a single view. Sir John
Herschel gave to all such opportunities of observing
directly the results of a general law, the name of Col-
lective Instances, and I propose to adopt the name
Collective Experiments.
