THE THEORY OF PROBABILITY. 245
instance, that the probabilities would be the same when
coins are thrown successively as when thrown simul-
taneously. a Some men of high ability, such as Ancillon,
Moses Mendelssohn, Grarve, b Auguste Comte c and J. S.
Mill, d have so far misapprehended the theory, as to
question its value or even to dispute altogether its
validity.
Many persons have a fallacious tendency to believe that
when a chance event has happened several times together
in an unusual conjunction, it is less likely to happen
again. D'Alembert seriously held that if head was thrown
three times running with a coin, tail would more probably
appear at the next trial. 6 Bequelin adopted the same
opinion, and yet there is no reason for it whatever. If
the event be really casual, what has gone before cannot in
the slightest degree influence it.
As a matter of fact, the more often the most casual
event takes place the more likely it is to happen again;
because there is some slight empirical evidence of a
tendency, as will afterwards be pointed out. The source of j
the fallacy is to be found entirely in the feelings of/
surprise with which we witness an event happening by .
apparent chance, in a manner which seems to proceed from
design.
Misapprehension may also arise from overlooking the
difference between permutations and combinations. To
throw ten heads in succession with a coin is no more
unlikely than to throw any other particular succession
of heads and tails, but it is much less likely than five
heads and five tails without regard to their order, be-
