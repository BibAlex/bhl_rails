THE INDIRECT METHOD OF INFERENCE. 115
we can substitute in ( i ) obtaining the conclusion
A = Ac.
But the same result may be obtained by taking the
eight combinations of A, B, C, of the abecedarium ; it will
be found that only three combinations, namely
aBC
abc,
are consistent with the premises, whence it results that
A = Abe,
or by the process of Ellipsis before described (p. 69)
A = Ac.
As a somewhat more complex example I take the
argument thus stated, one which could not be thrown
into the syllogistic form.
* All metals except gold and silver are opaque ; there-
fore what is not opaque is either gold or silver
or is not-metal/
There is more implied in this statement than is dis-
tinctly asserted, the full meaning being as follows :
All metals not gold or silver are opaque, (i)
Gold is not opaque but is a metal. (2)
Silver is not opaque but is a metal, (3)
Gold and silver are distinct substances. (4)
Taking our letters thus
A metal C = silver
B = gold D = opaque,
we may state the premises in the form
A&c = AfoD (i)
B = ABeJ (2)
C = ACd (3)
B = Be. (4)
To obtain a complete solution of the question we take
the sixteen combinations of A, B, C, D, and striking out
