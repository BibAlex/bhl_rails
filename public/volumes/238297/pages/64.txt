38 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Symbolic Expression of the Law of Contradiction.
The synthesis of terms is subject to the all-important
Law of Thought, described in a previous section (p. 6)
and called the Law of Contradiction. It is self-evident
that no quality or circumstance can be both present and
absent at the same time and place. This fundamental
condition of all thought and all existence is expressed
symbolically by a rule that a term and its negative shall
never be allowed to come into combination. Such com-
bined terms as Aa, B6, Cc, &c. are self- contradictory and
devoid of all meaning. If they represented anything, it
would be what cannot exist, and cannot even be imagined
in the mind. They can therefore only enter into our con-
sideration to suffer immediate exclusion. The criterion
of false reasoning, as we shall find, is that it involves
self-contradiction, the affirming and denying of the same
statement. Thus we might represent the object of all
reasoning as the separation of the consistent and possible
from the inconsistent and impossible ; and we cannot make
any inference without implying that certain combinations
of terms are contradictory and excluded from thought.
To conclude that 'all A's are BV is equivalent to the
assertion that f A's which are not B's cannot exist/
It will be convenient to have the means of indicating
this exclusion of the self-contradictory ; and we may use
the familiar sign for nothing, the cipher o. Thus the
second law of thought may be symbolised in the forms
Aa = o AB6 = o ABCa = o.
We may variously describe the meaning of o in logic as
the non-existent, the impossible, the self-inconsistent, the
inconceivable. Close analogy exists between this meaning
and its mathematical signification.
