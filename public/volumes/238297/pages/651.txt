EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE, EXPLANATION, <kc. 161
only two sensibly translucent metals 1 Why should
sulphur be capable of so many peculiar changes into
amorphous conditions ?
There are whole branches of chemical knowledge which
are as yet mere aggregates of disconnected facts. The
properties of alloys, or mixtures of metals, are often ex-
ceedingly remarkable ; but no laws have yet been detected,
and the usual laws of combining proportions seem to have
no clear application e . Not the slightest explanation can
be given of the wonderful variations of the qualities of
iron, according as it contains more or less carbon and
silicon, nay, even the facts of the case are often involved
in uncertainty. Why, again, should the properties of
steel be remarkably affected by the presence of a little
tungsten. All that was determined by Matthiessen con-
cerning the variation of the conducting powers of copper
according to its purity, was of a purely empirical cha-
racter f. Many animal substances cannot be shown to obey
even the laws of combining proportions. Thus for the
most part chemistry is yet a science occupied with an
exact description of artificial or natural substances, which
by the collection of enormous numbers of exact facts
is preparing the way for an extension of theory at some
future time.
We must not indeed suppose that any science will ever
entirely cease to be empirical. Multitudes of phenomena
have been explained by the undulatory theory of light ;
but there remains an almost undiminished mass of facts
yet to be treated. The natural colours of bodies, and the
rays given off by them when heated, are yet free from all
theory, and yield few empirical coincidences. The theory
of electricity is partially understood, but the conditions
of the production of frictional electricity defy law or ex-
