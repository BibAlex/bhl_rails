156 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
stances under it, or imagine that the name gives us any
knowledge of the obscure origin of life. To name a
substance protoplasm 110 more explains the infinite variety
of forms of life which spring out of the substance, than
does the vital force which may be supposed to reside in
the protoplasm. Both expressions appear to me to be
mere names for an unknown and inexplicable series of
causes which out of apparently similar conditions pro-
duce the most diverse results.
Hardly to be distinguished from descriptive hypotheses
are certain imaginary objects or conditions which we often
frame for the more ready investigation or comprehension
of a subject. The mathematician, in treating abstract
questions of probability, finds it convenient, to represent
the conditions to his own or other minds by a concrete
analogy in the shape of a material ballot-box. The funda-
mental principle of the inverse method of probabilities
upon which depends the whole of our reasoning in in-
ductive investigations is proved by Poisson, who imagines
a number of ballot-boxes, of which the contents are after-
wards supposed to be mixed in one great box (vol. i.
p. 280). Many other such devices are also used by
mathematicians. When Newton investigated the nature
of waves, he employed the pendulum as a convenient
mode of representing the nature of the undulation.
Centres of gravity, oscillation, &c., poles of the magnet,
lines of force, are other imaginary existences solely em-
ployed to assist our thoughts (vol. i. p. 422). All such
creations of the mind may be called Representative Hypo-
theses, and they are only permissible and useful so far as
they embody analogies. Their further consideration pro-
perly belongs either to the subject of Analogy, or to that
of language and representation, founded upon analogy.
