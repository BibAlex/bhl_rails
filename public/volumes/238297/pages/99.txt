DEDUCTIVE REASONING. 73
for in (2) we can substitute its equivalent in (3). We
shall obtain as an intermediate result,
A = ABC,
and from this the complete conclusion
A = ABCD. (4)
The full interpretation is that Iron is iron, metal, good
conductor of electricity, useful for telegraphic purposes,
which is abridged in common language by the ellipsis of
the circumstances which are not of immediate importance.
Instead of all the propositions being of one type, as in
the last example, we may have a series of premises of
various character ; for instance
Common salt is sodium chloride (i)
Sodium chloride crystallizes in a cubical form (2)
What crystallizes in a cubical form does not
possess the power of double refraction ; (3)
it will follow that
Common salt does not possess the power of
double refraction. (4)
Taking our letter-terms thus
A = Common salt,
B = Sodium chloride,
C = Crystallizing in a cubical form,
D = Possessing the power of double refraction,
we may state the premises in the form
A = B, (i)
B = BO, (2)
C = Cd. (3)
Substituting by (2) in (i) and by (3) in (2) we obtain
A = BCd, (4)
which is a more precise version of the common conclusion.
We often meet with a series of propositions describing
the qualities or circumstances of one same thing, and we
may if we like combine them all into one proposition
by the process of substitution. This case is, in fact,
