PHILOSOPHY OF INDUCTIVE INFERENCE. 267
Sir George Airy has also recorded a curious case, in
which he accidentally fell by trial on a new geometrical
property of the sphered Many of the most important and
now trivial propositions in geometry, were probably thus
discovered by the ancient Greek geometers ; and we have
pretty clear evidence of this in the Commentaries of
Proclus/ But discovery in such cases means nothing
more than suggestion, and it is always by pure deduction
that the general law is really established. As Proclus
puts it, we must pass from sense to consideration.
Given, for instance, the series of figures in the accom-
panying diagram, a little examination and measurement
will show that the curv-
ed lines approximate to
semicircles, and the rec-
tilineal figures to right-
angled triangles. These
figures may seem to sug-
gest to the mind the gen-
eral law that angles in-
scribed in semicircles are right angles ; but no number of
instances, and no possible accuracy of measurement would
really establish the truth of that general law. Availing
ourselves of the suggestion furnished by the figures, we
can only investigate deductively the consequences which
flow from the definition of a circle, until we discover
among them the property of containing right angles.
Many persons, after much labour, have thought that they
had discovered a method of trisecting angles by plane
geometrical construction, because a certain complex ar-
rangement of lines and circles had appeared to trisect an
angle in every case tried by them, and they inferred, by a
