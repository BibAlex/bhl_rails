PRINCIPLES OF NUMBER. 175
mathematical science, and it is no wonder that we ever
meet with the traces of those laws from the domain of
which we can never emerge.
The Nature of Number.
^ Number is but another name for diversity. Exact
identity is unity, and with difference arises plurality.
An abstract notion, as was pointed out (p. 33), possesses
a certain oneness. The quality of justice, for instance, is
one and the same in whatever just acts it be manifested.
In justice itself there are no marks of difference by which
to discriminate justice from justice. But one just act can
be discriminated from another just act by many circum-
stances of time and place, and we can count and number
many acts each thus discriminated from every other. In
like manner pure gold is simply pure gold, and is so far
one and the same throughout. But besides its intrinsic
and invariable qualities, gold occupies space and must
have shape or size. Portions of gold are always mutually
exclusive and capable of discrimination, at least in respect
that they must be each without the other. Hence they
may be numbered.
Plurality arises when and only when we detect differ-
ence. For instance, in counting a number of gold coins
I must count each coin once, and not more than once. Let
C denote a coin, and the mark above it the position in
the order of counting. Then I must count the coins
If I were to make them as follows
I should make the third coin into two, and should imply
the existence of difference where there is not difference 1 *.
C'" and C"' are but the names of one coin named twice
