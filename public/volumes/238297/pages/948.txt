458 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
We may lay down the general form of the equations, ex-
pressing the demand and supply for two or three commo-
dities among two or three trading bodies, but all the
functions involved are of so complicated a character that
there is not much fear of scientific method making a
rapid progress in this direction. If such be the prospects
of a comparatively formal science, like Political Economy,
what shall we say of Moral Science \ VAny complete
theory of morals must deal with quantities of pleasure
and pain, as Bentham pointed out, and must sum up the
general tendency of each kind of action upon the good
of the community./ If we are to apply scientific method
to morals, we must have a calculus of moral effects, a
kind of physical astronomy investigating the mutual per-
turbations of individuals. But as astronomers have not
yet fully solved the problem of three gravitating bodies,
when shall we have a solution of the problem of three
moral bodies ?
Now the sciences of political economy and morality are,
comparatively, abstract and general, treating mankind
from simple points of view, and attempting to detect
general grounds of action. They are to social phenomena
what the general sciences of chemistry, heat, and electri-
city, are to the concrete science of meteorology. ' Before
we can investigate the actions of any aggregate of men,
we must have fairly mastered all the more abstract
sciences applying to them, somewhat in the way that
we have acquired a fair comprehension of the simpler
truths of chemistry and physics.) But all our physical
sciences do not enable us to predict the weather two days
hence with any great probability, and the general problem
of meteorology is almost unattempted as yet. What shall
we say then of the general problem of social science, which
shall enable us to predict the course of events in a nation ?
There have indeed been several writers who have pro-
