UNITS AND STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT. 363
and that the dissipation of energy arising out of the fric-
tion of tidal waves, and the radiation of the heat into
space, has slightly decreased the rapidity of the earth's
rotatory motion. The sidereal day is now longer by one
part in 2,700,000, than it was in 720 B.C. Even before
this discovery, it was certain that the invariable rotation
depended upon the perfect maintenance of the earth's
internal heat, which is requisite in order that the earth's
dimensions shall be unaltered. Now the earth being far
superior in temperature to empty space, must cool more
or less rapidly, so that it cannot furnish an absolute
measure of time. Similar objections could be raised to
all other rotating bodies within our cognizance.
The moon's motion round the earth, and the earth's
motion round the sun, form the next best measure of
time. They are subject, indeed, to all kinds of disturb-
ance from other planets, but it is believed that these
must in the course of time run through their rhythmical
courses, and leave the mean distances unaffected, and con-
sequently, by the third Law of Kepler, the periodic times
unchanged. But there is more reason than not to believe
that the earth encounters a certain slight resistance in
passing through space, like that which is so apparent in
Encke's comet. There may also be a certain dissipation
of energy in the electrical relations of the earth to the
sun, possibly identical with that which is manifested in
the retardation of comets *. It is probably an untrue
assumption then, that the earth's orbit remains quite
invariable, and if so our last hope of getting a really
uniform measure of time disappears, and we are reduced
to accepting such as are sufficient for all practical pur-
poses.
