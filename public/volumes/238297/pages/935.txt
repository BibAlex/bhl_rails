RESULTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD. 445
apply that name to the passage through each part of
space of similar average trains of atoms, the particular
successions of atoms being governed only by the theory
of probability, and the law of divergence from a mean
exhibited in the Arithmetical Triangle. Such a universe
would correspond partially to the Lucretian rain of
atoms, and to that nebular hypothesis out of which
Laplace proposed philosophically to explain the evolution
of the planetary system.
According to another extreme supposition, the intense
heat energy of this nebulous mass might have been
mostly radiated away into the unknown regions of outer
space. The attraction of gravity would then have shown
itself between each two particles, and the energy of
motion thence arising would, by incessant conflicts, be
resolved into heat and dissipated.
Inconceivable ages might be required for the com-
pletion of this process, but the dissipation of energy thus
proceeding could end only in the production of a cold
and motionless stone-like universe. The relation of cause
and effect, as we see it manifested in life and growth,
would then degenerate into the constant existence of
every particle in a fixed position relative to every other
particle. Logical and geometrical resemblances would still
exist between atoms, and between groups of atoms crys-
tallized in their appropriate forms for ever more. But
time, the great variable, would bring no variation, and
as to human hopes and troubles, they would have come to
eternal rest.
(Science is not really adequate to proving that such
is the inevitable fate of the universe, for we can seldom
trust our best established theories and most careful in-
ferences far from their data) Nevertheless, the most
probable speculations which we can form as to the history,
especially of our own planetary system, is that it origi-
