(3) That the consequences inferred do agree with facts
of observation.
The First Requisite Possibility of Deductive
Reasoning.
As the truth of an hypothesis is to be proved by its con-
formity with fact, the first condition is that we be able
to apply methods of deductive reasoning, and learn what
should happen according to such an hypothesis. Even if
we could imagine an object acting according to laws
wholly unknown in other parts of nature, it would be
useless to do so, because we could never decide whether it
existed or riot. We can only infer what would happen
under supposed conditions by applying what knowledge
we possess of nature to those conditions. Hence, as Bos-
covich truly said, we are to understand by hypotheses
'not fictions altogether arbitrary, but suppositions con-
formable to experience or analogy/ It follows that every
hypothesis" worthy of consideration must suggest some
likeness, analogy, or common law, acting in two or more
things. If, in order to explain certain facts, a, a', a", &c.,
we invent a cause A, then we must in some degree appeal
to experience as to the mode in which A will act. As the
objects and laws of nature are certainly not known to the
mind intuitively, we must point out some other cause B,
which supplies the requisite notions, and all we do/is .to
invent a fourth term to an analogy. As B is to its effects
Z>, V, I", &c., so is A to its effects a, a', a", &c. When, for
instance, we attempt to explain the passage of light and
heat radiations through space unoccupied by matter, we
imagine the existence of the so-called ether. But if this
ether were wholly different from anything else known to
us, we should in vain try to reason about_iL__Je must
at least apply to it the laws of motion, that is, we must
