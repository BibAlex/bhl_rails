142 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
and we can therefore in a certain sense figure to ourselves
elasticity a thousand or a million times greater than any
which is sensuously known to us. The waves of the ocean
are many times higher than our own bodies ; other waves,
we may observe, are many times less ; continue the pro-
portion, and we may ultimately arrive at waves as small
as those of light. Thus it is that from a sensuous basis
the powers of mind enable us to reason concerning agents
and phenomena different in an unlimited degree. If no
hypothesis then can be absolutely opposed to sense,
accordance with experience must always be a question
of degree.
In order that an hypothesis may allow of satisfactory
comparison with experience, it must possess a certain
defmiteness, and, generally speaking, a certain mathe-
matical exactness allowing of the precise calculation of
results. We must be able to ascertain whether it does
or does not agree with facts.
The theory of vortices, on the contrary, did not present
any mode of calculating the exact relations between the
distances and periods of the planets and satellites ; it
could not, therefore, undergo that rigorous testing to
which/ Newton scrupulously submitted his theory of
gravity before its promulgation. Vagueness and incapa-
bility of precise proof or disproof often enables a false
theory to live ; but with those who love truth, such
vagueness should excite the highest suspicion. The up-
holders of the ancient doctrine of Nature's abhorrence of
a vacuum, had been unable to anticipate the important
fact that water would not rise more than 33 feet in a
common suction pump. Nor when the fact was pointed
out could they explain it, except by introducing a special
alteration of the theory to the effect that Nature's ab-
horrence of a vacuum was limited to 33 feet.
