230 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
there is a margin of error which can only be safely treated
by the principles of probability.
The method which we employ in the theory consists
in calculating the number of all the cases or events
concerning which our knowledge is equal. If we have
even the slightest reason for suspecting that one event
is more likely to occur than another, we should take this
knowledge into account. This being done, we must
determine the whole number of events which are, so far
as we know, equally likely. Thus, if we have no reason
for supposing that a penny will fall more often one way
than another, there are two cases, head and tail, equally
likely. But if from trial or otherwise we know, or think
we know, that of 100 throws 55 will give tail, then the
probability is measured by the ratio of 55 to 100.
The mathematical formulae of the theory are exactly the
same as those of the theory of combinations. In this
latter theory, we determine in how many ways events may
be joined together, and we now proceed to use this know-
ledge in calculating the number of ways in which a certain
event may come about, and thus defining its probability.
If we throw three pennies into the air, what is the proba-
bility that two of them will fall tail uppermost "? This
amounts to asking in how many possible ways can we
select two tails out of three, compared with the whole
number of ways in which the coins can be placed. Now,
the fourth line of the Arithmetical Triangle (p. 208) gives
us the answer. The whole number of ways in which we
can select or leave three things is eight, and the possible
combinations of two things at a time is three ; hence the
probability of two tails is the ratio of three to eight.
From the numbers in the triangle we may draw all the
following probabilities :
One combination gives o tail. Probability ^.
Three combinations give i tail. Probability f .
