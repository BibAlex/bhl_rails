THE LAW OF ERROR. 4G3
always possible, and usually likely, that we overlook
sources of error which a future generation will detect.
Thus the pendulum experiments of Baily and Sabine
were directed to ascertain the nature and amount of a
correction for air resistance, which had been entirely mis-
understood in the experiments upon which was founded
the definition of the standard yard, by means of the
seconds pendulum in the Act of 5th George IV. c. 74.
It has already been mentioned that a considerable error
was discovered in the determination of the standard
metre as the ten-millionth part of the distance from the
pole to the equator (p. 368).
We shall return in the second volume to the further
consideration of the methods by which we may as far as
possible secure ourselves against permanent and undetected
sources of error. In the meantime, having completed the
consideration of the special methods requisite for treating
quantitative phenomena, we must return to our principal
subject, and endeavour to trace out the course by which
the physicist, from observation and experiment, collects
the materials of natural knowledge, and then proceeds
by hypothesis and inverse calculation to educe from them
the laws of nature.
