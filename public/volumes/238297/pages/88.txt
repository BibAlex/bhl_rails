62 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
of the general rule of inference. We have two propo-
sitions, A B and B = 0, and we may for a moment con-
sider the second one as affirming a truth concerning B
while the former one informs us that B is identical with
A ; hence by substitution we may affirm the same truth
of A. It happens in this particular form that the truth
affirmed is identity to 0, and we might, if we had preferred,
have considered the substitution as made by means of the
second identity in the first. Having two identities we
have a choice of the mode in which we will make the
substitution, though the result is exactly the same in
either case.
.Now compare the three following formulae
(1) A = B = C hence A^C
(2) A = B-C hence A-C
(3) A *> B * C, no inference.
In the second formula we have an identity and a differ-
ence, and we are able to infer a difference ; in the third
we have two differences and are unable to make any
inference at all. Because A and C both differ from B, we
cannot tell whether they will or will riot differ from each
other. The flowers and leaves of a plant may both differ
in colour from the earth in which the plant grows, and
yet they may differ from each other ; in other cases the
leaves and stem may both differ from the soil and yet agree
with each other. Where we have difference only we can
make no inference ; where we have identity we can infer.
This fact gives great countenance to my assertion that
inference proceeds always through an identity, but may
be indifferently effected in a difference or an identity.
Deferring a more complete discussion of this point, I
will only mention now that arguments from double
identity occur very frequently, and are usually taken
for granted owing to their extreme simplicity. In the
equivalency of words it must be constantly employed. If
