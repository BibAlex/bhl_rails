88 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
of Thought, which I have called the Law of Duality.
Taking A to represent any class or object or quality, and
B any other class, object or quality, we may always
assert that A either agrees with B, or does not agree.
Thus we may say
A = AB I- Aft.
This is a formula which will henceforth be constantly
employed, and it lies at the basis of reasoning.
The reader may perhaps wish to know why A is inserted
in both alternatives of the second member of the identity,
and why the law is not stated in the form
A=Bf&.
But if he will consider the contents of the last section
(p. 87), he will see that the latter expression cannot be
correct, otherwise no term would have any negative.
For the negative of B -I- & is 5B, or a self-contradictory
term ; so that if A were identical with B | b, its nega-
tive a would be non-existent. This result would generally
be an absurd one, and I see much reason to think that in
a strictly logical point of view it would always be absurd.
In all probability we ought to assume as a fundamental
logical axiom that every term has its negative in thought.
We cannot think at all without separating what we think
about from other different things, and these things neces-
sarily form the negative notion f . If so, it follows that
any term of the form B ! b is just as self-contradictory
as one of the form B&.
It will be convenient to recapitulate in this place the
three great Laws of Thought in their symbolic form, thus
Law of Identity A = A.
Law of Contradiction Aa = o.
Law of Duality A = AB -|- A&-.

Morgan in the 'Athenaeum,' No. 1892, 3oth January, 1864 ; p. 155.
