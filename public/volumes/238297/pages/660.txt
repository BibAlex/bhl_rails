170 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
in 1824. Arago acutely inferred from Gambey's experi-
ment that if the copper were set in rotation while the
needle was stationary the motion would gradually be
communicated to the needle. The phenomenon never-
theless puzzled the whole scientific world, and it required
the deductive genius of Faraday to show that it was a
necessary result of the principles of electro-magnetism k .
By an act of deductive reasoning Faraday anticipated
that a piece of copper rotating between the poles of a
powerful magnet must experience a kind of resistance
which will soon bring it to rest, and this effect he proved
to exist in a decisive experiment 1 .
Many other curious facts might be mentioned which
when once noticed were explained as the effects of well-
known natural laws. It was accidentally discovered that
the navigation of canals of small depth could be greatly
facilitated by increasing the speed of the boats, the resist-
ance being actually reduced by this increase of speed,
which enables the boat to ride as it were upon its own
forced wave. Now mathematical theory might have pre-
dicted this result had the right application of the formulae
occurred to any one m . Giffard's injector for supplying
steam boilers with water by the force of their own steam,
was, I believe, accidentally discovered, but no new prin-
ciples of mechanics are involved in it, so that it might
have been theoretically invented. The same may be said
of the curious experiment in which a stream of air or
steam issuing from a pipe is made to hold a free disc
upon the end of the pipe and thus apparently obstruct
its own free outlet. The possession then of a true theory
does not by any means imply the foreseeing of all the
