hypothesis of one thousand distinct causes f ; but mathe-
maticians have generally proceeded on the hypothesis of
infinity, and then, by some of the beautiful devices of
analysis, have substituted a general law of easy treatment.
In mathematical works upon the subject, it is shown that
the standard Law of Error is expressed in the formula
y=Y<-" \
in which x is the amount of the error, Y the maximum
ordinate of the curve of error, arid c a number constant
for each series of observations, and expressing the general
amount of the tendency to error, but varying between
one series of observations and another, while e is the
peculiar constant, 2*71828 the base of the Naperian
logarithms. To show the close correspondence of this
general law with the special law which might be derived
from the supposition of any moderate number of causes
of error, I have in the accompanying figure drawn a
-3 -I -2
curved line representing accurately the variation of y
when x in the above formula is taken equal to o, ^, i, |, 2,
&c., positive or negative, the arbitrary quantities Y and c
