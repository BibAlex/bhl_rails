the law to be more and more complicated than was pre-
viously supposed.
There is yet another way of explaining the apparent
results of a complicated law. If we take any curve and
regard only a portion of it free from any kind of discon-
tinuity, we may represent the character of such portion
by an equation of the form
y = A + Ex + Cx* + Vx* +
Restrict the attention to a very small portion of the curve,
and the eye will be unable to distinguish its difference
from a straight line, which amounts to saying that in the
portion examined the term C x 2 has no value appreciable
by the eye. Take a larger portion of the curve and it will
be apparent that it possesses curvature, but it will be
possible to draw a parabola or ellipse so that the curve
shall be apparently coincident with a portion of that
parabola or ellipse. In the same way if we take larger
and larger arcs of the curve it will assume the character
successively of a curve of the third and fourth degrees ;
that is to say, it corresponds to equations involving the
third and fourth powers of the variable quantity.
We have arrived then at the conclusion that every phe-
nomenon, when its amount can only be rudely measured,
will either be of fixed amount, or will seem to vary uni-
formly like the distance between two inclined straight
lines. More exact measurement may show the error of
this first assumption, and the variation will then appear
to be like that of the distance between a straight line
and a parabola or ellipse. We may afterwards find that
a curve of the third or higher degrees is really required
to represent the variation. I propose to call the variation
of a quantity linear, elliptic, cubic, quartic, quintic, &c.,
according as it is discovered to involve the first, second,
third, fourth, fifth or higher powers of the variable. It is
a general rule in quantitative investigation that we com-
