CLASSIFIOA T10N. 351
Natural and Artificial Systems of Classification.
It has been usual to distinguish systems of classifica-
tion as natural and artificial, those being called natural
which seemed to express the order of existing things as
determined by nature. Artificial methods of classification,
on the other hand, included those formed for the mere
convenience of men in remembering or treating natural
objects.
The difference, as it is commonly regarded, has been well
described by Ampere 6 , as follows : ' We can distinguish
two kinds of classifications, the natural and the artificial.
In the latter kind, some characters, arbitrarily chosen,
serve to determine the place of each object ; we abstract
all other characters, and the objects are thus found to be
brought near to or to be separated from each other, often
in the most bizarre manner. In natural systems of classi-
fication, on the contrary, we employ concurrently all the
characters essential to the objects with which we are
occupied, discussing the importance of each of them ; and
the results of this labour are not adopted unless the
objects which present the closest analogy are brought
most near together, and the groups of the several orders
which are formed from them are also approximated in pro-
portion as they offer more similar characters. In this way
it arises that there is always a kind of connexion, more or
less marked, between each group and the group which
follows it.'
There is much, however, that is vague and logically
false in this and many other definitions which have been
proposed by naturalists to express their notion of a
natural system. We are not informed how the import-
