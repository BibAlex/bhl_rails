GENERALIZATION. 257
Light and heat are conveyed by it with equal velocity in
all directions, and in all parts of space so far as observa-
tion informs us. But the presence of gravitating matter
modifies the density and mechanical properties of the
so-called ether in a way which is yet quite unexplained.
Leaving gravity, it is somewhat difficult to discover
other laws which are equally true of all matter. Boer-
haave was considered to have established that all bodies
expand by heat, but not only is the expansion very dif-
ferent in different substances, but we now know positive
exceptions. Many liquids and a few solids contract by
heat at certain temperatures. There are indeed other
relations of heat to matter which seem to be universal
and uniform ; thus all substances begin to give off rays of
heat or light at the same temperature, according to the
law of Draper ; and gases will not be an exception if
sufficiently condensed, as in the experiments of Frank-
land. Grove considers it to be universally true that all
bodies in combining produce heat ; all solids, with the
doubtful exception of sulphur and selenium, in becoming
liquid, and all liquids in becoming gases, absorb a certain
quantity of heat ; but the quantities of heat absorbed
vary with the chemical qualities of the matter. On the
other hand, Carnot's Thermodynamic Law is held to be
exactly true of all matter without distinction ; it ex-
presses the fact that the amount of mechanical energy
which might be theoretically obtained from a certain
amount of heat energy depends only upon the tempera-
tures between which a substance is made to change, so
that whether an engine be worked by water, air, alcohol,
ammonia, or any other substance, the result would theo-
retically be the same, if the boiler and condenser were
employed at similar temperatures.
