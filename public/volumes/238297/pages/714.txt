.224 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
to consider by what logical procedure he attains the
truth.
If I have taken a correct view of logical method, there
is really no such thing as a distinct process of induction.
The probability is infinitely small that a collection of
complicated facts will fall into an arrangement capable
of exhibiting directly the laws obeyed by them. The
mathematician might as well expect to integrate his
functions by a ballot-box, as the experimentalist to draw
deep truths from haphazard trials. All induction is but
the inverse application of deduction, and it is by the
inexplicable mental action of a gifted mind that a multi-
tude of heterogeneous facts are caused to range them-
selves in luminous order as the results of some uniformly
acting law. So different, indeed, are the qualities of mind
required in different branches of science that it would
be absurd to attempt to give an exhaustive description
of the character of mind which leads to discovery. The
labours of Newton could not have been accomplished
except by a mind of the utmost mathematical genius ;
Faraday, on the other hand, has made the most extensive
and undoubted additions to human knowledge without
ever passing beyond common arithmetic. I do not re-
member meeting in Faraday's writings with a single
algebraic formula or mathematical problem of any com-
plexity. Professor Clerk Maxwell, indeed, in the preface
to his new ' Treatise on Electricity/ has strongly re-
commended the reading of Faraday's researches by ah 1
students of science, and has given his opinion that though
Faraday seldom or never employed mathematical formulae,
his methods and conceptions were not the less mathe-
matical in their nature k. I have myself protested against
the prevailing confusion between a mathematical and an
