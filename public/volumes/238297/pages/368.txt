A like peculiarity in the motions of Jupiter's fourth satel-
lite was similarly detected by Maraldi in 1713.
Remarkable conjunctions of the planets may sometimes
allow us to compare their periods of revolution, through
long intervals of time, with great accuracy. Laplace in
explaining the long inequality in the motions of Jupiter
and Saturn, was much assisted by a conjunction of these
planets, observed by Ibyn Jounis at Cairo, towards the
close of the eleventh century. Laplace calculated that
such a conjunction must have happened on the 3ist of
October, A. D. 1087 ; and the discordance between the dis-
tances of the planets as recorded, and as assigned by
theory, was less than one-fifth of the apparent diameter
of the sun. This difference being less than the probable
error of the early record, his theory was confirmed as far
as facts were available 13 .
The ancient astronomers often shewed the highest in-
genuity in turning any opportunities of measurement
which occurred to good account. Eratosthenes, as early
as 250 B.C., happening to hear that the sun at Syene, in
Upper Egypt, was visible at the summer solstice at the
bottom of a well, proving that it was in the zenith, pro-
posed to determine the dimensions of the earth, by mea-
suring the length of the shadow of a rod at Alexandria on
the same day of the year. He thus learnt in a rude
manner the difference of latitude between Alexandria and
Syene, and finding it to be about one fiftieth part of the
whole circumference, he ascertained the dimensions of the
earth within about one sixth part of the truth. The use
of wells in astronomical observation appears to have been
occasionally practised in comparatively recent times, as
by Flamsteed in 1679. Hipparchus employed the moon
as an instrument of measurement in several sagacious
