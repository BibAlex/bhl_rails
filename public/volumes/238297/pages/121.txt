CHAPTEE VI.
THE INDIRECT METHOD OF INFERENCE.
THE forms of deductive reasoning as yet considered, are
mostly cases of Direct Deduction as distinguished from
those which we are now about to treat. The method of
Indirect Deduction may be described as that which points
out what a thing is, by showing that it cannot be anything
else. We can define a certain space upon a map, either by
colouring that space, or by colouring all except the space ;
the first mode is positive, the second negative. The dif-
ference, it will be readily seen, is exactly analogous to that
between the direct and indirect proof in geometry. Euclid
often shows that two lines are equal, by showing that they
cannot be unequal, and the proof rests upon the known num-
ber of alternatives, greater, equal or less, which are alone
conceivable. In other cases, as for instance in the seventh
proposition of the first book, he shows that two lines must
meet in a particular point, by showing that they cannot
meet elsewhere.
In logic we can always define with certainty the utmost
number of alternatives which are conceivable. The Law
of Duality (pp. 6, 88) enables us always to assert that any
quality or circumstance whatsoever is either present or
absent in anything. Whatever may be the meaning and
nature of the terms A and B it is certainly true that
A = AB | A6
B = AB | aB.
These are universal though tacit premises which may
be employed in the solution of every problem, and which
