322 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
or moon, according as it is high in the heavens or near
the horizon, should be sufficient to make us cautious in
accepting the plainest indications of our senses, unassisted
by instrumental measurement. As to statements concern-
ing the height of the aurora and the distance of meteors,
they are to be utterly distrusted. When Captain Parry
says that a ray of the aurora shot suddenly downwards
between him and the land which was only 3000 yards dis-
tant, we must consider him subject to an error of sense 1 .
It is true that errors of observation are more usually
errors of judgment than of sense. That which is actually
seen must be truly seen so far ; and if we correctly
interpret the meaning of the phenomenon, there would
be no error at all. But the weakness of the bare senses
as measuring instruments, arises from the fact that they
import varying conditions of unknown amount, and we
cannot make the requisite corrections and allowances as in
the case of a solid and invariable instrument.
Bacon has excellently stated the insufficiency of the
senses for estimating the magnitudes of objects, or de-
tecting the degrees in which phenomena present them-
selves. ' Things escape the senses/ he says m , 'because the
object is not sufficient in quantity to strike the sense : as
all minute bodies ; because the percussion of the object is
too great to be endured by the senses : as the form of the
sun when looking directly at it in mid-day ; because the
time is not proportionate to actuate the sense : as the
motion of a bullet in the air, or the quick circular motion
of a firebrand, which are too fast, or the hour-hand of
a common clock, which is too slow ; from the distance
of the object as to place: as the size of the celestial
bodies, and the size and nature of all distant bodies ;
