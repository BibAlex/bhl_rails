degrees, or other differences, we render the terms so far
concrete. In that they are merely red there is but a
single nature in red objects, and so far as things are
merely coloured, colour is a single indivisible quality.
Eedness, so far as it is redness merely, is one and the
same everywhere, and possesses absolute oneness or unity.
In virtue of this unity we acquire the power of treating
all instances of such quality as we may treat any one.
We possess, in short, general knowledge.
Substantial Terms.
Logicians appear to have taken very little notice of a
large class of terms which partake in certain respects of
the character of abstract terms and yet are undoubtedly
the names of concrete existing things. These terms are
the names of substances, such as gold, carbonate of lime,
nitrogen, &c. We cannot speak of two golds, twenty
carbonates of lime, or a hundred nitrogens. There is no
such distinction between the parts of a uniform sub-
stance as will allow of a discrimination of numerous
individuals. The qualities of colour, lustre, malleability,
density, &c., by which we recognise gold, extend through
its substance irrespective of particular size or shape. So
far as a substance is gold, it is one and the same every-
where ; so that terms of this kind, which I propose to call
substantial terms, possess the peculiar unity of abstract
terms. Yet they are not abstract ; for gold is of course
a tangible visible body, entirely concrete, and existing
physically independent of other bodies.
It is only when we break up, by actual mechanical
division, the uniform whole which forms the meaning of
a substantial term, that we introduce the notion of
number. Piece of gold is a term capable of plurality ;
for there may be an endless variety of pieces discriminated
