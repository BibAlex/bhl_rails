ANALOGY. 289
No two "sciences might seem at first sight more
entirely discrete and divergent in their subject matter
than geometry and arithmetic, or algebra. The first deals
with circles, squares, parallelograms, and various other
forms in space ; the latter with mere symbols of number,
the symbols having form indeed, but bearing a meaning
independent of shape or size. Prior to the time of Des-
cartes, too, the sciences actually were developed in a slow
and painful manner in almost entire independence of each
other. The Greek philosophers indeed could not avoid
noticing occasional analogies, as when Plato in the
Thaeetetus describes a square number as equally equal,
and a number produced by multiplying two unequal
factors as oblong. Euclid, in the jih and 8th books of
his Elements, continually uses expressions displaying a
consciousness of the same analogies, as when he calls a
number of two factors a plane number, eV/Tre^o? apti^s,
and distinguishes a square number of which the two
factors are equal as an equal-sided or plane number,

of a cubic number its' side, Tr\evpa. In the Diophantine
algebra many problems of a geometrical character were
solved by algebraic or numerical processes ; but there
was no general system, so that the solutions were of an
isolated character. In general the ancients were far more
advanced in geometric than symbolic methods ; thus
Euclid in his 4th book gives us the means of dividing
a circle by purely geometric or mechanical means into 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30 parts, but he- was
totally unacquainted with the theory of the roots of unity
exactly corresponding to this division of the circle.
During the middle ages, on the other hand, algebra ad-
vanced beyond geometry, and modes of solving equations
were painfully discovered by those who had no notion
that at every step they were implicitly solving important
