and we imply at the same time that the other four con-
ceivable combinations containing B, C, or D, namely
ABCD, A&CD, AbCd, and AfoD, do not exist in nature.
The bifurcate form of classification seems to be needless
when the property according to which we classify any
group of things admits of numerical discrimination. It
would seem absurd to arrange things according as they
have one degree of the property or not one degree, two
degrees or not two degrees, and so on. The elements, for
instance, are classified according as the atom of each satu-
rates, one, two, three or more atoms of a monad element,
such as chlorine, and they are called accordingly Monad,
Dyad, Triad, Tetrad elements, and so on. It would be
wholly useless to apply the bifid arrangement, thus :
Element
i
Monad not-Monad
Dyad not-Dyad
Triad not-Triad
Tetrad not-Tetrad.
The reason of this is that, by the very nature of number
as described in Chapter VIII, every number is logically
discriminated from every other number. There can thus
be no logical confusion in a numerical arrangement, and
the series of numbers indefinitely extended is also exhaus-
tive. Every thing admitting of a property expressible in
numbers must find its place somewhere in the series of
numbers. The chords in music correspond to the various
simpler numerical ratios and must admit of complete
