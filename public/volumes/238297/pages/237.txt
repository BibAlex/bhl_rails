7. It follows that the sum of the numbers in any one
line is equal to the sum of those in all the preceding lines
diminished by a unit. For the sum of the ^th line is, as
already shewn, 2 n-1 , and the sum of the first n i lines
is 2 n ~ l i, or less by a unit.
This enumeration of the properties of the figurate
numbers does not approach completeness ; a considerable,
perhaps an unlimited, number of less simple and obvious
relations might be traced out. Pascal, after giving many
of the properties, exclaims l : ' Mais j'en laisse bien plus
que je n ; en donne ; c'est une chose etrange combien il est
fertile en proprietes ! Chacun peut s'y exercer/ The
arithmetical triangle may be considered a natural classifi-
cation of numbers, exhibiting, in the most complete
manner, their evolution and relations in a certain point
of view. It is obvious that in an unlimited extension of
the triangle, each number will have at least two places.
Though the properties above explained are highly
curious, the greatest value of the triangle arises from the
fact that it contains a complete statement of the values
of the formula (p. 206), for the number of combinations
of m things out of n, for all possible values of m and n,
Out of seven things one may be chosen in seven ways,
and seven occurs in the eighth line of the second column.
The combinations of two things chosen out of seven
are ^ - or 21, which is the third number in the eighth
line. The combinations of three things out of seven are
D or 35, which appears fourth in the eighth line.

In a similar manner, in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth
columns of the eighth line I find it stated in how many
ways I can select combinations of 4, 5, 6, and 7 things
out of 7. Proceeding to the ninth line, I find in succession
