separately for each apparatus by suitable experiments.
Thus Smeaton, in his admirable but now almost forgotten
researches concerning water-wheels, eliminated friction in
the most simple manner by determining by trial what
weight, acting by a cord and roller upon his model water-
wheel, would make it turn without water as rapidly as
the water made it turn. In short, he ascertained what
weight concurring with the water would exactly com-
pensate for the friction 8 . In Dr. Joule's experiments to
determine the mechanical equivalent of heat by the con-
densation of air, a considerable amount of heat was pro-
duced by friction of the condensing pump, and a small
portion by stirring the water employed to measure the
heat. This heat of friction was ascertained by simply
repeating the experiment in an exactly similar manner
except that no condensation was effected, and observing
the change of temperature then produced*.
We may describe as test experiments any in which we
perform operations not intended to give the quantity of
the principal phenomenon, but some quantity which would
otherwise remain as an error in the result. Thus in
astronomical observations almost every source of error
may be avoided by increasing the number of observations
and distributing them in such a manner as to produce
in the final mean as much error in one way as in the
other. But there is one source of error, first discovered
by Maskelyne, which cannot be avoided, because it affects
all observations in the same direction and to the same
average amount, namely the Personal Error of the ob-
server or the inclination to record the passage of a star
across the wires of the telescope a little too soon or a
little too late. This personal error was first described in
