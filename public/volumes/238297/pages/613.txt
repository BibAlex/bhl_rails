culus of differences a correct empirical formula ; for if p
be the first term of the series of values, and &p, & 2 p,
A 3 J>, &c., be the first number in each column of dif-
ferences, then the mth term of the series of values will be

A closely equivalent but more practicable formula for
interpolation by differences, as devised by Lagrange, will
be found in Thomson and Tait's ' Elements of Natural
Philosophy/ p. 115.
If 110 column of differences shows any tendency to
become zero throughout, it is an indication that the law
is of a more complicated, for instance of an exponential,
character, so that it cannot be correctly represented in
a formula involving only a few powers of the variable.
Dr. J. Hopkinson has lately suggested another method of
arithmetical interpolation % which is intended to avoid
much that is arbitrary in the graphical method. His
process will yield the same results in all hands, but he
remarks that it has no theoretical basis to rest on.
So far as we can infer the results likely to be obtained
by variations beyond the limits of experiment, we must
proceed upon the same principles. If possible we must
detect the exact laws in action, and then trust to them as
a guide when we have no experience. If not, an empirical
formula of exactly the same character as those employed
in interpolation is our only resource. But the reader must
carefully observe that to extend our inference far beyond
the limits of experience is exceedingly unsafe. Our know-
ledge is at the best only approximate, and takes no account
of very small tendencies. Now it may, arid in fact usually
will, happen, that tendencies small within our limits of
