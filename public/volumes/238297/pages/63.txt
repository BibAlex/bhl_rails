TERMS. 37
S = of specific gravity 10*5,
T = melting above ioooC,
V = good conductor of heat and electricity,
then we can form a combined term PQRSTV, which will
denote 'a white monovalent metal, of specific gravity
10*5, melting above ioooC, and a good conductor of heat
and electricity/
There are many grammatical rules or usages concerning
the junction of words and phrases to which we need pay
no attention in logic. We can never say in ordinary
language * of wood table/ meaning ' a table of wood/
but we may consider 'of wood' as logically an exact
equivalent of * wooden ' ; so that if
X = of wood,
Y = table,
there is no reason why, in our symbols, XY should not be
the correct term for ' table of wood/ In this case indeed
we might substitute the corresponding adjective 'wooden/
but we should often fail to find any adjective answering
exactly to a phrase. There is no single word which could
express the notion * of specific gravity 10*5 ' : but logically
we may consider these words as forming an adjective ; and
denoting this by S and metal by P, we may say that SP
means 'metal of specific gravity 10*5.' It is one of many
advantages in these blank letter-symbols that they enable
us completely to abstract all grammatical peculiarities and
fix our attention solely on the purely logical relations
involved. Investigation will probably show that the rules
of grammar are mainly founded upon traditional usage
and have little logical signification. This indeed is suffi-
ciently proved by the wide grammatical differences which
exist between languages where the logical foundation must
be the same.
