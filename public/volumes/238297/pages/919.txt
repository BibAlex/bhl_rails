RESULTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD. 429
To enter actually upon theological discussions would be
evidently beyond the scope of this work. It is with the
scientific method common to all the sciences, and not with
any of the separate sciences, that we are concerned.
Theology therefore would be at least as much beyond
my scope as chemistry or geology. But I believe that
grave misapprehensions exist as regards the very nature
of this scientific method. There are scientific men who
assert that the interposition of Providence is impossible,
and prayer an absurdity, because the laws of nature are
inductively proved to be invariable. Inferences are drawn
not so much from particular sciences as from the logical
foundations of science itself, to negative the impulses and
hopes of men. Now I may properly venture to state
that my own studies in logic lead me to call in question"
all such negative inferences. Those so-called laws of
nature are uniformities observed te^exist in the action
of certain material agents, but it is logically impossible
to show that all other agents must behave as these do. /
The too exclusive study of particular branches of physical
science seems in some cases to generate an over confident
and dogmatic spirit. Rejoicing in the success with which
a few groups of facts are brought beneath the apparent
sway of laws, the investigator hastily assumes that he is
close upon the ultimate springs of being. A particle of
gelatinous matter is found to obey the ordinary laws of
chemistry ; yet it moves and lives. The world is therefore
asked to believe that chemistry can resolve the mysteries
of existence.
The Meaning of Natural Law.
Pindar speaks of Law as the Euler of the Mortals and
the Immortals, and it seems to be commonly supposed
that the so-called Laws of Nature, in like manner, rule
