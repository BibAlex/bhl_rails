380 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
genus, for we cannot frame the requisite notion of a class
forming it without implying the existence of another class
discriminated from it, but which with the supposed
summum genus will form the species of a still higher genus,
which is absurd.
Although there is no absolute summum genus, neverthe-
less relatively to any branch of knowledge or any special
argument, there is always some class or notion which
bounds our horizon as it were. The chemist restricts his
view to material substances and the forces manifested in
them ; the mathematician extends his view so as to com-
prehend all notions capable of numerical discrimination.
The biologist, on the other hand, has a narrower sphere
containing only organized bodies, and of these the botanist
and the zoologist take parts. In other subjects there
may be a still narrower summum genus, as when the lawyer
regards only living and reasoning beings of his own
country.
In the description of the Logical Abecedarium, it was
pointed out (vol. i. p. 108) that every series of com-
binations was really the development of some one single
class, denoted by X, which letter indeed was accord-
ingly placed in the first column of the table on p. 109.
This is the formal acknowledgment of the principle
clearly stated by De Morgan, that all reasoning pro-
ceeds within some assumed summum genus. But at
the same time the fact that X as a logical term must
have its negative x, shows that it cannot be an absolute
summum -genus.
There arises, again, the question whether there be any
such thing as an infima species, which cannot be divided
into any smaller species. The ancient logicians were of
opinion that there always was some assignable class which
could only be divided into individuals, but this doctrine
appears to me theoretically incorrect, as Mr. George
