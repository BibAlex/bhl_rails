THE LOGICAL MACHINE.

hand side, or as it used to be called the predicate of the
proposition, the letter keys on the right-hand side of the
keyboard are the proper representatives. The five other
keys may be called operation keys, to distinguish them
from the letter or term keys. They stand for the stops,
copula, and disjunctive conjunctions of a proposition. The
middle key of all is the copula, to be pressed when the
verb is or the sign = is met. The extreme right-hand
key is called the Full Stop, because it should be pressed
when a proposition is completed, in fact in the proper
place of the full stop. The extreme left-hand key is
used to terminate an argument or to restore the machine
to its initial condition ; it is called the Finis key. The
last key but one on the right and left complete the
whole series, and represent the conjunction or in its un-
exclusive meaning, or the sign -|- which I have employed,
according as it occurs in the right or left hand side
of the proposition. The whole keyboard is arranged
as shown below

To work the machine it is only requisite to press the
keys in succession as indicated by the letters and signs
of a symbolical proposition. All the premises of an ar-
gument are supposed to be reduced to the simple notation
which has been employed in the previous pages. Taking
then such a simple proposition as
A = AB,
we press the keys A (subject), copula, A (predicate),
B (predicate), and full stop.
