in a succession of predictions grounded on the theory of
gravitation as to the inequalities of the planetary move-
ments caused by mutual perturbations. These inequalities
are so numerous, so small, and so complicated in character,
that it would be an almost hopeless task to attempt to
discover them empirically or tentatively by the compari-
son and classification of observations. But theory pretty
easily indicates the period and general nature of the
inequality to be detected, and by elaborate calculations
even the amount of the effect may be assigned. Thus
the inequality arising from the attraction of Venus and
the earth was estimated by Sir George Airy to amount to
no more than a few seconds at its maximum, while the
period is no less than 240 years. Nevertheless, the in-
direct effects of this inequality upon the moon's motion
are considerable, and are entirely verified in the lunar
theory. Although prediction by theory is the general
rule in physical astronomy, yet the empirical investiga-
tion of divergences from theory sometimes discloses effects
which had been overlooked, or points out residual effects
of unknown origin.
Quantities determined ~by Theory and not verified.
It will continually happen that we are able, from
certain measured phenomena and a correct theory, to
determine the amount of some other phenomenon which
we may either be unable to measure at all, or to measure
with an accuracy corresponding to that required to verify
the prediction. Thus Laplace having worked out an
almost complete theory of the motions of Jupiter's satel-
lites on the hypothesis of gravitation, found that these
motions were greatly affected by the spheroidal form of
Jupiter. Hence from the motions of the satellites, which
can be observed with great accuracy owing to the frequent
