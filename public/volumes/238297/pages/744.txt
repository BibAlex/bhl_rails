254 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
rally to depend upon the molecule ; thus, the power of
certain substances to cause the plane of polarization of a
ray of light to rotate, is exactly the same whatever be its
degree of density, or the diluteness of the solution in
which it is contained. Taken as a whole, the physical
properties of substances and their quantitative laws, pre-
sent a problem of infinite complexity, and centuries must
elapse before any moderately complete generalizations on
the subject become possible.
Uniform Properties of all Matter.
Some laws are held to be true of all matter in the
universe absolutely, without exception, no instance to the
contrary having ever been noticed. This is the case with
the laws of motion, as. laid down by Galileo and Newton.
It is also conspicuously true of the law of universal
gravitation. The rise of modern physical science may
perhaps be considered as beginning at the time when
Galileo showed, in opposition to the Aristotelians, that
matter is equally affected by gravity, irrespective of its
form, magnitude, or texture. - All objects fall with equal
rapidity, when disturbing causes, such as the resistance of
the air, are removed or allowed for. That which was
rudely demonstrated by Galileo from the leaning tower of
Pisa, was proved by Newton to a high degree of approxi-
mation, in an experiment which has already been referred
to (vol. ii. p. 55).
Newton formed two pendulums of as nearly as possible
similar outward shape, by taking two equal round wooden
boxes, and suspending them by equal threads, eleven
feet long. The motion of each pendulum was therefore
equally subject to the resistance of the air. He filled one
box with wood, and in the centre of oscillation of the
