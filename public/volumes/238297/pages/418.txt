392 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
which are called errors in one case, may really be most
important and interesting phenomena in another inves-
tigation. When we speak of eliminating error we really
mean disentangling the complicated phenomena of nature.
The physicist rightly wishes to treat one thing at a time,
but as this object can seldom be rigorously carried into
practice, he has to seek some mode of counteracting the
tendency to error.
The general principle of the subject is that a single
observation can render known only a single quantity.
Hence if several different quantitative effects are known
to enter into any investigation, we must have at least
as many distinct results of observation as there are
quantities to be determined. Every complete experiment
will therefore consist in general of several operations.
Guided if possible by previous knowledge of the causes
in action, we must arrange these determinations, so that
by a simple mathematical process we may distinguish the
separate quantities. There appear to be five principal
methods in which we may accomplish this object ; these
methods are specified below and illustrated in the suc-
ceeding sections.
(1) The Method of Avoidance. The physicist may seek
for some special mode of experiment or opportunity of
observation, in which the error is non-existent or inap-
preciable.
(2) The Differential Method. He may find opportunities
of observation when all interfering phenomena remain
constant, and only the subject of observation is at one time
present and another time absent ; the difference between
two exact observations then gives its amount.
(3) The Method of Correction. He may endeavour to
estimate the amount of the interfering force by the best
available mode, and then make a corresponding correction
in the results of observation.
