must integrate or sum the effects of that law ; and to
obtain the space passed over by the body in any given
time, we must again integrate with regard to the variable
velocity.
In periodic variations the same distinction must be
drawn. The heating power of the sun's rays at any place
on the earth varies every day with the height attained,
and is greatest about noon ; but it does not follow that
the temperature of the air is greatest at the same time.
This temperature is an integrated effect of the sun's heat-
ing power, and as long as the sun is able to give more
heat to the air than the air loses in any other way, the
temperature continues to rise, so that the maximum is
deferred until about 3 P.M. Similarly the hottest day of
the year falls, on an average, about one month later than
the summer solstice, and all the seasons lag about a month
behind the motions of the sun. In the case of the tides,
too, the effect of the sun's or moon's attractive power is
never greatest when the power is greatest ; the effect
always lags more or less behind the cause. Yet the in-
tervals between the successive tides are exactly equal, in
the absence of disturbance, to the intervals between the
passage of the sun or moon across the meridian. Thus
the principle of forced vibrations holds true of all such
cases.
In periodic phenomena, however, very curious results
will sometimes follow from the integration of effects. If
we strike a pendulum, and then repeat the stroke time
after time when it is in the same part of the vibration,
every stroke concurs with every other one in adding to
the momentum, and we can thus increase the extent and
violence of the vibrations to any degree. We can stop
the pendulum again by strokes applied when it is moving
in the opposite direction, and the successive effects being
added together will soon bring it to rest. Now if we
