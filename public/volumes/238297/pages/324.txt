pened increased ~by one, by the same number increased by
one and the number of times it is to happen.
An event having happened m times without fail, the
probability that it will happen n more times is ^i
m + n+i
Thus the probability that three new planets would obey
Bode's law is ff , but it must be allowed that this, as well
as the previous result, would be much weakened by the
fact that Neptune can barely be said to obey the law.
3. An event having happened and failed a certain
number of times, to find the probability that it will happen
the next time, divide the number of times the event has
happened increased by one, by the whole number of times
the event has happened or failed increased by two.
Thus, if an event has happened m times and failed n times,
the probability that it will happen on the next occasion
8 in + n+2
Thus, if we assume that of the elements yet discovered
50 are metallic and 14 non-metallic, then the proba-
bility that the next element discovered will be metallic
Again since of 37 metals which have been sufficiently
examined only four, namely, sodium, potassium, lan-
thanum and lithium, are of less density than water, the
probability that the next metal examined or discovered
will be less dense than water is - or -
37 + 2 39.
We may state the results of the method in a more
general manner thus, If under given circumstances cer-
tain events A, B, C, &c., have happened respectively m, n,
p, &c., times, and one or other of these events must
happen, then the probabilities of these events are propor-
tional to m + i, n+ i, p+ i, &c. ; so that the probability
of A will be - But if new events
m + i + n + 1 + jp + 1 + &c.
