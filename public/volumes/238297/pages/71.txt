PROPOSITIONS. 45
the exact likeness of the substance in several qualities to
other pieces of substance which are undoubtedly of gold.
I must make a judgment of the colour, the specific
gravity, the hardness, sound, and chemical properties ;
and each of these judgments might be expressed in an
elementary proposition, 'the colour of this coin is the
colour of gold/ and so on. Even when we establish
the identity of a thing with itself under a different
name or aspect, it is by distinct judgments concerning
r single circumstances. To prove that the Homeric xa\K6g
is copper we must show the identity of each quality
recorded of x a ^ K v with a quality of copper. To establish
Deal as the landing-place of Caesar, every circumstance
must be shown to agree. If the modern Wroxeter is
the ancient Uriconium, there must be the like agreement
of all features of the country not subject to alteration by
time.
All such identities may be expressed in the form A = B.
We may say
Colour of Pacific Ocean = Colour of Atlantic Ocean.
Smell of rotten egg = Smell of hydrogen sulphide.
In these and similar propositions we assert identity of
single qualities or sensations. But in the same form
we may express identity of any group of qualities, as in
^aA/co'? = Copper.
Deal = Landing-place of Caesar.
A multitude of propositions involving singular terms fall
into the same form, as in
The Pole star = The slowest-moving star.
Jupiter = The greatest of the planets.
The ringed planet = The planet having seven satel-
lites.
The Queen of England = The Queen of India.
The number two = The even prime number.
Honesty = The best policy.
