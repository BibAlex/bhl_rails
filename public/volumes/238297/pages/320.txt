second, and third hypotheses are respectively

The inductive part of the problem is now completed, since
we have found that the urn most likely contains three
white and one black ball, and have assigned the exact
probability of each possible supposition. But we are now
in a position to resume deductive reasoning, and infer the
probability that the next drawing will yield, say a white
ball. For if the box contains three white and one black
ball, the probability of drawing a white one is certainly f ;
and as the probability of the box being so constituted is
f^, the compound probability that the box will be so filled
and will give a white ball at the next trial, is
27 3 81
-L x 2. or -
46 4 184
Again, the probability is 44 that the box contains two
white and two black, and under those conditions the
probability is \ that a white ball will appear ; hence the
probability that a white ball will appear in consequence
of that condition, is
16 i 32
x -- or -~,
46 2 184
From the third supposition we get in like manner the
probability
- or

Now since one and not more than one hypothesis can be
true, we may add together these separate probabilities,
and we find that
or
_

is the complete probability that a white ball will be next
drawn under- the conditions and data supposed.
