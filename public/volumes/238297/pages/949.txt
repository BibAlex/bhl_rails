RESULTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD. 459

The late Mr. Buckle undertook to write the ' History of
Civilisation in England/ and showed how the character
of a nation could be explained by the nature of the
climate and the fertility of the soil. He omitted to
/
explain the contrast between the ancient Greek nation

some more complex causes must be imagined to have
come into operation. Auguste Comte detected some very
fundamental and simple laws of development through
which nations pass. (There are always three phases of

progress to concrete cases, Comte was enabled to predict
that in the hierarchy of European nations, Spain would
necessarily hold the highest place. Such are the paro-
dies of science offered to us by the so-called positive
philosophers.
\^A science of history in the true sense of the term is
an absurd notion.) A nation is not a mere sum of in-
dividuals whom we can treat by the method of averages ;
it is an organic whole, held together by ties of infinite
complexity. Each individual acts and re-acts upon his
own smaller or greater circle of friends, and those who

nations sway the whole body, even when they are least
aware of it. From time to time arise critical positions,
battles, delicate negotiations, internal disturbances, in
which the slightest incidents may profoundly change
the course of history. A rainy day may hinder a forced
march, and change the course of a campaign ; a few in-
