EXPERIMENT. 43
duction of sounds, evidently because their vacuum was not
sufficiently perfect 11 . Otto von Guericke fell into- a like
mistake in the use of his newly-constructed air-pump,
doubtless from the unsuspected presence of air sufficiently
dense to convey the sound of the bell 1 .
It is hardly requisite to point out that the doctrine of
spontaneous generation is due to the unsuspected presence
of germs, even after the most careful efforts to exclude
them k , and in the case of many diseases, both of animals
arid plants, germs which we have no means as yet of de-
tecting and examining, are doubtless the active cause. It
has long been a subject of dispute, again, whether the
plants which spring up from newly turned land grow
from seeds long buried in that land, or from seeds brought
by the wind. Argument is unphilosophical when direct
trial can readily be applied ; for by turning up some old
ground, and covering a portion of it with a glass case, the
conveyance of seeds by the wind can be entirely prevented,
and if the same plants appear within and without the
case, it will become clear that the seeds are in the earth.
By gross oversight some experimenters have thought
before now that crops of rye had sprung up where oats
had been sown 1 .
Blind or Test Experiments.
Every correct and conclusive experiment necessarily
consists in the comparison of results between two different
combinations of circumstances. To give a fair probability
