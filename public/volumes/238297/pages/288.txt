262 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
association, or any rude process of inference, infer the
future directly from the past, it is the work of logic to
analyse the conditions on which the correctness of this
inference depends. Even Mr. Mill would admit that such
analysis involves the consideration of general truths 11 , and
in this, as in several other important points, we might
controvert Mr. Mill's own views by his own statements.
On the Grounds of Inductive Inference.
I hold that, in all cases of inductive inference, we must
invent hypotheses, until we fall upon some hypothesis
which yields deductive results in accordance with experi-
ence. Such accordance renders the chosen hypothesis
more or less probable, and we may then deduce, with some
degree of likelihood, the nature of our future experience, on
the assumption that no arbitrary change takes place in
the conditions of nature. We can o.nly .argue from the
past to the future, on the general principle set forth in the
commencement of this work, that what is true of a thing
will be true of the like. So far then as one object or
event differs from another, all inference is impossible ;
particulars as particulars can no more make an inference
than grains of sand can make a rope. We must always
rise to something which is general or same in the cases,
and assuming that sameness to be extended to new cases
we learn their nature. Hearing a clock tick five thousand
times without exception or variation, we adopt the very
probable hypothesis that there is some invariably acting
machine which produces those uniform sounds, and which
will, in the absence of change, go on producing them.
Meeting twenty times with a bright yellow ductile sub-
stance, and finding it to be always very heavy and in-
corrodible, I infer that there was some natural condition,
