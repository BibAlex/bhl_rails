INTRODUCTION.
SCIENCE arises from the discovery of Identity amid
Diversity. The process may be described in many dif-

between two objects. It is doubtful whether an entirely
isolated phenomenon could present itself to our notice,
since there must always be a contrast between object
and object to awaken our consciousness. But in any
case an isolated phenomenon could be studied to no
useful purpose. The whole value of science consists in
the power which it confers upon us of applying to one
object the knowledge acquired from like objects ; and it
is only so far, therefore, as we can discover and register
resemblances or differences that we can turn our obser-

Nature is a spectacle continually exhibited to our
senses, in which phenomena are mingled in combina-
