CHAPTER XX.
METHOD OF VARIATIONS.
EXPERIMENTS may be of two kinds : experiments of
simple fact, and experiments of quantity. In. the first
class of experiments we combine certain conditions, and
wish to ascertain whether or not a certain effect of any
quantity exists. Thus Hooke, as before described, wished
to ascertain whether or not there was any difference in the
force of gravity at the top and bottom of St. Paul's Cathe-
dral. The chemist continually performs analyses for the
purpose of ascertaining whether or not a given element
exists in a particular mineral or mixture ; all such experi-
ments and analyses are qualitative rather than quantita-
tive, because though the result may be more or less, and is
necessarily quantitative, the particular amount of the result
is not the immediate object of the enquiry.
So soon, however, as a result is known to be dis-
coverable, the scientific man ought to proceed to the
strictly quantitative enquiry, how great a result follows
from a certain amount of the conditions which are sup-
posed to constitute the aggregate cause 1 The possible
numbers of experiments are now indefinitely great, for
every variation in a necessary condition will usually pro-
duce a variation in the amount of the effect. The method
of variation which thus arises is no narrow or special
method, but it is the general application of experiment to
phenomena capable of continuous quantity. As Professor
