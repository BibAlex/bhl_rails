12 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
staff, string, or other kind of measure may be employed
to represent the length of one object, and according as it
agrees or not with the other, so must the two objects
agree or differ. In this case the proxy or sample repre-
sents length ; but the fact that lengths can be added and
multiplied renders it unnecessary that the proxy should
always be as large as the object. Any standard of con-
venient length, such as a common foot-rule, may be made
the medium of comparison. The height of a church in
one town may be carried to that in another, and objects
existing immoveably at opposite sides of the earth may be
vicariously measured against each other. We obviously
employ the rule that whatever is true of a thing as
regards its length, is true of its equal.
To every other simple phenomenon in nature the same
principle of substitution is applicable. We may compare
weights or densities or degrees of hardness, and all other
qualities, in like manner. To ascertain whether two
sounds are in unison we need not compare them directly,
but a third sound may be the go-between. If a tuning-
fork is in unison with the middle C of York Minster
organ, and we afterwards find it to be in unison with the
same note of the organ in Westminster Abbey, then it
follows that the two organs are tuned in unison. The
rule of inference now is that what is true, as regards
pitch, of the tuning-fork, is true of any sound in unison
with it.
The skilful employment of this substitutive process
enables us to make measurements beyond the powers of
our senses. No one can count the vibrations, for instance,
of an organ pipe. But we can construct an instrument
called the syren, so that while producing a sound of any
pitch it shall register the number of vibrations consti-
tuting the sound. Adjusting the sound of the syren in
unison, with an organ pipe, we measure indirectly the
