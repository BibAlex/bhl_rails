144 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
rays. Such an hypothesis then is inconsistent with the
main body of our knowledge concerning gases.
Provided that there be no clear and absolute conflict
with known laws of nature, there is nothing so im-
probable or apparently inconceivable that it may not be
rendered highly probable, or even approximately certain,
by a sufficient number of concordances. In fact the two
best founded and most conspicuously successful theories
in the whole range of physical science involve the most
absurd suppositions. Gravity is a force which appears to
act between bodies through vacuous space ; it is in
positive contradiction to the old dictum that nothing-
could act but through some intervening medium or sub-
stance. It is even more puzzling that the force acts in
perfect indifference to all intervening obstacles. Light in
spite of its extreme velocity, shows much respect to
matter, for it is almost instantaneously stopped by opaque
substances, and to a considerable extent absorbed and de-
flected by transparent ones. But to gravity all media are, as
it were, absolutely transparent, nay non-existent ; and two
particles at opposite points of the earth affect each other
exactly as if the globe were not between. To complete the
apparent impossibility, the action is, so far as we can ob-
serve, absolutely instantaneous, so that every particle of the
universe is at every moment in separate cognizance, as it
were, of the relative position of every other particle
throughout the universe at that same moment of absolute
time. Compared with such incomprehensible conditions,
the theory of vortices deals with common-place realities.
Newton's celebrated saying, hypotheses non Jingo, bears
the appearance of pure irony ; and it was not without
apparent grounds that Leibnitz and the greatest con-
tinental philosophers charged Newton with re-introducing
occult powers and qualities.
The undulatory theory of light presents almost equal
