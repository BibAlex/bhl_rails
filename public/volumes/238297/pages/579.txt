THEORY OF APPROXIMATION. 89
In a similar manner Fourier's theory of the conduction
and radiation of heat was based upon the hypothesis that
the quantity of heat passing along any line is simply pro-
portional to the rate of change of temperature. But it
has since been shown by Forbes that the conductivity of a
body diminishes as its temperature increases. All the
details of Fourier's solution therefore require modification,
and the results are in the meantime to be regarded as
only approximately true 9.
We ought to distinguish between those problems which
are physically and those which are merely mathematically
incomplete. In the latter case the physical law is cor-
rectly seized, but the mathematician neglects, or is more
often unable to follow out the law in all its results. The law
of gravitation and the principles of harmonic or undula-
tory movement, even supposing the data to be correct,
can never be followed into all their ultimate results.
Dr. Young explained the production of Newton's rings by
supposing that the rays reflected from the upper and
lower surfaces of a thin film of a certain thickness were in
opposite phases, and thus neutralized each other. It was
pointed out, however, that as the light reflected from the
nearer surface must be undoubtedly a little brighter than
that from the further surface, the two rays ought not to
neutralize each other so completely as they are observed
to do. It was finally shown by Poisson that the dis-
crepancy arose only from incomplete solution of the
problem ; for the light which has once got into the film
must be to a certain extent reflected backwards and
forwards ad infinitum; and if we follow- out this course of
the light by a perfect mathematical analysis, absolute dark-
ness may be shown to result from the interference of the
rays r . In such a case as this we used no physical laws
