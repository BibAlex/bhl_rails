PHILOSOPHY OF INDUCTIVE INFERENCE. 263
which tended, in the creation of things, to associate these
properties together, and I expect to find them associated
in the next instance. But there always is the possibility
that some unknown change may take place between past,
and future cases. The clock may run down, or be subject
to any one of a hundred accidents altering its condition.
There is no reason in the nature of things, so far as known
to us, why yellow colour, ductility, high specific gravity,
and incorrodibility, should always be associated together ;
and in other like cases, if not in this, men's expectations
have been deceived. Our inferences, therefore, always \
retain more or less of a hypothetical character, and are so I
far open to doubt. Only in proportion as our induction/
approximates to the character of perfect induction, does
it approximate to certainty. The amount of uncertainty
corresponds to the probability that other objects than
those examined, may exist and falsify our inferences ; the
amount of probability corresponds to the amount of infor-
mation yielded by our examination ; and the theory of
probability will be needed to prevent our over-estimating
or under-estimating the knowledge we possess.
Illustrations of the Inductive Process.
To illustrate the passage from the known to the ap-
parently unknown, let us suppose that the phenomena
under investigation consist of numbers, and that the
following six numbers being exhibited to us, we are
required to infer the character of the next in the
series :
5, .15, 35, 45, 65, 95.
The question first of all arises, How may we describe this
series of numbers ? What is uniformly true of them ?
The reader cannot fail to perceive at the first glance that
they all end in five, and the problem is, from the proper-
