GENERALIZA TION. 263
may present to the senses very different appearances.
Without a careful analysis of the changes which take
place, we may often be in danger of widely separating
facts and processes, which are actually instances of the
same law. Extreme difference of degree or magnitude
is a very frequent cause of error. It is truly difficult
at the first moment to recognise any similarity between
the gradual rusting of a piece of iron, and the rapid
combustion of a heap of straw. Yet Lavoisier's chemical
theory was founded upon the close similarity of the oxy-
dizing process in one case and the other. We have only
indeed to divide the iron into excessively small particles
to discover that it is really the more combustible of the
two, so that it actually takes fire spontaneously and burns
like tinder. It is the excessive slowness of the process in
the case of a massive piece of iron which disguises its real
character.
If Xenophon reports truly, Socrates was seriously mis-
led by not making sufficient allowance for extreme differ-
ences of degree and quantity. He rejected the acute
opinion of Anaxagoras that the sun is a fire, on the ground
that we can look at a fire, but not at the sun, and that
plants grow by sunshine while they are killed by fire.
He also pointed out that a stone heated in a fire is not
luminous, and soon cools, whereas the sun ever remains
equally luminous and hot '. All such mistakes evidently
arise from not perceiving that difference of quantity may
be so extreme as to assume the appearance of difference
of quality. It is the least creditable thing we know of
Socrates, that when pointing out these supposed mistakes
of earlier philosophers, he advised his followers not to
study astronomy.
Masses of matter of very different size may always be
