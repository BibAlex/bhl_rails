ACCORDANCE OF QUANTITATIVE THEORIES, <bc. 197
eclipses and transits, he was able to argue inversely, and
assign the ellipticity of the planet's section by theory.
The ratio of the polar and equatorial axes thus deter-
mined was very nearly that of 13 to -14; and it agrees
well with such direct micrometrical measurements of the
planet as have been made ; but Laplace believed that the
theory gave a more accurate result than direct observation
could yield, so that the theory could hardly be said to
admit of direct verification.
The specific heat of air was believed on the grounds of
direct experiment to amount to 0*2669, the specific heat of
water being taken as unity ; but the methods of expe-
riment were open to considerable causes of error. The
late Professor Eankirie showed in 1850 that it was possible
to calculate from the mechanical equivalent of heat, and
from other thermodynamic data, what this number should
be, and he found for it 0-2378. This determination was
at the time accepted by him and others as the most
satisfactory result, although not verified ; subsequently in
1853 Regnault obtained by direct experiment the number
' 2 377> proving that the prediction had been well
grounded.
It will be readily seen that in purely quantitative
questions verification will be a matter of degree and
probability. A less accurate method of measurement can-
not verify the results of a more accurate method, so that
if we arrive at a determination of the same physical
quantity in several distinct modes it will often become >a
delicate matter of investigation to decide which result is
most reliable, and should be used for the indirect deter-
mination of other quantities. For instance, Joule's and
Thomson's ingenious experiments upon the thermal phe-
nomena of fluids in motion involved, as one physical
constant, the mechanical equivalent of heat ; if requisite,
