PROPOSITIONS. 49
article a often seems to express partiality, as when we say
* Iron is a metal ' we clearly mean one only of several
metals.
Certain eminent recent logicians have proposed to avoid
the indefiniteness in question by w^hat is called the Quan-
tification of the Predicate, and they have generally used
the little word some to show that only a part of the
predicate is identical with the subject . Some is an in-
determinate. adjective; it implies unknown qualities by
which we might select the part in question if they were
known, but it gives no hint as to their nature. I might
make extensive use of such an indeterminate sign to
express partial identities in this work. Thus, taking the
special symbol V = some, the general form of a partial
identity would be A = VB, and in Boole's Logic expres-
sions of the kind were freely used. But I find that
indeterminate symbols only introduce complexity, and
destroy the beauty and simple universality of the system
which may be created without their use. A vague word
like some is only used in ordinary language by ellipsis,
and to avoid the trouble of attaining accuracy. We can
always substitute for it more definite expressions if we
like ; but when once the indefinite some is introduced we
cannot replace it by the special description. We do not
know whether some colour is red, yellow, blue, or what it
is ; but on the other hand red colour is certainly some
colour ; as is also yellow, blue, &c.
Throughout this system of logic I shall usually dispense
with all such indefinite expressions ; and this can readily
be done by substituting one of the other terms. To
express the proposition * All As are some BV I shall not
use the form A = VB, but
