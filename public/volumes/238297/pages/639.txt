THE USE OF HYPOTHESIS. 149
with so many experimental facts as to have great appear-
ance of truth. Under such circumstances we have need
of some new experiment, which shall give results agreeing
with one hypothesis but not with the other.
Any such experiment which decides between two rival
theories may be called an JExperimentum Crucis, an
Experiment of the Finger Post. Whenever the mind
stands, as it were, at cross-roads, and knows not which
way to select, it needs some decisive guide, and Bacon
therefore assigned great importance and authority to in-
stances or facts which serve in this capacity. The name
given by Bacon has become exceedingly familiar ; it is
perhaps almost the only one of Bacon's figurative expres-
sions which has passed into common use. We even find
Newton, as I have already mentioned, using the name
(vol. ii. p. 134).
I* do not think, indeed, that the common use of the
word at all agrees with that intended by Bacon. Sir
John Herschel says that ' we make an experiment of the
crucial kind when we form combinations, and put in action
causes from which some particular one shall be deliberately
excluded, and some other purposely admitted 03 .' This,
however, seems to be the description of any special ex-
periment not made at haphazard. Pascal's experiment
of causing a barometer to be carried to the top of the
Puy-de-D6me has often been considered as a perfect
experimentum crucis, if not the first distinct one on
record"; but if so, we must dignify the doctrine of
Nature's abhorrence of a vacuum with the position of a
rival theory. A crucial experiment must not simply
confirm one theory, but must negative another ; it must
decide a mind which is in equilibrium, as Bacon says ,
