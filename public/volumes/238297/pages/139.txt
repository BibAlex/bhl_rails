THE INDIRECT METHOD OF INFERENCE. 113
And as the second member of this is identical with the
second member of ( i ) we may substitute, obtaining
A = AB.
This process of reducing useless alternatives, may be
applied again and again ; for it is plain that
A = AB (CD + Cd ! cD [ cd)
communicates no more information than that A is B.
This abstraction of indifferent terms is in fact the con-
verse process to that of development described in p. 104 ;
and it is one of the most important operations in the
whole sphere of reasoning.
The reader should observe that in the proposition
we cannot abstract C and infer
A = B;
but from
AC | Ac = BC | Be
we may abstract all reference to the term C.
Illustrations of the Indirect Method.
An infinite variety of arguments and logical problems
might be introduced here to show the comprehensive
character and powers of the Indirect Method. We can
treat either a single premise or a series of premises.
Take in the first place a simple definition, such as ' a
triangle is a three-sided rectilinear figure/ Let
A = triangle
B = three-sided
C = rectilinear figure,
then the definition is of the form
A- BC.
If we take the series of eight combinations of three
letters (see p. 106) and strike out those which are
I
