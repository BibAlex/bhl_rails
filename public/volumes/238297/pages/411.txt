dimensions of space, their periods of revolution, their
changes of brilliancy and colours. It is obvious that
though astronomical numbers are conventionally called
constant, they are in all cases probably subject to more
or less rapid variation.
Terrestrial Numbers.
Our knowledge of the globe we inhabit involves many
numerical determinations, which have little or no con-
nexion with astronomical theory. The extreme heights
of the principal mountains, the mean elevation of con-
tinents, the mean or extreme depths of the oceans, the
specific gravities of rocks, the temperature of mines, all
the host of numbers expressing the meteorological or
magnetic conditions of every part of the surface must
fall into this class. Many of such numbers are hardly
to be called constant, being subject to periodic or even
secular changes, but they are no more variable in fact,
than many which in astronomical science are set down
as constant. In many cases quantities which seem most
variable may go through rhythmical changes resulting
in a nearly uniform average, and it is only in the long
progress of physical investigation that we can hope to
discriminate successfully between those elemental num-
bers which are absolutely fixed and those which vary.
In the latter case the law of variation becomes the
constant relation which is the object of our search.
Organic Numbers.
All the forms and properties of brute nature having
been sufficiently defined by the previous classes of numbers,
the organic world, both vegetable and animal, remains
outstanding, and offers a higher series of phenomena for
