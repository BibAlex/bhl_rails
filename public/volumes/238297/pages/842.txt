352 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
ance of a resemblance is to be determined, nor what is
the measure of the closeness of analogy. Until all the
words employed in a definition are made clear in meaning,
the definition itself is worse than useless. Now if the
views concerning classification here upheld are true, there
can be no sharp and precise distinction between natural
and artificial systems. All arrangements which serve any
purpose at all must be more or less natural, because, if
closely enough scrutinized, they will involve more resem-
blances than those whereby the class was defined.
It is true that in the biological sciences there would be
one arrangement of plants or animals which would be
conspicuously instructive, and in a certain sense natural,
if it could be attained, and it is that after which natural-
ists have been in reality striving for nearly two centuries,
namely, that arrangement which would display the genea-
logical descent of every form from the original life germ.
Those morphological resemblances upon which the classi-
fication of living beings is almost always based are in-
herited resemblances, and it is evident that descendants
will usually resemble their parents and each other in a
great many points.
I have said that a natural is distinguished from an
arbitrary or artificial system only in degree. It will be
found almost impossible to arrange objects according to
any one circumstance without finding that some correla-
tion of other circumstances is thus made apparent. No
arrangement could seem more arbitrary than the common
alphabetical arrangement according to the initial letters
of the name. But we cannot scrutinize a list of names
of persons without noticing a predominance of Evans's
and Jones's, under the letters E and J, and of names
beginning with Mac under the letter M. The predomi-
nance is so great that we could not attribute it to chance,
and inquiry would of course show that it arose from im-
