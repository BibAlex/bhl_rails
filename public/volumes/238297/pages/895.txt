CLASSIFICATION. 405
arrangement of the spare copies. In the ' English Cyclo-
paedia' it is suggested that twenty copies of the book titles
might readily have been utilized in forming additional
catalogues, arranged according to the place of publication,
the language of the Book, the general nature of the sub-
ject, and so forth e .
It will hardly be a digression to point out the enormous
saving of labour, or, what comes to the same thing, the
enormous increase in our available knowledge, both lite-
rary and scientific, which arises from the formation of ex-
tensive indices. The ' State Papers/ containing the whole
history of the nation, were practically sealed to literary
inquirers until the Government undertook the task of
calendaring and indexing them. The British Museum
Catalogue is another national work, of which the im-
portance in advancing knowledge cannot be overrated.
The Royal Society is accomplishing a work of world-wide
importance, in publishing a complete catalogue of memoirs
upon physical science. The time will perhaps come when
our views upon this subject will be extended, and either
Government or some public society will undertake the
systematic cataloguing and indexing of masses of his-
torical and scientific information which are now almost
closed against inquiry.
Classification in the Biological Sciences.
The great generalizations established in the works of
Herbert Spencer and Charles Darwin have thrown great
light upon many other sciences, and, strange as it may
seem to say so, they have removed several difficulties out
of the way of the logician. The subject of classification
has long been studied in almost exclusive reference to the
e 'English Cyclopaedia/ 'Arts and Sciences/ vol. v. p. 233.
