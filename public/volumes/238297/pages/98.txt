72 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
leaves out some of the information afforded in the premises ;
it even leaves us open to interpret the some metals in a
wider sense than we are warranted in doing. From these
distinct defects of the syllogism the process of substitution
is free, and it only incurs the possible objection of being
tediously minute and accurate.
Miscellaneous Forms of Deductive Inference.
The more simple and common forms of deductive
reasoning having been exhibited and demonstrated on
the principle of substitution, there remain many, in fact
an indefinite number, which may be explained with nearly
equal ease. Such as involve the use of disjunctive propo-
sitions will be deferred to a later chapter, and several of
the syllogistic moods which include negative terms will be
more conveniently treated after we have introduced the
symbolic use of the second and third laws of thought.
We sometimes meet with a chain of propositions which
allow of repeated substitution and form an argument called
in the old logic a Sorites. Take, for instance, the premises
Iron is a metal (i)
Metals are good conductors of electricity (2)
Good conductors of electricity are useful for
telegraphic purposes. (3)
It obviously follows that
Iron is useful for telegraphic purposes. (4)
Now if we take our letters thus
A = Iron, B = metal, C = good conductor of
electricity, D = useful for telegraphic purposes,
the premises will assume the form
A = AB (i)
B = BC (2)
C = CD (3)
For B in (i) we can substitute its equivalent in (2), and
