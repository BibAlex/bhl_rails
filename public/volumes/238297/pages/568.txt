78 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
of heat from one part of the bar to another. All these
effects are utterly inappreciable in a practical point of
view, if the bar be a good stout one ; but in a theoretical
point of view they entirely prevent our saying that we
have solved a natural problem. The faculties of the
human mind, even when aided by the wonderful powers
of abbreviation conferred by analytical methods, are utterly
unable to cope with the complications of any one real pro-
blem. And had we exhausted all the known phenomena
of a mechanical problem, how can we tell that hidden
phenomena, as yet undetected, do not intervene in the
commonest actions. It is plain that no phenomenon
comes within the sphere of our senses unless it possesses
a certain momentum or magnitude capable of irritating
the appropriate nerves. There may then, and, in fact,
m.ust be" indefinite worlds of phenomena too slight to rise
within the scope of our consciousness.
All the instruments with which we perform our measure-
ments are fallible and faulty. We assume that a plumb-
line gives a perfectly vertical line ; but this is never true
in an absolute sense, owing to the attraction of mountains
and other inequalities in the surface of the earth. In an
accurate trigonometrical survey, the divergencies of the
plumb-line must be approximately determined and allowed
for 6 . We assume a surface of mercury to be perfectly
plane, but even in the breadth of 5 inches there is a cal-
culable divergence from a true plane of about one ten-
millionth part of an inch ; and this surface further diverges
from true horizontally as the plumb-line does from true
verticality. That most perfect instrument, the pendulum,
is not even theoretically perfect, except for infinitely
small arcs, and the delicate experiments performed with
the torsion balance proceed on the assumption that the
force of torsion of a wire is proportional to the angle of
