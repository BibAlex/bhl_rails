from B be such that in one second it would move A
to p, and similarly let the second force, acting alone,
move A to r. The question arises, A P B
then, whether their joint action \ \
will urge A to q along the V -W
diagonal of the parallelogram. \
May we say that A will move \
the distance Ap in the direction V
AB, and Ar in the direction c
AC, or, what is the same thing, along the parallel lifre-pg ?
In all strictness we cannot say so ; for when A has moved
towards p, the force from C will no longer act along the
line AC, and similarly the motion of A towards r will
modify the action of the force from B. This interference
of one force with the line of action of the other will
evidently be greater the larger is the extent of motion
considered ; on the other hand, as we reduce the paral-
lelogram Apqr, compared with the distances AB and AC,
the less will be the interference of the forces. Accord-
ingly mathematicians avoid all error by considering the
motions as infinitely small, so that the interference be-
comes of a still higher order of infinite smallness, and
may be entirely neglected. By the resources of the Differ-
ential Calculus it is possible to calculate the motion of the
particle A, as if it went through an infinite number of
infinitely small diagonals of parallelograms. The great
discoveries of Newton really arose from applying this
method of calculation to the movements of the moon
round the earth, which, while constantly tending to move
onward in a straight line, is also deflected towards the
earth by gravity, and moves through an elliptic curve,
composed as it were of the infinitely small diagonals of
infinitely small parallelograms. The mathematician, in
his investigation of a curve, always in fact treats it as
made up of a great number of short straight lines, and it
