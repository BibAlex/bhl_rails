THEORY OF APPROXIMATION. 95
rnence 'by discovering linear, and afterwards proceed to
elliptic or more complicated laws of variation. The ap-
proximate curves which we employ are all, according to
De Morgan's use of the name, parabolas of some order
or other ; and since the common parabola of the second
order is approximately the same as a very elongated
ellipse, arid is in fact an infinitely elongated ellipse, it
is convenient and proper to call variation of the second
order elliptic. It might also be called quadric variation.
As regards many important phenomena we are yet only
in the first stage of approximation. We know that the sun
arid many so-called fixed stars, especially 61 Cygni, have
a proper motion through space, and the direction of this
motio.n at the present time is known with some degree
of accuracy. But it is hardly consistent with the theory
of gravity that the path of any body should really be a
straight line. Hence, we must regard a rectilinear path
as only an approximate and provisional description of the
motion, and look forward to the time when its curva-
ture will be ultimately detected and measured, though
centuries perhaps must first elapse.
On the surface of the earth we are accustomed to
assume that the force of gravity is uniform at all ordinary
heights above or below the surface, because the variation
is of so slight an amount that we are scarcely able to
detect it. But supposing we could measure the variation,
we should find it simply proportional to the height.
Taking the earth's radius to be unity, let h be the height
at which we measure the force of gravity. Then by the
well-known law of the inverse square, that force will be
proportional to
^ w , or to </(! -2h+ 3 K'-4h>+ ).
But at all heights to which we can attain h will be so
small a fraction of the earth's radius that 3 h 2 will be in-
