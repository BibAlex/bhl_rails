EXCEPTIONAL PHENOMENA. 341
complicated and disguised manner. It would be easy to
point out an almost infinite number of other unex-
plained anomalies. Physicists assert, as an absolutely
universal law, that in liquefaction heat is absorbed 1 , yet
sulphur is at least an apparent exception.
The two substances, Sulphur and Selenium, are re-
markable for their relations to heat. Sulphur may
almost be said to have two melting points, for, though
liquid like water at 120 C., it becomes quite thick
and tenacious between 221 and 249, melting once
again at higher temperatures. As well as the other
element named, it may be thrown into several curious
states, which chemists conveniently dispose of by calling
them allotropic, a term freely used when they are
puzzled to know what has happened. The chemical and
physical history of iron, again, is full of anomalies ; not
only does it undergo inexplicable changes of hardness
and texture in its alloys with carbon and other substances,
but it is almost the only substance which conveys sound
with greater velocity at a higher than at a lower tem-
perature, the velocity increasing from 20 to 100 C., and
then decreasing. Silver is also anomalous in regard to
sound. These are all instances of inexplicable exceptions,
the bearing of which must be ascertained in the future
progress of science.
When the discovery of new and peculiar phenomena
conflicting with our theories of the constitution of nature
is reported to us, it becomes no easy task to steer a philo-
sophically correct course between credulity and scepticism.
We are not to assume, on the one hand, that there is any
limit to the wonders which nature can present to us.
Nothing except the contradictory is really impossible, and
many things which we now regard as common-place were
