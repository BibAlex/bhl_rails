which assert the equivalence of groups of atoms. Ordinary
fermentation is represented by the formula
C H 12 6 = 2C 2 H 6 + 2 C0 2 .
Three kinds of units, the atoms respectively of Carbon,
Hydrogen, and Oxygen, are here intermingled, but there is
really a separate equation in regard to each kind. Mathe-
maticians also employ compound equations of the same
kind ; for in a 4- l> +J T = c + d *J i, it is impossible by
ordinary addition to add a to b *J i- Hence we really
have the separate equations a = c, and b = d G . Similarly
an equation between two quaternions is equivalent to
four equations between ordinary quantities, whence in-
deed the origin of the name quaternion.
Analogy of Logical and Numerical Terms.
If my assertion is correct that number arises out of
logical conditions, we ought to find number obeying all
the laws and conditions of logic. It is almost super-
fluous to point out that this is the case with the funda-
mental laws of identity arid difference, and it only remains
for me to show that mathematical symbols do really obey
the special conditions of logical symbols which were
formerly pointed out (p. 39). Thus the Law of Com-
mutativeness, is equally true of quality and quantity. As
in logic we have
AB = BA,
so in mathematics it is familiarly known that
2x3 = 3x2, or x xy = y xx.
The properties of space, in short, are as indifferent in
pure multiplication as we found them in pure logical
thought.
