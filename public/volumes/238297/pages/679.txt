CHAPTER XXV.
ACCORDANCE OF QUANTITATIVE THEORIES AND
EXPERIMENTS.
IN the preceding chapter we found that facts may be
classed under four heads as regards their connexion with
theory, and our powers of explanation or prediction. The
facts hitherto considered were generally of a qualitative
rather than a quantitative nature ; but when we look
exclusively to the quantity of a phenomenon, and the
various modes in which we may estimate or establish its
amount, almost the same system of classification will hold
good. There will, however, be five possible cases :
(1) We may directly and empirically measure a phe-
nomenon, without being able to explain why it should
have any particular quantity, or to connect it by theory
with other quantities. ,
(2) In a considerable number of cases we can theo-
retically predict the existence of a phenomenon, but may
be unable to assign its amount, except by direct measure-
ment, or to explain the amount theoretically when thus
ascertained. .
(3^ We may measure a quantity, and afterwards ex-
plain it as related to other quantities, or as governed by
known quantitative laws.
(4) We may predict the quantity of an effect on theo-
retical grounds, and afterwards confirm the prediction by
direct measurement.
