DEDUCTIVE REASONING. 69
A = some crystals.
B = bodies equally elastic in all directions
C = doubly refracting light
c = not doubly refracting light.
Our argument is of the same form as before, and may
be concisely stated in one line
A = AB = ABc.
If we take PQ for the indefinite some crystals, we have
PQ = PQB = PQBc.
The only difference is that the negative term c occurs
instead of C in the mood Darii (p. 68).

The reader will probably have noticed that the conclu-
sion which we obtain from premises is often more full
than that drawn by the old Aristotelian processes. Thus
from ' Sodium is a metal/ and f Metals conduct electricity,'
we inferred (p. 66) that ' Sodium = sodium metal, con-
ducting electricity/ whereas the old logic simply concludes
that * Sodium conducts electricity/ Symbolically, from
A = AB, and B = BC, we get A = ABC, whereas the old
logic gets at the most A = AC. It is therefore well to
show that without employing any other principles of
inference than those already described, we may infer
A = AC from A = ABC, though we cannot infer the
latter more full and accurate result from the former.
We may show this most simply as follows :
By the first law of thought it is evident that
AA = AA ;
and if we have given the proposition A = ABC, we may
substitute for both the A's in the second side of the above,
obtaining
AA = ABC . ABC.
But from the property of logical symbols expressed in the
