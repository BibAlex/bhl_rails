448 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
fication by observation, and almost free from any re-
strictions afforded by present knowledge. We might attri-
bute various shapes to the whole body of adamantine
medium, and the consequences would be various. But
there is this value in such speculations, that they draw
attention to the finiteness of our knowledge. We cannot
deny the possible truth of such an hypothesis, nor can we
place a limit to the scientific imagination in the framing
of other like hypotheses. It is impossible, indeed, to
follow out our scientific inferences without falling into
speculation. If heat be radiated into outward space it
must either proceed ad infinitum, or it must be stopped
somewhere. In the latter case we fall upon Rankine's
hypothesis. But if the material universe consist of a finite
collection of heated matter situated in a finite portion of
an infinite adamantine medium, then either this universe
must have existed for a finite time, or else it must have
cooled down during the infinity of past time indefinitely
near to the absolute zero of temperature. I objected to
Lucretius' argument against the destructibility of matter,
that we have no knowledge whatever of the laws accord-
ing to which it would undergo destruction. But we do
know the laws according to which the dissipation of heat
appears to proceed, and the conclusion inevitably is that a
finite heated material body placed in a perfectly cold
infinitely extended medium would in an infinite time
become infinitely approximated to zero. Now our own
world is not yet cooled down near to zero, so that physical
science seems to place us in the dilemma of admitting
either the finiteness of past duration of the world, or else
the finiteness of the portion of medium in which we exist.
In either case we become involved in metaphysical and
mechanical difficulties surpassing our mental powers.
