180 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.

predict with certainty a whole class of highly interesting
phenomena. To him especially do we owe the important
advance which has been recently made to a new era in
the history of science, when the famous philosophical
system of Bacon will be to a great extent superseded,
and when, instead of arriving at discovery by induction
from experiment, we shall obtain our largest accessions of
new facts by reasoning deductively from fundamental
principles/
The theory of electricity is a necessary part of the
general theory of matter, and is rapidly acquiring the
power of prevision. As soon as Wheatstone had proved
experimentally that the conduction of electricity occupied
time, Faraday remarked in 1838, with wonderful sagacity,
that if the conducting wires were connected with the
coatings of a large Leyden jar, the rapidity of conduction
would be lessened. This prediction remained unverified
for sixteen years, until the submarine cable was laid be-
neath the Channel. A considerable retardation of the
electric spark was then detected by Siemens and Latimer
Clark, and Faraday at once pointed out that the wire
surrounded by water resembles a Leyden jar on a large
scale, so that each message sent through the cable verified
his remark of 1838.
The joint relations of heat and electricity to the metals
constitute almost a new science of thermo-electricity. Sir
W. Thompson was enabled by theory to anticipate the
following curious effect, namely, that an electric current
passing in an iron bar from a hot to a cold part produces
a cooling effect, but in a copper bar the effect is exactly
opposite in character, that is the bar becomes heated d .
The action of crystals with regard to heat and electricity
was partly foreseen on the grounds of theory by Poisson.
