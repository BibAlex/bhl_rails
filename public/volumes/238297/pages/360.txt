meter to a standard current r . In short, he measures not
the current itself but a known fraction of it.
In many electrical and other experiments, we wish to
measure the movements of a needle or other body, which
are not only very slight in themselves, but the manifes-
tations of exceedingly small forces. We cannot even
approach a delicately balanced needle without disturbing
it. Under these circumstances the only mode of proceed-
ing with accuracy, is to attach a very small mirror to the
moving body, and employ a ray of light reflected from
the mirror as an index of its movements. The ray may
be considered quite incapable of affecting the body, and
yet by allowing the ray to pass to a sufficient distance,
the motions of the mirror may be increased to almost any
extent. A ray of light is in fact a perfectly weightless
finger or index of indefinite length, with the additional
advantage that the angular deviation is by the law of
reflection double that of the mirror. This method, was
introduced by Gauss, and is now of great importance ;
but in Wollaston's reflecting goniometer a ray of light
had previously been employed as an index finger. Lavoi-
sier and Laplace had also used a telescope in connection
with the pyrometer.
It is a great advantage in some instruments that they
can be readily made to manifest a phenomenon in a greater
or less degree, by a very slight change in the construction.
Thus either by enlarging the bulb or contracting the tube
of the thermometer, we can make it give more conspicuous
indications of change of temperature. The barometer, on
the other hand, always gives the variations of pressure
on one scale. The torsion balance is especially remark-
able for the extreme delicacy which may be attained
by increasing the length and lightness of the rod, and the
