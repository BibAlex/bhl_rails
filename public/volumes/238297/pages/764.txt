probably assert with safety that between whatever points
of temperature we examined ice, there would be found
some indication, doubtless almost infinitesimally small,
of the apparently abrupt change which was to occur at a
higher temperature. It might also be pointed out that
all the most important and apparently simple physical
laws, such as those of Boyle and Marriotte, Dalton and
Gay-Lussac, &c., are only approximately true, and the
divergences from observation are fore warnings of abrupt
changes, which would otherwise break the law of con-
tinuity.
Secondly, it must be remembered that mathematical
laws of any complexity will probably present singular
cases or negative results, which may present the appear-
ance of discontinuity, as when the law of refraction sud-
denly yields us with perfect abruptness the entirely
different phenomenon of total internal reflection. In the
undulatory theory there is no real change of law between
the phenomenon of refraction and that of reflection.
Faraday in the earlier part of his career found so many
substances possessing more or less magnetic power, that
he ventured on a great generalization, and asserted that
all bodies shared in the magnetic property of iron. His
mistake, as he afterwards himself discovered, consisted in
overlooking the fact that though magnetic in a certain
sense, some substances might have negative magnetism,
and be repelled instead of attracted by the magnet.
Between magnetism and diamagnetism there must be a
zero near or even at which some substances may be
classed, but otherwise magnetic properties appear to be
universally present in matter.
Thirdly, where we might expect to find a uniform
mathematical law prevailing, the law may undergo abrupt
change at singular points, and actual discontinuity may
arise. We may sometimes be in danger of treating under
