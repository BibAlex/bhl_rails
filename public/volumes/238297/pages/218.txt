and exceeds it by the number of persons in the house who
are neither men nor aged (Abe).
It should be understood that this solution applies only
to the terms of the example quoted above, and not to the
general problem for which De Morgan intended it to serve
as an illustration.
As a second instance, let us take the following ques-
tion : The whole number of voters in a borough is a ; the
number against whom objections have been lodged by
liberals is b; and the number against whom objections
have been lodged by conservatives is c ; required the
number, if any, who have been objected to on both sides.
Taking
A = voter,
B = objected to by liberals,
C objected to by conservatives,
then we require the value of (ABC). Now the following
equation in identically true
(ABC) - (AB) + (AC) + (Abe) - (A). (i)
For if we develop all the terms on the second side we
obtain
(ABC) = (ABC) + (ABc) + (ABC) + (A6C) 4- (Abe)
- (ABC) - (ABc) - (A6C) -- (Abe) ;
and striking out the corresponding positive and negative
terms, we have only left (ABC) = (ABC). Since then (i) is
necessarily true, we have only to insert the known values,
and we have
(ABC) = 6 + c - a + (Abe).
Hence the number who have received objections from both
sides is equal to the excess, if any, of the whole number
of objections over the number of voters together with the
numbers of voters who have received no objections (Abe).
In many cases classes of objects may exist under special
logical conditions, and we must consider how these con-
ditions must be interpreted numerically.
