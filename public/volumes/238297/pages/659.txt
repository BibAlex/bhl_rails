EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE, EXPLANATION, &c. 169
combination of laws, will occur to a reasoner. Whatever
road a traveller takes, he is sure to arrive somewhere, but
unless he proceed in a very systematic manner, it is very
unlikely that he will reach every place to which a network
of roads will conduct him. In like manner there are
many phenomena which were virtually within the reach
of philosophers by inference from their previous knowledge,
but were never discovered until accident or systematic
empirical observation disclosed their existence.
That light is propagated with a certain uniform but
very high velocity, was proved by Roemer, by observation
of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites. Corrections could
henceforward be made in all astronomical observations
requiring it, for the difference of absolute time at which
an event happens, and that at which it becomes evident to
us. But no person happened to remark that the motion
of light compounded with that of the earth in its orbit
would occasion a small apparent displacement of the
greater part of the heavenly bodies. Fifty years elapsed
before Bradley empirically discovered this effect, called by
him aberration, when examining his accurate observations
of the fixed stars *.
When once the relation between an electric current
and a magnet had been detected by Oersted and Faraday,
it ought, theoretically speaking, to have been possible for
them or any other person to foresee the diverse results
which must ensue in different circumstances. If, for in-
stance, a plate of copper were placed beneath an oscillating
magnetic needle it should have been seen that the needle
would induce currents in the copper, but as this coirid not
take place without a certain reaction against the needle, it
ought to have been seen that the needle would come to
rest more rapidly than in the absence of the copper. Yet
this peculiar effect was accidentally discovered by Gambey
i Laplace, 'Precis de I'histoire de I'Astronomie,' p. 104.
