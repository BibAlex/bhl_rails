QUANTITATIVE INDUCTION.
LET it be observed that we have not yet formally con-
sidered any processes of reasoning which have for their
object to disclose general laws of nature expressed in
quantitative formulae or equations. We have been in-
quiring into the modes by which a phenomenon may be
measured, and, if it be a composite phenomenon, may be
resolved, by the aid of several measurements, into its
component parts. We have dso considered the precau-
tions to be taken in the performance of observations and
experiments in order that we may know what phenomena
we really do measure and record. In treating of the
approximate character of all observations, we have par-
tially entered upon the subject of Quantitative Induction
proper, but we must remember that no number of facts
and observations can by themselves constitute science or
general knowledge. Numerical facts, like other facts,
are but the raw materials of knowledge, upon which our
reasoning faculties must be exerted in order to draw
forth the secret principles of nature. It is by an. inverse
process of reasoning that we can alone discover the mathe-
matical laws to which varying quantities conform. By well-
conducted experiments we gain a series of values of a
variable, and a corresponding series of values of a variant,
and we now want to know what mathematical function
the variant is as regards the variable. .In the usual pro-
gress of a science three questions will have to be answered
as regards every important quantitative phenomenon :
