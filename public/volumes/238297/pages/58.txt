32 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
crystal is but part of opaque crystal. We increase the
intent of meaning of a term by joining adjectives, or
phrases equivalent to adjectives, to it, and the removal
of such adjectives of course decreases the intensive
meaning. Now concerning such changes of meaning
the following all-important law holds universally true.
When the intent of meaning of a term is increased the
extent is decreased; and vice versa, when the extent is
increased the intent is decreased. In short, as one is
increased the other is decreased.
This law refers only to logical changes. The number
of steam engines in the world may be undergoing a
rapid increase without the intensive meaning of the
name being altered. The law will only be verified again
when there is a real change in the intensive meaning,
and an adjective may often be joined to a noun without
making a change. Elementary metal is identical with
metal ; mortal man with man ; it being a property of all
metals to be elements, and all men to be mortals.
There is no limit to the amount of meaning which
a term may have. A term may denote one object, or
many, or an infinite number; it may imply a single
quality, if such there be, or a group of any number of
qualities, and yet the law connecting the extension and
intension will infallibly apply. Taking the general
name planet, we increase its intension and decrease its
extension by prefixing the adjective exterior ; and if we
further add nearest to the earth, there remains but one
planet Mars, to which the name can then be applied.
Singular terms, which denote a single individual only,
come under the same law of meaning as general names.
They may be regarded as general names of which the
meaning in extension is reduced to a minimum. Logi-
cians have erroneously asserted, as it seems to me, that
singular terms are devoid of meaning in intension, the
