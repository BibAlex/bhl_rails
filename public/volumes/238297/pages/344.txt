318 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Division of the Subject.
The general subject of quantitative investigation will
have to be divided into several parts. We shall, firstly,
consider the means at our disposal for measuring phe-
nomena, and thus rendering them more or less amenable
to mathematical treatment. This task will involve an
analysis of the principles on which accurate methods of
measurement are founded, forming the subject of the
remainder of the present chapter. As measurement, how-
ever, only yields ratios, we have in the next chapter
(XIV) to consider the establishment of unitary mag-
nitudes, in terms of which our results may be expressed.
As every phenomenon is usually the sum of several dis-
tinct quantities proceeding from different causes, we have
next to investigate in Chapter XV the methods by which
we may disentangle complicated effects, and refer each
part of the joint effect to its separate cause.
It yet remains for us in subsequent chapters to treat of
quantitative induction, properly so called. We must
follow out the inverse logical method, as it presents itself
in problems of a far higher degree of difficulty than those
which treat of objects related in a simple logical manner,
and incapable of merging into each other by addition and
subtraction.
Continuous Quantity.
The phenomena of nature are for the most part mani-
fested in quantities which increase or decrease continu-
ously. When we inquire into the precise meaning of
continuous quantity, we find that it can only be described
as that which is divisible without limit. We can divide
a millemetre into ten, or one hundred, or one thousand, or
ten thousand parts, and mentally at any rate we can carry
