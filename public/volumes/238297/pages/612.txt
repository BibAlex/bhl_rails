122 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
ing that a curve of simple character is to pass through
certain determined points. If we have, for instance, two
experimental results, and only two, we must assume that
the curve is a straight line ; for the parabolas which can
be passed through two points are infinitely various in
magnitude, and quite indeterminate. One straight line
alone can pass through two points, and it will have an
equation of the form y = mx + n, the constant quantities
of which can be readily determined from two results.
Thus, if the two values for x 9 7 and n, give the values
f r 2/> 35 an d 53, the solution of two simple equations
gives y = 4*5x^ + 3*5 as the equation, and for any other
value of x, for instance 10, we get a value of y, 48-5.
When we take an exactly intermediate value of x 9 namely
9, this process yields a simple mean result, namely 44.
Three experimental results being given, we may assume
that they fall upon a portion of a parabola, and simple
algebraic calculation readily gives the position of any
intermediate point upon the parabola. Concerning the
process of interpolation as practised in the science of
meteorology the reader will find some directions in the
French edition of Keemtz' Meteorology P.
When we have, either directly by experiment or by
the use of a curve, a series of values of the variant for
exactly equidistant values of the variable, it is often very
instructive to take the differences between each value of
the variant and the next, and then the differences between
those differences, and so on. If any series of differences
approaches closely to zero it is an indication that the
numbers may be correctly represented by a finite em-
pirical formula ; if the nth differences are zero, then the
formula will contain only the first n-i powers of the
variable. Indeed we may sometimes obtain by the Cal-
