152 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
diamagnetic substances are capable of polarity C = CD, it
follows by substitution that all substances are capable of
polarity, or A = AD. We may divide the class substance
again into the three subclasses, solid, liquid, and gas ;
and if we can show that in each of these forms it obeys
Carnot's thermodynamic law, it foUows that all substances
obey that law. Similarly we may show that all verte-
brate animals possess red blood, if we can show separately
that fish, reptiles, birds, marsupials, and mammals possess
red blood, there being, as far as is known, only five
principal subclasses of vertebrata.
Our inductions will often be embarrassed by exceptions,
real or apparent. We might affirm that all gems are
incombustible were not diamond undoubtedly combustible.
Nothing seems more evident than that all the metals are
opaque until we examine them in fine films, when gold
and silver are found to be transparent. All plants absorb
carbonic acid except certain fungi ; all the bodies of the
planetary system have a progressive motion from west to
east, except the satellites of Uranus and Neptune. Even
some of the profoundest laws of matter are not quite
universal ; all solids expand by heat except india-rubber,
and possibly a few other substances ; all liquids which
have been tested expand by heat except water below 4C
and fused bismuth ; all gases have a coefficient of expan-
sion increasing with the temperature except hydrogen.
In a later chapter I shall consider how such anomalous
cases may be regarded and classified ; here we have only
to express them in a consistent manner in our nota-
tion.
Let us take the case of the transparency of metals, and
assign the terms thus
A = metal D = iron
B = gold E, F &c. = copper, lead, &c.
C = silver X opaque.
