that there do not exist more than from 3Xio 24 to io 26
molecules in a cubic centimetre of a solid or liquid sub-
stance^ Assuming these data to be true, for the sake
of argument, a simple calculation enables us to show that
the almost inconceivably vast sphere of our stellar system
if entirely filled with solid matter, would not contain
more than about 68 x io 90 atoms, that is to say, a number
requiring for its expression 92 places of figures. Now,
this number would be immensely less than the fifth order
of the powers of two.
In the variety of logical relations, which may exist
between a certain number of logical terms, we also meet
a case of higher variations. Two terms, as it has been
shewn (p. 154), may form four distinct combinations,
but the possible selections from these series of com-
binations will be sixteen in number, or, excluding cases
of contradiction, seven. Three terms may form eight
combinations, allowing 256 selections, or with exclu-
sion of contradictory cases, 193. Four terms give sixteen
combinations, and no less than 65,536 possible selec-
tions from those combinations, the nature of which I
naturally abstained from exhaustively examining. Five
terms give thirty-two combinations, and 4,294,967,296
possible selections ; and for six terms the corresponding
numbers are sixty-four and 18,446,744,073,709,551,616.
Considering that it is the most common thing in the
world to use an argument involving six objects or terms,
it may excite some surprise that the complete investiga-
tion of the relations in which six such terms may stand
to each other, should involve an almost inconceivable
number of cases. Yet these numbers of possible logical
relations belong only to the second order of combina-
tions.
