182 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
under similar circumstances logical terms would give
exactly the like result, and it is not true that A' A" = A',
identically where A" is different in meaning from A'.
In an exactly similar manner it may be shown that
the Law of Unity
A I A = A
holds true alike of logical and mathematical terms. It is
absurd indeed to say that
x + x = x
except in the one case when x = absolute zero. But this
contradiction x -f x = x arises from the fact that we have
already defined the unit in one x as differing from those in
the other. Under such circumstances the Law of Unity
does not apply. For if in
A'tA" = A'
we mean that A" is in any way different from A' the
assertion of identity is evidently false.
The contrast then which seems to exist between logical
and mathematical symbols is only apparent. It is because
the Law of Simplicity and Unity must always be ob-
served in the operation of counting that those laws can
no longer be operative. This is the understood condition
under which we use all numerical symbols. Whenever
I use the symbol 5 I really mean
i + i + i -f- i + i,
and it is perfectly understood that each of these units is
distinct from each other. If requisite I might mark them
thus
l' + l"+i'"+l^+i*'"
Were this not the case and were the units really
i'+i" + i" + i"' + i"",
the Law of Unity would, as before remarked, apply, and
l"+l"=l".
Mathematical symbols then obey all the laws of logical
