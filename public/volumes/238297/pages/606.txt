116 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
now the actual function we can try whether it gives with
sufficient accuracy the remainder of our experimental
results. If not, we must either make a new selection of
results to give a new set of equations, and thus obtain
a new set of values for the constants, or we must acknow-
ledge that our form of function has been wrongly chosen.
If it appears that the form of function has been correctly
ascertained, we may regard the constants as only approxi-
mately accurate and may proceed by the Method of Least
Squares (vol. i. p. 458) to determine the most probable
values as given by the whole of the experimental results.
In most cases we shall find ourselves obliged to fall
back upon the third mode, that is, anticipation of the
form of the law to be expected on the ground of previous
knowledge. Theory and analogical reasoning must be
our guides. The general nature of the phenomenon will
often indicate the kind of law to be looked for. If one
form of energy or one kind of substance is being converted
into another, we may expect the law of direct simple pro-
portion. In one distinct class of cases the effect already
produced influences the amount of the ensuing effect, as
for instance in the cooling of a heated body, when the
law will be of an exponential form. When the direction
in which a force acts/ influences its action, trigonometrical
functions must of course enter. Any force or influence
which spreads freely through tridimensiona] space will be
subject to the law of the inverse square of the distance.
From such considerations we may sometimes arrive deduc-
tively and analogically at the general nature of the mathe-
matical ]aw required.
The Graphical Method.
In endeavouring to discover the mathematical law
obeyed by experimental results it is often necessary,
