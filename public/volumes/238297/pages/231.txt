COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS. 205
number of ways of choosing 1326x25x24. But the fact
that one choice succeeded another has caused us to obtain
the same combinations of letters in different orders ; we
should get, for instance, a, p, r at one time, and p, r, a at
another, and every three distinct letters will appear six
times over, because three things can be arranged in six
permutations. Thus the true number of combinations
.-,, i 24 x 23 x 22
will be - , or 2024.
1x2x3
It is apparent that we need the doctrine of permuta-
tions in order that we may in many questions counteract
the exaggerating effect of successive selection. If out of
a senate of 30 persons we have to choose a committee of 5,
we may choose any of 30 first, any of 29 next, and so on,
in fact there will be 30 x 29 x28 x 27 x 26 selections;
but as the actual character of the members of the committee
will not be affected by the accidental order of their selec-
tion, we divide by 1x2x3x4x5, and the possible num-
ber of different committees will be 142,506. Similarly
if we want to calculate the number of ways in which the
eight major planets may come into conjunction, it is evi-
dent that they may meet either two at a time or three at
a time, or four or more at a time, and as nothing is said as to
the relative order or place in the conjunction, we require
the number of combinations. Now a selection of 2 out of 8

is possible in - or 28 ways; of 3 out of 8 in
or 56 ways ; of 4 out of 8 in ^-^ or 70 ways; and it
may be similarly shown that for 5, 6, 7, and 8 planets,
meeting at one time, the number of ways is 56, 28, 8
and i. Thus we have solved the whole question of the
variety of conjunctions of eight planets; .and adding all the
numbers together, we find that 247 is the utmost possible
number of modes of meeting.
In general a]gebraic language, we may say that a group
