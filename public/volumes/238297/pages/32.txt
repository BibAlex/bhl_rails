THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Laws of Identity and Difference.
At the basis of all thought and science must lie the
laws which express the very nature and conditions of the
discriminating and identifying powers of mind. These
are the so-called Fundamental Laws of Thought, usually
stated as follows :
1 . The Law of Identity. Whatever is, is.
2. The Law of Contradiction. A thing cannot both be
and not be.
3. The Law of Duality. A thing must either be or
not be.
The first of these statements may perhaps be regarded
as a description of identity itself, if so fundamental a
notion can admit of description. A thing at any moment
is perfectly identical with itself, and if any person were
unaware of the meaning of the word * identity' we could
not better describe it than by such an example.
The second law points out that contradictory attri-
butes can never be joined together. The same object may
vary in its different parts ; here it may be black, and
there white ; at one time it may be hard and at another
time soft : but at the same time and place an attribute
cannot be both present and absent. Aristotle truly
described this law as the first of all axioms one of
which we need not seek for any demonstration. All
truths cannot be proved, otherwise there would be an
endless chain of demonstration ; and it is in self-evident
truths like this that we find the fittest foundation.
The third of these laws completes the other two. It
asserts that at every step there are two , possible alter-
natives presence or absence, affirmation or negation.
Hence I propose to name this law the Law of Duality,
