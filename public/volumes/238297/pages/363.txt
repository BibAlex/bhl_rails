THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF PHENOMENA. 337
observation, in addition to the irregularities of the clock.
But the revolutions of the earth repeat themselves day
after day, and year after year, without the slightest in-
terval between the end of one period and the beginning
of another. The operation of multiplication is perfectly
performed for us by nature. If, then, we can find an obser-
vation of the passage of a star across the meridian a hun-
dred years ago, that is of the interval of time between
the passage of the sun and the star, the instrumental
errors in measuring this interval by a clock and telescope
may be greater than in the present day, but will be
divided by about 36,524 days, and rendered excessively
small. It is thus that astronomers have been able to
ascertain the ratio of the mean solar to the sideral day
to the 8th place of decimals (1*00273791 to i), or to the
hundred millionth part, probably the most accurate result
of measurement in the whole range of science.
The antiquity of this mode of comparison is almost as
great as that of astronomy itself. Hipparchus made the
first clear application of it, when he compared his own
observations with those of Aristarchus, made 145 years
previously u , and thus ascertained the length of the year.
This calculation may in fact be regarded as the earliest
attempt at an exact determination of the constants of
nature. The method is the main resource of astronomers ;
Tycho, for instance, detected the slow diminution of the
obliquity of the> earth's axis, by the comparison of ob-
servations at long intervals. Living astronomers use the
method as much as earlier ones ; but so superior in ac-
curacy are all observations taken during the last hundred
years to all previous ones, that it is often found pre-
ferable to take a shorter interval, rather than incur the
risk of greater instrumental errors in the earlier observa-
tions.
