actually occurred in the history of the solar system. Olbers
sought for the minor planets or asteroids, on the sup-
position that they were fragments of an exploded or
fractured planet, and he was rewarded with the discovery
of some of them. /The retrograde motion of the satellites
of the more distant planets, the abnormal position of the
poles of Uranus and the excessive distance of Neptune, are
other indications of some violent event, of which we have
no other evidenced I adduce all these facts and argu-
ments, not to show that there is any appreciable proba-
bility, so far as we can judge, of actual interruption
within the scope of human history, but to/prove that the
Uniformity of Nature is theoretically consistent with the
most unexpected events of which we can form any con-
ception. /
Possible States of the Universe.
When we give the rein to scientific imagination, it
becomes apparent that conflict of body with body must
not be regarded as the rare exception, but as the general
rule and the inevitable fate of each star system/ 1 ( So far
as we can trace out the results of the law of gravitation,
and the dissipation of energy, the universe must be re-
garded as undergoing gradual condensation into a single
cold solid body of gigantic dimensions.) Those who so
frequently use the expression Uniformity of Nature, seem
to forget that the universe might exist consistently with
the laws of nature in the most diverse conditions. It
might consist, on the one hand, of a glowing nebulous mass
of gaseous substances. The heat might be so intense
that all elements, even carbon and silicon, would resemble
permanent gases, and all atoms, of whatever nature, would
be flying about in chemical independence, diffusing them-
selves almost uniformly in the neighbouring parts of
space. There would then be no life, unless we can
