UNITS AND STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT. 383
to reward the enormous labour which must be undertaken
in these calculations. Such labours once successfully com-
pleted must benefit the whole human race as long as it
shall exist. A valuable account of all the chief mathe-
matical tables yet published will be found in De Morgan's
article on Tables, in the 'English Cyclopaedia/ Division
of Arts and Sciences, vol. vii. p. 976.
Physical Constants.
The second class of constants contains those which refer
to the actual constitution of matter. For the most part
they depend upon the peculiarities of the chemical sub-
stance in question, but we may begin with those which
are of the most general character. In a first sub-class
we may place the velocity of light or heat undulations,
the numbers expressing the relation between the lengths
of the undulations, and. the rapidity of the undulations,
these numbers depending only on the properties of the
ethereal medium, and being probably the same in all parts
of the universe. The theory of heat gives rise to several
numbers of the highest importance, especially Joule's
mechanical equivalent of heat, the absolute zero of tempe-
rature, the mean temperature of empty space, &c.
Taking into account the diverse properties of the
elements we must have tables of the atomic weights,
the specific heats, the specific gravities, the refractive
powers, not only of the elements, but their almost in-
finitely numerous compounds. The properties of hardness,
elasticity, viscosity, expansion by heat, conducting powers
for heat and electricity, must also be determined in
immense detail. There are, however, certain of these
numbers which stand out prominently because they serve
as intermediate units or terms of comparison. Such are,
for instance, the absolute coefficients of expansion of air,
