74 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
perfect correspondence must be purely accidental, and
should give rise to suspicion rather than to satisfaction.
One remarkable result of the approximate character of
our observations is that we never could prove the existence
of perfectly circular or parabolic movement, even if it
existed. The circle is a singular case of the ellipse, for
which the eccentricity is zero ; it is infinitely improbable
than any planet, even if undisturbed by other bodies,
should have a circle for its orbit ; but if the orbit were
a circle we could never prove the entire absence of ec-
centricity. All that we could do would be to declare the
divergence from the circular form to be inappreciable.
Delambre was unable to detect the slightest ellipticity
in the orbit of Jupiter's first satellite, but he could only
infer that the orbit was nearly circular. The parabola is
the singular limit between the ellipse and the hyperbola.
As there are elliptic and hyperbolic comets, so we might
conceive the existence of a parabolic comet. Indeed if an
undisturbed comet fell towards the sun from an infinite
distance it would move in a parabola ; but we could never
prove that it so moved.
Substitution of Simple Hypotheses.
In truth men never can solve problems fulfilling the
complex circumstances of nature. All laws and explana-
tions are in a certain sense hypothetical, and apply exactly
to nothing which we can know to exist. In place of the
actual objects which we see and feel, the mathematician
invariably substitutes imaginary objects, only partially
resembling those represented, but so devised that the
discrepancies may not be of an amount to alter seriously
the character of the solution. When we probe the matter
to the bottom physical astronomy is as hypothetical as
Euclid's elements. There may exist in nature perfect
