of matter ; for were an exceedingly minute fraction of
existing matter to vanish in any experiment, say one
part in ten millions, we could never detect the loss.
Successive Approximations to Natural Conditions.
When we examine the history of scientific problems, we
find that one man or one generation is usually able to
make but a single step at a time. A problem is always
solved for the first time by making some bold hypothetical
simplification, upon which the next investigator makes
hypothetical modifications approaching more nearly to the
truth. Errors are successively pointed out in previous
solutions, until at last there might seem little more to be
desired. Careful examination, however, will show that an
indefinite series of minor inaccuracies remain to be cor-
rected and explained, were our powers of reasoning suffi-
ciently great, and the purpose adequate in importance.
Newton's successful solution of the problem of the
planetary movements entirely depended at first upon a
great but hypothetical simplification. The law of gravity
only applies directly to two infinitely small particles, so
that when we deal with vast globes like the earth, Jupiter,
or the sun, we have an immense aggregate of separate
attractions to deal with, and the law of the aggregate
need not coincide with the law of the elementary particles.
But Newton, by a great effort of mathematical reasoning,
was able to show that two homogeneous spheres of
matter act as if the whole of their masses were concen-
trated at the centres ; in short, that such spheres are
aggregates which manifest the simple law of gravity or
are centrobaric bodies (vol. i. p. 423). He was then able
with comparative ease to calculate the motions of the
planets on the hypothesis of their being spheres, and to
show that the results roughly agreed with observation.
