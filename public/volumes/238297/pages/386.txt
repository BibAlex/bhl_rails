360 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
wonderful advances which have been made in the practical
measurement of its efflux. The rude sun-dial or the
rising of a conspicuous star, gave points of reference, while
the flow of water from the clepsydra, the burning of a
candle, or, in the monastic ages, even the continuous
equable chanting of psalms, gave the means of roughly
subdividing periods, and marking the hours of the day and
night 6 . The sun and stars still furnish the standard of
time, but means of accurate subdivision have become
requisite, and this has been furnished by the pendulum
and the chronoscope. By the pendulum we can accurately
divide the day into seconds of time. By the chronograph
we can subdivide the second into a hundred, a thousand,
or even a million parts. Wheat stone measured the dura-
tion of an electric spark, and found it to be no more than
i oo part of a second, while more recently Captain Noble
has been able to appreciate intervals of time, not exceed-
ing the millionth part of a second.
When we come to inquire precisely what phenomenon
it is that we thus so minutely measure, we meet insur-
mountable difficulties. Newton distinguished time accord-
ing as it was absolute or apparent time, in the following
words :
' Absolute, true, and mathematical time of itself and
from its own nature, flows equably without regard to any-
thing external, and by another name is called duration;
relative, apparent and common time, is some sensible and
external measure of duration by the means of motion v .
Though we are perhaps obliged to assume the existence
of a uniformly increasing quantity which we call time,
e Sir Gr. C. Lewis gives many curious particulars concerning the mea-
surement of time, 'Astronomy of the Ancients,' pp. 241, &c.
