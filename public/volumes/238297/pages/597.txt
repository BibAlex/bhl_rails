QUANTITATIVE INDUCTION. 107
laws so nearly the same, that in no part of the variations
open to our observation can any discrepancy be discovered.
I grant that if two clocks could be shown to have kept
exactly the same time during one year, or any finite
interval of time, the probability would become infinitely
high that there was a connexion between their motions.
But it is apparent that we can never absolutely prove
such coincidences to exist. Allow that we may observe
a difference of one tenth or one hundredth of a second in
their time, yet it is just possible that they were independ-
ently regulated so as to go together within less than that
quantity of time. In short it would require either an in-
finitely long time of observation, or infinitely acute powers
of measuring a discrepancy to decide positively whether
two clocks were or were not in relation with each other.
A similar question actually occurs in the case of the
moon's motion. We have absolutely no record that any
other portion of the moon was ever visible to men than
such as we now see. This fact sufficiently proves that
within the historical period the rotation of the moon on its
own axis has coincided with its revolutions round the
earth. Does this coincidence prove a relation of cause
and effect to exist between these motions ? The answer
must be in the negative, because there might have been
so slight a discrepancy between the motions that there
has not yet been time to produce any appreciable effect.
There may nevertheless be a high probability of con-
nexion.
The whole question of the relation of quantities thus
resolves itself into one of probability. When we can
only rudely measure a quantitative result, we can assign
but slight importance to any correspondence. Because
the brightness of two stars seems to vary in the same-
manner there is no appreciable probability that they have
any relation with each other. Could it be shown that
