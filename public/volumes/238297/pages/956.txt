466 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
given purpose at a given moment. Like the pre-arranged
change of law in Babbage's Imaginary Calculating Machine,
there may exist pre-arranged surprises in the order of
nature, as it presents itself to us. Secondly, the same
Power, which created material nature, might, so far as
I can see, create additions to it, or annihilate portions
which do exist. Such events are doubtless inconceivable
to us in a certain sense ; yet they are no more inconceiv-
able than the existence of the world as it is. The in-
destructibility of matter, and the conservation of energy,
are very probable scientific hypotheses, which accord very
satisfactorily with experiments of scientific men during
a few years past, but it would be a gross misconception
of scientific inference to suppose that they are certain
in the sense that a proposition in geometry is certain,
or that any fact of direct consciousness is certain in it-
self. Philosophers no doubt hold that de nihilo nihil
jit, that is to say, their senses give them no means of
imagining to the mind how creation can take place.
But we are on the horns of a trilemma ; \we must either
deny that anything exists, or we must allow that it was
created out of nothing at some determinate date, or that
it existed from past eternity.] The first alternative is
absurd ; the other two seem to me equally conceivable.
Conclusion.
It may seem that there is one point where our specu-
lations must end^ namely, where contradiction begins! The
laws of Identity and Difference and Duality were the
very foundations from which we started, and they are, so
far as I can see, the foundation which we can never quit.)
Scientific Method must begin and end with the laws of
thought] but it does not follow that it will save us froni
encountering inexplicable, and at least apparently contra-/
