112 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
be written down on the unoccupied part of the slate, and
the proper series of combinations being chosen, the contra-
dictory combinations can be struck out with the pencil.
I have used a slate of this kind, which I call a Logical
Slate, for more than ten years, and it has saved me much
trouble. It is hardly possible to apply this process to
problems of more than six terms, owing to the large num-
ber of combinations which would require examination ;
thus seven terms would give 128 combinations, 'eight
terms 256, nine terms 512, ten terms 1024, eleven terms
2048, twelve terms 4096, and so on in geometrical pro-
gression.
Abstraction of Indifferent Circumstances.
There is a simple but highly important process of
inference which enables us to abstract, eliminate or disre-
gard all circumstances indifferently present and absent.
Thus if I were to state that *a triangle is a figure of
three sides, with or without equal angles/ the latter
qualification would be superfluous, because by a law of
thought I know that angles must be either equal or
unequal. To add the qualification gives no new know-
ledge since the existence of the two alternatives will be
understood in the absence of any information to the
contrary. Accordingly, when two alternatives differ only
as regards a single component term which is positive in
one and negative in the other, we may always reduce
them to one term by striking out their indifferent part.
It is really a process of substitution which enables us
to do this ; for having any proposition of the form
A = ABC | ABc, (i)
we know by the Law of Duality that
B = BC ! Be. (2)
Hence AB = ABC I ABc. (3)
