200 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
mains unreduced we may attempt to invent some widely
different mode of arriving at the same physical quantity,
so that we may be almost sure that the same cause of
error will not affect both the new and old results. In
some cases it is possible to find five or six essentially
different modes of arriving at the same determination.
Supposing that the discrepancy still exists we may well
begin to suspect that our direct measurements are correct,
but that the data employed in the theoretical calculations
are inaccurate. We must now review the grounds on
which these data depend, consisting as they must ulti-
mately do of direct measurements. A comparison of the
various recorded results will show the degree of proba-
bility attaching to the mean result employed ; and if there
is any ground for imagining the existence of error, we
should repeat the observations, and vary the forms of
experiment just as in the case of the previous direct
measurements. , The continued existence of the discre-
pancy must show that we have not really attained to a
complete acquaintance with the theory of the causes in
action, but two different cases still remain. We may have
misunderstood the action of those causes which do exist,
or we may have overlooked the existence of one or more
other causes. In the first case our hypothesis appears to be
wrongly chosen and inapplicable ; but whether we are to
reject it will depend upon whether we can form any other
hypothesis which yields a more accurate accordance. The
probability of an hypothesis, it will be remembered (vol. i.
p. 279), is to be judged entirely by the probability that if
the supposed causes exist the observed result follows ;
but as there is now very little probability of reconciling
the original hypothesis with our direct measurements the
field is open for new hypotheses, and any one which gives
a closer accordance with measurement will so far have
claims to attention. Of course we must never estimate
