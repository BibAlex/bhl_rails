336 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Real Exceptions to Supposed Laws.
The exceptions which we have lastly to consider,- are
perhaps the most important of all, since they lead to
the entire rejection of a law or theory before accepted.
No law of nature can fail ; there are no such things as
real exceptions. Where contradiction exists it must be in
the mind of the experimentalist. Either the law is
imaginary or the phenomena which conflict with it ; if,
then, by our senses we can satisfy ourselves of the actual
occurrence of the phenomena, the law must be rejected
as illusory. The followers of Aristotle held that nature
abhorred a vacuum, and thus accounted for the rise of
water in a pump. When Torricelli pointed out the visible
fact that water would not rise more than 33 feet in a
pump, nor mercury more than about 30 inches in a glass
tube, they attempted to represent these facts as limiting
exceptions, saying that nature abhorred a vacuum to a
certain extent and no further. But the Academicians
del Cimento completed their discomfiture by showing that
if we remove the pressure of the surrounding air, and
in proportion as we remove it, nature's feelings of abhor-
rence decrease and finally disappear altogether. Even
Aristotelian doctrines could not stand such direct contra-
diction.
Lavoisier's ideas concerning the constitution of acids
received complete refutation. He named oxygen the acid
generator, because he believed that all acids were com-
pounds of oxygen, a generalization based on insufficient
data. Berthollet, as early as 1789, proved by analysis that
hydrogen sulphide and prussic acid, both clearly acting
the part of acids, were devoid of oxygen; the former
might perhaps have been interpreted as a limiting excep-
tion, but when so powerful an acid as hydrogen chloride
