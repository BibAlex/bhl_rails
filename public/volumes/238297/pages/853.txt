CLASSIFICATION. 363
the isothermal surface is an ellipsoid with three unequal
axes.
In the remaining three classes, called the monoclinic,
diclinic, and triclinic, the axes are more or less oblique,
as described above (vol. ii. p. 360), and at the same time
unequal. The complication of phenomena is therefore
greatly increased, and it need only be stated that there
are always two directions in which a ray is singly re-
fracted, but that in all other directions double refraction
takes place. The conduction of heat is unequal in all
directions, the isothermal surface being an ellipsoid of
three unequal axes. The relations of such crystals to other
phenomena are often very complicated, and hardly yet
reduced to law. Thus some crystals, called pyro-electric,
manifest vitreous electricity at some points of their sur-
face, and resinous electricity at other points when rising
in temperature, the character of the electricity being
changed when the temperature sinks again. This pro-
duction of electricity is believed indeed to be connected
with the hemihedral character of the crystals exhibiting
it. The crystalline structure of a substance again influ-
ences its magnetic behaviour, the general law being that
the direction in which the molecules of a crystal are most
closely approximated tends to place itself axially or equa-
torially between the poles of a magnet, according as the
body is magnetic or diamagnetic. Further questions arise
if we apply pressure to crystals. Thus doubly refracting
crystals with one principal axis acquire two axes when
the pressure is perpendicular in direction to the principal
axis.
All the phenomena peculiar to crystalline bodies are
thus closely correlated with the formation of the crystal,
or will almost certainly be found to be so as investigation
proceeds. It is upon empirical observation indeed that
the laws of connexion are in the first place founded, but
