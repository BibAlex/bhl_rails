CHAPTEE XXI.
THEORY OF APPROXIMATION.
IN order that we may gain a true understanding of the
kind, degree, and value of the knowledge which we ac-
quire by experimental investigation, it is requisite that
we should be fully conscious of its approximate character.
We must learn to distinguish between what we can know
and cannot know between the questions which admit of
solution, and those which only seem to be solved. Many
persons may be misled by the expression exact science,
and may think that the knowledge acquired by scientific
methods admits of our reaching absolutely true laws,
exact to the last degree. There is even a prevailing
impression that when once mathematical formulae have
been successfully applied to a branch of science, this por-
tion of knowledge assumes a new nature, and admits of
reasoning of a higher character than those sciences which
are still unmathematical.
The very satisfactory degree of accuracy attained in the
science of astronomy gives a certain plausibility to erro-
neous notions of this kind. Some persons no doubt con-
sider it to be proved that planets move in ellipses, in such
a manner that all Kepler's laws hold exactly true ; but
there is a double error in any such notions. In the first
place, Kepler's laws are not proved, if by proof we mean
certain demonstration of their exact truth. In the next
place, even assuming Kepler's laws to be exactly true in a
