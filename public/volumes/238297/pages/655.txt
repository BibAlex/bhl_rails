EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE, EXPLANATION, &c. 165
the same way. Cultivation of plants probably arose, in
Mr. Darwin's opinion, from some such accident as the
seeds of a fruit falling upon a heap of refuse, and pro-
ducing an unusually fine variety. Even the use of fire
must, some time or other, have been discovered in a like
accidental manner.
With the progress of any branch of science, the element
of chance becomes much reduced. Not only are laws
discovered which enable results to be predicted, as we
shall shortly consider, but the systematic examination of
phenomena arid substances often leads to important and
novel discoveries, which can in no true sense be said to be
accidental. It has been asserted that the anaesthetic pro-
perties of chloroform were disclosed by a little dog smelling
at a saucerful of the liquid in a chemist's shop in Linlith-
gow, the singular effects upon the dog being reported
to Dr. Simpson, who turned the incident to such good
account. This story, however, has since been shown to
be a fabrication, the fact being that Dr. Simpson had for
many years being endeavouring to discover a better anaes-
thetic than those previously employed, and that he tested
the properties of chloroform, among other substances, at
the suggestion of Mr. Waldie, a Liverpool chemist. The
valuble powers of hydrate of chloral have since been dis-
covered in a like manner, and systematic inquiries are
continually being made into the therapeutic or economic
value of new chemical compounds.
If we must attempt to draw any conclusion concerning
the part which chance plays in scientific discovery, it
must be allowed that it more or less affects the success of
all inductive investigation, but becomes less important
with the progress of any particular branch of science.
Accident, too, may bring a new and valuable combination
to the notice of some person who had never expressly
searched for a discovery of the kind, and the probabilities
