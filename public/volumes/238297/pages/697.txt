ACCORDANCE OF QUANTITATIVE THEORIES, &c. 207
coincident results, a new method has sometimes disclosed
a discrepancy which it is yet impossible to explain.
The ellipticity of the earth is known with very con-
siderable approach to certainty and accuracy, for it has
been estimated in three independent ways. The most
direct mode is to measure long arcs extending north and
south upon the earth's surface, by means of trigonome-
trical surveys, and then to compare the lengths of these
arcs with the amount of their curvature as determined by
the observation of the altitude of certain stars at the ter-
minal points. The most probable ellipticity of the earth
deduced from all measurements of this kind was estimated
by Bessel at , though subsequent measurements might
lead to a slightly different estimate. The divergence from
a globular form causes a small variation in the force of
gravity in different parts of the earth's surface, so that
exact pendulum observations give the data for an entirely
independent estimate of the ellipticity, which is thus found
to be . In the third place the spheroidal protuberance
about the earth's equator leads to a certain inequality in
the moon's motion, as shown by Laplace ; and from the
amount of that inequality, as given by observations, Laplace
was enabled to calculate back to the amount of its cause.
He thus inferred that the ellipticity is , which lies be-
O^O
tween the two numbers previously given, and was con-
sidered by him to be the most satisfactory conclusion. In
this case the accordance is both close and undisturbed by
any other or subsequent results, so that we are obliged to
accept Laplace's result as a highly probable and accurate
one.
The mean density of the earth is another constant quan-
tity of the highest importance, because it forms the starting-
point for the determination of the masses of all the other
