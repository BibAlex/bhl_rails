CHARACTER OF THE EXPERIMENTALIST. 225
exact science , yet I certainly think that Faraday's expe-
riments were for the most part purely qualitative, and
that his mathematical ideas were of a rudimentary cha-
racter. It is true that he could not possibly investigate
such a subject as magne-crystallic action without involv-
ing himself in geometrical relations of considerable com-
plexity. I nevertheless think that he was deficient in
purely mathematical deductive power, that power which
is so exclusively developed by the modern system of
mathematical training at Cambridge. Faraday, for in-
stance, was perfectly acquainted with the forms of his
celebrated lines of force, but I am not aware that he ever
entered into the subject of the algebraic nature of those
curves, and I feel sure that he could not have explained
their form as depending on the resultant attraction of all
the magnetic particles acting according to general mathe-
matical laws. There are even occasional indications that
he did not understand some of the simpler mathematical
doctrines of modern physical science. Although he so
clearly foresaw the establishment of the unity of the
physical forces, and laboured so hard with his own hands
to connect gravity with the other forces, it is very doubt-
ful whether he understood the fundamental doctrine of
the conservation of energy as applied to gravitation.
Thus, while Faraday was probably equal to Newton in
experimental skill and deductive power as regards the
invention of simple qualitative experiments, he was con-
trasted to him in mathematical power. These two in-
stances are sufficient to show that minds of widely dif-
ferent conformation may meet with suitable regions of
research. Nevertheless, there are certain common traits
which we may discover in all the highest scientific minds.
