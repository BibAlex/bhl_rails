THE INDUCTIVE OR INVERSE METHOD. 291
separate probabilities contributed by each distinct hypo-
thesis.
To illustrate more precisely the method of solving the
problem, it is desirable to adopt some concrete mode of
representation, and the ballot-box, so often employed by
mathematicians, will best serve our purpose. Let the
happening of any event be represented by the drawing of
a white ball from a ballot-box, while the failure of an
event is represented by the drawing of a black ball. Now,
in the inductive problem we are supposed to be ignorant
of the contents of the ballot-box, and are required to
ground all our inferences on our experience of those con-
tents as shown in successive drawings. Rude common
sense w r ould guide us nearly to a true conclusion. Thus
if we had drawn twenty balls, one after another, replacing
the ball after each drawing, and the ball had in each case
proved to be white, we should believe that there was a
considerable preponderance of white balls in the urn, and
a probability in favour of drawing a white ball on the
next occasion. Though we had drawn white balls for
thousands of times without fail, it would still be possible
that some black balls lurked in the urn and would at last
appear, so that our inferences could never be certain. On
the other hand, if black balls came at intervals, I should
expect that after a certain number of trials the future
results would agree more or less closely with the past
ones.
The mathematical solution of the question consists in
nothing more than a close analysis of the mode in which
our common sense proceeds. If twenty white balls have
been drawn and no black ball, my common sense tells me
that any hypothesis which makes the black balls in the
urn considerable compared with the white ones is im-
probable ; a preponderance of white balls is a more pro-
bable hypothesis, and as a deduction from this more
