356 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
than in the following extract from the classical work of
Cuvier e :
' I doubt if any one would have divined, if untaught
by observation, that all ruminants have the foot cleft,
and that they alone have it. I doubt if any one would
have divined that there are frontal horns only in this
class : that those among them which have sharp canines
for the most part lack horns.
' However, since these relations are constant, they must
have some sufficient cause ; but since we are ignorant of
it, we must make good the defect of the theory by means
of observation : it enables us to establish empirical laws
which become almost as certain as rational laws when
they rest on sufficiently repeated observations ; so that
now whoso sees merely the print of a cleft foot may con-
clude that the animal which left this impression rumi-
nated, and this conclusion is as certain as any other in
physics or morals. This footprint alone, then, yields to
him who observes it, the form of the teeth, the form of
the jaws, the form of the vertebrae, the form of all the
bones of the legs, of the thighs, of the shoulders, and of
the pelvis of the animal which has passed by : it is a
surer mark than all those of Zadig/
We meet with a good instance of the purely empirical
correlation of circumstances when we classify the planets
of the solar system according to their densities or periods
of axial rotation f . If we examine a table specifying
the usual astronomical numbers of the solar system, we
find that four planets resemble each other very closely
in the period of axial rotation, and the same four planets
are all found to have high densities, thus :
