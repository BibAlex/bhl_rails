ANALYSIS OF QUANTITATIVE PHENOMENA. 403
difference between the judgment of observers at the
Greenwich Observatory usually varies from ~ to J of
a second, or even a little more, and remains pretty con-
stant for the same observers". In some observers it has
amounted to seven or eight-tenths of a second x . De
Morgan appears to have entertained the opinion that
this source of error was essentially incapable of elimina-
tion or correction y. But it seems clear that this personal
error might be determined absolutely with any desirable
degree of accuracy by test experiments, consisting in
making an artificial star move at a considerable distance
and recording by electricity the exact moment of its
passage over the wire. This method has in fact been
successfully employed in Leyden, Paris, and Neuchatel z .
Newton employed the pendulum for making experi-
ments on the impact of balls. Two balls were hung in
contact, and one of them, being drawn aside through a
measured arc, was then allowed to strike the other, the
arcs of vibration giving sufficient data for calculating the
distribution of energy at the moment of impact. The
resistance of the air was an interfering cause which he
estimated very simply by causing one of the balls to
make several complete vibrations and then marking the
reduction in the length of the arcs, a proper fraction
of which reduction was added to each of the other ob-
served arcs of vibration a .
In the modern use of the pendulum, to measure
terrestrial gravity, it is not found convenient to annul
