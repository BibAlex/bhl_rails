THE LA W OF ERROR. 449
determined, this method evidently resolves itself into
taking the mean of all the values given by observation.'
Encke, again, distinctly says m , that the expression for the
probability of an error ' not only contains in itself the
principle of the arithmetical mean, but depends so imme-
diately upon it, that for all those magnitudes for which
the arithmetical mean holds good in the simple cases in
which it is principally applied, no other law of proba-
bility can be assumed than that which is expressed by
this formula/
It can be shown, too, in a moment that the mean is the
result which gives the least sum of squares of errors.
For if a, b, c, &c., be the results of observation and x the
selected mean result, the sum of squares of the errors is
(a x) 2 + (b x) 2 + (c #) 2 + &c., which is at a minimum
when its differential coefficient 2 (a x + b x + cx-\-
&c.) o. From this equation we immediately obtain, de-
noting by n the number of separate results, a, b, c, &c.,
x = (a + b + c + . . . ) -, or the ordinary arithmetic mean.
Weighted Observations.
It is to be distinctly understood that when we take the
mean of certain numerical results as the most probable
number aimed at, we regard all the different results as
equally good and probable in themselves. The theory
of error expresses no preference for any one number over
any other. If, then, an observer has reason to suppose
that some results are not so trustworthy as others, he
must take account of this difference in drawing the mean.
By the method of weighting observations this difference of
value is easily allowed for. Astronomers are in the habit
