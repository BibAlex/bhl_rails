Determination of the Zero point by the Method
of Means.
There are a number of important observations in which
one of the chief difficulties consists iu defining exactly the
zero point from which we are to measure. We can point
a telescope with great precision to a star and can measure
the angle through which the telescope is raised or lowered
to a second of arc ; but all this precision will be useless
unless we can know exactly where the centre point of
the heavens is from which we measure, or, what comes to
the same thing, the horizontal line 90 distant from it.
Since the true horizon has reference to the figure of the
earth at the place of observation, we can only determine
it by the direction of gravity, as marked either by the
plumb-line or the surface of a liquid. The question re-
solves itself then irito the most accurate mode of observing
the direction of gravity, and as the plumb-line has long
been found hopelessly inaccurate, astronomers generally
employ the surface of mercury in repose as the criterion
of horizontality. They ingeniously observe the direction
of the surface by making a star the index. From the
Laws of Reflection it follows that the angle between the
direct ray from a star and that reflected from a surface
of mercury will be exactly double the angle between the
surface and the direct ray from the star. Hence the
horizontal or zero point is the mean between the apparent
place of any star or other very distant object and its
reflection in' mercury.
A plumb-line is perpendicular, or a liquid surface is hori-
zontal only in an approximate sense ; for any irregularity
of the surface of the earth, a mountain, or even a house
must cause some deviation by its attracting power. To
detect such deviation might seem very difficult, because
every other plumb-line or liquid surface would be equally
