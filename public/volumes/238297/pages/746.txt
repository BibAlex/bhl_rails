25G THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
planets, Vesta, Juno, &c., or from the perturbation of
Encke's Comet, the results are closely accordant, showing
that precisely the same law of gravity applies to the
most different bodies which we can observe. The gravity
or weight of a body, again, appears to be entirely inde-
pendent of its other physical conditions, being totally
unaffected by any alteration in the temperature, density,
electric or magnetic condition, or other physical proper-
ties of the substance.
One almost paradoxical result of the law of equal
gravitation is the theorem of Torricelli, to the effect that
all liquids of whatever density fall or flow with equal
rapidity. If there be two equal cisterns respectively filled
with mercury and water, the mercury, though thirteen
times as heavy, would flow from an aperture neither more
rapidly nor more slowly than the water, and the same
would be true of ether, alcohol, or any other liquids,
allowance being made for the resistance of the air, and the
differing viscosities of the liquids.
In its exact equality and its perfect independence of
every circumstance, except mass and distance, the force of
gravity stands apart from all the other forces and pheno-
mena of nature, and has not yet been brought into any
relation with them except through the general principle
of the conservation of energy. Magnetic attraction, as
remarked by Newton, follows a wholly different law as
depending upon the chemical quality and molecular struc-
ture of each particular substance.
We must remember that in saying ' all matter gravi-
tates,' we exclude from the term matter the basis of light-
undulations, which is almost infinitely more extensive
in amount, and obeys in many other respects the laws of
mechanics. This adamantine basis of undulations appears,
so far as can be ascertained, to be perfectly uniform in its
properties when existing in space unoccupied by matter.
