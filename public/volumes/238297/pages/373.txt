THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF PHENOMENA. 347
minute difference in the lengths of the waves makes a
very perceptible difference in the position of the point
at which two rays will interfere and produce darkness.
M. Fizeau has recently employed Newton's rings in an
inverse manner, to measure small amounts of motion. By
merely counting the number of rings of sodium mono-
chromatic light passing a certain point where two glass
plates are in close proximity, he is able to ascertain with
the greatest accuracy and ease the change of distance
between these glasses, produced, for instance, by the ex-
pansion of a metallic bar, connected with one of the glass
plates 11 .
Nothing excites more admiration than the mode in
which scientific observers can occasionally measure quan-
tities, which seem beyond the bounds of human obser-
vation. We know the average depth of the Pacific
Ocean to be 14,190 feet, not by actual sounding, which
would be impracticable in sufficient detail, but by noticing
the rate of transmission of earthquake waves from the
South American to the opposite coasts, the rate of move-
ment being connected by theory with the depth of the
water 1 . In the same way the average depth of the
Atlantic Ocean is inferred to be no less than 22,157 feet,
from the velocity of the ordinary tidal waves. A tidal
wave again gives beautiful evidence of an effect of the
law of gravity, which we could never in any other way
detect. Newton estimated that the moon's force in mov-

ing the ocean is onlv - -part of the whole force of

gravity, which even the pendulum, used with the utmost
skill, would fail to render apparent. Yet the immense
extent of the ocean allows the accumulation of the effect
into a very palpable amount ; and from the comparative
