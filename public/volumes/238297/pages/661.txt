results. The effects of even a few simple laws may be
infinitely diverse, and some of the most curious and
useful effects may remain undetected until accidental
observation brings them to our notice.
Predicted Discoveries.
The most interesting of the four classes of facts or
phenomena as specified in p. 157, is probably the third-
containing those the occurrence of which has been first
predicted by theory, and then verified by observation.
There is no more convincing proof of the soundness of
scientific knowledge than that it thus confers the gift
of foresight. Auguste Comte said that ' Prevision is the
test of true theory ; ' I should say that it is only one test
of true theory, but that which is most likely to strike the
public attention. Coincidence with fact is the test of true
theory, but when the result of theory is announced before-
hand, there can be no possible doubt as to the unpre-
judiced and confident spirit in which the theorist inter-
prets the results of his own theory.
The earliest instance of scientific prophecy is naturally
furnished by the science of Astronomy, which was the
earliest in development. Herodotus narrates 11 that, in
the midst of a battle between the Medes and Lydians, the
ofay was suddenly turned into night, and the event had
been foretold by Thales, the Father of Philosophy. A
cessation of the combat and a peace confirmed by mar-
riages was the immediate consequence of this happy
scientific effort. Much controversy has taken place con-
cerning the exact date of this occurrence, Baily assign-
ing the year 610 B.C., but Sir G-. B. Airy has lately
decided that the exact day was the 28th of May, 584 B.C.
