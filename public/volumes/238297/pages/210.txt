be that ' Two things of which one is equal and the other
unequal to a third common thing, are unequal to each
other/ An equality and inequality, in short, may give an
inequality, and this is equally true with the first axiom of
all kinds of quantity. If Venus, for instance, agrees with
Mars in density, but Mars differs from Jupiter, then Venus
differs from Jupiter. A third axiom must exist to the
effect that 'Things unequal to the same thing may or
may not be equal to each other/ Two inequalities give
no ground of inference whatever. If we only know, for
instance, that Mercury and Jupiter differ in density from
Mars, we cannot say whether or not they agree between
themselves. As a fact they do not agree ; but Venus and
Mars on the other hand both differ from Jupiter and yet
closely agree with each other. The force of the axioms
can be most clearly illustrated by drawing lines d .
The general conclusion must be then that where there is
equality there may be inference, but where there is not
equality there cannot be inference A plain induction will
lead us to believe that equality is the condition of inference,
concerning quantity. All the three axioms may in fact
be summed up in one, to the effect, that 'in whatever
relation one quantity stands to another, it stands in the
same relation to the equal of that other!
The active power is always the substitution of equals,
and it is an accident that in a pair of equalities we can
make the substitution in two ways. From a = b = c we
can infer a = c, either by substituting in a = b the value of
b as given in b = c, or else by substituting in b = c the
value of b as given in a = b. In a b ^ d we can make
but the one substitution of a for b. In e^f^g we can
make no substitution and get no inference.
In mathematics the relations in which terms may stand
to each other are far more varied than in pure logic, yet
