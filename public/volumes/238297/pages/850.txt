length : (i) they may be all equal, or (2) two equal and
one unequal, or (3) all unequal. They may also be varied
in four ways as regards direction : (i) they may be all at
right angles to each other ; (2) two axes may be at right
angles and the third perpendicular to one of them and
oWique to the other ; (3) two axes may be at right angles to
each other and the third oblique to both ; (4) the three
axes may be all oblique to each other. Now if all the
variations as regards length were combined with those
regarding direction, it would seem to be possible to have
twelve classes of crystals in all, the enumeration being-
then logically and geometrically complete. But as a
matter of empirical observation, many of "these classes are
not found to occur, oblique axes being seldom or never
equal. There remain in all seven distinct classes of
crystals, but even of these one class is not positively
known to be represented in nature.
The first class of crystals is defined by possessing three
equal rectangular axes, and equal elasticity in all direc-
tions. The primary or most simple form of the crystals
is the cube , but by the modification or removal of the
corners of the cube by planes variously inclined to the
axes, we have the regular octohedron, the dodecahedron,
or various combinations of these forms. Now it is a law
of this class of crystals that as each axis is exactly like
each of the other two, every modification of any corner of
a crystal must be repeated symmetrically with regard to
the other axes ; thus the forms produced are symmetri-
cal or regular, and the class is called the Regular System
of Crystals. It includes a great variety of substances,
some of them being elements, such as carbon in the form
of diamond, others more or less complex compounds, such
as rock-salt, potassium iodide and bromide, the several
kinds of alum, fluor-spar, iron bisulphide, garnet, spinelle,
&c. No correlation then is apparent between the form of
