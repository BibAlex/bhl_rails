METHOD OF VARIATIONS. 61
Periodic Variations.
A very large and important class of investigations are con-
cerned with Periodic Variations. We may define a periodic
phenomenon as one which, with the constant and uniform
change of the variable, returns time after time to the
same value. If we strike a pendulum it presently returns
to the point from which we disturbed it, and with the
uniform progress of time goes on making excursions and
returning, until stopped by the dissipation of its energy.
If one body in space approaches by gravity towards
another, they will revolve round each other in an elliptic
orbit, and return for an indefinite number of times to the
same relative positions. On the other hand a single body
projected into empty space, away from the action of any
extraneous force, would go on moving for ever in a
straight line, according to the first law of motion. In the
latter case the variation is called secular, because it pro-
ceeds during ages in a similar manner, and suffers no
jrepioSos or going round. It may be doubted whether
there really is any motion in the universe which is not
periodical. Mr. Herbert Spencer long since adopted the
doctrine that all motion is ultimately rhythmical P, and
abundance of evidence may be adduced in favour of his
view. The so-called secular acceleration of the moon's
motion is certainly periodic, and as, so far as we can tell,
no body is beyond the attractive power of other bodies,
rectilinear motion becomes purely hypothetical, or at least
infinitely improbable. All the motions of all the stars
must tend to become periodic. Though certain disturb-
ances in the planetary system seem to be uniformly pro-
gressive, Laplace is considered to have proved that they
really have their limits, so that after an almost infinitely
great time, all the planetary bodies might return to the
