of definition. Tastes of mixed or intermediate character
may exist almost ad infinitum, and, what is still more
troublesome, the tastes clearly united within one class
may differ more or less from each other, without our being
able to arrange them in subordinate genera and species.
The same remarks may be made concerning the classifi-
cation of odours, which may be roughly grouped according
to the arrangement of Linnaeus as, Aromatic, Fragrant,
Ambrosiac, Alliaceous, Fetid, Virulent, Nauseous. Within
each of these vague classes, however, there would be
infinite shades of variety, and each class would graduate
probably into each other class. The varieties of odour
which can be discriminated by an acute olfactory organ
are almost infinite ; every rock, stone, plant, or animal
has some slight odour, and it is well known that dogs, or
even blind human beings, can discriminate persons by a
slight distinctive odour which usually passes unnoticed.
Nearly similar remarks may be made concerning the
higher feelings of the human mind, usually called emotions.
We know what is anger, grief, fear, hatred, love ; and
many systems for classifying these feelings have been
proposed at one time or another. They may be roughly
distinguished according as they are pleasurable or painful,
prospective or retrospective, selfish or sympathetic, active
or passive, and possibly in many other ways, but each
mode of arrangement will be indefinite and unsatisfactory
when followed into details. As a general rule, the emo-
tional state of the mind at any moment will be neither
pure anger nor pure fear, nor any one pure feeling, but
an indefinite and complex aggregate of feelings. It may
be that the state of mind is really a sum of several distinct
modes of agitation, just as a mixed colour is the sum of
the several distinct rays of the spectrum. In this case
there may be more hope of some method of analysis being
successfully applied at some future time. But it may
