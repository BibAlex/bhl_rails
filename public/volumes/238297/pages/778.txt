288 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
countenance is now given to the notion by the somewhat
similar rate of propagation of nerve pulses and sound-
waves in soft bodies. But the phenomena of memory are
far more difficult to reduce to any material mechanism,
and I know of no material analogy but the interesting
one suggested by Hooke c , who likens memory to ' those
bells or vases which Vitruvius mentions to be placed in
the ancient theatre, which did receive and return the
sound more vigorous and strong; or like the unison-
toned strings, bells, or glasses, which receive impressions
from sounds without, and retain the impressions for some
time, answering the tone by the same tone of their own.'
Analogy in the Mathematical Sciences.
Whoever wishes to acquire a deep acquaintance witli
the constitution of Nature must observe that there are
deep analogies which connect whole branches of science in
a parallel manner, and enable us to infer of one class of
phenomena what we know of the other. It has thus
happened on several occasions that the discovery of
an unsuspected analogy between two hitherto distinct
branches of knowledge has been the starting-point for a
rapid course of discovery. The truths readily observed
in the one may be of a different character from those
which present themselves in the other. The analogy,
when once pointed out, leads us easily to discover regions
of one science yet undeveloped, but to which the key is
furnished by the corresponding truths in the other
science. An interchange of aid most wonderful in its
results may thus take place, and at the same time the
mind rises to a higher generalization, and a more com-
prehensive view of mind and nature.
