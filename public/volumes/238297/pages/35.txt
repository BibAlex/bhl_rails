INTRODUCTION.
mistakes in arguments of very moderate complexity, and
we sometimes only discover our mistakes by a collision
between our mental expectations and the events of ob-
jective nature.
Mr. Herbert Spencer holds that the laws of logic are
objective laws f , and he regards the mind as being in
a state of constant education, each act of false reasoning
or miscalculation leading to results which are likely to
prevent similar mistakes from being again committed.
I am quite inclined to accept such ingenious views ; but
at the same time it is necessary to distinguish between
the accumulation of knowledge and experience, and the
constitution of the mind which allows of the acquisition
of knowledge. Before the mind can perceive or reason
at all it must have the conditions of thought impressed
upon it. Before a mistake can be committed, the mind
must clearly distinguish the mistaken conclusion from all
other assertions. Are not the Laws of Identity and
Difference the prior conditions of all consciousness and
all existence 1 Must they not hold true, alike of things
material and immaterial 1 and if so, can we say that
they are only subjectively true or objectively true ? I
am inclined, in short, to regard them as true both 'in
the nature of thought arid things/ as I expressed it in.
my first logical essays, and I hold that they belong to
the common basis of all existence. But this is one of
the most profound and difficult questions of psychology
and metaphysics which can be raised, and it is hardly
one for the logician to decide. As the mathematician does
not inquire into the nature of unity and plurality, but
developes the formal laws of plurality, so the logician,
as I conceive, must assume the truth of the Laws of
