QUANTITATIVE INDUCTION. 129
simple proportion to the mass of each of the attracting
bodies, the mass being measured by, or proportional to
inertia. Similarly, in all cases of ' direct unimpeded
action,' as Sir J. Herschel has remarked x , we may expect
simple proportion to manifest itself. In such cases the
equation expressing the relation may have the still
simpler form y = mx.
A similar simple relation holds true wherever there
is a conversion of one substance or form of energy into
another. The quantity of chloride of silver is propor-
tional to the quantity either of chlorine or silver. The
amount of heat produced in friction is exactly propor-
tional to the mechanical energy absorbed. It was ex-
perimentally proved by Faraday that f the chemical
power of the current of electricity is in direct proportion
to the quantity of electricity which passes/ When an
electric current is produced, the quantity of electric
energy is simply proportional to the weight of metal
dissolved. If electricity is turned into heat, there is
again simple proportion. Wherever, in fact, one thing
is but another thing with a new aspect, we may expect to
find the law of simple proportion. It is only among the
most elementary causes and effects that this simple re-
lation will hold true. Simple conditions do not, generally
speaking, produce simple results. The planets move in
approximate circles round the sun, but the apparent
motions, as seen from the earth, are so various, that men
have not believed in such a simple view of the matter
for more than about two centuries and a half. All those
motions, again, are summed up in the law of gravity,
of no great complexity, yet men never have, and never
can be, able to exhaust the complications of action and
reaction, even among a small number of planets. We
should be on our guard against a tendency to assume that
