erroneous in one direction as ^ (b -f c) in the other, so
that the mean of these two means, or what is the same,
J (a + 2 b + c), will be exceedingly near to the point of
rest . A still closer approximation may be made by
taking four readings and reducing them by the formula
-J- (a + 2 b + 2 c + d).
The accuracy of Baily's experiments, directed to deter-
mine the density of the earth, entirely depended upon this
mode of observing oscillations. The balls whose gravi-
tation was measured were so delicately suspended by a
torsion balance that they never came to rest. The ex-
treme points of the oscillations were observed both when
the heavy leaden attracting ball was on one side and on the
other. The difference of the mean points when the leaden
ball was on the right hand and that when it was on the
left hand gave double the amount of the deflection.
A most beautiful instance of the mode of avoiding the
use of a zero point is to be found in Mr. E. J. Stone's
observations on the radiated heat of the fixed stars. The
great difficulty in these observations arose from the com-
paratively great amounts of heat which were sent into the
telescope from the atmosphere, and which were sufficient
almost entirely to disguise the feeble heat rays of a star.
But Mr. Stone fixed at the focus of his telescope a double
thermo-electric pile of which the two parts were reversed
in order. Now any disturbance of temperature which
acted upon both piles uniformly produced no effect
upon the galvanometer needle, and when the rays of the
star were made to fall alternately upon one pile and
the other, the total amount of the deflection represented
double the heating power of the star. Thus Mr. Stone
was able to detect with much certainty a heating effect
of the star Arcturus, which even when concentrated
by the telescope amounted only to r|-^th of a degree
