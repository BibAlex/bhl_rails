THE THEORY OF PROBABILITY. 2S3
distinguished into two or more simpler events. Thus
the firing of a gun may be distinguished into pulling the
trigger, the fall of the hammer, the explosion of the cap,
&c. In this example the simple events are not' inde-
pendent, because if the trigger is pulled, the other events
will under proper conditions necessarily follow, and their
probabilities are therefore the same as that of the first
event. Events are independent when the happening of
one does not render the other either more or less probable
than before. Thus the death of a person is neither more
nor ]ess probable because the planet Mars happens to be
visible. When the component events are independent,
a simple rule can be given for calculating the probability
of the compound event, thus Multiply together the frac-
tions expressing the probabilities of the independent
component events.
The probability of throwing tail twice with a penny
^ s i x i> or 4 > the probability of throwing it three times
running is -| x J x -Jr, or -^ ; a result agreeing with that
obtained in an apparently different manner (p. 230). In
fact when we multiply together the denominators, we get
the whole number of ways of happening of the compound
event, and when we multiply the numerators, we get the
number of ways favourable to the required event.
Probabilities may be added to or subtracted from each
other under the important condition that the events in
question are exclusive of each other, so that not more than
one of them can happen. It might be argued that as
the probability of throwing head at the first trial is -Jr, and
at the second trial also ^, the probability of throwing
it in the first two throws is ^ + ^, or certainty. Not only
is this result evidently absurd, but a repetition of the
process would lead us to a probability of i^ or of any
greater number, results which could have no meaning
whatever. The probability we wish to calculate is that of
