THE EQUIVALENCY OF PROPOSITIONS. 135
Although in these and many other cases the equivalents
of certain propositions can readily be given, yet I believe
that no uniform and infallible process can be pointed out
by which the exact equivalents of premises can be ascer-
tained. Ordinary deductive inference usually gives us
only a portion of the contained information. It is true
that the combinations consistent with a set of propositions
are logically equivalent to them, but the difficulty consists
in passing back from the combinations to a new set of
propositions. The task is here of a different character
from any which we have yet attempted. It is in reality
an inverse process, and is just as much more troublesome
and uncertain than the direct process, as seeking is com-
pared with hiding. Not only may several different answers
equally apply, but there is no method of discovering any
of those answers except by repeated trial. The problem
which we have here met is really that of induction, the
inverse of deduction ; and, as I shall soon show, induction
is always tentative, and unless conducted with peculiar
skill and insight must be exceedingly laborious in cases of
any considerable complexity.
The late Professor de Morgan was unfortunately led
by this equivalency of propositions into the most serious
error of his ingenious system of Logic. He held that
because the proposition ' All A's are all B's,' was but
another expression for the two propositions 'All A's are
B's ' and ' All B's are A's/ it must be a composite and not
really an elementary form of proposition 1 . But on taking
a general view of the equivalency of propositions such an
objection seems to have no weight. Logicians have, with
few exceptions, persistently upheld the original error of
Aristotle in rejecting from their science the one simple
