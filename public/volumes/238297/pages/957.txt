RESULTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD. 467
dictory results. The very nature of continuous quantity
leads us into extreme difficulties. /Any finite length is
composed of an infinite number of infinitely small spaces,]
each of which, again, is composed of an infinite number of
spaces of a second order of infinite smallness ; these spaces
of the second order are composed, again, of infinitely small
spaces of the third order. [ Even these spaces of the third
order are not absolute geometrical points answering to
Euclid's definition of a point, as position without mag-
nitude./ 1 Go on as far as we will, in the subdivision of
continuous quantity, yet we never get down to the ab-
solute point. Thus Scientific Method leads us to the
inevitable conception of an infinite series of successive
orders of infinitely small quantities. If so, there is nothing
impossible in the existence of a myriad universes within
the compass of a needle's point, each with its stellar sys-
tems, and its suns and planets, in number and variety
unlimited. Science does nothing to reduce the number
of strange things that we may believe. When fairly
pursued it makes large drafts upon our powers of com-
prehension and belief.
I Some of the most precise and beautiful theorems in
mathematical science seem to me to involve apparent con-
tradiction. ] Can we imagine that a point moving along
a perfectly straight line towards the west, would ever
get round to the east and come back again, having
performed a circuit through infinite space, as it were,
yet without ever diverging from a perfectly straight
direction 1 Yet this is what happens to the intersecting
point of two straight lines, when, being in the same
plane, one line revolves about a fixed point. The same
principle is exhibited in the hyperbola, which may be
regarded as an infinite ellipse, one extremity of which
has passed to an infinite distance and come back in
the opposite direction. A varying quantity may change
