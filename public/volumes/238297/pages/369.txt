modes. When the moon is exactly half full, the moon,
sun, and earth, are at the angles of a right-angled triangle.
He proposed therefore at such a time to measure the
moon's elongation from the sun, which would give him
the two other angles of the triangle, and enable him to
judge of the comparative distances of the moon and sun
from the earth. His result, though very rude, was far
more accurate than any notions previously entertained,
and enabled him to form some estimate of the comparative
magnitudes of the bodies. Eclipses of the moon were also
very useful in ascertaining the longitudes of the stars,
which were invisible when the sun w r as above the horizon.
For the moon when eclipsed must be 180 distant from
the sun ; hence it was only requisite to measure the
distance of a fixed star in longitude from the eclipsed
moon to obtain with ease its angular distance from the
sun.
In later times the eclipses of Jupiter have usefully
served to give a measure of an angle ; for at the middle
moment of the eclipse the satellite must be exactly in the
same straight line with the planet and sun, so that we
can learn from the known laws of movement of the
satellite the longitude of Jupiter as seen from the sun.
If at the same time we measure the elongation or ap-
parent angular distance of Jupiter from the sun, as seen
from the earth, we have all the angles of the triangle
between Jupiter, the sun, and the earth, and can cal-
culate the comparative magnitudes of the sides of the
triangle by simple trigonometry.
The transits of Venus over the sun's face are other
natural events which seem to give most accurate measure-
ments of the sun's parallax, or apparent difference of
position as seen from distant points of the earth's surface.
The sun forms a kind of background on which the place
of the planet is marked, and serves as a measuring instru-
