20 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
one term is identical with that denoted by the other in
everything except the names. The general formula
A = B
must be taken to mean that A and B are symbols for the
same object or group of objects. This identity may some-
times arise from the mere imposition of names, but it
may also arise from the deepest laws of the constitution
of nature ; as when we say
Gravitating matter = Matter possessing inertia,
Exogenous plants = Dicotyledonous plants,
Plagihedral quartz crystals = Quartz crystals rotating
the plane of polarisation of light.
We shall need carefully to distinguish between relations
of terms which can be modified at our own will and those
which are fixed as expressing the laws of nature ; but at
present we are considering only the mode of expression.
We may sometimes, but much less frequently, require a
symbol to indicate difference or the absence of complete
sameness. For this purpose we may generalise in like
manner the symbol **> , which was introduced by Wallis to
signify difference between two numbers or quantities.
The general formula
B - C
denotes that B and C are the names of some two objects
or groups of objects which are not identical with each
other. Thus we may say
Acrogens **> Flowering plants.
Snowdon +> The highest mountain in Great Britain.
I shall also occasionally use the sign to signify in the
most general manner the existence of any relation between
the two terms connected by it. Thus o* might mean not
only the relations of equality or inequality, sameness or
difference, but any special relation of time, place, size,
causation, &c. in which one thing may stand to another.
By A**B I mean, then, any two objects of thought re-
lated to each other in any matter whatsoever.
