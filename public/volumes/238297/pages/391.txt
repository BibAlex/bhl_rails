UNITS AND STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT. 3G5
spring could be observed with the requisite accuracy. We
thus appear to be devoid of any hope of establishing a
sure standard of the efflux of time.
The Unit of Space and the Bar Standard.
Next in importance after the measurement of time is
that of space. Time comes first in theory, because pheno-
mena, our internal thoughts for instance, may change in
time without regard to space magnitude. As to the phe-
nomena of outward nature, they tend more and more to re-
solve themselves into the motion of molecules, and motion
cannot be conceived or measured without reference both
to time and space.
Turning now to space measurements, we find it almost
equally difficult to fix and define once and for ever, a unit
magnitude. There are three different modes in which
it has been proposed to attempt the perpetuation of a
standard length.
1 i ) By constructing an actual specimen of the standard
yard or metre, in the form of a bar.
(2) By assuming the globe itself to be the ultimate
standard of magnitude, the practical unit being a sub-
multiple of some dimension of the globe.
(3) By adopting the length of a simple pendulum,
beating .seconds as a standard of reference.
At first sight it might seem that there was no great
difficulty in this matter, and that any one of these methods
might serve well enough ; but the more minutely we
inquire into the details, the more hopeless appears to be
the attempt to establish an invariable standard. We must
in the first place point out a principle not of an obvious
character, namely, that the standard length must be defined
by one single object 1 . To make two bars of exactly the
