and scientific importance may attach even to such ap-
parently trifling observations as that ' white cats having
blue eyes are deaf c /
The process of inference by which all such truths are
obtained may readily be exhibited in a precise symbolic
form. We must have one premise specifying in a dis-
junctive form all the possible individuals which belong
to a class ; we resolve the class, in short, into its con-
stituents. We then need a number of propositions each
of which affirms that one of the individuals possesses a
certain property. Thus the premises must be of the
form
A= BlCtDl -I-P-I-Q
B = BX
C = CX
Q-QX.
Now if we substitute for each alternative of the first
premise its description as found among the succeeding
premises we obtain
A = BX!CX! !PX|QX
or
A = (BIG I- |.Q)X.
