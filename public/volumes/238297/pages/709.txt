CHARACTER OF THE EXPERIMENTALIST. 219
science and the organization of enormous and well dis-
ciplined armies has not decreased the value of a skilful
general ; on the contrary, the rank and file are still more
in need than the} 7 used to be of the guiding power of an
ingenious and far-seeing intellect. The swift destruction
of the French military power was not due alone to the
perfection of the German army, nor to the genius of
Moltke ; it was due to the combination of a well-disci-
plined multitude, with a leader of the highest intellectual
powers. So in every branch of human affairs the influence
of the individual is not withering, but is growing with
the extent of the material resources which are at his
command.
Nature of Genius.
Turning to our own particular subject, it is a work of
undiminished interest to reflect upon those qualities of
mind which lead to great advances in natural knowledge.
Nothing, indeed, is less amenable than genius to scientific
analysis and explanation. Even precise definition is out
of the question. Buffon said that ' genius is patience,'
and certainly patience is one of its most constant and
requisite components. But no one can suppose that
patient labour alone will invariably lead to those con-
spicuous results which we attribute to genius. In every
branch of science, literature, art, or industry, there are
thousands of men and women who work with unceasing
patience, and thereby ensure at least a moderate success ;
but it would be absurd to assent for a moment to crude
notions of human equality, and to allow that equal
amounts of intellectual labour yield equal results. A
Newton may modestly and sincerely attribute his dis-
coveries to industry and patient thought, and there is
much reason to believe that genius is essentially uncon-
scious and unable to account for its own peculiar powers.
