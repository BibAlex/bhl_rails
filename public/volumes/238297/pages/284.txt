258 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
and the patients, as concur in the producing of the effect
propounded ; all which existing together, it cannot be
understood but that the effect existeth with them ; or
that it can possibly exist if any of them be absent/
Dr. Brown, in his * Essay on Causation/ gave a nearly
corresponding statement. *A cause,' he says e , 'may be
denned to be the object or event which immediately
precedes any change, and which existing again in similar
circumstances will be always immediately followed by a
similar change/ Of the kindred word power, he like-
wise says : f ' Power is nothing more than that invariable-
ness of antecedence which is implied in the belief of
causation/
These definitions may be accepted with the qualifica-
/ tion that our knowledge of causes in such a sense can
/ be probable only. The work of science consists in ascer-
V taining the combinations in which phenomena present
themselves.. Concerning every event we shall have to
determine its probable conditions, or group of antecedents
from which it probably follows. An antecedent is any-
thing which exists prior to an event ; a consequent is
anything which exists subsequently to an antecedent. It
will not usually happen that there is any probable con-
nection between an antecedent and consequent. Thus
nitrogen is an antecedent to the lighting of a common
\ fire ; but it is so far from being a cause of the lighting,
that it renders the combustion less active. Daylight is
an antecedent to all fires lighted during the day, but it
probably has no appreciable effect one way or the other.
But in the case of any given event it is usually pos-
sible to discover a certain number of antecedents which
