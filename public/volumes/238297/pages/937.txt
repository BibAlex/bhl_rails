RESULTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD. 447
mately fixed by scientific inference. It is progressing
towards a state in which the available energy of
matter will be dissipated through infinite surrounding
space, and all matter will become cold and lifeless. ( This
constitutes, as it were, the historical period of physical
science, that over which our scientific insight may more
or less extend. But in this, as in other cases, we have
no right to interpret our experience negatively, so as to
infer that because the present state of things began at
a particular time, there was no previous existence. It
may be that the present period of material existence is
but one of an indefinite series of like periods. All that
we can see, and feel, and infer, and reason about may
be, as it were, but a part of one single pulsation in the
existence of the universe.
After Sir W. Thomson had pointed out the prepon-
derating tendency which now seems to exist towards the
conversion of all energy into heat-energy, and its equal
diffusion by radiation throughout space, the late Pro-
fessor Rankine put forth a remarkable speculation k . He
suggested that the ethereal, or rather, as I have called it,
the adamantine medium in which all the stars exist, and
all radiation takes place, may have bounds, beyond which
only empty space may exist. All heat undulations reach-
ing this boundary wiU be totally reflected, according to the
theory of undulations, and will in all probability be recon-
centrated into foci situated in many parts of the medium.
Whenever a cold and extinct star happens to pass through
one of these foci, it will be instantly ignited and resolved
by intense heat into its constituent elements. A discon-
tinuity will occur in the history of that portion of matter,
and the star will begin its history afresh with a renewed
store of energy.
This is doubtless a mere speculation, incapable of veri-
