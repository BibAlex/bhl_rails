CHAPTER XV.
ANALYSIS OF QUANTITATIVE PHENOMENA.
IN the two preceding chapters we have been engaged
in considering how a phenomenon may be accurately
measured and expressed. So delicate and complex an
operation is a measurement which pretends to any con-
siderable degree of exactness, that no small part of the
skill and patience of physicists is usually spent upon this
operation. Much of this difficulty arises from the fact that
it is scarcely ever possible to measure one simple pheno-
menon at a time. The ultimate object must be to discover
the mathematical equation or law connecting a quantitative
cause with its quantitative effect ; this purpose usually
involves, as we shall see, the varying of one condition at
a time, the other conditions being maintained constant.
The labours of the experimentalist would be comparatively
light if he could carry out this rule of varying one circum-
stance at a time. He would then obtain a series of cor-
responding values of the variable quantities concerned,
from which he might by proper hypothetical treatment
obtain the required law of connexion. But in reality
it is seldom possible to carry out this direction except
in an approximate manner. Before then we proceed to
the consideration of the actual process of quantitative
induction, it is necessary to review the several devices
by which the complication of effects can be disentangled.
Every phenomenon measured will usually be the sunij
difference or product of two or more different effects,
and these must be in some way analysed and separately
