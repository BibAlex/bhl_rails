200 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
of all these important profes c ions is but to form reasonable
conjectures concerning the several objects which engage
their attention, and all wise conjectures are the results of
a just and careful examination of the several different
effects that may possibly arise from the causes that are
capable of producing them/ c
Distinction of Combinations and Permutations.
We must at once consider the deep difference which
exists between Combinations and Permutations; a dif-
ference involving important logical principles, and in-
fluencing the form of all our mathematical expressions.
In permutation we recognise varieties of order or arrange-
ment, treating AB as a different group from BA. In
combination we take notice only of the presence or
absence of a certain thing, and pay no regard to its
place in order of time or space. Thus the four letters
a, e, m, n can form but one combination, but they occur
in language in several permutations, as name, amen,
mean, mane.
We have hitherto been dealing with purely logical
questions, involving only combination of qualities. I have
fully pointed out in more than one place that, though our
symbols could not but be written in order of place and
read in order of time, the relations expressed had no
regard to place or time (pp. 40, 131). The Law of Com-
mutativeness, in fact, expresses the condition that in logic
we deal with combinations, and the same law is true
of all the processes of algebra. In nature and art, order
may be a matter of indifference ; it makes no difference,
for instance, whether gunpowder is a mixture of sulphur,
carbon and nitre, or carbon, nitre and sulphur, or nitre, sul-
phur and carbon, provided that the substances are present in
