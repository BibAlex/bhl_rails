108 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
become apparent that there is a close connection between
these combinations and the most fundamental theorems of
mathematical science. For the convenience of the reader
who may wish to employ the abecedarium in logical
questions, I have had printed on the next page a complete
series of the combinations up to those of six terms. At
the very commencement in the first column is placed a
single letter X which might seem to be superfluous. This
letter serves to denote that it is always some higher class
which is divided up. Thus the combination AB really
means ABX, or that part of some larger class, say X,
which has the qualities of A and B present. The letter
X is omitted in the greater part of the table merely for
the sake of brevity and clearness. In a later chapter on
Combinations it will become apparent that the intro-
duction of this unit class is requisite in order to com-
plete the analogy with the Arithmetical Triangle there
described.
The reader ought to bear in mind that though the
abecedarium seems to give mere lists of combinations,
these combinations are intended in every case to con-
stitute the development of a term of a proposition.
Thus the four combinations AB, A&, aB, ab really mean
that any class X is described by the following proposition,
X = X (AB I Ab | aB ! ab).
If we select the A's, we obtain the following proposition
AX = X(AB I Aft).
Thus whatever group of combinations we treat must be
conceived as part of a higher class, summum genus or
universe symbolised in the term X ; but bearing this in
mind, it is needless to complicate our formulae by always
introducing the letter. All inference consists in passing
from propositions to propositions, and combinations per se
have no meaning. They are consequently to be regarded
in all cases as forming parts of propositions.
