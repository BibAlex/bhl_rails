THE THEORY OF PROBABILITY. 241
probabilities that A is B, J and that B is C, ^, we have
no right to suppose that the probability of A being C /
is reduced by the argument in its favour. If the conclu- j
sion is true on its own grounds, the failure of the argument \
does not affect it ; thus its total probability is its ante-
cedent probability, added to the probability that this
failing, the new argument in question establishes it.
There is a probability ^ that we shall not require the
special argument ; a probability -| that we shall, and
a probability ^ that the argument does in that case
establish it. Thus the complete result is \ + ^ x ^, or -|.
In general language, if a be the probability formed on
a particular argument, and c the antecedent probability,
then the general result is
i ( i - a) ( i c), or a + c ac.
We may put it still more generally in this way : Let
a, b, c, d, &c., be the probabilities of a conclusion grounded
on various arguments or considerations of any kind. It is
only when all the arguments fail that our conclusion
proves finally untrue ; the probabilities of each failing
are respectively i a, i b, i c, &c. ; the probability
that they will all fail ( i a) ( i b) ( i c) . . . ; therefore
the probability that the conclusion will not fail is
i (i a)(i 6)(i c)...&c. On this principle it follows^
that every argument in favour of a fact, however flimsy |i
and slight, adds probability to it. When it is unknown
whether an overdue vessel has foundered or not, every
slight indication of a lost vessel will add some proba-
bility to the belief of its loss, and the disproof of any
particular evidence will riot disprove the event.
We must apply these principles of evidence with great
care, and observe that in a great proportion of cases the
adducing of a weak argument does tend to the disproof of
its conclusion. The assertion may have in itself great
inherent improbability as being opposed to other evidence
