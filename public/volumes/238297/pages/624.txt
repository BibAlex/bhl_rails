134 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
regretted that no distinct theory of the constitution of
comets had guided his observations of Halley's comet a ; in
attempting to verify or refute any good hypothesis, not
only would there have been a chance of establishing a true
theory, but if confuted, the very confutation would pro-
bably have involved a large store of useful observations.
It would be an interesting work, but one which I can-
not undertake, to trace out the gradual reaction which has
taken place in recent times against the purely empirical,
or Baconian, theory of induction. Francis Bacon, seeing
the futility of the scholastic logic, which had long been
predominant, asserted that the accumulation of facts and
the careful and orderly abstraction of axioms, or general
laws from them, constituted the true method of induction.
This method, as far as we can gather its exact nature
from Bacon's writings, would correspond to the process of
exhaustive examination and classification to which I
e just alluded. JThe value of this method might be
estimated historically by the fact that it has not been
ollowed by any of the great masters of science. Whether
we look to Galileo, who preceded Bacon, to Gilbert, his
contemporary, or to Newton and Descartes, his successors,
we find that discovery was achieved by the exactly
opposite method to that advocated by Bacon. Through-
out Newton's works, as I shall more fully show in suc-
ceeding pages, we find deductive reasoning wholly pre-
dominant, and experiments are employed, as they should
be, to confirm or refute hypothetical anticipations of
nature. In my 'Elementary Lessons in Logic' (p.
258), I stated my belief that there was no kind of
reference to Bacon in Newton's works. I have since
found that Newton does once or twice employ the
a Tyndall, ' On Cometary Theory,' Philosophical Magazine, April,
1869. 4th Series, vol. xxxvii. p. 243.
