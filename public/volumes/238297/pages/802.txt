312 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
true faces, but surfaces produced by the orderly junction
of an immense number of distinct thin crystalline plates,
each plate being in fact a separate crystal, in which the
laws of crystallography are strictly observed. The rough-
ness of the supposed face, the striae detected by the
microscope, or inference by continuity from other speci-
mens where the true faces of the plates are clearly seen,
prove the purely mistaken character of the supposed
exception.
In tracing out the isomorphic relations of the elements,
great perplexity has often been caused by mistaking
one substance for another. It was pointed out that
though arsenic was supposed to be isomorphous with
phosphorus, the arseniate of soda crystallized in a form
distinctly different from that of the corresponding phos-
phate. Some chemists held this to be a fatal objection
to the doctrine of isomorphism ; but it was afterwards
pointed out by Clarke, that the arseniate and phosphate
in question were not corresponding compounds, as they
differed in regard to the water of crystallization . Vana-
dium again appeared to be an exception to the laws of
isomorphism, until it was proved by Professor Boscoe, that
what Berzelius supposed to be metallic vanadium was
really an oxide of vanadium d .
In the science of crystallography many other apparent
exceptions present themselves, and sometimes cause con-
siderable perplexity. Four of the faces of a regular octa-
hedron may become so enlarged in the crystallization of
iron pyrites and some other substances, that the other
four faces become altogether imperceptible and a regular
tetrahedron appears to be produced, contrary to the laws
of crystallographic symmetry. Many other crystalline
