THEORY OF APPROXIMATION. 81
could not reconcile with the law. Euler and Clairaut
who were, with D'Alembert, the first to apply the full
powers of mathematical analysis to the theory of gravita-
tion as explaining the perturbations of the planets, did
not treat the law as sufficiently established to attribute
all discrepancies to the errors of calculation and obser-
vation. In short, they did not feel certain that the force
of gravity exactly obeyed the well known rule. The
law might have involved other powers of the distance.
It might have been expressed, for example, in the form
a b c
' + D + & + W + '
and the coefficients a and c might have been so small
that those terms would only become apparent in very
accurate comparisons with fact. Attempts have been
made from time to time to account for difficulties, by
attributing value to such neglected terms. Gauss at
one time thought that the even more fundamental prin-
ciple of gravity, that the force is dependent only on
mass and distance, might not be exactly true, and he
undertook accurate pendulum experiments to test this
opinion. Only as these repeated doubts have been time
after time resolved in favour of the law of Newton, has it
been assumed as precisely correct. But this belief does not
rest on experiment or observation only. The calculations
of physical astronomy, however accurate, could never show
that the other terms of the above general expression were
absolutely devoid of value. It could only be shown that
they had such slight value as never to become apparent.
There are, however, other theoretical reasons why the
law is probably complete and true as commonly stated.
Whatever influence or power spreads from a point, and
expands uniformly through space, will doubtless vary in-
versely in intensity as the square of the distance, simply
because the area over which it is spread increases as the
