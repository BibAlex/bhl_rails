ANALYSIS OF QUANTITATIVE PHENOMENA. 397
In some rudimentary experiments we may wish merely
to establish the existence of a quantitative effect without
precisely measuring its amount ; if there exist causes of
error of which we can neither render the amount known
or inappreciable, the best way will be to make them all
negative so that the quantitative effects will be less than
the truth rather than greater. Mr. Grove, for instance,
in proving that the magnetization or demagnetization of
a piece of iron raises its temperature, took care to maintain
the electro-magnet by which the iron was acted upon at
a lower temperature, so that it would cool rather than
warm the iron by radiation or conduction l .
Rumford's celebrated experiment to prove that heat was
generated out of mechanical force in the boring of a
cannon was subject to the difficulty that heat might be
brought to the cannon by conduction from neighbouring
bodies. It was an ingenious device of Davy to produce
friction by a piece of clock-work resting upon a block
of ice in an exhausted receiver ; as the machine rose in
temperature above 32, it was certain that no heat was
received by conduction from the support 111 . In many
other experiments ice may be employed to prevent the
access of heat by conduction, and this device, first put in
practice by Murray n , is beautifully employed in Bunsen's
calorimeter.
To obtain the true temperature of the air, though
apparently so easy, is really a very difficult matter,
because the thermometer employed is sure to be affected
either by the sun's rays, the radiation from neighbouring
objects, or the escape of heat into space. These sources
