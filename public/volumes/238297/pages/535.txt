EXPERIMENT. 45
upon a mixture compounded so as to contain a known
quantity of that element. The accuracy of the gold assay
process greatly depends upon the precaution of assaying
alloys of gold of exactly known composition 111 . Gabriel
Plattes' works give evidence of much scientific spirit, and
when discussing the supposed merits of the divining rod
for the discovery of subterranean treasure, he sensibly
suggests that the rod should be tried in places where veins
of metal are known to exist, and, we might add, known not
to exist 11 .
Negative Results of Experiment.
When we pay proper regard to the imperfection of all
measuring instruments and the possible minuteness of
effects, we shall see much reason for interpreting with
caution the negative results of experiments. We may
fail to discover the existence of an expected effect, not
because that effect is really non-existent, but because it
is of an amount inappreciable to our senses, or confounded
with other effects of much greater amount. As in fact
there is no limit on d priori grounds to the smallness of a
phenomenon, we can never, on the grounds of a single ex-
periment, prove the non-existence of a supposed effect.
We are always at liberty to assume that a certain amount
of effect might have been detected by greater delicacy of
measurement. We cannot safely affirm that the moon has
no atmosphere at all. We may doubtless show that the
atmosphere, if present, is less dense than the air in the
so-called vacuum of an air-pump, as did Du Sejour. It is
equally impossible to prove that gravity occupies no time
in transmission. Laplace indeed ascertained that the
velocity of propagation of the influence was at least fifty
