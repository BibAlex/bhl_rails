ANALYSIS OF QUANTITATIVE PHENOMENA. 389
The apparent motion of the spots on the sun, is the
algebraic sum of the sun's axial rotation, and of the
proper motion of the spots upon the sun's face ; hence
the difficulty of ascertaining by direct observations the
period of the sun's rotation.
We cannot obtain the weight of a portion of liquid
in a chemical balance without weighing it with the
containing vessel. Hence to have the real weight of
the liquid operated upon in an experiment, we must
have a separate weighing of the vessel, with or without
the adhering film of liquid according to circumstances.
This is likewise the mode in which a cart and its load
are weighed together, the tare or weight of the cart
previously ascertained being deducted. The variation
in the height of the barometer is a joint effect, partly
due to the real variation of the atmospheric pressure,
partly due to the expansion of the mercurial column by
heat. The effects may be discriminated, if, instead of
one barometer tube we have two tubes placed closely
side by side, so as to have exactly the same temperature.
If one of them be closed at the bottom so as to be
unaffected by the atmospheric pressure, it will show
the changes due to temperature only, and, by subtracting
these changes from those shown in the other tube, we
get the real oscillations of atmospheric pressure. But
this correction, as it is called, of the barometric reading,
is better effected by calculation from the readings of
an ordinary thermometer.
In a great many other cases a quantitative effect will be
the difference of two causes acting in opposite directions.
The late Sir John Herschel invented an instrument like a
large thermometer which he called the Actinometer b , and
M. Pouillet constructed a somewhat similar instrument
