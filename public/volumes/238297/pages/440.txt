CHAPTER XVI.
THE METHOD OF MEANS.
ALL results of the measurement of continuous quantity
can only be approximately true. Were this assertion
doubted, it could readily be proved by direct experience.
For if any person, using an instrument of the greatest
precision, makes and registers successive observations in
an unbiassed manner, it will almost invariably be found
that the results differ from each other. When we operate
with sufficient care we cannot perform so simple an
experiment as weighing an object in a good balance
without getting discrepant numbers. Only the rough
and careless experimenter will think that his observations
agree, but in reality he will be found to overlook the
differences. The most elaborate researches, such as those
undertaken in connexion with standard weights and
measures, always render it apparent that complete coinci-
dence is out of the question, and that the more accurate
our modes of observation are rendered, the more numerous
are the sources of minute error which become apparent.
We may look upon the existence of error in all measure-
ments as the normal state of things. It is absolutely
impossible to eliminate separately the multitude of small
disturbing influences, except by balancing them off against
each other. And even in drawing a mean it is to be
expected that we shall come near the truth rather than
exactly to it. In the measurement of continuous quantity,
