THE USE OF HYPOTHESIS. 135
expression experimentum crucis in his ' Opticks/ but
this is the only expression, so far as I am aware, which
could indicate on the part of Newton direct or indirect
acquaintance with Bacon's writings b .
Other great physicists of the same age were equally
prone to the use of hypotheses rather than the blind
accumulation of facts in the Baconian manner. Hooke
emphatically asserts in his posthumous work on Philo-
sophical Method, that the first requisite of the Natural
Philosopher is readiness at guessing the solution of many
phenomena and making queries. * He ought to be very
well skilled in those several kinds of philosophy already
known, to understand their several hypotheses, sup-
positions, collections, observations, &c., their various ways
of ratiocinations and proceedings, the several failings and
defects, both in their way of raising, and in their way of
managing their several theories : for by this means the
mind will be somewhat more ready at guessing at the
solution of many phenomena almost at first sight, and
thereby be much more prompt at making queries, and at
tracing the subtlety of Nature, and in discovering and
searching into the true reason of things.'
We find Horrocks, again, than whom no one was more
filled with the scientific spirit, telling us how he tried
theory after theory in order to discover one which was in
accordance with the motions of Mars c . It might readily
be shown again that Huyghens, who possessed one of the
most perfect philosophical intellects, followed the deductive
process combined with continual appeal to experiment,
with a skill closely analogous to that of Newton. As to
Descartes and Leibnitz, their investigations were too much
opposed to the Baconian rules, since they too often
