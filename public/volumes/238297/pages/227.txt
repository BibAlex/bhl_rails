COMBINA TIONS AND PERMUTA TIONS. 201
proper proportions and well mixed. But this indifference
of order does not usually extend to the events of physical
science or the operations of art. The change of mechanical
energy into heat is not exactly the same as the change
from heat into mechanical energy ; thunder does not in-
differently precede and follow lightning ; it is a matter of
some importance that we load, cap, present, and fire a rifle
in this precise order. Time is the condition of all our
thoughts, space of all our actions, and therefore both in
art and science we are to a great extent concerned with
permutations. All language, for instance, treats different
permutations of letters as having different meanings.
Permutations of certain t' ings are far more numerous
than combinations of those things, for the obvious reason
that each distinct thing is regarded differently according
to its place. Thus the letters A, B, C, will make different
permutations according as A stands first, second, or third ;
^having decided the place of A, there are two places
between which we may choose for B ; and then there
remains but one place for C. Accordingly the permuta-
tions of these letters will be altogether 3x2x1 or 6 in
number. With four things or letters, A, B, C, D, we
shall have four choices of place for the first letter, three
for the second, two for the third, and one for the fourth,
so that there will be altogether 4x3x2x1, or 24
permutations. The same simple rule applies in all cases ;
beginning with the whole number of things we multiply
at each step by a number decreased by a unit. In general
language, ifn be the number of things in a combination, the
number of permutations is n (n i) (n 2) 4.3.2. i .
Thus, if we were to re-arrange the names of the days of the
week, the possible arrangements out of which we should
have to choose the new order, would be no less than
7.6.5.4.3.2. i, or 5040, or, excluding the existing
order, 5039.
