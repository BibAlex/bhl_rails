46 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
In mathematical and scientific theories we often meet
with simple identities capable of expression in the same
form. Thus in mechanical science * The process for finding
the resultant of forces = the process for finding the re-
sultant of simultaneous velocities a / Theorems in geometry
often give results in this form, as-
Equilateral triangles = Equiangular triangles.
Circle = Finite plane curve of constant curvature.
Circle = Curve of least perimeter.
The more profound and important laws of nature are
often expressible in the form of identities ; in addition to
some instances which have already been given I may
suggest
Crystals of cubical system = Crystals incapable of
double refraction.
All definitions are necessarily of this form of simple
identity, whether the objects defined be many, few, or sin-
gular. Thus we may say
Common salt = Sodium chloride.
Chlorophyl = Green colouring matter of leaves.
Square = Equal-sided rectangle.
It is an extraordinary fact that propositions of this
elementary form, all-important and very numerous as
they are, had no recognised place in Aristotle's system of
Logic. Accordingly their importance was overlooked until
very recent times, and logic was the most deformed of
sciences. But it is quite impossible that Aristotle or any
other person should avoid constantly using them ; not a
term could be defined without their use. In one place at
least Aristotle actually notices a proposition of the kind.
He observes : ' We sometimes say that that white thing
is Socrates, or that the object approaching is CalliasV
Here we certainly have simple identity of terms ; but he
