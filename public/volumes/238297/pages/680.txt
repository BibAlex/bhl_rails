190 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
(5) We may indirectly predict or determine the quan-
tity of an effect without being able to verify it by experi-
ment.
These various classes of quantitative facts might be
illustrated by an almost infinite number of interesting
points in the history of physical science. Philosophical
prophecies especially serve to show the mastery which is
sometimes attained over the secrets of nature, and to
convince the least intelligent of the value of theory.
Empirical Measurements.
Under the first head of purely empirical measurements,
which have not been brought under any theoretical
system, may be placed the great bulk of quantitative
facts recorded by scientific observers. The tables of nu-
merical results which abound in books on chemistry and
physics, the huge quartos containing the observations of
public observatories, the multitudinous tables of meteoro-
logical observations, which are continually being compiled
and printed, the more abstruse results concerning terres-
trial magnetism such results of measurement, for the
most part, remain empirical, either because theory is de-
fective, or the labour of calculation and comparison is too
formidable. In the Greenwich Observatory, indeed, the
salutary practice has been maintained by the present
Astronomer Royal, of always reducing the observations,
and comparing them with the recognised theories of
motion of the several bodies. The divergences from
theory thus afford a constant supply of material for the
discovery of errors or of new phenomena ; in short, the
observations have been turned to the use for which they
were intended. But it is to be feared that other establish-
ments are too often engaged in merely recording numbers
of which no real use is made, because the labour of reduc-
