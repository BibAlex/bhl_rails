404 THE PRINCIPLES OP SCIENCE.
different heads, the frontier of the dubious region would
itself be a mere matter of doubt. I never turn from a
classed catalogue to an alphabetical one without a feeling
of relief and security. With the latter I can always, by
taking proper pains, make a library yield its utmost ;
with the former I can never be satisfied that I have
taken proper pains, until I have made it, in fact, as many
different catalogues as there are different headings, with
separate trouble for each. Those to whom bibliographical
research is familiar, know that they have much more
frequently to hunt an author than a subject : they know
also that in searching for a subject, it is never safe to
take another person's view, however good, of the limits
of that subject with reference to their own particular
purposes.'
It is often very desirable, however, that an alphabetical
name catalogue should be accompanied by a subordinate
Bubject catalogue, but in this case no attempt should
be made to devise a theoretically complete classification.
Every principal subject treated in a book should be entered
separately in an alphabetical list, under the name most
likely to occur to the searcher, or under several names.
This method was partially carried out in Watts's valuable
* Bibliotheca Britannica,' but it was perfectly applied in the
admirable subject index to the ' British Catalogue of Books/
and equally well in the ' Catalogue of the Manchester Free
Library at Campfield/ this latter being the most perfect
model of a printed catalogue with which I am acquainted.
The public Catalogue of the British Museum is arranged
as far as possible according to the alphabetical order of
the author's names, but in writing the titles for this
catalogue several copies are simultaneously produced by a
manifold writer, so that a catalogue according to the order
of the books on the shelves, and another according to the
first words of the title-page, are created by a mere re-
