346 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
one or other of the elementary circumstances out of which
it was produced. We restore nature, as it were, to the
simple conditions out of which its endless variety was
> developed. As Professor Bowen has excellently said a ,
' The first necessity which is imposed upon us by the
constitution of the mind itself, is to break up the infinite
wealth of Nature into groups and classes of things, with
reference to their resemblances and affinities, and thus to
enlarge the grasp of our mental faculties, even at the
expense of sacrificing the minuteness of information which
can be acquired only by studying objects in detail. The
first efforts in the pursuit of knowledge, then, must be
directed to the business of Classification. Perhaps it will
be found in the sequel, that Classification is not only the
beginning, but the culmination and the end, of human
knowledge/
Classification Involving Induction.
The purpose of classification must always be the detec-
tion of resemblances and laws of nature. However much
the process may in some cases be disguised, classification
is not really distinct from the process of perfect induction,
whereby we endeavour to ascertain the connexions which
exist between the several properties of the objects under
treatment. There can be no use in placing an object in a
class unless something more than the fact of being in that
class is thereby implied. If we arbitrarily formed a class
of metals and placed therein a selection from the list of
known metals made by the ballot we should have no
reason to expect that the metals in question would re-
semble each other in any points except that they are
