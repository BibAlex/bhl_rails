THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF PHENOMENA. 325
bisulphide, and other media, so that unless general laws
can .be detected, this one phenomenon of solution can
never be exhaustively treated. The same kind of questions
recur as regards the solution or absorption of gases in
liquids, the pressure as well as the temperature having
then a most decided effect, and Professor Roscoe's re-
searches on the subject present an excellent example of
the successive determination of various complicated laws 11 .
There is hardly a single branch of scientific research
in which similar complications are not ultimately en-
countered. In the case of gravity, indeed, we arrive at
the final law, that the force is invariably the same for all
kinds of matter, and depends only on the distance of
action. But in other subjects the laws, if simple in their
ultimate nature, are disguised and complicated in their
apparent results. Thus the effect of heat in expanding
solids, or the reverse effect of forcible extension or com-
pression upon the temperature of a body, will vary
from one substance to another, will vary as the tem-
perature is already higher or lower, and will probably
follow a highly complex law, which in some cases gives
negative or exceptional results. In crystalline substances
the same researches have to be repeated in each distinct
axial direction.
In the sciences of pure observation again, such as those
of astronomy, meteorology, and terrestrial magnetism, we
meet with many interesting series of quantitative deter-
minations. The so-called fixed stars, as Giordano Bruno
divined, are not really fixed, and may be more truly
described as vast wandering orbs, each pursuing its own
path through space. We must then determine separately
for each star the following questions :
1 . Does it move ?
2. In what direction ?
