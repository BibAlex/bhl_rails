powers, because they furnish us with a great body of
precise and successful investigations. In these sciences
we meet with happy instances of unquestionable deductive
reasoning, of extensive generalization, of happy prediction,
of satisfactory verification, of nice calculation of proba-
bilities. We can note how the slightest analogical clue
has been followed up to a glorious discovery, how a rash
generalization has at length been exposed, or a conclusive
experimentum crucis has decided the long-continued strife
between two rival theories.
In following out my design of detecting the general
methods of inductive investigation, I have found that the
more elaborate and interesting processes of quantitative
induction have their necessary foundation in the simpler
science ^>f Formal Logic. The earlier, and probably by
far the least attractive part of this work, consists, there-
fore, in a statement of the so-called Fundamental Laws of
Thought, and of the all-important Principle of Substi-
tution, of which, as I think, all reasoning is a develop-
ment. The whole procedure of inductive inquiry, in its
most complex cases, is foreshadowed in the combinational
view of Logic, which arises directly from these fundamental
principles. Incidentally I have described the mechanical
arrangements by which the use of the important form
called the Logical Abecedarium, and the whole working
of the combinational system of Formal Logic, may be ren-
dered evident to the eye, and easy to the mind and
hand.
The study both of Formal Logic and of the Theory of
Probabilities, has led me to adopt the opinion that there
is no such thing as a distinct method of induction as con-
trasted with deduction, but that induction is simply an
inverse employment of deduction. Within the last cen-
tury a reaction has been setting in against the purely
empirical procedure of Francis Bacon, and physicists have
