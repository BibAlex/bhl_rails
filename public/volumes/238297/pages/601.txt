QUANTITATIVE INDUCTION. Ill
general rule that the formula thus obtained yields the
other numbers of the table to a considerable degree of
approximation.
In many cases even the second power of the variable
will be unnecessary ; thus Regnault found that the results
of his elaborate inquiry into the latent heat of steam at
different pressures were represented with sufficient ac-
curacy by the empirical formula
X = 606-5 4- 0-305 t,
in which X is the total heat of the steam, and t the tem-
perature 6 . In other cases it may be requisite to include
the third power of the variable. Thus physicists assume
the law of the dilatation of liquids to be of the form
i t = a t 4- b t 2 + c t 3 ,
and they calculate from results of observation the values
of the three constants a, b, c, which are usually small
quantities not exceeding one hundredth part of a unit,
but requiring to be determined with great accuracy d .
Theoretically speaking, this process of empirical repre-
sentation might be applied with any degree of accuracy ;
we might include still higher powers in the formula, and
with sufficient labour obtain the values of the constants,
by using an equal number of experimental results.
In a similar manner all periodic variations may be repre-
sented with any required degree of accuracy by formulas
involving the sines and cosines of angles and their mul-
tiples. The form of any tidal or other wave may thus be
expressed, as Sir G. B. Airy has explained 6 . Almost all
the phenomena registered by meteorologists are periodic
in character, and when freed from disturbing causes may
be embodied in empirical formulas. Bessel has given a
