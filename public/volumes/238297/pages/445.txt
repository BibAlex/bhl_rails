THE METHOD OF MEANS. 419
quantities, as before, their reciprocals are and , the
a o
mean of which is J ( + y), and the reciprocal again is
-. Other kinds of means might no doubt be invented
for particular purposes, and we might apply the term, as
De Morgan pointed out e , to any quantity a function of
which is equal to a function of two or more other
quantities, and is such, that the interchange of these latter
quantities among themselves will make no alteration in
the value of the function. Symbolically, if <p (y, y, y . . . .)
= (f> ( x l9 x 2 , x 3 . . . .), then y is a kind of mean of the
quantities x l9 x 2 , &c.
The geometric mean is necessarily adopted in certain
cases. Thus when we estimate the work done against
a force which varies inversely as the square of the
distance from a fixed point, the mean force is the geo-
metric mean between the forces at the. beginning and end
of the path f . When in an imperfect balance, we reverse
the weights to eliminate error, the true weight will be the
geometric mean of the two apparent weights of the one
body (see p. 410).
In almost all the calculations of statistics and commerce
the geometric mean ought, strictly speaking, to 'be used.
Thus if a commodity rises in price 100 per cent, and
another remains unaltered, the mean rise of price is not
50 per cent, because the ratio 150 : 200 is not the same
as 100 : 150. The mean ratio is as unity to A/I -00x2-00
or i to 1*41. The difference between the three kinds of
mean in such a case, as I have elsewhere shown , is very
considerable, being as follows
