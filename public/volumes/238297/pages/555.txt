METHOD OF VARIATIONS. 65
bility was more rapid, then it became gradually slower ;
and this decrease in the length of time reached its limit
between the years 1840 and 1844. During that time its
period was nearly invariable ; at present it is again
decidedly on the decrease 1 ." It is evident that the
tracing out of such complicated variations presents an
almost unlimited field for interesting investigation. The
number of such variable stars already known is consider-
able, and there is no reason to suppose that any appreciable
fraction of the whole number has yet been detected.
Principle of Forced Vibrations.
All investigations of the connection of periodic causes
and effects rest upon a most important and general prin-
ciple, which has been demonstrated by Sir John Herschel
for some special cases, and clearly explained by him in
several of his works u . The principle may be formally
stated in the following manner : ' If one part of any
system connected together either by material ties, or by
the mutual attractions of its members, be continually
maintained by any cause, whether inherent in the consti-
tution of the system or external to it, in a state of regular
periodic motion, that motion will be propagated through-
out the whole systems, and will give rise, in every member
of it, and in every part of each member, to periodic move-
ments executed in equal period, with that to which they
owe their origin, though not necessarily synchronous with
them in their maxima and minima.' The meaning of the
proposition is that the effect of a periodic cause will be
periodic, and will recur at intervals equal to those of the
