as Grimaldi supposed, or whether there is a constant
relation between the colour and the refrangibility. If
Grimaldi was right, it might be expected that any part
of the spectrum taken separately, and subjected to a
second refraction, would suffer a new breaking up, and
produce some new spectrum. Newton inferred from his
own theory that a particular ray of the spectrum would
have a constant refrangibility, so that a second prism
would merely bend it more or less, but not further dis-
perse it in any considerable degree. By simply cutting
off most of the rays of the spectrum by a screen, and
allowing the remaining narrow ray to fall on a second
prism, he proved the truth of this conclusion ; and then
slowly turning the first prism, so as to vary the colour
of the ray falling on the second one, he found that the
spot of light formed by the twice-refracted ray travelled
up and down, a palpable proof that the amount of refran-
gibility varied with the colour. For his further satisfac-
tion, he sometimes refracted the light a third or fourth
time, and he found that it might be refracted upwards or
downwards or sideways, and yet for each coloured light
there was a definite amount of refraction through each
prism. He completes the proof by showing that the
separated rays may again be gathered together into white
light by an inverted prism. So that no number of refrac-
tions alters the character of the light. The conclusion
thus obtained serves to explain the confusion arising in
the use of a common lense ; with homogeneous light he
shows that there is one distinct focus, with mixed light
an infinite number of foci, which prevent a clear view
from being obtained at any one point.
What astonishes the reader of the ' Opticks ' is the
persistence with which Newton follows out the conse-
quences of a preconceived theory, and tests the one notion
by a wonderful variety of simple comparisons with fact.
