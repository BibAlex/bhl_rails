174 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
only strong and true as long as he is logical, and if
numbers rule the world, it is the laws of logic which rule
number.
Nearly all writers have hitherto been strangely content
to look upon numerical reasoning as something wholly
apart from logical inference. A long divorce has existed
between quality and quantity, and it has not been un-
common to treat them as contrasted in nature and re-
stricted to independent branches of human thought. For
my own part, I have a profound belief that all the sciences
meet somewhere upon common ground. No part of know-
ledge can stand wholly disconnected from other parts of
the great universe of thought ; it is incredible, above all,
that the two great branches of abstract science, interlac-
ing and co-operating in every discourse, should rest upon
totally distinct foundations. I assume that a connection
exists, and care only to inquire, What is its nature ? Does
the science of quantity rest upon that of quality ; or, vice
versd, does the science of quality rest upon that of
quantity \ There migki-coneeivably TJe'a' third view, that
they both rest upon some still deeper set of principles yet
undiscovered, but there is an absence of any sugges-
tions to this effect. The late Dr. Boole adopted the second
view, and treated logic as a kind of algebra, a special
case of analytical reasoning which admits but the two
quantities unity and zero. He proved beyond doubt
that a deep analogy does exist between the forms of
algebraic and logical deduction ; and could this analogy
receive no other explanation we must have accepted his
opinion, however strange. But I shall attempt to show
that just the reverse explanation is the true one.
I hold that algebra is a highly developed logic, and !
number but logical discrimination. Logic resembles al- *
gebra, as the mould resembles that which is cast in it.
Logic has imposed its own laws upon every branch of
