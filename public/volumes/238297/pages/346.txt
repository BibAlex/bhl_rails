320 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
fingers, and senses, and instruments must stop somewhere,
there is no reason why the mind should not go on. We
can see that a proof which is only carried through a few
steps, in fact, might be carried on without limit, and it is
this consciousness of no stopping place, which renders
Euclid's proof of his 1 1 7th proposition so impressive. Try
how we will to circumvent the matter, we cannot really
avoid the consideration of the infinitely small and the
infinitely great. The same methods of approximation
which seem confined to the finite, mentally extend them-
selves to the infinite .
One result which immediately follows from these con-
siderations is, that we cannot possibly adjust any two
quantities in absolute equality. The suspension of Ma-
homet's coffin between two precisely equal magnets, is
theoretically conceivable but practically impossible. The
story of the * Merchant of Venice,' turns upon the infinite
improbability, that an exact quantity of flesh could be
cut. Unstable equilibrium cannot exist in nature, for it
is that which is destroyed by an infinitely small displace-
ment. It might be possible to balance an egg on its end
practically, because no egg has a surface of perfect curva-
ture. Suppose the egg shell to be perfectly smooth, and
the feat would become impossible.
The Fallacious Indications of the Senses.
I may briefly remind the reader how little we can trust
to our unassisted senses in estimating the degree, quantity,
or magnitude of any phenomenon. The eye cannot cor-
rectly estimate the comparative brightness of two lumi-
nous bodies which differ much in brilliancy ; for we know
that the iris is constantly adjusting itself to the intensity
