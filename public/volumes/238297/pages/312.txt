the double stars. It has since been estimated by Struve,
that the odds are 9570 to i against any two stars of not
less than the seventh magnitude falling within the appa-
rent distance of four seconds of each other by chance, and
yet ninety-one such cases were known when the estimation
was made, and many more cases have since been discovered.
There were also four known triple stars, and yet the odds
against the appearance of any one such conjunction are
173,524 to i 1 . The conclusions of Michell have been en-
tirely verified by the discovery that many double stars are
in connexion under the law of gravitation.
Michell also investigated the probability that the six
brightest stars in the Pleiades should have come
by accident into such striking proximity. Estimating
the number of stars of equal or greater brightness at
1500, he found the odds to be nearly 500,000 to i
against casual conjunction. Extending the same kind of
argument to other clusters, such as that of Prsesepe, the
nebula in the hilt of Perseus' sword, he says m : ' We
may with the highest probability conclude, the odds
against the contrary opinion being many million millions
to one, that the stars are really collected together in
clusters in some places, where they form a kind of system,
while in others there are either few or none of them, to
whatever cause this may be owing, whether to their
mutual gravitation, or to some other law or appointment
of the Creator/
The calculations of Michell have been called in question
by the late James D. Forbes n , and Mr. Todhunter vaguely
