INDUCTION. 171
great logical domain. I venture to assert that number is
wholly logical, both in its fundamental nature and in all
its complex developments. Quantity in all its forms is but
a development of number. That which is mathematical
is not the less logical ; if anything it is the more logical,
in the sense that it presents logical results in the highest
degree of complexity and variety.
Before proceeding then from Perfect to Imperfect In-
duction I break off in some degree the course of the work,
to treat of the logical conditions of number. I shall then
employ number to estimate the variety of combinations
in which natural phenomena may present themselves, and
the probability or improbability of their occurrence under
definite circumstances. It is in later parts of the work
that I must endeavour to establish, in a complete manner,
the notions which I have set forth upon the subject of
Imperfect Induction, as applied in the investigation of
Nature, which notions may be thus briefly stated:
1. Imperfect Induction entirely rests upon Perfect In-
duction for its materials.
2. The logical process by which we seem to pass directly
from examined to unexamined cases consists in an
inverse and complex application of deductive in-
ference, so that all reasoning may be said to be
either directly or inversely deductive.
3. The result is always of a hypothetical character, and
is never more than probable.
4. No nett addition is ever made to our knowledge by
reasoning ; what we know of future events or unex-
amined objects is only the unfolded contents of
our previous knowledge, and it becomes less and
less probable as it is more boldly extended to re-
mote cases.
