336 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
There is an exact equation between the intensities of the
beams when Newton's rings disappear, the ring created
by one ray being exactly the complement of that created
by the other*.
The Method of Repetition.
The ratio of two quantities can be determined with
unlimited accuracy, if we can multiply both the object
of measurement and the standard unit without error, and
then observe what multiple of the one coincides or nearly
coincides with some multiple of the other. Although per-
fect coincidence can never be really attained, the error
thus arising may be indefinitely reduced. For if the
equation py = qx be uncertain to the amount e, so
IT P
that py = qxe, then we have p = q~- 9 and
j J
as we are supposed to be able to make y as great as we
like without increasing the error e, it follows that we
can approximate as closely as we like to the required
ratio x-^y.
This method of repetition is naturally employed when-
ever quantities can be repeated, or repeat themselves
without error of juxtaposition, which is especially the
case with the motions of the earth and heavenly bodies.
In determining the length of the sidereal day, we really
determine the ratio between the earth's revolution round
the sun, and its rotation on its own axis. We might
ascertain the ratio by observing the successive passages
of a star across the zenith, and comparing the interval by
a good clock with that between two passages of the sun,
the difference being due to the angular movement of the
earth round the sun. In such observations we should
have an error of a considerable part of a second at each
