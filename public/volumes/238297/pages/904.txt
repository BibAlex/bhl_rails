414 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
the frank recognition of the fact that according to the
theory of hereditary descent, the gradation of characters
is probably the rule, and the precise demarcation between
groups the exception. ,
Natural Genera and Species.
One important result of the establishment of the theory
of evolution, is to explode all notions about the existence
of natural groups constituting separate creations. Natura-
lists have long held that every plant belongs to some
species or group, marked out by invariable characters,
which do not change by difference of soil, climate, cross-
breeding, or other circumstances. They were unable to
deny the existence of such things as sub-species, varieties,
or hybrids, so that a species of plants was often sub-
divided and classified within itself. But then the dif-
ferences upon which this sub-classification depended were
supposed to be variable, and thus distinguished from the
invariable characters imposed upon the whole species at
its creation. Similarly a Natural Genus was a group of
species, and was marked out from other genera by eternal
differences of still greater importance.
We now, however, perceive that the existence of any
such groups as genera and species is an arbitrary creation
of the naturalist's mind. All resemblances of plants, in-
deed, are natural, so far as they express their hereditary
affinities, but this applies as well to the variations within
the species as to the species itself, or the larger natural
classes. All is a matter of degree. The deeper differences
between plants have been produced by the differentiating
action of circumstances during millions of years, so that
it would naturally require millions of years to undo this
result, and prove experimentally that the forms can be
approximated together again. Sub-species may often have
