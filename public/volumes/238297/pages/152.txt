THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
If there be a second premise, for instance
we press in like manner the keys
B (subj.), copula, B (pred.), C (pred.), full stop.
The process is exactly the same however numerous the
premises may be. When they are completed the operator
will see indicated on the face of the machine the exact
combinations of letters which are consistent with the
premises according to the principles of thought.
As shown in the figure opposite the title-page, the
machine exhibits in front an abecedarium of sixteen com-
binations, exactly like that of the abacus, except that the
letters of each combination are separated by a certain
interval. After the above problem has been worked upon
the machine the abecedarium will present the following
appearance
A A
a I a I a I a
B B
B B
b 666
C C
C C
C \ C \ c \ c
D d
D I d
D \ d \ D \ d
The operator will collect the various conclusions, as for
instance that A is always C, that not-C is not-B and
not- A ; that not-B is not- A but either C or not-C, as
in the use of the Logical Slate or Abacus.
