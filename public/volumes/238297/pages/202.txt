over. But according to one of the conditions of logical
symbols, which I have called the Law of Unity (p. 86),
the same name repeated has no effect, and
A I A- A.
We must apply the Law of Unity, and must reduce all
identical alternatives before we can count with certainty
and use the processes of numerical calculation. Identical
alternatives are harmless in logic, but produce deadly
error in number. Thus logical science ascertains the
nature of the mathematical unit, and the definition may
be given in these terms A unit is any object of thought
which can be discriminated from every other object treated
as a unit in the same problem.
It has often been said that units are units in respect of
being perfectly similar to each other; but though they
may be perfectly similar in some respects, they must be
different in at least one point, otherwise they would be
incapable of plurality. If three coins were so similar
that they occupied the same space at the same time, they
would not be three coins, but one. It is a property of
space that every point is discriminable from every other
point, and in time every moment is necessarily distinct
from any other moment before or after. Hence we fre-
quently count in space or time, and Locke, with some
other philosophers, has even held that number arises from
repetition in time. Beats of a pendulum might be so
perfectly similar that we could discover no difference
except that one beat is before and another after. Time
alone is here the ground of difference and is a sufficient
foundation for the discrimination of plurality ; but it is
by no means the only foundation. Three coins are three
coins, whether we count them successively or regard them
all simultaneously. In many cases neither time nor space
is the ground of difference, but pure quality alone enters.
We can discriminate for instance the weight, inertia, and
