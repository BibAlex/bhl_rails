original nebulous matter, although all the particles of
matter should obey the one law of gravity.
Lucretius tells us how in the original rain of atoms
some of these little bodies diverged from the rectilineal
direction, and coming into contact with other atoms gave
rise to the various combinations of substances and phe-
nomena which exist. He omitted, indeed, to tell us whence
the atoms came, or by what force some of them were
caused to diverge, but surely these omissions involve
the whole question. I accept the Lucretian conception
of creation when properly supplemented. Every atom
which existed in any point of space must have existed
there previously, or must have been created there by a
previously existing Power. When placed there it must
have had a definite mass and a definite energy, kinetic
or potential as regards other existing atoms. Now, as
before remarked, an unlimited number of atoms can be
placed in unlimited space in an entirely unlimited number
of modes of distribution. Out of infinitely infinite choices
which were open to the Creator, that one choice must
have been made which has yielded the universe as it
now exists.
It would indeed be a mistake to suppose that the law
of gravity, when it holds true, is no restriction in the dis-
tribution of force. That law is a geometrical law, and it
would in many cases be mathematically impossible, as far
as we can see, that the force of gravity acting on one
particle should be small while that on a neighbouring
particle was great. We cannot conceive that even Omni-
potent Power should make the angles of a triangle less
or greater than two right angles. | The primary laws of
thought and the fundamental notions of the mathemati-
cal sciences do not seem to us to admit of any alter-
ation/) Into the metaphysical origin and meaning of the
apparent necessity attaching to such laws I have not
