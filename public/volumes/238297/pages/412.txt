386 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
our investigation. All exact knowledge relating to the
forms and sizes of living things, their numbers, the
quantities of various compounds which they consume,
contain, or excrete, their muscular or nervous energy, &c.
must be placed apart in a class by themselves, All such
numbers are doubtless more or less subject to variation,
and but in a minor degree capable of exact determination.
Man, so far as he is an animal, and as regards his physical
form, must also be treated in this class.
Social Numbers.
Little or no allusion has hitherto been made in this
work to the fact that man in his economical, sanitary,
intellectual, aesthetic, or moral relations may become the
subject of exact sciences, the highest and most useful
of all sciences. Every one who is in any degree engaged
in statistical inquiry or study must so far acknowledge
the possibility of natural laws governing such statistical
facts. Hence we must certainly allot a distinct place to
all numerical information relating to the numbers, ages,
physical and sanitary condition, mortality, of all different
peoples, in short, to vital statistics. Economic statistics,
comprehending the quantities of commodities produced,
existing, exchanged, and consumed, constitute another
most extensive body of science. In the progress of reason
exact investigation may possibly subdue regions of pheno-
mena which at present defy all analysis and scientific
treatment. That scientific method can ever exhaust the
phenomena of the human -mind is on the other hand in-
credible.
