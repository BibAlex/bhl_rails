is the equation required, and we only need to multiply
out the expression on the left hand by ordinary rules.
But having given a complex algebraic expression equated
to zero, it is a matter of exceeding difficulty to dis-
cover all the roots. Mathematicians have exhausted
their highest powers in carrying the complete solution
up to the fourth degree. In every other mathematical
operation the inverse process is far more difficult than
the direct process, subtraction than addition, division
than multiplication, evolution than involution ; but the
difficulty increases vastly as the process becomes more
complex. The differentiation, the direct process, is always
capable of performance by certain fixed rules, but as these
produce considerable variety of results, the inverse process
of integration presents immense difficulties, and in an
infinite majority of cases surpasses the present resources
of mathematicians. There are no infallible and general
rules for its accomplishment ; it must be done by trial,
by guesswork, by remembering the results of differentia-
tion, and using them as a guide.
Coming more nearly to our own immediate subject,
exactly the same difficulty exists in determining the law
which certain numbers obey. Given a general mathe-
matical expression, we can infallibly ascertain its v.alue
for any required value of the variable. But I am not
aware that mathematicians have ever attempted to lay
down the rules of a process by which, having given cer-
tain numbers, one might discover a rational or precise
formula from which they proceed. The problem is always
indeterminate, because an infinite number of formulae
agreeing with certain numbers, might always be dis-
covered with sufficient trouble.
The reader may test his power of detecting a law, by
contemplation of its results, if he, not being a mathema-
tician, will attempt to point out the law obeyed by the
