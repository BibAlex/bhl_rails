216 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
in which we can calculate the whole number of com-
binations of certain things. Either we may take the
whole number at once as shown in the Abecedarium, in
which case the number will be some power of two, or
else we may calculate successively, by aid of permutations;
the number of combinations of none, one, two, three, and
so on. Hence we arrive at a necessary identity between
two series of numbers. In the case of four things we
shall have
I 1.2 1.2.3 1.2.3.4
In a general form of expression we shall have
the terms being continued until they cease to have any
value. Thus we have arrived at a proof of simple cases
of the Binomial Theorem, of which each column of the
Abecedarium is an exemplification. It may be shown
that all other mathematical expansions likewise arise out
of simple processes of combination, but the more complete
consideration of this subject must be deferred.
Possible Variety of Nature and Art.
We cannot adequately understand the difficulties which
beset us in certain branches of science, unless we gain
a clear idea of the vast number of combinations or per-
mutations which may be possible under certain conditions.
Thus only can we learn how hopeless it would be to
attempt to treat nature in detail, and exhaust the whole
number of events which might arise. It is instructive to
consider, in the first place, how immensely great are the
numbers of combinations with which we deal in many
arts and amusements.
