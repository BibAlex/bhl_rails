THEORY OF APPROXIMATION. 77
are indefinitely more numerous and complex than the
few larger terms which are retained. All then is merely
approximate.
Concerning other branches of physical science the same
general statements are even more evidently true. We
speak and calculate about inflexible bars, inextensible
lines, heavy points, homogeneous substances, uniform
spheres, perfect fluids and gases, and we deduce an infinite
number of beautiful theorems ; but all is hypothetical.
There is no such thing as an inflexible bar, an inextensible
line, nor any one of the other perfect objects of mechanical
science ; they are to be classed with those other almost
mythical existences, the straight line, triangle, circle,
rectangle, &c., about which Euclid so freely discoursed.
Take the simplest operation considered in statics the use
of a crowbar in raising a heavy stone, and we shall find,
as Thomson and Tait have pointed out, that we neglect
far more than we observe d . If we suppose the bar to be
quite rigid, the fulcrum and stone perfectly hard, and the
points of contact real points, we might give the true re-
lation of the forces. But in reality the bar must bend,
and the extension and compression of different parts in-
volve us in difficulties. Even if the bar be homogeneous
in all its parts, there is no mathematical theory capable of
determining with accuracy all that goes on ; if, as is in-
finitely more probable, the bar is not homogeneous, the
complete solution will be indefinitely more complicated,
but hardly more hopeless. No sooner had we determined
the change of form according to simple mechanical prin-
ciples, than we should discover the interference of thermo-
dynamic principles. Compression produces heat and
extension cold, and thus the conditions of the problem
are modified throughout. In attempting a fourth ap-
proximation we should have to allow for the conduction
