The Nature of Inference.
The question, What is Inference \ is involved, even to
"the present day, in as much uncertainty as that ancient
question, What is Truth ? I shall in more than one part
of this work endeavour to show that inference never does
more than explicate, unfold, or develop the information
contained in certain premises or facts. Neither in deduc-
tive nor inductive reasoning can we add a tittle to our
implicit knowledge, which is like that contained in an
unread book or a sealed letter. Sir W. Hamilton has well
said, ' Reasoning is the showing out explicitly that a pro-
position not granted or supposed, is implicitly contained
in something different which is granted or supposed m /
Professor Bo wen has explained 11 with much clearness
that the conclusion of an argument states explicitly what
is virtually or implicitly thought. ' The process of reasoning
is not so much a mode of evolving a new truth, as it is of
establishing or proving an old one, by showing how much
was admitted in the concession of the two premises taken
together/ It is true that the whole meaning of these
statements rests upon that of such words as 'explicit/
'implicit/ 'virtual/ That is implicit which is wrapped up,
and we render it explicit when we unfold it. Just as the
conception of a circle involves a hundred important geome-
trical properties, all following from what we know, if we
have acuteness to unfold the results, so every fact and
statement involves more meaning than seems at first
sight. Reasoning explicates or brings to conscious posses-
sion what was before unconscious. It does not create, nor
