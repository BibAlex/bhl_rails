CLASSIFICATION. 379
Here we see that wherever A is is also found, so that C
is a generic property ; D occurs always with B, so that it
constitutes a specific property, while E is indifferently
present and absent, so as not to be in any way correlated
with any of the other letters ; it represents, therefore, an
accident. It will now be seen that the Logical Abece-
darium leally represents an interminable series of subor-
dinate genera and species ; it is but a concise symbolic
statement of what was involved in the ancient doctrine of
the Predicables.
Summum Genus and Tnfima Species.
As a genus means any class whatever which is re-
garded as composed of minor classes or species, it follows
that the same class will be a genus in one point of view
and a species in another. Metal is a genus as regards
alkaline metal, a species as regards element, and any
extensive system of classes consists of a series of subor-
dinate, or as they are technically called, subaltern genera
and species. The question, however, arises, whether any
such chain of classes has a definite termination at either
end. The doctrine of the old logicians was to the effect
that it terminated upwards in a genus generalissimum or
summum genus, which was not a species of any wider
class. Some very general notion, such as substance, object
or thing, was supposed to be so comprehensive as to in-
clude all thinkable objects, and for all practical purposes
this might be so. But as I have already explained (vol. i.
p. 88), we cannot really think of any object or class
without thereby separating it from what is not that object
or class. All thinking is relative, and implies discrimina-
tion, so that every class and every logical notion must
have its negative. If so, there is no such thing as a summum
