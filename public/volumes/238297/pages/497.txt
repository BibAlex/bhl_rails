OBSERVATION.
assistants can supersede the mind-directed observations
of the philosopher. Thus the successful investigator must
combine diverse qualities ; he must have clear notions
of the result he expects, and confidence in the truth of his
theories, and yet he must have that candour and flexi-
bility of mind, which enable him to accept unfavourable
results and abandon mistaken views.
Instrumental and Sensual Conditions of Correct
Observation.
In every observation one or more of the senses must be
employed, and we should ever bear in mind that the ex-
tent of our knowledge may be limited by the power of the
sense concerned. What we learn of the world only forms
the lower limit of what is to be learned, and, for all that
we can tell, the processes of nature may indefinitely sur-
pass in variety and complexity those which are capable of
coming within our means of observation. In some cases
inference from observed phenomena may make us in-
directly aware of what cannot be directly felt, but we
can never be sure that we thus acquire any appreciable
fraction of the knowledge that might be acquired.
It is a strange reflection that space may be filled with
dark wandering stars, whose existence could not have yet
become in any way known to us. The planets have
already cooled so far as to be no longer luminous, and it
may well be that other stellar bodies of various size have
fallen into the same condition. From the consideration,
indeed, of variable and extinguished stars, Laplace inferred
that there probably exist opaque bodies as great and
perhaps as numerous as those we see 6 . Some of these
dark stars might ultimately become known to us, either by
reflecting light, or more probably by their gravitating
