246 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
cause there are no less than 252 different particular
throws which will give this result, when we abstract
the difference of order.
Difficulties arise in the application of the theory from
our habitual disregard of slight probabilities. We are
obliged practically to accept truths as certain which are
nearly so, because it ceases to be worth while to calculate
the difference. No punishment could be inflicted if
absolutely certain evidence of guilt were required, and as
Locke remarks, ' He that will not stir till he infallibly
knows the business he goes about will succeed, will
have but little else to do but to sit still and perish.' f
There is not a moment of our lives when we do not lie
under a slight danger of death, or some most terrible fate.
There is not a single action of eating, drinking, sitting
down, or standing up which has not proved fatal to some
person. Several philosophers have tried to assign the
limit of the probabilities which we regard as zero ; Buffon
named 10> o 00 , because it is the probability that a man of
56 years of age would die the next day, and is practically
disregarded. Pascal had remarked that a man would be
esteemed a fool for hesitating to accept death when three
dice gave sixes twenty times running, if his reward in
case of a different result was to be a crown ; but as the
chance of death in question is only i-=-6 60 , or unity divided
by a number of 47 places of figures, we may be said
every day to incur greater risks for less motives. There
is far greater risk of death, for instance, in a game of
cricket.
Nothing is more requisite than to distinguish carefully
between the truth of a theory and the truthful application
of the theory to actual circumstances. As a general rule,
events in nature or art will present a complexity of
