186 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
provided that the same roots are taken, that is that the
root of a shall really be related to a as the root of I is
to b. The ambiguity of meaning of an operation thus fails
in any way to shake the universality of the principle.
We may go further and assert that, not only the above
common relations, but all other known or conceivable
mathematical relations obey the same principle. Let Pa
denote in the most general manner that we do something
with the quantity a ; then if a = b it foUows that
Pa = PZ>.
Let us make Pa, for instance, mean
a 3 ~3a 2 +2a + 5;
then it necessarily follows that this quantity is exactly
equal to b s 3 b 2 + 2 I + 5.
The reader will also remember that one of the most
frequent operations in mathematical reasoning is to sub-
stitute for a quantity its equal, as known either by
assumed, natural, or self-evident condition. Whenever a
quantity appears twice over in a problem, we may apply
what we learn of its relations in one place to its relations
in the other. All reasoning in mathematics, as in other
branches of science, thus involves the principle of treating
equals equally, or similars similarly. In whatever way we
employ quantitative reasoning in the remaining parts of
this work, we never can desert the simple principle on
which we first set out.
Reasoning by Inequalities.
I have stated that all the processes of mathematical
reasoning may be deduced from the principle of substitution.
Exceptions to this assertion may seem to exist in the use
of inequalities. The greater of a greater is undoubtedly a
greater, and what is less than a less is certainly less.
