CLASSIFICATION. 377
either in intension or extension ; in the former respect
it is more than the Genus as containing one more quality,
the Difference : in the latter respect it is less than the
Genus as containing only a portion of the group consti-
tuting the Genus. We may say then, with Aristotle, that
in one sense the Genus is in the Species, namely in inten-
sion, and in another sense the Species is in the Genus,
namely in extension. The Difference, it is evident, can
be interpreted in intension only.
A Property is a quality which belongs to the whole of
a class, but does not enter into the definition of that class.
Thus if it be a generic property it belongs to every indi-
vidual object contained in the genus. It is a property of
the genus Parallelogram that the opposite angles are
equal. If we regard a Rectangle as a species of parallel-
ogram, the difference being that one angle is a right angle,
it follows as a specific property that all the angles are
right angles. Though a property in the strict logical
sense must belong to each of the objects included in the
class of which it is a property, it may or may not belong
to other objects. The property of having the opposite
angles equal may belong to many figures besides parallel-
ograms, for instance, regular hexagons. It is a property
of the circle that all triangles constructed upon the dia-
meter with the apex upon the circumference are right
angled triangles, and vice versa, all closed curves of
which this is true must be circles. We might with ad-
vantage distinguish properties which thus belong to a
class, and only to that class, as peculiar properties. They
enable us to make statements in the form of simple iden-
tities (vol. i. p. 44). Thus we know it to be a peculiar
property of the circle that for a given length of perimeter
it encloses a greater area than any other possible curve ;
hence we may say
Curve of equal curvature = curve of greatest area.
