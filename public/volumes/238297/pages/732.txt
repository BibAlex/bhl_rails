all inductive reasoning is an inverse application of de-
ductive reasoning, and consists in demonstrating that the
consequences of certain assumed propositions or laws
agree with facts of nature gathered by active or passive
observation. The fundamental process of reasoning, as
stated in the outset, consists in inferring of any thing
what we know of similar objects, and it is on this prin-
ciple that the whole of deductive reasoning, whether
simply logical or mathematico-logical, is founded. All
inductive reasoning must therefore be founded on the
same principle. Now it might seem that by a very plain
use of this principle we might avoid the complicated pro-
cesses of induction and deduction, and argue directly from
one particular case to another, as the late Mr. J. S. Mill
proposed. If the Earfh, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and other
planets move in elliptic orbits, cannot we dispense with
all elaborate precautions, and assert that Neptune, Ceres,
or the last discovered planet must do so likewise? Do
