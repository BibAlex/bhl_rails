132 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
of the Abecedarium are exactly the same in whatever
order the premises be treated on the logical slate or
machine.
Some difference may doubtless exist as regards con-
venience to human memory. The mind may take in
the results of an argument more easily in one mode of
statement than another, although there is no real differ-
ence in the logical results. But in this point of view
I think that Aristotle and the old logicians were clearly
wrong. It is more easy to conclude that ' all A's are C's '
from ' all A's are B's and all B's are C's,' than from
the same propositions in inverted order, 'all B's are C's
and all A's are BV

The Equivalency of Propositions.
One great advantage which arises from the study of
this Indirect Method of Inference consists in the clear
notion which we thus gain of the Equivalency of Propo-
sitions. The older logicians showed how from certain
simple premises we might draw an inference, but they
failed to point out whether that inference contained the
whole, or only a part, of the information embodied in the
premises. Now any one proposition or group of propo-
sitions may be classed with respect to another proposition
or group of propositions, as
1. Equivalent,
2. Inferrible,
3. Consistent,
4. Contradictory.
Taking the proposition * All men are mortals' as the
original, ' All immortals are not men ' is its equivalent ;
' Some mortals are men ' is inferrible, or capable of infe-
rence, but is not equivalent ; ' All not men are not
mortals ' cannot be inferred, but is consistent, that is, may
