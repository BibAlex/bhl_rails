COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS. 207
cation in the theory of combinations and probabilities, and
remarks of the Arithmetical Triangle, ' It not only contains
the clue to the mysterious doctrine of combinations, but it
is also the ground or foundation of most of the important
and abstruse discoveries that have been made in the other
branches of the mathematics/ *
The numbers of the triangle can be calculated in a very,
easy manner by successive additions. We commence with
unity at the apex ; in the next line we place a second
unit to the right of this ; to obtain the third line of
figures we move the previous line one place to the right,
and add them to the same figures as they were before
removal, and we can then repeat the same process ad
infinitum. The fourth line of figures, for instance, con-
tains i, 3, 3, i ; moving them one place and adding as
directed we obtain :
Fourth line . . . i .3 3 i
1331
Fifth line ....14 6 4
i 4 6
Sixth line . . . . i 5 10 10 51
i 5 10 10 5
Seventh line ... i 6 15 20 15 6 i
Carrying out this simple process through ten more steps
we obtain the first seventeen lines of the Arithmetical
Triangle as printed on the next page. Theoretically
speaking the Triangle must be regarded as infinite in
extent but the numbers increase so rapidly that it soon
becomes almost 'impracticable to continue the table. The
longest table of the numbers which I have found is given
in Fortia's * Traite des Progressions ' (p. 80), where they
are given up to the fortieth line and the ninth column.
