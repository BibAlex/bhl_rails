370 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
dently assign them by mere contemplation of the combina-
tions, as given in the first group. Several tentative classi-
fications must probably be made before we can resolve the
question. Let us now suppose that instead of seven objects
and five qualities, we have, say, five hundred objects and
fifty qualities. If we were to attempt the same method of
exhaustive grouping which we before employed, we should
have to arrange the five hundred objects in fifty different
ways, before we could be sure that we had discovered even
the simpler laws of correlation. But even the successive
grouping of all those possessing each of the fifty properties
would not necessarily give us all the laws. There might
exist complicated relations between several properties
simultaneously, for the detection of which no rule of pro-
cedure whatever can be given.
If the reader entertains any doubt as to the difficulty
of classifying combinations so as to disclose their rela-
tions, let him test the matter practically upon the fol-
lowing series of combinations. They involve only six
letters denoting six qualities, which are subject to four
laws of correlation of no great complexity.

I shall be happy to receive the solution of the above
problem in classification from any reader who thinks he
has solved it ; that is to say, I shall be glad to ascer-
tain whether any reader succeeds in detecting the laws
of correlation between the letters, which yield the above
combinations, according to the principles of the Indirect
Method described in Chapter VI.
