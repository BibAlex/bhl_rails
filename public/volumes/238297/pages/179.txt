INDUCTION. 153
Our premises will be
A - BIG -I- DIE, &c.
B =
and so on for the rest of the metals. Now evidently
Kbc = (DIE IF! ...... )lc,
ar.d by substitution as before we shall obtain
Abe = A&cX,
or in words, ' All metals not gold nor silver are opaque ; '
at the same time we have
A(B I C) - AB I AC = ABaH- ACx = A(B t C)x,
or ' Metals which are either gold or silver are not opaque/
In some cases the problem of induction assumes a much
higher degee of complexity. If we examine the properties
of crystallized substances we may find some properties
which are common to all, as cleavage or fracture in definite
planes ; but it would soon become requisite to break up
the class into several minor ones. We should divide
crystals according to the seven accepted systems and
we should then find that crystals of each system possess
many common properties. Thus crystals of the Eegular
or Cubical system expand equally by heat, conduct heat
and electricity with uniform rapidity, and are of like
elasticity in all directions ; they have but one index of
refraction for light ; and every facet is repeated in like
relation to each of the three axes. Crystals of the system
which possess one principal axis will be found to possess
the various physical powers of conduction, refraction,
elasticity, &c., uniformly in directions perpendicular to
the principal axis, but in other directions their properties
vary according to complicated laws. The remaining systems
in which the crystals possess three unequal axes, or have
inclined axes, exhibit still more complicated results, the
