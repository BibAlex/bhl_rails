188 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
into the form of an equality ; but the converse is not true.
We cannot possibly prove that two quantities are equal by
merely asserting that they are both greater or both less
than another quantity. From e >f and g >f, or e </and
9 <f> we can i n f er no relation between e and g. . And if the
reader take the equations x = y = 3 and attempt to prove
that therefore x = 3, by throwing them into inequalities, he
will find it impossible to do so.
From these considerations I gather that reasoning in
arithmetic or algebra by so-caUed inequalities is only an
imperfectly expressed reasoning by equalities, and when
we want to exhibit exactly and clearly the conditions of
reasoning, we are obliged to use equalities explicitly. Just
as in pure logic a negative proposition, as expressing mere
difference, cannot be the means of inference, so inequality
can never really be the true ground of inference. I do not
deny that affirmation and negation, agreement and differ-
ence, equality and inequality, are pairs of equally funda-
mental relations, but I assert that inference is possible only
where affirmation, agreement, or equality, some species of
identity in fact, is present, explicitly or implicitly. .
Arithmetical Reasoning.
It might seem somewhat inconsistent that I assert
number to arise out of difference or discrimination, and
yet hold that no reasoning can be grounded on difference.
Number, of course, opens a most wide sphere for inference,
and a little consideration shows that this is due to the
unlimited series of identities which spring up out of
numerical abstraction. If six people are sitting on six
chairs, there is no resemblance between the chairs and the
people in logical character. But if we overlook all the
qualities both of a chair and a person, and merely re-
member that there are marks bv which each of six chairs
