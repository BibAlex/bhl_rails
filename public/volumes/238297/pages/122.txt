are such invariable and necessary conditions of all thought,
that they need not be specially laid down. The Law of
Contradiction is a further condition of all thought and of
all logical symbols ; it enables, and in fact obliges, us to
reject from further consideration all terms which imply
the presence and absence of the same quality. Now,
whenever we bring both these Laws of Thought into ex-
plicit action by the method of substitution, we employ the
Indirect Method of Inference. It will be found that we
can treat not only those arguments already exhibited
according to the direct method, but we can also include an
infinite multitude of other arguments which are incapable
of solution by any other means.
Some philosophers, especially those of France, have
held that the Indirect Method of Proof has a certain infe-
riority to a direct method, which should prevent our using
it except when obliged. But there are an unlimited
number of truths which we can prove only indirectly.
We can prove that a number is a prime only by the
purely indirect method of showing that it is not any of the
numbers which have divisors, and the remarkable process
known as Eratosthenes' Sieve is the only mode by which
we can select the prime numbers a . It bears a strong
analogy to the indirect method here to be described. We
can also prove that the side and diameter of a square are
incommensurable, but only in the negative or indirect
manner, by showing that the contrary supposition con-
stantly and inevitably leads to contradiction b . Many other
demonstrations in various branches of the mathematical
sciences rest upon a like method. Now if there is only
one important truth which must be, and can only be
