ANALYSIS OF QUANTITATIVE PHENOMENA. 409
and in the more accurate observations it is likely to
introduce more uncertainty than it removes. A multitude
of instruments involving mechanical compensation have
been devised, but they are usually of an unscientific
character g, because the errors compensated can be more
accurately determined and allowed for. But there are
exceptions to this rule, and it seems to be proved that in
the delicate and tiresome operation of measuring a base
line, invariable bars, compensated for expansion by heat,
give a very accurate result, the observation of their vary-
ing temperature and the calculation of the corrections
being an uncertain and tedious work h .
We thus see that the choice of one or other mode of
eliminating a simple error depends entirely upon circum-
stances and the object in view ; but we may safely lay
down the following conclusions. First of all, seek to avoid
the source of error altogether if it can be conveniently
done ; if not, make the experiment so that the error may
be as small, but more especially as constant, as possible.
If the means are at hand for determining its amount
by calculation from other experiments and principles
of science, allow the error to exist and make a correction
in the result. If this cannot be accurately done or in-
volves too much labour for the purposes in view, then
throw in a counteracting error which shall as nearly as
possible be of equal amount in all circumstances with
that to be eliminated. There yet remains, however, one
important method, that of Reversal, which will form an
appropriate transition to the succeeding chapters on the
Method of Mean Hesults and the Law of Error.
