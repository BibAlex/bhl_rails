CHAPTER XII.
THE INDUCTIVE OR INVERSE APPLICATION OF THE
THEORY OF PROBABILITIES.
WE have hitherto considered the theory of probability
only in its simple deductive employment, by which it
enables us to determine from given conditions the probable
character of events happening under those conditions.
But as deductive reasoning when inversely applied con-
stitutes the process of induction, so the calculation of
probabilities may be inversely applied ; from the known
character of certain events we may argue backwards to
the probability of a certain law or condition governing
those events. Having satisfactorily accomplished this
work, we may indeed calculate forwards to the probable
character of future events happening under the same con-
ditions ; but this part of the process is a direct use of
deductive reasoning (p. 260).
Now it is highly instructive to find that whether the
theory of probabilities be deductively or inductively ap-
plied, the calculation is always performed according to
the principles and rules of deduction. The probability
that an event has a particular condition entirely depends
upon the probability that if the condition existed the
event would follow. If we take up a pack of common
playing cards, and observe that they are arranged in per-
fect numerical order, we conclude beyond all reasonable
doubt that they have been thus intentionally arranged
