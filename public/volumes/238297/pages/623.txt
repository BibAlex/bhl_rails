THE USE OF HYPOTHESIS. 133
of combinations and permutations, it became apparent
that we could never cope with the possible variety of
nature. An exhaustive examination of the metallic alloys,
or chemical compounds which can be formed, was found
to be out of the question (vol. i. p. 218). It is on such
considerations that we can explain the very small addi-
tions made to our knowledge by the alchemists. Many
of them were men of the greatest acuteness, and their
indefatigable labours were pursued through many cen-
turies. A few of the more common compounds and
phenomena were discovered by them, but a true insight
into the principles of nature, now enables chemists to
discover far more useful facts in a single year than were
yielded by the alchemists during many centuries. There
can be no doubt that Newton was really an alchemist, and
often spent his days and nights in laborious experiments.
But in trying to discover the secret by which gross
metals might be rendered noble, his lofty powers of
deductive investigation were wholly useless. Deprived
of all guiding clues, his experiments must have been, like
those of all the alchemists, purely tentative and hap-
hazard. While his hypothetical and deductive investiga-
tions have given us the true system of nature, and opened
the way in almost every one of the great branches of
natural philosophy, the whole results of his tentative
experiments are comprehended in a few happy guesses,
given in his celebrated ' Queries/
Even when we are engaged in apparently passive
observation of a phenomenon, which we cannot modify
experimentally, it is advantageous that our attention
should be guided by some theoretical anticipations. A
phenomenon which seems simple is, in all probability,
really complex, and unless the mind is actively engaged
in looking for particular details, it is quite likely that the
most critical circumstances will be passed over. Bessel
