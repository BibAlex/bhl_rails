On the Fictitious Mean or Average Result.
Although the average when employed in its proper
sense of a fictitious mean, represents no really existing
quantity, it is yet of the highest scientific importance, as
enabling us to conceive in a single result a multitude
of complex details. It enables us to make a hypothetical
simplification of a problem, and avoid complexity without
committing error. Thus the aggregate weight of a body is
the sum of the weights of the indefinitely small particles,
each acting at a different place, so that the simplest
mechanical problem concerning a body really resolves itself,
strictly speaking, into an infinite number of distinct pro-
blems. We owe to Archimedes the first introduction of
the beautiful idea that one point might be discovered in
a gravitating body such that the weight of all the par-
ticles might be regarded as concentrated in that point,
and yet the behaviour of the whole body would be exactly
represented by the behaviour of this heavy point. This
Centre of Gravity may be within the body, as in the
case of a sphere, or it may be in empty space, as in
the case of a ring. Any two bodies, whether connected
or separate, may be conceived as having a centre of
gravity ; that of the sun and earth, for instance, lying
within the sun and only 267 miles from its centre.
Although we most commonly use the notion of a centre
or average point with regard to gravity, the same notion
is applicable to many other cases. Terrestrial gravity
is only one case of approximately parallel forces, so that
the centre of gravity is but a special case of the more
general Centre of Parallel Forces. Wherever a number
of forces of whatever amount act in parallel lines, it
is possible to discover a point at which the algebraic
sum of the forces may be imagined to act with exactly
the same effect. Water in a cistern presses against the
