DISJUNCTIVE PROPOSITIONS. 91
alternative of the other. Since flowering plants are
either exogens or endogens, and are at the same time either
herbs, shrubs or trees, it follows that there are altogether
six alternatives namely, exogenous herbs, exogenous
shrubs, exogenous trees, endogenous herbs, endogenous
shrubs, endogenous trees. This process of combination is
shown in the general form
(A ! B) (0 I- D) = AC ! AD * BC |- BD.
It is hardly necessary to point out that, however numerous
the terms combined, or the alternatives in those terms, we
may effect the combination provided each alternative is
combined with each alternative of the other terms, as in
the algebraic process of multiplication.
Some processes of deduction may at once be exhibited.
We may always, for instance, unite the same qualifying
term to each side of an identity even though one or both
members of the identity be disjunctive. Thus let
A = B|- C.
Now it is self-evident that
AD = AD,
and in one side of this identity we may for A substitute
its equivalent B -|- C obtaining
AD = BD | CD.
Since ' a gaseous element is either hydrogen, or oxygen,
or nitrogen, or chlorine, or fluorine/ it follows that ' a free
gaseous element is either free hydrogen, or free oxygen,
or free nitrogen, or free chlorine, or free fluorine.'
This process of combination will lead to most useful
inferences when the qualifying adjective combined with
both sides of the proposition is a negative of one or more
alternatives. Since chlorine is a coloured gas, we may
infer that ' a colourless gaseous element is either (colour-
less) hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine.' The alter-
native chlorine disappears because colourless chlorine does
not exist, Again, since 'a tooth is either an incisor,
