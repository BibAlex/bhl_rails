178 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
number three asserts the existence of marks without
specifying their kind.
Numerical abstraction is then a totally different process
from logical abstraction (see p. 33), for in the latter
process we drop out of notice the very existence of
difference and plurality. In forming the abstract notion
hardness, for instance, I drop out of notice altogether the
diverse circumstances in which the quality may appear.
It is the concrete notion three hard objects, which asserts
the existence of hardness .along with sufficient other
undefined qualities, to mark out three such objects.
Numerical thought is indeed closely interwoven with
logical thought. We cannot use a concrete term in the
plural, as men, without implying that there are marks of
difference. Only when we use a term in the singular
and abstract sense man, do we deal with unity, unbroken
by difference.
The origin of the great generality of number is now
apparent. Three sounds differ from three colours, or
three riders from three horses ; but they agree in respect
of the variety of marks by which they can be discriminated.
The symbols i + i + i are thus the empty marks asserting
the fact of discrimination which may apply to objects
wholly independently of their peculiar nature.
Concrete and Abstract Numbers.
The common distinction between concrete and ab-
stract numbers can now be easily stated. In proportion
as we specify the logical character of the things num-
bered, we render them coilcrete. In the abstract num-
ber three there is no statement of the points in which
the three objects agree ; but in three coins, three men, or
three horses, not only are the variety of objects defined,
