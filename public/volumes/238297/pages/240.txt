214 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
By taking a proper line of the triangle, an answer
may be had under any more natural supposition. This
theory of comparative frequency of divergence from an
average, was first adequately noticed by M. Quetelet, and
has lately been employed in a very interesting and bold
manner by Mr. Galton, in his work on * Hereditary Genius/
We shall afterwards find that the theory of error, to which
is made the ultimate appeal in cases of quantitative in-
vestigation, is founded upon the comparative numbers of
combinations as displayed in the triangle.
Connection between the Arithmetical Triangle and the
Logical Abecedarium.
There exists a close connection between the arith-
metical triangle described in the last section, and the
series of combinations of letters called the Logical Abece-
darium. The one is to mathematical science what the
other is to logical science. In fact the figurate numbers,
or those exhibited in the triangle, are obtained by
summing up the logical combinations. Accordingly, just
as the total of the numbers in each line of the triangle
was twice as great as that for the preceding line (p. 210),
so each column of the Abecedarium (p. 109) contained
twice as many combinations as the preceding one. The
like correspondence would also exist between the sums
of all the lines of figures down to any particular line, and
of the combinations down to any particular column.
By examining any one column of the Abecedarium, we
shall also find that the combinations naturally group
themselves according to the figurate numbers. Take the
combinations of the letters A, B, 0, D ; they consist of
all the ways in which I can choose four, three, two, one,
or none of the four letters, filling up the vacant spaces
