CLASSIFICATION. 353
portant facts concerning the nationality of the persons. It
would appear that the Evans's and Jones's were of Welsh
descent, and those whose names bear the prefix Mac of
Scotch descent. With the nationality would be more or
less strictly correlated many peculiarities of physical con-
stitution, language, habits, or mental character. In other
cases I have been interested in noticing the empirical
inferences which are displayed in the most apparently
arbitrary arrangements. If a large register of the names
of ships be examined it will often be found that a number
of ships bearing the same name were built about the same
*time, a correlation due to the occurrence of some striking
incident shortly previous to the building of the ships.
The age of ships or other structures is usually closely cor-
related with their general form, nature of materials, &c.
It is impossible to examine the details of some of the
most apparently artificial systems of classification of plants,
without finding that many of the classes are natural in
character. Thus in Tournefort's arrangement, depending
almost entirely on the formation of the corolla, we find
the natural orders of the Labiatse, Cruciferaa, Rosacese,
Umbelliferse, Liliacese, and Papilionacese, recognise! in
his 4th, 5th, 6th, yth, pth, and loth classes. Many of the
classes in Linnaeus' celebrated sexual system also approxi-
mate to natural classes.
Correlation of Properties.
Habits and usages of language are always apt to lead
us into the error of imagining that when we employ
different words we mean different things. In introducing
the subject of classification nominally I was careful to
draw the reader's attention to the fact that all reasoning
and all operations of scientific method really involve
classification, though we are accustomed to use the name
