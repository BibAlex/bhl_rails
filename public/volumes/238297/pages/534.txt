44 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
that A is the cause of X, I must maintain invariable all
surrounding objects and conditions, and I must then show
that where A is X is, and where A is not X is not. Now
this cannot really be accomplished in a single trial. If,
for instance, a chemist places a certain suspected substance
in the Marsh's test apparatus, and finds that it gives a
small deposit of metallic arsenic, he cannot be sure that
the arsenic really proceeded from the suspected substance ;
for the impurity of the zinc or sulphuric acid might have
been the cause of its appearance. It is therefore the
practice of chemists to make what they call a blind ex-
periment, that is to try whether arsenic appears in the
absence of the suspected substance. The same precaution
ought to be taken in all important analytical operations.
Indeed, it is not merely a precaution, it is an essential
part of any experiment. If the blind trial be not made,
the chemist merely assumes that he knows what would
happen. Whenever we assert that because A and X are
found together A is the cause of X, we imply and assume
that if A were absent X would be absent. But wherever
it is possible, we ought clearly not to leave this as a
mere assumption, or even as a matter of inference. Ex-
perience is ultimately the basis of all our inferences,
but if we can with care bring immediate experience
to bear upon the point in question we should not trust
to anything more remote and liable to error. When
Faraday examined the magnetic properties of the bearing
apparatus, in the absence of the substance to be ex-
perimented on, he really made a blind experiment (see
vol. ii. p. 41).
We ought also, whenever we can, to test the sufficiency
and accuracy of any method of experiment by introducing
known amounts of the substance or force to be detected.
Thus a new analytical process for the quantitative esti-
mation of an element should be tested by performing it
