THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF PHENOMENA. 345
established by a simple acoustical observation. When
a rod or tongue of metal fixed at one end is set in
vibration, the pitch of the sound may be observed to
be exactly the same, whether the vibrations be small or
great ; hence the oscillations are isochronous, or equally
rapid, independently of their magnitude. On the ground
of theory, it can be shown that such a result only
happens when the flexure is proportional to the deflecting
force. Thus the simple observation that the pitch of
the sound of a harmonium, for instance, does not change
with its loudness, establishes an exact law of nature e .
A closely similar instance is found in the proof that the
intensity of light or heat rays varies inversely as the
square of the distance increases. For the apparent mag-
nitude certainly varies according to this law; hence, if the
intensity of light varied according to any other law, the
brightness of an object would be different at different
distances, which is not observed to be the case. Mellon i
applied the same kind of reasoning, in a somewhat dif-
ferent form, to the radiation of heat-rays f .
Modes of Indirect Measurement.
Some of the most conspicuously beautiful experiments
in the whole range of science, have been devised for the
purpose of indirectly measuring quantities, which in their
extreme greatness or smallness surpass the powers of
sense. All that we need to do, is to discover some
other conveniently measurable phenomenon, which is re-
lated in a known ratio or according to a known law,
however complicated, with that to be measured. Having
