consideration how far and in what manner we can safely
undertake thus to assign the place of objects in that
general system of classification which constitutes the
whole body of science.
Twofold Meaning of General Names.
Etymologically the meaning of a name is what we are
caused to think of when the name is used. Now every
general name causes us to think of some one or more of
the objects belonging to a class ; it may also cause us to
think of the common qualities possessed by those objects.
A name is said to denote the distinct object of thought
to which it may be applied ; it implies at the same time
the possession of certain qualities or circumstances. The
number of objects denoted forms the extent of meaning
of the term ; the number of qualities implied forms
the intent of meaning. Crystal is the name of any sub-
stance of which the molecules are arranged in a regular
geometrical manner. The substances or objects in ques-
tion form the extent of meaning ; the circumstance of
having the molecules so arranged forms the intent of
meaning.
When we compare a variety of general terms it may
often be found that the meaning of one is included in
the meaning of another. Thus all crystals are included
among material substances, and all opaque crystals are in-
cluded among crystals: here the inclusion is in extension.
We may also have inclusion of meaning in regard to
intension. For as ah 1 crystals are material substances,
the qualities implied by the term material substance
must be among those implied by crystal. Again, it is
obvious that while in extension of meaning opaque
crystals are but a part of crystals, in intension of meaning
