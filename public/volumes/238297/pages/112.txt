86 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
The order of statement, in short, has no effect upon the
meaning of an aggregate of alternatives, so that the Law
of Commutativeness holds true of the disjunctive symbol.
As we have admitted the possibility of joining as alter-
natives terms which are not really different, the ques-
tion arises, How shall we treat two or more alternatives
when they are clearly shown to be the same \ If we
have it asserted that P is Q or R, and it is afterwards
proved that Q is but another name for R, the result is
that P is either II or H. How shall we interpret such a
statement \ What would be the meaning, for instance, of
' wreath or anadem ' if, on referring to a dictionary, we
found anadem described as a wreath ? I take it to be
self-evident that the meaning would then become simply
* wreath/ Accordingly we may affirm the general law
A | A = A.
Any number of identical alternatives may always be
reduced to, and are logically equivalent to, any one of
those alternatives. This is a law which distinguishes
mathematical terms from logical terms, because it ob-
viously does not apply to the former. I propose to call
it the Law of Unity, because it must really be involved
in any definition of a mathematical unit. This law is
closely analogous to the Law of Simplicity, AA = A ; and
the nature of the connection is worthy of attention.
I am not aware that logicians have in any adequate way
noticed the close relation between combined and dis-
junctive terms, namely that every disjunctive term is the
negative of a corresponding combined term, and vice versd.
Consider the term
Malleable dense metal.
How shall we describe the class of things which are not
malleable-dense-metals ? Whatever is included under that
term must have all the qualities of malleability, denseness,
and metallic nature. Wherever any one or more of the
