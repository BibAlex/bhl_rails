76 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
sea, every mine affords conclusive evidence. If the astro-
nomer is to make his calculations perfect, he must not
only take account of the Himalayas and the Andes, the
Atlantic and Pacific, but the attraction of every hill, nay,
every ant-hill, must be separately calculated, nor must the
attractive power of any grain of sand be neglected. So far
are they from having yet considered any local inequality
of the surface, that they have not yet decided upon the
general form of the earth ; it is yet a matter of specula-
tion whether or not the earth is an ellipsoid with three
unequal axes c . If, as is probable, the globe is proved to
be irregularly compressed in some directions, the calcula-
tions of astronomers will have to be repeated and refined,
in order that they may approximate to the attractive
power of such a body. If we cannot accurately learn the
form of our own earth, how can we expect to ascertain
that of the moon, the sun, and other planets, in some of
which are probably irregularities of greater proportional
amount.
The science of physical astronomy is yet in a further
way merely approximative and hypothetical. Given
perfectly homogeneous ellipsoids acting upon each other
according to the law of gravity, the best mathematicians
have never and perhaps never will determine exactly the
resulting movements. Even when three bodies simul-
taneously attract each other the complication of effects is
so great that only approximate calculations can be made.
Astronomers have not even attempted the general problem
of the simultaneous attractions of four, five, six, or more
bodies, resolving the general problem into so many cjif-
ferent problems of three bodies. The principle upon
which the calculations of physical astronomy proceed, is to
neglect every effect which could not lead to any quantity
appreciable in observation, and the quantities rejected
