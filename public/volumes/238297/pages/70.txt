44 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
of gravity is directly as the product of the masses, and
inversely as the square of the distance/ are propositions
concerning magnitude or degree. Logicians have not paid
adequate attention to the great variety of propositions
which can be stated by the use of the little conjunction
as, together with so. ' As the home so the people/ is a
proposition expressing identity of manner ; and a great
number of similar propositions all indicating some kind of
resemblance might be quoted. Whatever be the special
kind or form of identity, all such expressions of identity
are subject to the great principle of inference ; but as we
shall in later parts of this work treat more particularly
of inference in cases of number and magnitude, we will
here confine our attention to the logical propositions
which involve only notions of quality.
Simple Identities.
The most important class of propositions consists of
those which fall under the formula
A = B,
and may be called simple identities. I may instance, in
the first place, those most elementary propositions which
express the exact similarity of a quality encountered in
two or more objects. I may compare by memory or
otherwise the colour of the Pacific ocean with that of
the Atlantic, and declare them identical. I may assert
that 'the smell of a rotten egg is that of hydrogen
sulphide/ ' the taste of silver hyposulphite is that of
cane sugar/ ' the sound of an earthquake is that of distant
artillery.' Such are propositions stating, accurately or
otherwise, the identity or non-identity of simple physical
sensations. Judgments of this kind are necessarily pre-
supposed in more complex judgments. If I declare that
1 this coin is made of gold/ I must base the judgment upon
