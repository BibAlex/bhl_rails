But the present theory of classification was not reached
until at least three previous false systems had been long
entertained. And though there is much reason to believe
that the present system of classification according to
atomicity is substantially correct, many errors may yet
be discovered in the details of the grouping.
Symbolic Statement of the Theory of Classification.
The whole theory of classification can be explained in
the most complete and general manner, by reverting for
a time to the use of the Logical Abecedarium, which was
found to be of supreme importance in Formal Logic (vol. i.
p. 109). That form expresses in fact the necessary classi-
fication of all objects and ideas as depending on the laws
of thought, and there is no point concerning the purpose
and methods of classification which may not be explained
most precisely by the use of letter combinations, the only
inconvenience being the somewhat abstract and repulsive
form in which the subject is thus represented.
If we pay regard only to three qualities or circum-
stances in which things may resemble each other, namely
the qualities A, B, C, then there are according to the laws
of thought eight possible classes of objects. If there exist
objects belonging to aU these eight classes, thus indicated,
ABC aBC
ABc aBc
A6C abC
Abe abc
it follows that the qualities A, B, C are subject to no
conditions except the primary laws of thought and nature
(vol. i. p. 6). There is then no special law of nature to
