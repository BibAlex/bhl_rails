THE INDIRECT METHOD OF INFERENCE. 105
class not-element or c. By the Law of Duality we can
develop c into four alternatives, thus
c ABc -I- A6c -I- aBc [ abc.
Now if we substitute for A and B as before, we get
c = ABCc I AB&c I aBCc -|- abc,
and striking out the terms which, break the Law of Contra-
diction there remains
c = abc,
or what is not element is also not iron arid not metal.
This Indirect Method of Inference thus furnishes a
complete solution of the following problem Given any
number of logical premises or conditions, required the
description of any class of objects, or any term, as governed
by those conditions.
The steps of the process of inference may thus be
concisely stated :
1. By the Law of Duality develop the utmost number
of alternatives which may exist in the description of the
required class or term as regards the terms involved in
the premises.
2. For each term, in these alternatives substitute its
description as given in the premises.
3. Strike out every alternative which is then found to
break the Law of Contradiction.
4. The remaining terms may be equated to the term in
question as the desired description or inference.
Abbreviation of the Process.
Before proceeding to illustrations of the use of this
method, I must point out how much its practical em-
ployment can be simplified, and how much more easy it
is than would appear from the description. When we
want to effect at all a complete solution of a logical
