already mentioned (vol. ii. p. 235), until he happened to
test a piece of the heavy glass. The peculiar refractive
power of this medium caused the magnetic strain to be
apparent, and the rotation of the plane of polarization was
discovered.
In almost every other part of physical science there is
some substance of powers pre-eminent for the special pur-
pose to which it is put. Rock-salt is invaluable for its
extreme diathermancy or transparency to the least re-
frangible rays of the spectrum. Quartz is equally valu-
able for its transparency, as regards the ultra-violet or
most refrangible rays. Diamond is the most highly refrac-
ting substance which is at the same time transparent ;
were it more abundant and easily worked it would be
of great optical importance. Cinnabar is distinguished
by possessing a power of rotating the plane of polarization
of light, from 1 5 to 17 times that of quartz. In electric
experiments copper is employed for its high conducting
powers and exceedingly low magnetic properties ; iron
is of course essential for its enormous and almost ano-
malous magnetic powers ; whi]e bismuth holds a like place
as regards its diamagnetic powers, and was t)f much im-
portance in TyndalTs decisive researches upon the polar
character of the diamagnetic force. In regard to magne-
crystallic action the mineral cyanite is highly remark-
able, being so powerfully affected by the earth's magnetism,
that when delicately suspended, it will assume, a constant
position with regard to the magnetic meridian, and may
almost be used like the compass needle. Sodium is dis-
tinguished by its unique light-giving powers, which are
so extreme that probably one half of the whole number of
stars in the heavens have a yellow tinge in consequence.
It is highly remarkable that water, though the most
common of all fluids, is distinguished in almost every
