PREFACE.
the conditions and precautions requisite for accurate ob-
servation, for successful experiment, and for the sure
detection of the quantitative laws of nature. As it is
impossible to comprehend aright the value of quantitative
laws without constantly bearing in mind the degree of
quantitative approximation to the truth probably attained,
I have devoted a special chapter to the Theory of Ap-
proximation, and however imperfectly I may have treated
this subject, I must look upon it as a very essential part
of a work on Scientific Method.
It then remains to illustrate the sound use of hypo-
thesis, to distinguish between the portions of knowledge
which we owe to empirical observation, to accidental
discovery, or to scientific prediction. Interesting questions
arise concerning the accordance of quantitative theories
and experiments, and I point out how the successive veri-
fication of an hypothesis by distinct methods of experi-
ment yields conclusions approximating to but never
attaining certainty. Additional illustrations of the general
procedure of inductive investigations are given in a
chapter on the Character of the Experimentalist, in which
I endeavour to show, moreover, that the inverse use of
deduction was really the logical method of such great
masters of experimental inquiry as Newton, Huyghens,
and Faraday.
In treating Generalization and Analogy, I consider the
precautions requisite in inferring from one case to another,
or from one part of the universe to another part, the
validity of all such inferences resting ultimately upon the
inverse method of probabilities. The treatment of Ex-
ceptional Phenomena appeared to afford an interesting
subject for a further chapter illustrating trie various modes
in which an outstanding fact may eventually be explained.
The formal part of the book closes with the subject of
Classification, which is, however, very inadequately treated.
