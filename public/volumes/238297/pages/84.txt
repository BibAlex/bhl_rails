exactly corresponds with the circumstance of being iden-
tical in magnitude. Similarly in
Opacity = Incapability of transmitting light,
the quality of being incapable of transmitting light is
declared to be the same as the intended meaning of the
word opacity.
When general names form the terms of a proposition
we may apply a double interpretation. Thus
Exogens = Dicotyledons
means either that the qualities which belong to all exo-
gens are the same as those which belong to all dicotyle-
dons, or else that every individual falling under one name
falls equally under the other. Hence it may be said that
there are two distinct fields of logical thought. We may
argue either by the qualitative meaning of names or
by the quantitative, that is, the extensive meaning.
Every argument involving concrete plural terms might
be converted into one involving only abstract singular
terms, and vice versa. But there are many reasons for
believing that the intensive or qualitative form of reason-
ing is the primary and fundamental one. It is sufficient
to point out that we may use abstract terms which contain
no reference to an extensive meaning ; and when there
is a mode which we must sometimes and may always
adopt, it is higher in importance than a mode which we
never need adopt necessarily.
