THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
Variable Properties of Matter.
I have enumerated some of the few properties of matter,
which are manifested in exactly the same manner by all
substances, whatever be their differences of chemical or
physical constitution. But by far the greater number <
qualities vary in degree ; substances are more or ^lesi
dense, more or less transparent, more or less compress
more or less magnetic, and so on. One very common
result of the progress of science is to show that qualities
supposed to be entirely absent from many substances are
present only in so low a degree of intensity that the
means of detection were insufficient. Newton believed
that most bodies were not, Affected by the magnet at all
Faraday and Tyndall have rendered it very doubtful
whether any substance whate cS wholly non-magnetic,
including under that term diamagnetic properties,
are rapidly learning to believe that there are no sub-|
stances absolutely opaque, or non-conducting, non-electric,
non-elastic, non-viscous, non- compressible, insoluble, in-
fusible, or non-volatile. All tends to become a matter o1
degree, or sometimes of direction. There may be som-
substances oppositely affected to others, as ferro-magneti
substances are oppositely affected to diamagnetics, or ?
substances which contract by heat are opposed to tho*
which expand; but the tendency is certainly for evei
affection of one kind of matter to be represented by some
thing similar in other kinds. On this account one ol
Newton's rules of philosophizing seems quite to lose al
validity ; he said, ' Those qualities of bodies which arj
not capable of being heightened and remitted, and whicfl
are found in all bodies on which experiment can be mad<
must be considered as universal qualities of all bodies
As far as I can see, the contrary is more probable, nameW
