pendulum, performed by Newton and Gauss, shows that
all kinds of matter equally gravitate, that is, the attractive
power of a substance is exactly proportional to its density.
Two portions of matter then which are in equilibrium in
the balance, may be assumed to possess equal inertia, and
their densities will therefore be inversely as their cubic
dimensions.
Unit of Mass.
Multiplying the number of units of density of a portion
of matter, by the number of units of space occupied by it,
we arrive at the quantity of matter, or, as it is usually
called, the units of mass, as indicated by the inertia and
gravity it possesses. To proceed in the most simple and
logical manner, the unit of mass ought to be that of a
cubic unit of matter of the standard density. The
founders of the French metrical system took as their unit
of mass, the cubic centimetre of water, at the temperature
of maximum density (about 4 Centigrade). They called
this unit of mass the gramme, and constructed standard
specimens of the kilogram, which might be readily re-
ferred to by all who required to employ accurate weights.
Unfortunately, however, the determination of the bulk of
a given weight of water at a certain temperature is an
operation involving many practical and theoretical dif-
ficulties, and it can not be performed in the present day
with a greater exactness than that of about one part in
5000, the results of careful observers being sometimes
found to differ as much as one part in i ooo *.
Weights, on the other hand, can be compared with
each other to at least one part in a million. Hence if
different specimens of the kilogram be prepared by direct
