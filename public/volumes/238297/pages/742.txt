different elasticity in different directions, and thus de-
nuded of the rich geometrical complexity of solids, they
retain the variety of density, colour, degrees of trans-
parency, great diversity in surface tension, viscosity, co-
efficients of expansion, compressibility, and many other
properties which we observe in solids, but not for the
most part in gases. Though our knowledge of the phy-
sical properties of liquids is thus much wanting in
generality at present, there is ground to hope that by
degrees laws connecting and explaining the varieties
of character may be traced out. Liquids ought to be
compared together, not at uniform temperatures, but at
points of temperature similarly related to the points of
fusion and ebullition.
Solids are in every way contrasted to gases. Each solid
substance has its own peculiar density, hardness, com-
pressibility, degree of transparency, tenacity, elasticity,
power of conducting heat and electricity, magnetic pro-
perties, capability of producing frictional electricity, and
so forth. Even different specimens of the same kind of
substance will be widely different, according to the acci-
dental treatment it has received. And not only has
each substance its own specific properties, but, when
crystallized, its own properties peculiar to each direc-
tion, regard being had to the axes of crystallization.
The velocity of radiation, the rate of conduction of heat,
the coefficients of expansibility and compressibility, the
thermo-electric properties, all vary in different crystallo-
graphic directions.
It is highly probable that many apparent differences
among liquids, and even among solids, will be resolved
and explained, when we learn to regard them under ex-
actly corresponding circumstances. The extreme gene-
rality of the properties of gases is really only true at an
infinitely high temperature, when they are all equally
