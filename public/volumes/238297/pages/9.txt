PREFACE.
IT may be truly asserted that the rapid progress of
the physical sciences during the last three centuries has
not been accompanied by a corresponding advance in
the theory of reasoning. Physicists speak familiarly of
Scientific Method, but they could not readily describe
what they mean by that expression. Profoundly engaged
in the study of particular classes of natural phenomena,
they are usually too much engrossed in the immense and
ever-accumulating details of their special sciences, to
generalize upon the methods of reasoning which they
unconsciously employ. Yet few will deny that these
methods of reasoning ought to be studied, especially by
those who endeavour to introduce scientific order into less
successful and methodical branches of knowledge.
The application of Scientific Method cannot be re- \
stricted to the sphere of lifeless objects. We must sooner
or later have strict sciences of those mental and social
phenomena, which, if comparison be possible, are of
more interest to us than purely material phenomena.
But it is the proper course of reasoning to proceed from
the known to the unknown from the evident to the
obscure from the material and palpable to the subtle
and refined. The physical sciences may therefore be
properly made the practice-ground of the reasoning
