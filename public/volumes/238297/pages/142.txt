those which are inconsistent with the premises, there
remain only
ABcd
AbCd
AbcD
abcD
abed.
The expression for not-opaque things consists of the
three combinations containing d, thus
d = KBcd \- AbCd { abed,
or d = Ad (Be -|- bC) [ abed.
In ordinary language, what is not-opaque is either
metal which is gold, and then not-silver, or silver and then
not gold, or else it is not-metal and neither gold nor silver.
A good example for the illustration of the Indirect
Method is to be found in De Morgan's Formal Logic (p.
123), the premises being substantially as follows :
From A follows B, and from C follows D ; but B and
D are inconsistent with each other ; therefore A and C
are inconsistent.
The meaning no doubt is that where A is, B will be
found, or that every A is a B, and similarly every C is a D ;
but B and D cannot occur together. The premises there-
fore appear to be of the form
A = AB, (i)
C = CD, (2)
B = Ed. (3)
On examining the series of sixteen combinations, but five
are found to be consistent with the above conditions,
namely,
ABcd
aBcd
abCD
abcD
abed.
