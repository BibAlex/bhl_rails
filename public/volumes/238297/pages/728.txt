238 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
in nature, in which the mutual relations of electricity and
gravity would come into play ; he pictures to himself the
planets and the comets charging themselves as they ap-
proach the sun ; cascades, rain, rising vapour, circulating
currents of the atmosphere, the fumes of a volcano, the
smoke in a chimney become so many electrical machines.
A multitude of events and changes in the atmosphere
seem to be at once elucidated by such actions ; for a
moment his reveries have the vividness of fact. * I think
we have been dull and blind not to have suspected some
such results,' and he sums up rapidly the consequences of
his great but imaginary theory ; an entirely new mode of
exciting heat or electricity, an entirely new relation of the
natural forces, an analysis of gravitation, and a justifica-
tion of the conservation of force. Such were Faraday's
fondest dreams of what might be, and to many another
philosopher they would have been a sufficient basis for
the writing of a great book. But Faraday's imagination
was within his full control ; as he himself says, ' Let the
imagination go, guarding it by judgment and principle,
and holding it in and directing it by experiment/ His
dreams soon took a very practical form, and for many
subsequent days he laboured with ceaseless energy, on the
staircase of the Eoyal Institution, in the clock tower of
the Houses of Parliament, or in the Shot Tower at
Southwark, raising and lowering heavy weights, and com-
bining electrical helices and wires in every conceivable
way. His skill and long experience in experiment were
severely taxed to eliminate the effects of the earth's mag-
netism, and time after time he saved himself from accept-
ing mistaken indications, which to another man might
have seemed conclusive verifications of his theory. When
all was done there remained absolutely no results. ' The
experiments/ he says, * were well made, but the results are
negative;' and yet he adds, 'I cannot accept them as
