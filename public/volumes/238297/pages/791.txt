ANALOGY. 301
alogies receives a salutary correction in the recently dis-
covered fact that the atmosphere of Uranus contains
hydrogen. Philosophers of the highest grade have not
stopped at these comparatively safe inferences, but have
speculated on the existence of living creatures in other
planets. Huyghens remarked that as we infer by analogy
from the dissected body of a dog to that of a pig and
ox or other animal of the same general form, and as we
expect to find the same viscera, the heart, stomach, lungs,
intestines, &c., in corresponding positions, so when we
notice the similarity of the planets in many respects, we
must expect to find them alike in other points 11 . He
even enters into an inquiry whether the inhabitants of
other planets would possess reason and knowledge of the
same sort as ours, concluding in the affirmative. Although
the power of intellect might be different, he considers that
they would have the same geometry if they had any at
all, and that what is true with us would be true with
them . As regards the sun, he wisely observes that every
conjecture fails. Laplace entertained a strong belief in
the existence of inhabitants on other planets. The benign
influence of the sun gives birth to animals and plants
upon the surface of the earth, and analogy induces us to
believe that his rays would tend to have a similar effect
elsewhere. It is not probable that matter which is here
so fruitful of life, would be sterile upon so great a globe
as Jupiter, which, like the earth, has its days and nights
and years, and changes which indicate active forces. Man
indeed is formed for the temperature and atmosphere in
which he lives, and, so far as appears, could not live upon
the other planets. But there might be an infinity of
organizations relative to the diverse constitution of the
bodies of the universe. The most active imagination can-
