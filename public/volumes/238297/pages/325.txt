may happen in addition to those which have been ob-
served, we must assign unity for the probability of such
new event. The proportional probabilities then become
i for a new event, m + i for A, n + i for B, and so on, and
the absolute probability of A is
&c. c
It is very interesting to trace out the variations of
probability according to these rules under diverse circum-
stances. Thus the first time a casual event happens it is
i to i, or as likely as not that it will happen again ; if it
does happen it is 2 to i that it will happen a third time ;
and on successive occasions of the Hke kind the odds
become 3, 4, 5, 6, &c., to i. The odds of course will be
discriminated from the probabilities which are successively
i> i, ^, &c. Thus on the first occasion on which a person
sees a shark, and notices that it is accompanied by a little
pilot fish, the odds are i to i , or the probability ^, that the
next shark will be so accompanied.
When an event has happened a very great number of
times, its happening once again approaches nearly to cer-
tainty. Thus if we suppose the sun to have risen demon-
stratively one thousand million times, the probability that it
will rise again, on the ground of this knowledge merely, is
1,000,000,000+1 Bu( . then the babilit t]mt it wi jj
1,000,000,000+ I + 1
continue to rise for as long a period as we know it to have
risen is only I ' 000 ' 000 ' 000+I , or almost exactly 4. The
2,000,000,000 + 1
probability that it will continue so rising a thousand times
as long is only about 5-^77. The lesson which we may
draw from these figures is quite that which we should
adopt on other grounds, namely that experience never
affords certain knowledge, and that it is exceedingly im-
probable that events will always happen as we observe
