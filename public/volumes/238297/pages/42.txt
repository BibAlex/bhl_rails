16 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
language convenient, but it is essential to the expression
of those general truths which are the very soul of science.
To apprehend the truth of special cases of inference does
not constitute logic ; we must apprehend them as cases of
more general truths. The object of all science is the
separation of what is common and general from what is
accidental and different. In a system of logic, if anywhere,
we should esteem this generality, and strive to exhibit
clearly what is similar in. very diverse cases. Hence the
great value of general symbols by which we can represent
the form and character of a reasoning process, disentangled
from any consideration of the special subject to which it is
applied.
The signs required in logic are of a very simple kind.
As every sameness or difference must exist between two
things or notions, we need signs or terms to indicate the
things or notions compared, and other signs to denote the
relation between them. We shall need, then, (i) symbols
for terms, (2) a symbol for sameness, (3) a symbol for differ-
ence, and (4) one or two symbols to take the place of
conjunctions.
Ordinary nouns substantive, such as Iron, Metal, Elec-
tricity, Undulation, might serve as terms, but for the
reasons explained above it is better to adopt blank letters,
devoid of special signification, such as A, B, C, D, E, &c.
Each letter must be understood to represent a noun, and,
so far as the conditions of the argument allow, any noun.
Just as in Algebra, x, y, z, p, q, r, &c. are used for any
quantities, undetermined or unknown, except when the
special conditions of the problem are taken into account,
so will our letters stand for undetermined or unknown
things.
These letter-terms will be used indifferently for nouns
substantive and adjective. Between these two kinds of
nouns there may be important differences in a metaphysical
