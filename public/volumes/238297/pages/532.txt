splendid experiments on the density of the earth. The
accuracy of his results entirely depended upon the eli-
mination of all disturbing influences, so that the oscillation
of his torsion balance should depend on gravity alone.
Hence he varied the apparatus in many ways, changing the
small balls subject to attraction, changing the connecting
rod, and the means of suspension. He observed the effect
of artificial disturbances, such as the presence of visitors,
the occurrence of violent storms, &c., and as no real altera-
tion was produced in the results, he confidently attributed
them to gravity 6 .
Newton would probably have discovered the mode of
constructing achromatic lenses, but for the unsuspected
effect of some sugar of lead which he is supposed to have
dissolved in the water of a prism. He tried, by means of
a glass prism combined with a water prism, to produce
dispersion of light without refraction, and if he had
succeeded there would have been an obvious mode of
producing refraction without dispersion. His failure is
supposed to be due to his adding lead acetate to the water
for the purpose of increasing its refractive power, the lead
having a high dispersive power which frustrated his pur-
pose^ Judging from Newton's remarks, in the ' Philo-
sophical Transactions/ it would appear as if he had not,
without many unsuccessful trials, despaired of the con-
struction of achromatic glasses .
The Academicians of Cimento, in their early and in-
genious experiments upon the vacuum, were often misled
by the mechanical imperfections of their apparatus. They
concluded that the air had nothing to do with the pro-
