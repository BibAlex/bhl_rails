ANALYSIS OF QUANTITATIVE PHENOMENA. 391
obtained a measure of the effect of atmospheric pressure
on the bulb, he opened the top of the thermometer tube
and admitted the air. The level of the water now sank
still more, partly from the pressure on the bulb being
now compensated, and partly from the compression of the
water by the atmospheric pressure. It is obvious that
the amount of the latter effect was approximately the
difference of the two observed depressions.
Not uncommonly indeed the actual phenomenon which
we wish to measure is considerably less than various
disturbing effects which enter into the question. Thus
the compressibility of mercury is considerably less than
the expansion of the vessels in which it is measured
under pressure, so that the attention of the experi-
mentalist has chiefly to be concentrated on the change
of magnitude of the vessels. Many astronomical phe-
nomena, such as the parallax or proper motions of the
fixed stars, are far less than the instrumental imper-
fections, and the other phenomena of precession, nutation,
aberration, &c. Even Flamsteed imagined he had dis-
covered the parallax of the pole star 6 , and 'time after
time astronomers mistook various other phenomena for
that minute motion which they were so desirous to
discover.
Methods of Eliminating Error.
In any particular experiment it is the object of the
experimentalist to measure a single effect only, and he
endeavours to obtain that effect free from any interfering
effects. If this cannot be, as it seldom or never can.
really be, he makes the effect as considerable as possible
compared with the other effects, which he reduces to a
minimum, and treats as noxious errors. Those quantities,
