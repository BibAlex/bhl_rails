is infinitely more probable, diverge from it by an amount
which we must regard as error of unknown origin. Now,
to quote the words of Sir J. Herschel 6 , 'the probability of
that error is the unknown function of its square, i. e. of
the sum of the squares of its deviations in any two rect-
angular directions. Now, the probability of any deviation
depending solely on its magnitude, and not on its direc-
tion, it follows that the probability of each of these rect-
angular deviations must be the same function of its square.
And since the observed oblique deviation is equivalent to
the two rectangular ones, supposed concurrent, and which
are essentially independent of one another, and is, there-
fore, a compound event of which they are the simple in-
dependent constituents, therefore its probability will be
the product of their separate probabilities. Thus the
form of our unknown function comes to be determined
from this condition, viz., that the product of such functions
of two independent elements is equal to the same function
of their sum. But it is shown in every work on algebra
that this property is the peculiar characteristic of, and
belongs only to, the exponential or antilogarithmic function.
This, then, is the function of the square of the error, which
expresses the probability of committing that error. That
probability decreases, therefore, in geometrical progression,
as the square of the error increases in arithmetical/
Laplace s and Quetelet's Proof of the Law
of Error.
However much presumption the modes of determining
the Law of Error, already described, may give in favour
of the law usually adopted, it is difficult to feel that the
