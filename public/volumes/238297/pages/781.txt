ANALOGY. 291
sents some algebraic equation, we are presented by simple
observation of many mechanical movements with abun-
dant suggestions towards the discovery of mathematical
problems. Every particle of a carriage- wheel when mov-
ing on a level road is constantly describing a cycloidal
curve, the curious properties of which exercised the in-
genuity of all the most skilful mathematicians of the
seventeenth century, and led to important advancements
in algebraic power. It may well be held even that the
discovery of the Differential Calculus is mainly due to
geometrical analogy, because mathematicians, in attempt-
ing to treat algebraically the tangent of a continuously
varying curve, were obliged to entertain the notion of
infinitely small quantities d . There can be no doubt
that Newton's fluxional, or in fact geometrical mode of
stating the differential calculus, however much it sub-
sequently retarded its progress in England, facilitated its
apprehension at first, and I should think it almost certain
that Newton discovered the calculus geometrically.
We may accordingly look upon this discovery of
analogy, this happy alliance, as Bossut calls it e , between
geometry and algebra, as the chief source of discoveries
which have been made for three centuries past in mathe-
matical methods. This is certainly the opinion of no less
an authority than Lagrange, who has said, ' So long as
algebra and geometry have been separate, their progress
was slow, and their employment limited ; but since these
two sciences have been united, they have lent each other
mutual strength, and have marched together with a rapid
step towards perfection/
The advancement of mechanical science has also been
greatly aided by analogy. An abstract and intangible
