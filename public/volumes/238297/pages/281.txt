PHILOSOPHY OF INDUCTIVE INFERENCE. 255
science, but he so uses the expression as to imply that
when once we pass within the circle of causation we deal
with certainties.
The philosophical danger which attaches to the use of
this word may be thus described. A cause is defined as
the necessary or invariable antecedent of an event, so
'that when the cause exists the effect will also exist or
soon follow. If then we know the cause of an event, we
know when it will certainly happen ; and as it is implied
that science, by a proper experimental method, may attain
to a knowledge of causes, it follows that experience may \
give us a certain knowledge of future events. Now, no- \
" thing is more unquestionable than that finite experience
can never give us certain knowledge of the future, so that
either a cause is not an invariable antecedent, or else we/
> can never gain certain knowledge as to causes. The first
horn of this dilemma is hardly to be accepted. Doubtless
there is in nature some invariably acting mechanism, such
that from certain fixed conditions an invariable result
always emerges. But we, with our finite minds and
short experience, can never penetrate the mystery of
those existences which embody the Will of the Creator,
) and evolve it throughout time. We are in the position
of spectators who witness the productions of a compli-
cated machine, but are not allowed to examine its inti-
mate structure. We learn what does happen and what
does appear, but if we ask for the reason, the answer
would involve an infinite depth of mystery. The simplest
bit of matter, or the most trivial incident, such as the
stroke of two billiard balls, offers infinitely more to learn
than ever the human intellect can fathom. The word cause
covers just as much untold meaning as any of the words
substance, matter, thought, existence.
