PHILOSOPHY OF INDUCTIVE INFERENCE. 253
the diameter of a circle, with its apex upon the circum-
ference, apparently contains a right angle, we may
ascertain that all triangles in similar circumstances will
contain right angles. This is a case of pure space reason-
ing, apart from circumstances of time or quality, and it
seems to be governed by different principles of reasoning.
I shall endeavour to show, however, that geometrical
reasoning differs but in degree from that which applies
to other natural relations. If we observe that the com-
ponents of a binary star have moved for a length of time
in elliptic curves, we have reason to believe that they will
continue so to move. Time and space relations are here
complicated together.
The Relation of Cause and Effect.
In a very large part of the scientific investigations
which must be considered, we deal with events which
follow from previous events, or with existences which
succeed existences. Science, indeed, might arise even were
material nature a fixed and changeless whole. Endow
mind with the power to travel about, and compare part
with part, and it could certainly draw inferences concern-
ing the similarity of forms, the co-existence of qualities,
or the preponderance of a particular kind of matter in
a changeless world. A solid universe, in at least approxi-
mate equilibrium, is not inconceivable, and then the rela-
tion of cause and effect would evidently be no more than
the relation of before and after. As nature exists, how-
ever, it is a progressive existence, ever moving and
changing as time, the great independent variable, pro-
ceeds. Hence it arises that we must continually compare
what is happening now with what happened a moment
before, and a moment before that moment, and so on,
until we reach indefinite periods of past time. A comet
