GENERALIZATION. 275
one law phenomena which really belong to different laws.
It is generally known, for instance, that a spherical
shell of uniform matter attracts an external particle of
matter with a force varying inversely as the square of the
distance from the centre of the sphere. But this law
only holds true so long as the particle is external to the
shell. Within the sheU the law is wiiolly different, and
the aggregate gravity of the sphere becomes zero, because
the force in every direction is neutralized by an exactly
equal force. If an infinitely small particle be in the
superficies of a sphere, the law is again different, and the
attractive power of the shell is half what it would be
on particles infinitely close to the surface of the shell.
Thus in approaching the centre of a shell from a distance,
the force of gravity evinces a double discontinuity in
passing through the shell d .
It may well admit of question, too, whether discontinuity
is really unknown in nature. We perpetually do meet
with events which are real breaks upon the previous law,
though the discontinuity may then be a sign that some
wholly independent cause has come into operation. If
the ordinary course of the tides is interrupted by an
enormous and irregular wave, we attribute it to an earth-
quake, or some gigantic natural disturbance. If a meteoric
stone falls upon a person and kills him, it is clearly a
discontinuity in his life, of which he could have had no
anticipation. A sudden sound may pass through the
air neither preceded nor followed by any continuous
effect. Although, then, we may regard the Law of Con-
tinuity as a principle of nature holding rigorously true in
many of the relations of natural forces, it seems to be a
matter of difficulty to assign the limits within which the
