QUANTITATIVE INDUCTION. 413
the variant is of the variable, but we obtain another func-
tion which, within the bounds of our observation, gives
nearly the same series of values.
Discovery of Rational Formulce.
Let us now proceed to consider the modes in which
from numerical results we can establish the actual relation
between the quantity of the cause and that of the effect.
What we want is a rational formula or function, which
may exhibit the reason or exact character and origin of
the law in question. There is no word more frequently
used by mathematicians than the word function, and yet
it is difficult to define its meaning with perfect accuracy.
Originally it meant performance or execution, being equi-
valent to the Greek Xeirovpyia or reXeo-ima. Mathematicians
at first used it to mean any power of a quantity, but
afterwards generalized it so as to include ' any quantity
formed in any manner whatsoever from another quantity s.'
Any quantity, then, which depends upon and varies with
another quantity may be called a function of it, and
either may be considered a function of the other.
Given the quantities, we want the function of which
they are the values. It may first of ah! be pointed out
that simple inspection of the numbers cannot as a general
rule disclose the function. In an earlier part of this work
(vol. i. p. 142) I put before the reader certain numbers,
and requested him to point out the law which they obey,
and the same question will have to be asked in every
case of quantitative induction. There are perhaps three
methods, more or less distinct, by which we may hope to
obtain an answer :
(1) By purely haphazard trial.
(2) By noting the general character of the variation of
