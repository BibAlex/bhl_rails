338 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
It is obvious that many of the slower changes of the
heavenly bodies must require the lapse of large intervals
of time to render their amount perceptible. Hipparchus
could not possibly have discovered many of the smaller
inequalities of the heavenly motions, because there were
no previous observations of sufficient age or exactness to
exhibit them. And just as the observations of Hipparchus
formed the starting-point for subsequent comparisons, so
a large part of the labour of present astronomers is di-
rected to recording the present state of the heavens so
exactly, that future generations of astronomers may detect
many changes, which cannot possibly become known in
the present age.
The principle of repetition was very ingeniously em-
ployed in an instrument first proposed by Mayer in 1767,
and carried into practice in the Repeating Circle of Borda v .
The exact measurement of angles is indispensable, not
only in astronomy but also in trigonometrical surveys, and
the highest skill in the mechanical execution of the gradu-
ated circle and telescope will not prevent terminal errors
of considerable amount. If instead of one telescope, the
circle be provided with two similar telescopes, these may
be alternately directed to two distant points, say the
marks in a trigonometrical survey, so that the circle shall
be turned through any multiple of the angle subtended
by those marks, before the amount of the angular revolu-
tion is read off upon the graduated circle. Theoretically
speaking, all error arising from imperfect graduation might
thus be indefinitely reduced, being divided by the number
of repetitions. In practice, however, the advantage of
the invention is not found to be great, probably because
a certain error is introduced at each observation in the
changing or fixing of the telescopes. It is moreover in-
