the establishment of a conclusion and their probabilities
be m, n, p, q, r, &c., the probability of the conclusion on
the ground of these premises is mxnxpxqxrx
This product has but a small value, unless each of the
qualities m, n, &c., be nearly unity.
But it is particularly to be noticed that the probability
thus calculated is not the whole probability of the con-
clusion, but that only which it derives from the premises
in question. Whately's 1 remarks on this subject might
mislead the reader into supposing that the calculation is
completed by multiplying together the probabilities of the
premises. But it has been fully explained by De Morgan 111
that we must take into account the antecedent probability
of the conclusion ; A may be C for other reasons besides
its being B, and as he remarks, * It is difficult, if not
impossible, to produce a chain of argument of which the
reasoner can rest the result on those arguments only.'
We must also bear in mind that the failure of one argu-
ment does not, except under special circumstances, disprove
the truth of the conclusion it is intended to uphold, other-
wise there are few truths which could survive the ill
considered arguments adduced in their favour. But as
a rope does not necessarily break because one strand in i
is weak, so a conclusion may depend upon an endless
number of considerations besides those immediately in
view. Even when we have no other information we must
not consider a statement as devoid of all probability. The
\ true expression of complete doubt is a ratio of equality
between the chances in favour of and against it, and this
'! ratio is expressed in the probability ^.
Now if A and C are wholly unknown things, we have
no reason to believe that A is C rather than A is not C.
The antecedent probability is then ^. If we also have the
