INDUCTION. 167
logism ; that the price of corn in England has never been
so high since 1847 as ^ was m that year; that the price
of the English funds has never been lower than it was on
the 23rd of January, 1798, when it fell to 47^.
It has been urged against this process of Perfect In-
duction that it gives no new information, and is merely a
summing up in a brief form of a multitude of particulars.
But mere abbreviation of mental labour is one of the
most important aids we can enjoy in the acquisition of
knowledge. The powers of the human mind are so limited
that multiplicity of detail is alone sufficient to prevent its
progress in many directions. Thought would be prac-
tically impossible if every separate fact had to be separately
thought and treated. Economy of mental power may be
considered one of the main conditions on which our ele-
vated intellectual position depends. Most mathematical
processes are but abbreviations of the simpler acts of
addition and subtraction. The invention of logarithms
was one of the most striking additions ever made to
human power : yet it was a mere abbreviation of oper-
ations which could have been done before had a sufficient
amount of labour been available. Similar additions to
our power will, it is hoped, be made from time to time,
for the number of mathematical problems hitherto solved
is but an indefinitely small portion of those which await
solution, because the labour they have hitherto demanded
renders them impracticable. So it is really throughout
all regions of thought. The amount of our knowledge
depends upon our powers of bringing it within prac-
ticable compass. Unless we arrange and classify facts,
and condense them into general truths, they soon sur-
pass our powers of memory, and serve but to confuse.
Hence Perfect Induction, even as a process of abbrevi-
ation, is absolutely essential to any high degree of
mental achievement.
