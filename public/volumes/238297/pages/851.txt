CLASSIFICATION. 361
crystallization and the chemical composition. But what
we have to notice is that the physical properties of the
crystallized substances with regard to light, heat, elec-
tricity, &c., are closely similar. Light and heat undula-
tions, wherever they enter a crystal of the regular system,
spread with equal rapidity in all directions, just as they
would in a uniform liquid, gas, or amorphous solid, such
as unstrained glass. Crystals of the regular system accord-
ingly do not in any case exhibit the phenomena of double
refraction, unless by mechanical compression we alter the
conditions of elasticity. These crystals, again, expand
equally in all directions when heated, and if we could cut
a sufficiently large plate from a cubical crystal, and ex-
amine the sound vibrations of which it is capable, we
should find that they indicated an equal elasticity in
every direction. Thus we see that a great number of
important properties are correlated with that of crys-
tallizing in the regular system, and as soon as we know
that the primary form of crystallization of a substance is
the cube, we are able to infer with approximate cer-
tainty that it possesses all these properties. The class
of cubical crystals is then an evidently natural class,
one disclosing general laws connecting together the
physical and mechanical properties of the substances so
classified.
In the second class of crystals, called the dimetric,
square prismatic, or pyramidal system, there are also
three axes at right angles to each other, two of which are
equal, and the third or principal axis is unequal, being
either greater or less than either of the other two. In
such crystals accordingly the elasticity and other physical
properties are alike in all directions perpendicular to the
principal axis, but vary in all other directions. If a point
within a crystal of this system be heated, the heat spreads
with equal rapidity in planes perpendicular to the prin-
