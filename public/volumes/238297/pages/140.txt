114 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
inconsistent with the definition, we have the following-
result :
ABC -^ee-
-^Ee- aBc
-AA6- abC
Abe abc.
For the description of the class we have
C = ABC -I- a&C,
that is, ' a rectilinear figure is either a triangle and three-
sided, or not a triangle and not three-sided.'
For the class b we have
b = abC ! abc.
To the second side of this we may apply the process of
simplification by abstraction described in the last section ;
for by the Law of Duality
ab = abC [ abc ;
and as we have two propositions identical in the second
side of each we may substitute, getting
b = ab,
or what is not three-sided is not a triangle (whether it be
rectilinear or not).
Let us treat by this method the following argument :
* Blende is not an elementary substance ; elementary
substances are those which are undecomposable ;
blende, therefore, is decomposable.'
Taking our letters thus
A = blende,
B = elementary substance,
C = undecomposable,
the premises are of the form
A = Aft, (i)
B = 0. (2)
No immediate substitution can be made ; but if we take
the contrapositive of (2), namely
b = c, (3)
