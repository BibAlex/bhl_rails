other placed an equal weight of gold. The pendulums
were then equal in weight and in size ; and, on setting
them simultaneously in motion, Newton found that they
vibrated for a great length of time with exactly equal
vibrations. He tried the same experiment with silver,
lead, glass, sand, common salt, water, and wheat, instead
of gold, and ascertained that the rapidity of motion of his
pendulum was exactly the same whatever was the kind
of matter inside them h . He considered that a difference
of a thousandth part would have been apparent. The
reader must observe that the pendulums were made of
equal weight only in order that they might suffer equal
retardation from the air. The meaning of the experiment
is that all the substances manifest exactly equal accelera-
tion from the force of gravity, and that therefore the
inertia or resistance of matter to force, which is the only
independent measure of mass in our possession, is always
proportional to gravity.
These experiments of Newton were considered conclu-
sive up to very recent times, when certain discordances
between the theory and observations of the movements
of planets led Nicolai, in 1826, to suggest that the equal
gravitation of different kinds of matter might not be
absolutely exact. It is perfectly philosophical and desir-
able thus to call in question, from time to time, some of
the best accepted laws. On this occasion Bessel carefully
repeated the experiments of Newton with pendulums
composed of ivory, glass, marble, quartz, meteoric stones,
&c., but was unable to detect the least difference. This
conclusion is also confirmed by the ultimate agreement of
all the calculations of physical astronomy based upon it.
Thus, whether the mass of Jupiter be calculated from the
motion of its own satellites, from the effect upon the small
