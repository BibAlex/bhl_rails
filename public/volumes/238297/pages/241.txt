i combination.
The numbers, it will be noticed, are exactly the same
as those in the fifth line of the arithmetical triangle, and
an exactly similar correspondence would be found to
exist in the case of each other column of the Abece-
darium.
Numerical abstraction, it has bean asserted, consists in
overlooking the kind of difference, and retaining only a
consciousness of its existence (p. 177). While in logic,
then, we have to deal with each combination as a separate
kind of thing, in arithmetic we can distinguish only the
classes which depend upon more or less positive terms
being present, and the numbers of these classes imme-
diately produce the numbers of the arithmetical triangle.
It may here be pointed out that there are two modes
