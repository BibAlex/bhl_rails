never occur together, and that they are never both absent ;
these propositions are indeed logically equivalent to one,
namely AB = Ac. Our classification is then identical with
the following bifurcate one :
A
AB A6
i I
ABC ABc A6C Abe
= o =o
If, again, we divide the genus A into three species AB,
AC, AD, we are either logically in error, or else we must
be understood to imply the existence of three propositions
excluding the union within the genus A of the properties
of B, Cf and D, namely AB = ABcd, AC = A.bCd, and
AD = AbcD. It comes to the same thing if we say that
our classification is really a bifurcate one, as follows :
A
i
AB Afe
ABC ABc
ABCD AJBCd ABcD ABcd
A6CD AbCd AbcD Abed
= o =0=0 =o = o
The logical necessity of bifurcate classification has been
clearly and correctly stated in the * Outline of a New System
of Logic' by George Bentham, a work of which the logical
value has been quite overlooked until lately. Mr. Bentham
points out, in p. 1 1 3, that every classification must be
essentially bifurcate and takes, as an example, the division
of vertebrate animals into four subclasses, as follows :
Mammifera endowed with mammae and lungs.
Birds without mammae but with lungs and wings.
Fish deprived of lungs.
Reptiles deprived of mammae and wings but with
lungs.
