386 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
the series of English writings which have, in the present
century, made logic a new and progressive science. In
Table IV. Bentham gives the Arbor Porphyriana, as
exhibited in the course of a college lecture in 1761, call-
ing it the original form. His reading of logic seems to
have been restricted to the compendiums of Saunderson
and Watts, and it was only after the text was written that
he obtained an opportunity of consulting the work of
Porphyry, and was surprised to find no diagram therein.
He attributes its invention to Peter Ramus, although he
had never seen the writings of that logician, and had
merely learnt their titles from a dictionary.
In this essay he states in the most powerful way the
advantages of the bifurcate method of classification, which
had been suggested to him by a chapter in Saunderson's
logic and the diagram given in the college course.
Although the Tree of Porphyry and the principles of
bifurcation had been mentioned by almost all logicians,
the utility and excellence of the method, he says (p. 287),
had not made itself apparent. Indeed the method was
mentioned but to be slighted, or to be made a subject of
pleasantry by Reid and Kames. Bentham sufficiently
states his own opinion when he speaks (p. -295) of 'the
matchless beauty of the Eameaii Tree.' After fully show-
ing its logical value as an exhaustive method of classifi-
cation, and refuting the objections of Reid and Kames,
on a wrong ground, as I think, he proceeds to inquire to
what length it may be carried. He correctly points out
two objections to the extensive use of bifid arrangements,
(i) because v they soon become impracticably extensive and
unwieldy, and (2) because they are uneconomical. In his
day the recorded number of different species of plants
was 40,000, and he leaves the reader to estimate the im-
mense number of branches and the enormous area of a
bifurcate table which should exhibit all these species in
