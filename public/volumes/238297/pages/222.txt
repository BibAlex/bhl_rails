196 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
the number of qualities, 2 n is the number of varieties of
things which may be formed from them, if there be no con-
ditions but those of logic. This number, it need hardly
be said, increases after the first few terms, in an extra-
ordinary manner, so that it would require 302 figures,
even to express the number of combinations in which 1000
qualities might conceivably present themselves.
If all the combinations allowed by the Laws of Thought
occurred in nature, then science would begin and end with
those laws. To observe nature would give us no ad-
ditional knowledge, because no two qualities would in the
long run be oftener associated than any other two. We
could never predict events with more certainty than we
now predict the throws of dice, and experience would be
without use. But the universe, as actually created, pre-
sents a far different and much more interesting problem.
The most superficial observation shows that some things
are habitually associated with other things. The more
mature our examination, the more we become convinced
that each event depends upon the prior occurrence of
some other series of events. Action and reaction are
gradually discovered to underlie the whole scene, and an
independent or casual occurrence does not exist except in
appearance. Even dice as they fall are surely determined
in their course by prior conditions and fixed laws. Thus
the combinations of events which can really occur are
found to be very restricted, and it is the work of science
to detect these restricting conditions.
In the English alphabet, for instance, we have twenty-
six letters. Were the combinations of such letters per-
fectly free, so that any letter could be indifferently
sounded with any other, the number of words which
could be formed without any repetition would be 2 26 i,
or 67,108,863, equal in number to the combinations of
the twenty-seventh column of the Abecedarium, excluding
