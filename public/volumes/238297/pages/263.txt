THE THEORY OF PROBABILITY. 237
is almost impossible, for instance, that any whist player
should have played in any two games where the distri-
bution of the cards was exactly the same, by pure accident
(p. 217). Such a thing as a person always losing at
a game of pure chance, is wholly unknown. Coincidences
of this kind are not impossible, as I have said, but they
are so unlikely that the lifetime of any person, or indeed
the whole duration of history does not give any appreciable
probability of their being encountered. Whenever we
make any extensive series of trials of chance results, as in
throwing a die or coin, the probability is great that the
results will agree nearly with the predictions yielded by
theory. Precise agreement must not be expected, for that,
as the theory could show, is highly improbable. Several
attempts have been made to test, in this way, the accord-
ance of theory and experience. The celebrated naturalist,
Buffon, caused the first trial to be made by a young
child who threw a coin many times in succession, and he
obtained 1992 tails to 2048 heads. A pupil of Professor
De Morgan repeated the trial for his own satisfaction, and
obtained 2044 tails to 2048 heads. In both cases the
coincidence with theory is as close as could be expected,
and the details may be found in De Morgan's ' Formal
Logic/ p. 185.
Quetelet also tested the theory in a rather more com-
plete manner, by placing 20 black and 20 white balls in an
urn and drawing a ball out time after time in an
indifferent manner, each ball being replaced, before a
new drawing was made. He found, as might be expected,
that the greater the number of drawings made the more
nearly were the white and black balls equal in number.
At the termination of the experiment he had registered
2066 white and 2030 black balls, the ratio being ro2\
