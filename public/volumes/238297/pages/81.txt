PROPOSITIONS. 55
deduction, with simple, partial, or limited identities be-
tween negative terms, in the forms
a = b, a = ab, aC = bC.
It would be equally possible to represent affirmative
propositions in the negative form. Thus ' Iron is solid/
might be expressed as * Iron is not not-solid/ or ' Iron is not
fluid'; or, taking A and b for the terms 'iron,' and * not -solid/
the form would be
A-J;
But there are very strong reasons why we should em-
ploy all propositions in their affirmative form. All infer-
ence proceeds by the substitution of equivalents, and a
proposition expressed in the form of an identity is ready
to yield all its consequences in the most direct manner.
As will be more fully shown, we can infer in a negative
proposition, but not by it. Difference is incapable of
becoming the ground of inference ; it is only the implied
agreement with other differing objects, which admits of
deduction ; and it will always be found advantageous to
employ propositions in the form which exhibits clearly all
the implied agreements.
Conversion of Propositions.
The old books of logic contain many rules concerning
the conversion of propositions, that is, the transposition
of the subject and predicate in such a way as to obtain
a new proposition which will be equally true with the
original. The reduction of every proposition to the
form of an identity renders all such rules and processes
needless. Identity is essentially reciprocal. If the colour
of the Atlantic Ocean is the same as that of the Pacific
Ocean, that of the Pacific must be the same as that of
the Atlantic. Sodium chloride being identical with
common salt, common salt must be identical with sodium
