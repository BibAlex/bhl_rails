412 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
do not possess all these properties, naturalists select a
typical form or specimen, and they group around it all
other forms or specimens which resemble this type more
than any other selected type. * The type of each genus/
we are told 1 , 'should be that species in which the charac-
ters of its group are best exhibited and most evenly
balanced/ It would usually consist of those descendants
of a form which had undergone little alteration, while
other descendants had suffered slight differentiation in
various directions.
It would be a great mistake to suppose that this classi-
fication by types is a logically distinct method. It is
either not a real method of classification at all, or it is
a merely abbreviated mode of representing a very com-
plicated system of arrangement. A class must be defined
by the invariable presence of certain common properties.
If, then, we venture to include an individual in which
one of these properties does not appear, we either fall
into logical contradiction, or else we form a new class
with a new definition. Even a single exception consti-
tutes a new class by itself, and by calling it an excep-
tion we merely imply that this new class closely resembles
that from which it diverges in one or two points only.
Thus if in the definition of the natural order of Eosacese,
we find that the seeds are one or two in each carpel,
but that in the genus Spiraea there are three or four, this
must mean either that the number of seeds is not a part
of the fixed definition of the class, or else that Spiraea does
not belong to that class, though it may be closely ap-
proximated to it. Naturalists continually find themselves
between two horns of a dilemma ; if they restrict the
number of marks specified in a definition so that every
form intended to come within the class shall possess all
