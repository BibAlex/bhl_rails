solidifies and rises in temperature to 32 Fahr. A like
effect is still more beautifully displayed in the well known
lecture-room experiment, of the suspended crystallization
of a solution of sodium sulphate, in which a sudden rise
of temperature of 30 or even 40 Fahr. is often manifested.
The science of electricity is full of the most varied and
interesting cases of inversion. As Professor Tyndall has
remarked, Faraday had a profound belief in the reciprocal
relations of the physical forces. The great starting-point
of his researches, the discovery of electro-magnetism, was
clearly an inversion.
Oersted and Ampere had proved that with an electric
current and a magnet in a particular position as ante-
cedents, motion is the consequent. If then a magnet, a
wire and motion be the antecedents, an opposite electric
current will be the consequent. It would be an endless
task to trace out the results of this fertile relationship
when once fully understood. No small part of Faraday's
researches was occupied in ascertaining the direct and
inverse relations of magnetic and diamagnetic, amorphous
and crystalline substances in various circumstances. In
all other relations of electricity the principle of inversion
holds. The voltameter or the electro-plating cell is the
inverse of the galvanic battery. As heat applied to a
junction of antimony and bismuth bars produces electricity,
it necessarily follows that an electric current passed
through such a junction will produce cold. Thus it is
apparent that inversion of cause and effect is a most
fertile ground of prediction and discovery.
The reader should carefully notice, however, that the
inversion of natural phenomena is exactly true only of
the character of the effect, not the amount. There is
always a waste of energy in every work, because a certain
part of it is dissipated in the form of conducted or radiated
heat, and escapes beyond our use. Theoretically speaking,
