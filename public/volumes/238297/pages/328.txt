302 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
The grand object of seeking to estimate the probability
of future events from past experience, seems to have been
entertained by James Bernouilli and De Moivre, at least
such was the opinion of Condorcet; and Bernouilli may be
said to have solved one case of the problem '. The English
writers Bayes and Price are, however, undoubtedly the
first who put forward any distinct rules on the subject 11 .
Condorcet and several other eminent mathematicians ad-
vanced the mathematical theory of the subject; but it was
reserved to the immortal Laplace to bring to the subject
the full power of his genius, and carry the solution of the
problem almost to perfection. It is instructive to observe
that a theory which arose from the consideration of the
most petty games of chance, the rules and the very names
of which are in many cases forgotten, gradually advanced,
until it embraced the most sublime problems of science,
and finally undertook to measure the value and certainty
of all our inductions.
Fortuitoiis Coincides ces.
We should have studied the theory of probability to
very little purpose, if we thought that it would furnish
us with an infallible guide. The theory itself points out
the possibility, or rather the approximate certainty, that
we shall sometimes be deceived by extraordinary, but
fortuitous coincidences. There is no run of luck so ex-
treme that it may not happen, and it may happen to us,
or in our time, as well as to other persons or in other
times. We may be forced by all correct calculation to
refer such coincidences to some necessary cause, and yet
we may be deceived. All that the calculus of probability
