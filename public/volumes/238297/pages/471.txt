THE LAW OF ERROR.
445
minute sources of error, which will as often produce
excess as deficiency. Granting this assumption, the Law
of Error must be as it is usually taken to be, and there is
no more need to verify empirically than to test the truth
of one of Euclid's propositions mechanically, after we have
proved it theoretically. Nevertheless, it is an interesting
occupation to verify even the propositions of geometry in
an approximate manner, and it is still more instructive to
inquire whether a large number of observations will be
found to justify our assumption of the Law of Error.
Encke has given an excellent instance of the cor-
respondence of theory with experience, in the case of
certain observations of the difference of Right Ascension
of the sun and two stars, namely a Aquilse and a Canis
minoris. The observations were 470 in number, and were
made by Bradley and reduced by Bessel, who found the
probable error of the final result to be only about one-
fourth part of a second (d f '26^j). He then compared
the number of errors of each magnitude from th part of
a second upwards, as actually given by the observations,
with what should occur according to the Law of Error.
The results were as follow &:
Magnitude of the errors in parts
Number of errors of each magnitude
