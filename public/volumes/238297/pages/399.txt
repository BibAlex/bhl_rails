UNITS AND STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT. 373
weighing against water, they will not agree very closely
with each other ; and, as a matter of fact, the two principal
standard kilograms neither agree with each other, nor
with their true definition u . The so-called Kilogram des
Archives weighs 15432*34874 grains according to Prof.
W H. Miller, while the kilogram deposited at the
Ministry of the Interior in Paris, as the standard for
commercial purposes, weighs 15432*344 grains x .
Now since a standard weight constructed of platinum,
or platinum and iridium, can be preserved in all proba-
bility free from any appreciable alteration, and since it
can be very accurately compared with other weights, we
shall ultimately attain the greatest exactness in our
recorded measurements of weight and mass, by assuming
some single standard kilogram as a provisional standard,
leaving the determination of its actual mass in units of
space and density for future investigation. This is what
is practically done at the present day, and thus a unit of
mass takes the place of the unit of density, both in the
French and the present English systems. The English
pound is defined by a certain lump of platinum, carefully
preserved at Westminster, and is an entirely arbitrary-
mass, made to agree as nearly as possible with old English
pounds. The gallon, the old English unit of cubic mea-
surement, is defined by the condition that it shall con-
tain exactly ten pounds weight of water at 62 Fahr.; and
although it is stated that it has the capacity of about
277-274 cubic inches, this ratio between the cubic and
linear system of measurement is not legally enacted, but
is left open to investigation from time to time. While
the French metric system as originally designed was
theoretically perfect, it does not seem to differ practically
in this point from the English system.
