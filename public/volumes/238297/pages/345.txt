THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF PHENOMENA. 319
on the process ad infinitum. Any finite space, then, must
be conceived as made up of an infinite number of parts,
each of which must consequently be infinitely small. We
cannot entertain some of the simplest geometrical notions
without allowing this. The conception of a square in-
volves the conception of a side and diagonal, which, as
Euclid admirably proves in the nyth proposition of his
tenth book, have no common measure f , meaning, as I
apprehend, no finite common measure. Incommensurable
quantities are, in fact, those which have for their only
common measure an infinitely small quantity. It is
somewhat startling to find, too, that in theory incommen-
surable quantities will be infinitely more frequent than
commensurable. Let any two lines be drawn haphazard ;
it is infinitely unlikely that they will be commensurable,
so that the commensurable quantities, which we are sup-
posed to deal with in practice, are but singular cases
among an infinitely greater number of incommensurable
cases.
Practically, however, we treat all quantities as made up
of the least quantities which our senses, assisted by the
best measuring instruments, can appreciate. So long as
microscopes were uninvented, it was sufficient to regard
an inch as made up of a thousand thousandths of an
inch ; now we must treat it as composed of a million
millionths. We might apparently avoid all mention of
infinitely small quantities, by never carrying our approxi-
mations beyond quantities, which the senses can appreciate.
In geometry, as thus treated, we should never assert two
quantities to be equal, but only to be apparently equal.
Legendre really adopts this mode of treatment in the
twentieth proposition of the first book of his Geometry ;
and it is practically adopted throughout the physical
sciences, as we shall afterwards see. But though our
