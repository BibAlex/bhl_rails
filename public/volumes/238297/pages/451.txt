THE METHOD OF MEANS. 425
the simplest possible case in the determination of the
latitude of a place by observations of the Pole-star.
Tycho Brahe suggested that if the elevation of any cir-
cumpolar star were observed at its higher and lower
passages across the meridian, half the sum of the elevations
would be the latitude of the place, which is equal to the
height of the pole. Such a star is as much above the
pole at its highest point, as it is below at its lowest, so
that the mean must necessarily give the height of the
pole itself free from doubt, except as regards incidental
errors of observation. The Pole-star is usually selected
for the purpose of such observations because it describes
the smallest circle, and is thus on the whole least affected
by atmospheric refraction.
Whenever several causes are in action, each of which
at one time increases and at another time decreases the
joint effect by equal quantities, we may apply this method
and disentangle the effects. Thus the solar and lunar
tides roll on in almost complete independence of each
other. When the moon is new or full the solar tide coin-
cides, or nearly so, with that caused by the moon, and the
joint effect is the sum of the separate effects. When the
moon is in quadrature, or half full, the two tides are
acting in opposition, one raising and the other depressing
the water, so that we observe only the difference of the
effects. We have in fact
Spring tide = lunar tide + solar tide
Neap tide = lunar tide solar tide.
We have only then to add together the heights of the
maximum spring tide and the minimum neap tide, and
half the sum is the true height of the lunar tide. Half
the difference of the spring and neap tides on the other
hand gives the solar tide.
Effects of very small amount may with great approach
to certainty be detected among much greater fluctuations,
