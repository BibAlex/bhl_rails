ACCORDANCE OF QUANTITATIVE THEORIES, <&c. 201
the probability of an hypothesis merely by its accordance
with a few results only. Its general analogy and accord-
ance with other known laws of nature, and the fact that
it does not conflict with any other probable theories, must
be taken into account, as we shall see in the next book.
The requisite condition of a good hypothesis, that it must
admit of the deduction of facts verified in observation,
must be interpreted in the widest possible manner, as
including all ways in which there may be accordance or
discordance.
All our attempts at reconciliation having failed, the
only conclusion we can come to is that some unknown
cause of a new character exists. If the measurements be
accurate and the theory probable, then there remains a
residual phenomenon, which, being devoid of theoretical
explanation, must be set down as a new empirical fact
worthy of deliberate investigation. As a matter of fact
these outstanding residual discrepancies have often been
found to involve new discoveries of the greatest im-
portance.
Accordance of Measurements of Astronomical Distances.
One of the most instructive instances which we could
meet, as regards the manner in which different measure-
ments confirm or check each other, is furnished by the
determination of the velocity of light, and the dimensions
of the planetary system. Eoemer first discovered that
light requires time in travelling, by observing that the
eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, although they of course
occur at fixed moments of absolute time, are visible at
different moments in different parts of the earth's orbit,
according to the distance of the earth and Jupiter. The
time occupied by light in. traversing the mean semi-
diameter of the earth's orbit is found to be about eight
minutes. The mean distance o^ the sun and earth was
