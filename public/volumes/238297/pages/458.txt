moreover this advantage in the method that several points
may be determined with the corresponding ones on the
other side, and the mean of the whole taken as the true
place of the maximum. But this method entirely depends
upon the existence of symmetry in the curve, so that of
two equal ordinates one shall be as far on one side of the
maximum as the other is on the other side. The method
fails when other laws of variation prevail.
In tidal observations great difficulty is encountered in
fixing the moment of high water, because the rate at
which the water is then rising or falling is almost imper-
ceptible. Dr. Whewell proposed, therefore, to note the
time at which the water passes a fixed point somewhat
below the maximum both in rising and falling, and take
the mean time as that of high water. But this mode of
proceeding unfortunately does not give a correct result,
because the tide follows different laws in rising and in
falling. There is a difficulty again in selecting the highest
spring tide, another object of much importance in tidology.
Laplace discovered that the tide of the second day pre-
ceding the conjunction of the sun and moon is nearly
equal to that of the fifth day following ; and, believing
that the increase and decrease of the tides proceeded in a
nearly symmetrical manner, he decided that the highest
tide would occur about thirty-six hours after the con-
junction, that is half-way between the second day before
and the fifth day after <i.
This method is also employed in determining the time
of passage of the middle or densest point of a stream of
meteors. The earth takes twT> or three days in passing
completely through the November stream ; but astro-
nomers need for their calculations to have some definite
point fixed within a few minutes if possible. When near
to the middle they observe the numbers of meteors which
