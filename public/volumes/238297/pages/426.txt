400 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
weighing exist in both cases, supposing that the balance
has riot been disarranged, and that B must be exactly
equal to C, since it has exactly the same effect under
the same circumstances. In like manner it is a general
rule that, if by any uniform mechanical process we get
a copy of an object, it is unlikely that this copy will
be precisely the same in magnitude and form as the
original, but two copies will equally diverge from the
original, and will therefore almost exactly resemble each
other.
Leslie's Differential Thermometer 1 was well adapted
to the experiments for which it was invented. Having
two equal bulbs any alteration in the temperature of the
air will act equally by conduction on each and produce
no change in the indications of the instrument. Only
that radiant heat which is purposely thrown upon one
of the bulbs will produce any effect. This thermometer
in short carries out the principle of the differential method
in a mechanical manner.
3. Method of Correction.
Whenever the result of an experiment is affected by an
interfering cause to an amount either invariable or exactly
calculable, it is sufficient simply to add or subtract this
calculated amount. We are said to correct observations
when we thus eliminate what is due to extraneous causes,
although of course we are only separating the correct
effects of several agents. Thus the variation in the height
of the barometrical column is partly due to the change
of temperature, and since the coefficient of absolute
dilatation of mercury has been exactly determined, as
already described (p. 395), we have only to make cal-
