As Babbage further showed f , a calculating engine,
after proceeding through any required number of motions
according to a first law, may be made suddenly to suffer
a change, so that it shall then commence to calculate
according to a wholly new law. After giving the natural
numbers for any finite time, it might suddenly begin to
give triangular, or square, or cube numbers, and these
changes might theoretically be conceived as occurring
time after time. Now if such occurrences can be designed
and foreseen by a human artist, (it is surely within the
capacity of the Divine Artist to provide for similar
changes of law in the mechanism of the atom, or the
construction of the heavens. )
Physical science, so far as its highest speculations can
be trusted, gives some indication of a change of law in
the past history of the Universe. According to Sir W.
Thomson's deductions from Fourier's Theory of Heat,
we can trace down the dissipation of heat by conduction
and radiation to an infinitely distant time when all things
will be uniformly cold. But we cannot similarly trace
the heat-history of the Universe to an infinite distance in
the past. For a certain negative value of the time the
formulae give impossible values, indicating that there was
some initial distribution of heat which could not have re-
sulted, according to known laws of nature, from any pre-
vious distribution . There are other cases in which a
consideration of the dissipation of energy leads to the
conception of a limit to the antiquity of the present order
of things 11 . Human science, of course, is fallible, and
