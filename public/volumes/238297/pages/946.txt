invented. Common trigonometry, for instance, consists
of a great series of useful formulas, all of which arise
out of the simple fundamental relation of the sine and
cosine expressed in the one equation
sin 2 x + cos 2 x = i .
But this is not the only trigonometry which may exist ;
mathematicians also recognise the so-called hyperbolic
trigonometry of which the fundamental equation is
cos 2 x sin 2 x = i .
De Morgan has pointed out that the symbols of ordinary
algebra form but three of an interminable series of con-
ceivable systems 8 . As the logarithmic operation is to addi-
tion or addition to multiplication, so is the latter to a
higher operation, and so on without limit.
We may rely upon it that indefinite, and to us incon-
ceivable, advances will be made by the human intellect, in
the absence of any unforeseen catastrophe to the species
or the globe. Almost within historical periods we can
trace the rise of mathematical science from its simplest
germs. We can prove our descent from ancestors who
counted only on their fingers, but how almost infinitely
is a Newton or a Laplace above those simple savages.
Pythagoras is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb when
he discovered the Forty-seventh Proposition of Euclid, and
the occasion was worthy of the sacrifice. Archimedes was
beside himself when he first perceived his beautiful mode
of determining specific gravities. Yet these great dis-
coveries are the simplest elements of our schoolboy-know-
ledge. Step by step we can trace upwards the acquirement
of new mental powers. What could be more wonderful
and unexpected than Napier's discovery of logarithms, a
wholly new mode of calculation which has multiplied
perhaps a hundred-fold the working powers of every
computer, and indeed has rendered easy calculations which
