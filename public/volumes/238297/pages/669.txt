EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE, EXPLANATION, &c. 179
afterwards verified almost exactly by Sir W. Thomson 2 .
' In this very remarkable speculation, an entirely novel
physical phenomenon was predicted, in anticipation of
any direct experiments on the subject; and "the actual
observation of the phenomenon was pointed out as a
highly interesting object for experimental research/ Just
as liquids which expand in solidifying will have the tem-
perature of solidification lowered by pressure, so liquids
which contract in solidifying will exhibit the reverse effect.
They will be assisted in solidifying, as it were, by pressure,
so as to become solid at a higher temperature, as the
pressure is greater. This latter result was verified by
Bunsen and Hopkins, in the case of paraffin, spermaceti,
wax, and stearin. The effect upon water has more recently
been carried to such an extent by Mousson, that under
the vast pressure of 1300 atmospheres, water did not
freeze until cooled down to -18 Cent. Another remark-
able prediction of Professor Thomson was to the effect
that, if a metallic spring be weakened by a rise of tem-
perature, work done against the spring, by bending it,
must cause a cooling effect. Although the amount of
effect to be expected in a certain apparatus was only
about four- thousandths of a degree Centigrade, Dr. Joule a
succeeded in detecting and measuring the effect to the
extent of three-thousandths of a degree, such is the deli-
cacy of modern methods of measurement. I cannot
refrain from quoting Dr. Joule's reflections upon this
fact b . ' Thus even in the above delicate case/ he says,
< is the formula of Professor Thompson completely verified.
