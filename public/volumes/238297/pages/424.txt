398 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
of error are too fluctuating to allow of correction, so that
the only accurate mode of procedure is that devised by
Dr. Joule, of surrounding the thermometer with a copper
cylinder ingeniously adjusted to the temperature of the
air, as described by him, so that the effect of radiation
shall be nullified .
When the avoidance of error cannot be carried into
effect, it will yet be desirable to reduce the absolute
amount of the interfering error as much as possible before
employing the succeeding methods to correct the result.
As a general rule we can determine a quantity with less
inaccuracy as it is smaller, so that if the error itself be
small the error in determining that error will be of a still
lower order of magnitude. But in some cases the absolute
amount of an error is of no consequence, as in the index
error of a divided circle, or the difference between a
chronometer and astronomical time. Even the rate at
which a clock gains or loses is a matter of little im-
portance provided it remains constant, so that a sure
calculation of its amount can be made.
2. Differential Method.
When we cannot avoid the entrance of error, we can
often resort with great success to the second mode of
measuring phenomena under such circumstances that the
error shall remain nearly or quite the same in all the
observations, and neutralize itself as regards the purposes
in view. This mode is available whenever we want a
difference between quantities and not the absolute
quantity of either. The determination of the parallax
of the fixed stars is exceedingly difficult, because the
amount of parallax is far less than most of the corrections
