result. It is apparent that as the number of balls in the
box is increased, the absolute probability of any one hypo-
thesis concerning the exact proportion of balls is decreased,
but the aggregate results of all the hypotheses will assume
the character of a wide average.
When we take the step of supposing the balls within
the urn to .be infinite in number, the possible proportions
of white and black balls also become infinite, and the
probability of any one proportion actually existing is
infinitely small. Hence the final result that the next ball
drawn will be white is really the sum of an infinite
number of infinitely small quantities. It might seem,
indeed, utterly impossible to calculate out a problem
having an infinite number of hypotheses, but the wonderful
resources of the integral calculus enable this to be done
with far greater facility than if we supposed any large
finite number of balls, and then actually computed the
results. I will not attempt to describe the processes by
which Laplace finally accomplished the complete solution
of the problem. They are to be found described in several
English works, especially De Morgan's ' Treatise on Proba-
bilities/ in the * Encyclopaedia Metropolitana/ and Mr. Tod-
hunter's ' History of the Theory of Probability/ The ab-
breviating power of mathematical analysis was never more
strikingly shown. But I may add that though the integral
calculus is employed as a means of summing infinitely
numerous results, we in no way abandon the principles of
combinations already treated. We calculate the values of
infinitely numerous factorials, not, however, obtaining their
actual products, which would lead to an infinite number of
figures, but obtaining the final answer to the problem by
devices which can only be comprehended after study of the
integral calculus.
It must be allowed that the hypothesis adopted by
Laplace is in some degree arbitrary, so that there was some
