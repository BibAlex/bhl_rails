THE INDUCTIVE OR INVERSE METHOD. 277
by some person acquainted with the usual order of
sequence. This conclusion is quite irresistible, and rightly
so ; for there are but two suppositions which we can make
as to the reason of the cards being in that particular
order :
1. They have been intentionally arranged by some one
who would probably prefer the numerical order.
2. They have fallen into that order by chance, that is,
by some series of conditions which, being wholly unknown
in nature, cannot be known to lead by preference to the
particular order in question.
The latter supposition is by no means absurd, for any
one order is as likely as any other when there is no prepon-
derating tendency. But we can readily calculate by the
doctrines of permutation the probability that fifty-two
objects would fall by chance into any one particular order.
Fifty-two objects can be arranged in
52x5ix50x.... X4x3x2xior 8066 x (io) 64
possible orders, the number obtained requiring 68 places
of figures for its full expression. Hence it is excessively
unlikely, and, in fact, practically impossible, that any one
should ever meet with a pack of cards arranged in perfect
order by pure accident. If we do meet with a pack so
arranged, we inevitably adopt the other supposition, that
some person having reasons for preferring that special
order, has thus put them together.
We know that of the almost infinite number of possible
orders the numerical order is the most remarkable ; it is
useful as proving the perfect constitution of the pack, and
it is the intentional result of certain games. At any rate,
the probability that intention should produce that order is
incomparably greater than the probability that chance
should produce it ; and as a certain pack exists in that
order, we rightly prefer the supposition which most
probably leads to the observed result.
