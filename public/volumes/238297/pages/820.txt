and 12 of carbon. But when careful analyses were made
of a great many minerals, this law often appeared to fail.
What was unquestionably the same mineral, judging by
its crystalline form and physical properties, would often
give varying proportions of its components, and would
sometimes contain unusual elements which yet could not
be set down as mere impurities. Dolomite, for instance, is a
compound of the carbonates of magnesia and lime, but speci-
mens from different places do not exhibit any fixed ratio
between the lime and magnesia, and carbonate of iron
occasionally forms a real constituent of the mineral. Such
facts could be reconciled with the laws of Dalton only
by supposing the interference of a new law, that of
Isomorphism.
It is now sufficiently established that certain elements
are closely related to each other, so that they can, as it
were, step into each other's places without apparently
altering the form of the compound molecules, or the
shape of the crystals which they constitute. The car-
bonates of iron, calcium, and magnesium, are nearly
identical in their crystalline forms, hence they may
crystallize together in harmony, producing mixed minerals
of considerable complexity, which nevertheless perfectly
verify the laws of equivalent proportions. This principle
of isomorphism once established, not only explains what
was formerly a stumbling-block, but gives most valuable
aid to chemists in deciding upon the real constitution of
new salts, since those compounds of isomorphous elements
which have identical crystalline forms must possess cor-
responding chemical formulae.
We may always expect that from time to time new and
extraordinary phenomena will be discovered, and will lead
to new views of the laws of nature. The recent observa-
tion, for instance, that the resistance of a bar of selenium
to a current of electricity is affected in an extraordinary
