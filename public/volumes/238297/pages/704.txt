214 THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE.
atmosphere at the earth's surface would be 968 feet per
second, and very rude experiments made by him in the
cloisters of Trinity College seemed to show that this wa&.
not far from the truth. Subsequently it was ascertained by
other experimentalists that the velocity of sound was
more nearly 1142 feet, and the discrepancy being no
less than one sixth part of the whole was far too much
to attribute to casual errors in the numerical data.
Newton attempted to explain away this discrepancy by
hypotheses as to the relations of the molecules of air,
but without success.
Many new investigations having been made from time
to time concerning the velocity of sound, both as observed
experimentally and as calculated from theory, it was found
that each of Newton's results was inaccurate, the theo-
retical velocity being 916 feet per second, and the real
velocity about 1090 feet. The discrepancy therefore re-
mained as serious as ever, and it was not until the year
1816 that Laplace showed it to be due to the heat
developed by the sudden compression of the air in the
passage of the wave, this heat having the effect of in-
creasing the elasticity of the air and accelerating the
motion of the impulse. It is now perceived that this
discrepancy really involved the whole doctrine of the
equivalence of heat and energy, and the discrepancy was
applied by Mayer, at least by implication, to give an
estimate of the mechanical equivalent of heat. The esti-
mate thus derived agrees satisfactorily with independent
and more direct determinations by Dr. Joule and other
physicists, so that the explanation of the residual dis-
crepancy which so exercised Newton's ingenuity is now
complete.
As Sir John Herschel observed, almost all the great
astronomical discoveries have been first disclosed in the
form of residual differences. It is the practice at well-
