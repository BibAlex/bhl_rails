appreciable, and the force of gravity will seem to follow
the law of linear variation, being proportional to i 2 h.
When the circumstances of an experiment are much
altered, different powers of the variable may become pro-
minent. The resistance of a liquid to a body moving
through it may be approximately expressed as the sum
of two terms respectively involving the first and second
powers of the velocity. At very low velocities the first
power is of most importance, and the resistance, as Pro-
fessor Stokes has shown, is nearly in simple proportion to
the velocity. When the motion is rapid the resistance
increases in a still greater degree, and is more nearly pro-
portional to the square of the velocity.
Approximate Independence of Small Effects.
One result of the general theory of approximation
possesses such great importance in physical science, and
is so often applied, that we may consider it separately.
The investigation of causes and effects is immensely
simplified when we may consider each cause as producing
its own effect invariably, whether other causes are acting
or not. Thus, if the body P produces the effect x, and Q
produces y, the question is whether P and Q acting to-
gether will produce simply the sum of the separate effects,
x + y. It is under this supposition that we treated the
methods of eliminating error (Chap. XV.), and errors of
a less amount would still remain if the supposition was a
forced and unnatural one. There are probably some parts
of science in which the supposition of independence of
effects holds rigidly true. The mutual gravity of two
bodies, for instance, is entirely unaffected by the presence
or absence of other gravitating bodies. People do ^hot
usually consider that this important principle is involved
in such a simple thing as putting two pound weights in
