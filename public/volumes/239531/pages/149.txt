Dimensions, and Mean Density of the Earth, as derived from the
Ordnance Survey.' In this communication, he states that now
that the observed angles have been corrected by the most refined
methods of mathematical science, the triangulation is rendered
perfectly symmetrical and consistent in itself, so that, any side
being taken as a base, the same length will be reproduced when
it is calculated through the whole or any part of the triangulation.
This, as regards the angular measurements, leaves nothing to be
desired ; and when the five measured bases are incoi-porated in the
triangulation, although some of them are 400 miles apart, and from
5 to 7 miles in length, the greatest difference between the measured
and computed lengths of the bases does not amount to 3 inches ; and
it may be safely affirmed that such a degree of accuracy was never
before attained in so extensive a triangulation.
Astronomical observations have been taken at numerous trigono- ^
metrical stations for the purposes of determining their latitudes, and ^v^
by comparing the amplitudes of the astronomical with the geodetical
arcs, the figure and dimensions of the Earth have been determined. J^ j<y
In determining the most probable spheroid from all the observed *^
amplitudes, continues this talented officer, it was evident that the
plumb-line was deflected from the true direction of the zenith at '^^
several points, and that this was the case at the Eoyal Observatory of
Edinburgh and Arthur's Seat near it, to the extent of 27" to the south, iz fki\
The configuration of the ground — the great valley of the Frith of "'" ■^f->
Forth being on the north, and the range of the Pentland Hills on the
south— presented a tangible cause for the deflection ; but as the con-
toured plans of this district were published, and Colonel James was
himself personally acquainted with the geological structure of the
country, he had observations made on the summit and on the north
and south flanks of Arthur's Seat, with the view of determining the
amount of the attraction of its mass, and from thence deducing the ^ ''-'":?"
mean specific gravity of the Earth. The computed deflection of
the plumb-line due to the configuration of the ground, accounted
in great measure for the observed anomaly in the amplitudes of the
arcs of the meridian. The longest arc of meridian which has been
computed in Great Britain, extends from Dunnose in the Isle of
Wight, to Saxaford in the Shetland Islands, and is 10° in length.>^^; '^^
