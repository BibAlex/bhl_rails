20 ^ KANE. [Jan. 14, 1856.
marked on the confirmation by Dr. Rae of some of the discoveries of
Captain Inglefield.
Colonel Sabine referred to the remarkable facts mentioned by Dr.
Kane of the great variations of temperature in places in immediate
proximity in the Arctic regions, and concluded from this, and from
similar facts observed in other parts of the Arctic regions, that in the
high latitudes local temperature and productions were dependent on
local influences rather than latitude.
Captain Washington said : Iti common with all interested in Arctic
discovery, I beg to express my admiration of the indomitable perseve-
rance and the unflinching courage, under difficulties of no ordinary
character, that have been exhibited by Dr. Kane and his gallant crew
in the expedition of which we have heard an account this evening ;
and' when we consider that these labours and privations were undergone
in the sacred cause of humanity, in the search after our missing coun-
trymen, I feel it difficult to find words to convey my heartfelt appre-
ciation of their heroic exertions and their patient endurance. In answer
to a remark of the President as to my opinion with respect to an
open Polar Sea, I should not have ventured, in the presence of so many
experienced Arctic navigators who are assembled in this hall, to express
any opinion on the subject ; but as the question has been put to me, I
must not shrink from stating my conviction that every fresh fact is in
favour of such a theory. Barentz in 1597, and two centuries and a
half later Wrangel, found open sea off" Siberia, and Parry off" Spitzber-
gen ; Penny and Belcher report the same appearance in Victoria
Channel ; and now Dr. Kane adds his testimony to the rest. It is
difficult to resist the weight of such evidence.
Captain Ommanney and Lord Ellesmere having expressed their
admiration of the manner in which Dr. Kane had conducted the Expe-
dition, the Meeting broke up.
