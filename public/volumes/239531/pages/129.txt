May 26, 1856.] CORPORAL CHURCH— ROYAL AWARDS. 115
cess of other geographical undertakings. If anything can enhance
the pleasure which I feel in the discharge of this duty, it is that of
delivering this acknowledgment of the merits of a zealous and faith-
ful soldier into the hands of so distinguished an ornament of the
army, one whose high scientific knowledge and military experience
have contributed so largely to the glory of this nation."
Lieutenant-General Sir John Burgoyne, accompanied by Corporal
Church, after the delivery of the honorary award, said : —
*' Mr. President, — I have not been prepared to take any part in
this proceeding ; but although unexpectedly called upon, I cannot
refrain from expressing the gratification I feel, that any member of
the corps to which I have the honour to belong, should be thought
worthy of so flattering a mark of distinction as that now conferred.
T can assure the Meeting, that the corps of Royal Engineers and
Sappers are as ready to devote themselves to scientific enterprise, as
they are for military service in the field.
" With regard to Corporal Church, I believe him to be a zealous,
good soldier, a man of intelligence, and one who would be always
anxious to carry out the orders or wishes of his superiors ; and that
he would never bring discredit on the marks of favour thus shown
to him, by so distinguished a body as the Royal Geographical So-
ciety."
