TO THE
ROYAL GEOGIIAPHICAL SOCIETY
OF LOx\DON;
Delivered at the Anniversary Meeting on the 2bth Mai/, 1857,
By Sir Roderick Impey Murchison,
G.C.St.S., D.C.L., F.R.S., &C.,

open this Address by dwelling upon the decease of my prede-
cessor, the gallant Admiral Beechey, as well as that of my successor
when I vacated this chair in 1854, the noble Earl of Ellesmere.

on record some of the salient features in the characters of my
lamented friends, which more particularly connect them with the
great pursuits of this useful Society.
Rear- Admiral Frederick William Beechey, the son of the late Sir
William Beechey, r.a., was born in February, 1796, and before he
reached the age of ten years was already serving as a midshipman
in the Royal Navy. He bore a part in Commodore Schomberg's
brilliant and decisive action off the Isle of France in 1811, and
