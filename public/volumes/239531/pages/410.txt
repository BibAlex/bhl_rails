39G SIR RODERICK I. MURCHISON'S ADDRESS. [May 25, 1857.
list of works whicli lie published,* in whicli great research, combined
with much originality, is one of the most characteristic features.
But the work which has formed the basis of his European reputa-
tion was undoubtedly his ' History of the Ottoman Empire,' by far
the most important work yet written on this interesting subject,
though even here he has been accused of an undue bias toward the
House of Austria ; a bias, however, as pardonable as it is natural in
such a case.
He died at Yienna on the 16th of November, 1856, in his 83rd
year. His monument, which he had himself prepared forty years
before his death, is placed at his own request in the cemetery of
Weidling, near Kloster Neuburg. In a spirit of humble piety he
addressed a letter to our Secretary not long ago, in which, after

Livingstone. His collections have been sent to the Cape. His
companion Mr. Green had ascended the Tioghe as far as Libebe,
100 miles to the south of which he was forced to leave his boat on
account of the rapids.
M. Wahlberg, who was a Member of the Royal Academy of
Sciences of Stockholm, had returned to his native land in 1 844, but
the indomitable desire to make new discoveries in natural history
led him to revisit Southern Africa in 1854. Endowed with pro-
found knowledge in zoology and botany, M. Wahlberg, being speci-
ally characterized by a modest and unassuming manner, was truly
* Amongst his numerous publications the most important are, ' Encyclopedic
View of Oriental Science/ 1804 ; 'Glance at Turkish Literature,' 1816 ; ' History
of Persian Belles Lettres,' 1818; 'History of the Assassins,' 1818; ' History of
