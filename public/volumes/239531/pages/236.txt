FOOLE ON THE SHORES OF THE DEAD SEA. [Dec. 8, 1856.
1. Can the lebias found at Em Barghek and Ain Terabeb live in
the Dead Sea ?
2. Are the minnows in the Jordan, mentioned by Lynch, not
also lebias ?
3. Are the waters of the Dead Sea of different densities, as well
as temperatures, at different depths, as well as at different localities ?
4. What is the mean dew-point, force of vapour, and relative
humidity on the shores of the Dead Sea ?
5. What is the mean temperature, as well as amount of radiation ?
6. What is the mean height of barometer and boiling-point of
water ? Lynch gives the latter as 215°.
7. What do the wild-fowl feed upon which dive in the Dead
Sea?
8. What causes the phosphorescence observed by Lynch in the
Dead Sea ?
9. What is the difference of sea-level at different seasons of the
year, and will the evaporation compensate for the volume of water
flowing into the Dead Sea ?
10. I would also call your attention to the close approximation
made with the Aneroid Metallique, when corrected by Delcros's
formula for temperature and latitude, as shown in the accompanying
table of heights of mountains in Westmoreland : —

It would thus appear that this very portable instmment may be
advantageously employed for topographical surveying by using a
proper formula for corrections.
If any further inquiries were made on the shores of the Dead Sea,
it would be a good opportunity to carry a series of aneroid levellings
through the valley of Acaba to the Eed Sea; for in none of the
above six heights is there near so much difference as is recorded
between the barometrical altitudes of different places in Syria.
I found the temperature of the Dead Sea, in the month of October,
about 82° Fahrenheit near the surface. The temperature of air
* I was not quite at the summit of Wansfell, which I assumed to be 30 feet
above me, but it may not have been quite so much.
