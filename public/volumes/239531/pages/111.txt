" In conclusion, we further earnestly pray that it may not be left to the
efforts of individuals of another and kindred nation already so distinguished
in this cause, nor j'^et to the noble-minded widow of our lamented friend, to
make an endeavour which can be so much more effectively carried out by the
British Government.
" We have the honour to be, my Lord,
" Your Lordship's obedient Servants,

In addition to the above mentioned, many officers of the Royal Navy
who have been employed in the search after Franklin, and who are now
absent from London, have previously expressed themselves to be favour-
able to the final expedition recommended.
7. It was next announced that Mr. A. W. Wallace, f.r.g.s., had
returned to Singapore from his expedition to Borneo, and was preparing
to visit Celebes, where he hoped to explore portions of that island
hitherto unknown, as well as islands of the Molucca group. At the
request of the Council, Mr. Wallace has been furnished, through the
kindness of Lord Clarendon, with letters of introduction from the
Governments of Holland and of Spain, to the authorities of their
different colonies in the East.
