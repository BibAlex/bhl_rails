BENGUELA TO MOZAMBIQUE.
[May 12, 1856.
Caiora. Utumbuca Pambraculima has a commodious town, and provisions in
abundance. Utumbuca Modone has no town, but there is a river, and the
party were detained here a day. They now reached the Nha9a (Niassa)
country, and passed the following towns with few people and much pro-
visions, named Nhafa Buha, N. Pamucamba, N. Paherere, N. Pamira,
N. Pachicoca, N. Pacamonga, N. Paquasi, N. Pachamonga, N. Pomoro,
N. Mamutamlarasa, N. Pamunabombi, N. Papache, N. Pamacouba, N. Paca-
furmira, N. Passifuri, and N. Chamuconde. The town of N. Paquasi, before
mentioned, is large, with many people and much provisions. The Moors
were attacked here for nine days ; they killed sixty-five persons and wounded
eight, and three of their own party were killed. On leaving the Nha^a, the
J ana country was entered, and the following towns were passed, containing
many people, viz., Jana Pacamussicusa, J. Passimoro, J. Pamudicula, J. Paji-
mucudo, J. Paruere, J. Pamuganbo. These were succeeded by the populous
town of Uvuma ; the town of Maconde, with much forest ; Miquindane, a
Moorish town containing a large mosque, and the towns of Mucimbua and
Ibo, with many inhabitants of good character. The last-named town, Ibo or
Wuibu, is on the Mozambique coast, and terminates the itinerary. Neither
bearings nor distances are mentioned, and the time occupied is only spoken of
once, during the whole journey, namely, on reaching Cutonge. Among the
names that can be identified are those near the Mozambique coast, also the
Jana, the Nha9a, the Tumbuca, the Muizas, and the river Kuanga ; the rest
are almost entirely unknown.
