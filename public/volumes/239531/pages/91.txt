The large proportion of children, and the immature age of the majority both
of males and females, as indicated by the above analysis, sufficiently accounts
for the mortality from which they suffered during their residence at Tahiti.
An interesting fact relative to the return of these people to their original
habitation is mentioned by Captain Fremantle, in the enclosure of Captain
Sandilands' communication, viz., that the cost was defrayed by the sale of
the copper bolts of * The Bounty.*
