having received an excellent education, he vi^as sent as minister of
Portugal to the Court of Denmark ; recalled after the revolution of
1820, he was appointed, in 1823, keeper of the archives of the realm,
having already, in 1821, during a sojourn in Paris, collected numer-

the MSS. in the ' Bibliotheque Eoyale.' In 1827, he v^^as appointed
Minister of Foreign Affairs, but shortly afterwards, upon his retire-
ment, he proceeded to Paris, where he joined the Geographical
Society in 1835, and was afterwards elected Vice-President. The
library of our Society is enriched with numerous works from his
pen; and it was but last year that my predecessor in this chair
directed the attention of the world to his beautiful work on the
' Discoveries of the Portuguese,' and other labours, which have
been so suddenly interrupted by his death, which took place in
February, 1856.

services, and the thanks of the Admiralty in 1 830 for a memoir con-
