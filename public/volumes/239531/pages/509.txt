June 22, 1857.] GREGORY'S NORTH AUSTRALIAN EXPEDITION. 495
onward with Mr. H. Gregory for that purpose, and had a horse
killed and dried during my absence from the camp.
34. On the 11th the party moved across the ranges, which rose
about 2,500 feet above the sea level, in latitude 18^ 45', longitude
143** 50', and encamped on a large sandy creek, tributary to the
Lynd Eiver, the southern branches of which we crossed the follow-
ing day. The lower part of the valley of the Lynd was here about
1,500 feet above the level of the sea, the primary ranges rising
abruptly to the W., but the eastern side was formed by a gradually
rising sheet of basaltic lava, which separated it from the valley of
the Burdekin. This portion of the country was well grassed, but
from the porous nature of the rock, destitute of surface water.
35. On the 14th descended into the valley of the Burdekin, and
on the 16th reached that river in latitude 18^ 57', longitude 144^ 50'.
The channel was about 50 yards wide, with a small running stream
of water winding along the sandy bed. The country was of a very
broken and almost mountainous character, the valley and some of
the lower ridges well grassed and suited for stock, the higher ranges
usually poor and stony.
36. Except in the river itself, surface water was very scarce at
this season, and our route consequently along its right bank ; the
general course S.E.
37. Below the junction of the "Clark," the country improved
considerably, large tracts of basaltic rock forming very fertile land
by its decomposition.
38. South of latitude 20^ granite and trap prevailed, forming fine
open grassy ridges, timbered with iron bark ; and this continued to
latitude 26^ 40'.
39. Eeaching the junction of the Burdekin with the "Suttor"
Eiver, on the 30th October, in latitude 20° 36', longitude 146° 50',
I followed up the latter river, soon encountering dense brigalow
scrubs, which gradually extended over the whole face of the country,
and impeded our progress considerably.
40. In about latitude 21° 30', longitude 146° 40', the Suttor is
joined by the " Belyando " of Sir T. Mitchell. This river was
running, there having been heavy rains on the upper part of its course.
41. Availing myself of this favourable circumstance, I followed it
up to latitude 22^, and then steered S.E. in hopes of finding a more
open country, but after crossing a low ridge of sandstone hills,
entered a vast level plain, covered with brigalow scrub, which
continued to latitude 22° 40', longitude 147° 10', where we crossed a
range of scrubby mountains, and descended to " Peak Downs " on the
12th November.
