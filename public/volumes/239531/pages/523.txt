WITT'S REPORT ON SEA-WATER.

in order to ascertain its real nature, or even to determine its relative
proportion, would have required at least a gallon instead of one or
two ounces of water.
In most cases, however, the samples were sufficient to enable me
to determine the specific gravity, and these numbers may possess
some little interest, as a further confirmation of the general observa-
tion of the diminution of the specific gravity of sea- water as it ap-
proaches the mouths of rivers.
The experiments were made after filtering oif the suspended
matter, so that all the samples were in the same clear state, and at
the same temperature of 60° F. ; and I may be allowed to mention
that, although the differences may appear slight, they are, in fact,
considerable, it being remembered that in every case about 1000
grains of water are used.
The samples were numbered as they approached the coast, com-
mencing at the greatest distance from it, and their specific gravities
are contained in the subjoined Table : —

( * ) In these cases, there being less than 1000 grains, the specific gravity even
could not be taken.
Hence it appears that the specific gravity of the open sea, unaf-
fected by rivers, may be assumed to be about 1-02745 to 1-02785,
unless at these furthest points it be still reduced by the same cause.
The following are some of the results of other observers : — MM.
Adolphe and Hermann Schlagintweit * give 1*0277 as the mean
specific gravity of the Atlantic, from the results of a series of experi-
ments made on a voyage from Southampton to Bombay in 1854; and
Rear- Admiral Philip King, e.n., f.r.s., gives a mean specific gravity
for the —
Pacific, between 10° and 40° S. of 1-02648,
