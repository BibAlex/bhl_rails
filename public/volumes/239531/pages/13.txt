Sir Roderick Murchison announced the recent erection of the obelisk
on the quay of Greenwich Hospital to the memory of Lieut. Bellot;,
in the following terms : —
" Mr. President and Gentlemen, — To the assembled geographers who
originated the subscription for the Bellot Testimonial, I beg to announce
that an obelisk of granite has just been erected in memory of the noble-
minded French officer who in the year 1853 perished amid the Polar
ice whilst serving in the last British expedition that sailed in search of
our illustrious member, Franklin. At the same time I have to inform
you, that about 1500/., the surplus of the subscriptions beyond the cosj:
of the obelisk, having been already partially distributed, wijl shortly
be entirely divided among the five sisters of the deceased.
" Not attempting on this occasion to give a sketch of the life of Bellot,
I may be permitted to say, that whilst in his earlier naval services he
gained the esteem of British sailors by his gallant co-operation, whether
in the Rio de la Plata or in suppressing the African slave trade, he
afterwards won the affection of all his associates during two perilous
and adventurous voyages in search of our missing explorers. In short,
the fortitude and daring he exhibited in moments of peril, and the
benevolence which shone out in his bright but short career, were emi-
nently calculated to rouse that warm an,d genial sympathy for his fate
throughout Britain which the monument is destined to mark.
