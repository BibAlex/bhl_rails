54 ANIMAL LIFE IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS. [Feb. 25, 1856.
At Batliurst Inlet and Arctic and Melville Sounds many deer were sLot,
and bears and seals were plentiful. Capeline and herring were extremely
numerous, with a variety of other fish. ISwans, cranes, and grey geese were
also killed.
To Victoria and Wollaston Lands Sir J. Piichardsoa says the deer migrate
in large herds in the spring, and return to the main in the autumn. They
are the breeding -places of vast flocks of snow-geese ; and seals are nu-
merous. There also Dr. Rae, in 1851, found many partridges ; deer were
very numerous, and many hares were seen. He found the Esquimaux very fat,
having killed plenty of seals. They kill the wliale near the difierent head-
lands of the coast, as Sir J. Richardson informs us. At Garry Island, off the
mouth of the Mackenzie, he found numbers of moose and reindeer, foxes,
gulls, dotterels, geese, cranes, and swans. In the autumn from 300 to 400
herring-salmon were caught daily, with carp, trout, and other fish.
At Icy Cape, Capt. Beechey, in the ' Blossom,' fell in with numerous flocks
of ducks, consisting entirely of young ones and females. The Esquimaux had
great quantities of oil, blubber, skins, and dried salmon.
On Herald Islands innumerable flocks of black and white divers deposit
their eggs and bring up their young.
On the Parry groui\ in 1819-20, animals were very numerous. Sir E.
Parry's hunting parties in a few excursions obtained 3 musk oxen, 24 deer,
63 hares, 53 geese, 59 ducks, 144 ptarmigan, amounting to nearly 4000 lbs.
of meat ; one of the musk oxen weighed 700 lbs. Here also M'Clintock
during his remarkable journey killed 4 oxen out of about 50 seen, 1 reindeer
out of 34, 2 bears, 1 wolf, 7 hares out of 80 or 90 seen, and 20 ptarmigan ;
and he remarks that, " had it been his object, he could easily have shot two-
thirds of all the oxen he saw ;" the other animals were remarkably tame.
Austin Island, the shores near Cape Walker, Beaufort, Bathurst, and
Cornwallis Lands, and Wellington and Victoria Channels, also abound with
animal life. Captain Penny especially mentions bears, seals, reindeer, wal-
ruses, hares, with thousands of ducks and sea-fowl. In a short journey, 3
ptarmigan, 4 bears, 3 seals, 1 walrus, 14 hares, 1 reindeer were killed ; of the
latter about 30 were seen, and 35 bears.
The following i3 the list of animals, &c., killed by the crew'S of the ' Assist-
ance ' and her tender ' Intrepid ' in their cruise of 14 months after leaving
Whalefish Islands previous to their return home : â€” 13 bears, 22 foxes, 9 hares,
4 musk oxen, 1 deer, 3 lemmings, 1 seal, and 2 narwhals. These were all in
good condition ; the hares w^eighing about 10 lbs. Of birds, 15 king ducks, 45
eider ducks, 20 long-tailed ducks, 1 brent goose, 82 ptarmigan, 6 willow
grouse, 4 phalaropes, 1 ring dotterel, 19 snow buntings, 10 curlews, 1080
loon (none of these latter were seen W. of Griffith Island), 225 dovekies, 10
lestries, 1438 rotges (these latter were not seen out of Baffin's Bay), 8 burgo-
masters, and 240 other birds, as ivory and silver gulls, puffins, terns, &c. ; in
all 3174 in number.
