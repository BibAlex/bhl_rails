ROYAL AWARDS
TO
MR. AUGUSTUS 0. GREGORY, THE EXPLORER OF NORTH
AUSTRALIA ; AND LT.-COLONEL ANDREW SCOTT WAUGH,
DIRECTOR OF THE TRIGONOMETRICAL SURVEY OF INDIA.
The President opened the Meeting by making tlie following state-
ment of the grounds on which the Council had awarded the
Medals : â€”
The Founder's Gold Medal has been awarded to Mr. Augustus C.
Gregory, for his extensive and accurate surveys in Australia, and
particularly for his last great and successful exploration of North
Australia and his journey thence, or from the Victoria of Stokes to the
Colony of New South Wales, as recommended by the Eoyal Geogra-
phical Society, and carried out under the orders of Her Majesty's
Government.
When Her Majesty's Government decided that an exploration of
North Australia should be made upon the general plan advocated
by this Society, and in accordance with the suggestions of our
members Stokes and Sturt, they wisely selected so experienced an
Australian surveyor as Mr. Gregory to carry out this great and im-
portant project. That gentleman was already well known to us by
his successful labours in unravelling the condition of the interior
of Western Australia, as recorded and mapped in the 18th and
22nd volumes of our Journal. In the first of these journe3"s
(in 1846) he ascertained that the inner part of that colony is
generally flat, broken here and there by low hills of granite or other
igneous rock, the depressions being usually occupied by salt lakes
or marshes, no fresh-water streams having yet been detected. In
1848, Mr. Gregory proceeded from Perth on what was termed "the
Settlers' Expedition," or an endeavour to discover a tract of good
