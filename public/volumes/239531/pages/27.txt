as the raw produce from the extensive forests of Siam is very great.
He would mention especially gum benzoin and lac. He regretted to
find that the Americans had been before us in the trade with Siam.
In answer to a question put by him, Mr. Parkes stated that accord-
ing to the treaty with the King of Siam, the British may travel and
trade throughout the country, but they may only settle and purchase
land for the distance of 54 miles round Bankok. English ships enter
the rivers on the same standing as native craft. The free use of
the Christian religion is allowed, together with churches, cemeteries,
&c. The former heavy measurement duty is abolished, and one pf 3
per cent, on imported goods and 6 or 7 per cent, on exported is sub-
stituted. Thus there is every reason to believe that the trade which
under the former oppressive duties reached half a million sterling, may
yield several millions annually.
