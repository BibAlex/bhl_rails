* Collection of F. Stephens.
Asyndesmus torquatus (Wilson). Lewis Woodpecker.
Of irregular occurrence in this. region, in 1902 I found them fairly
common when I arrived in the mountains at the end of March, and they
remained so until about the first of May. They did not venture into the
canyons at any time, but remained in the groves of live oaks extending
along the base of the mountains. The following year they did not put
in an appearance at all, in fact this is the only year that I have seen them
in the Huachucas.
Centurus uropygialis Baird. Gila Woodpecker.
Although the Gila Woodpecker is a common resident all along the
valley of the San Pedro River, in the Huachuca Mountains it is of rare
and very irregular occurrence. This woodpecker does not seem to mi-
grate south from this region to any extent, but after the breeding season
it spreads out over a greater area, and wanders to places it does not
frequent during the summer. A such times it occasionally strays up inta
the Huachucas, but I doubt very much if any breed in the range. I saw
one an August 30, 1902, and secured a female on March 9, 1903. One or
tw^o others were seen about the latter date but none later than March 15 :
all were right at the base of the mountains at an altitude of about 4500.
Colaptes cafer collaris (Vigors). Red-shafted Flicker.
A common resident throughout the mountains, but during the
breeding season restricted to rather a higher altitude than at other times.
They seldom breed below 5500 feet and from there on up become more
and more abundant as the summit is approached. They begin to lay the
first week in May and the full grown juveniles are tolerable abundant
by the third week in July.
Antrostomus vociferus macromystax (\\'agler). Stephens Whip-poor-
w^ill.
A fairly abundant summer resident, occurring principally between
5000 and 8000 feet ; they may occasionally occur at a little higher eleva-
tion, but T have never seen any below the lowest altitude given. In 190.'^
the first I saw was on April 28, and soon after their notes could be heard
every evening, usually from some thickly wooded hillside, near the bot-
tom of the canyon. The birds themselves were but seldom seen and I
never observed any alight on a road or trail, as their near relative the
