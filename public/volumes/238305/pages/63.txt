PACIFIC COAST AVIFAUNA. [No. 4
Passer domesticus (Linnaeus). English Sparrow.
In the report on the English Sparrow published by the Department
of Agriculture in 1889, this species was reported as present at Camp
Huachuca in the summer of 1886 (page 200, 1. c). I have never seen the
bird either in the grounds of the post or anywhere in the surroundmg
country, and it has probably been exterminated in this region since that
time.
