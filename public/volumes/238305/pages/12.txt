divide it was nearly eight feet deep ; while on the first of May there were
sheltered spots near the summit of the range where the snow was still
lying. Many times in February and March the thermometer fell as low
as 20 degrees Fahr. in the night, occasionally as low as 15 degrees. I
did not find the sumniers unpleasantly hot in the mountains, but on the
plains below it became far too warm for comfort.
I would like here to express my gratitude, first to Mr. G. Frean
Morcom, in whose interests these trips were made, and who has assisted
me in many ways in compiling and publishing this list ; to Mr. Joseph
Grinnell, whose opinions I have consulted, and of whose advice I have
frequently availed myself ; and also to Mr. Ridgway who has kindly
indentified for me many of the more obscure and puzzling species.
