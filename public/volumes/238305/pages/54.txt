April 1904] BIRDS OF THE HUACHUCA MOUNTAINS, ARIZONA. 55
the white of the abdomen being mixed with black ; while the yellow areas
on the throat, crown, and sides, are more restricted in size, and brighter
in color, as compared with aiiditboiii. In one specimen there is a black-
line, narrow but well defined between the yellow of the throat and tac
lower mandilile. But two adult females of nigrifrons were secured ; both
are darker than female examples of aitdnboni, and with the yellow areas
more restricted. In one the breast, sides and blanks are covered with
rather narrow, sharply defined black streaks ; the other has the breast
and sides uniformly black, but with the feathers broadly edged with
lighter, producing a dark slaty appearance, while the flanks are streaked
with dusky.

Dendrocia graciae Baird. Grace Warbler.
Of very irregular occurrence ; in the spring of 1902. I saw but a
single bird, whereas in the following year it was fairly abundant during
the spring migration. In 1896 it was still more abundant, and what is
rather unusual remained to breed in considerable numbers. The earliest
arrival noted was on April 12. 1903; they remained fairly numerous
throughout the month and disappeared about the first of May. A bird
of the pine woods, it was found almost exclusively in the higher moun-
tains, all that were taken being above 8000 feet, with the exception of a
few secured in the spring of 1896 as low as 6000 feet. In their travels
they associated with the other migrating warblers, particularlv with
occidentahs and townsendi, and I found it bv no means easv to distinguish
the various species in the tree tops ; though graciae acts more like a fly-
catcher than any of the others, constantly flying out from the trees to
a considerable distance after insects. Several juveniles were taken dur-
ing July, 1896; and in July and August, 1902, one immature and six
adults in fresh autumnal plumage were secured. A young male taken
July 13th is in the brown streaked plumage, but yellow feathers are be-
ginning to appear along the median line of the throat and upper breast,
and the yellow superciliary stripe is also beginning to show. Another,
a little older, has the streaks of the lower parts restricted to the sides
and flanks, and the yellow markings nearly perfect. A male taken on
July 30th, which has just discarded the juvenile for the winter plumage,
difl^ers from the autumnal adults in having the white of the under parts
more strongly tinged with bufif; and wher'eas the adult has the back
decidedly streaked, though the markings are overcast by the brownish
edgings to the feathers, in the juvenile these markings are but imper-
fectly indicated. Autumnal adults have the upper parts overcast with
brown to such an extent, that except on the sides of the crown where a
little of the black shows through, the characteristic markings are en-
tirely hidden. Females are even more brown than the males, and have
the black streaks on the sides of the breast and flanks nearly concealed
as well.
