This includes several species which appear under Julis
in Hill's list. As now restricted, Platyglossits has a
posterior canine tooth, and nine dorsal spines, while
Julis has no posterior canine, and ten dorsal spines.
216. Platyglossus bivittatus, (Bl.) Giinth. Rainbow. Base
of dorsal fin violet, two or three narrow lines
along its upper half. Base of pectorals whitish,
without black spot. A brown band runs from
snout through eye, Ac. Julis psittaculus oiTiilV a
list is a synony p .
217. P. cyaiwstigma, ((J, & V.) Giinth. Reddish-olive,
each scale on the tail and along the lateral line
with a blue spot. Two indistinct light bands
along the body. Back with 3 blackish blotches.

the soft dorsal with oblique brown streaks. Cau-
dal with 5 blue bands, &c,
219. P. patatus, (C. & V,) Giinth. A doubtful species,
which seems to have been confused with eyanos-
titjma&nd rtqitus.
220. P.cwtapJnis, (C. & V.) Giinth. Green, head and
caudal with red streaks. Dorsal red ; anal with
a band along the middle.
221. P. dimidiates, (Agass.) Julis dimidiatus of HiU's
list. Perhaps the same species as P. iutenmsalis
(Poey,) Giinth., but the streak on the temple
seems to be wanting.
222. P. yaruoti, (C. & V.) Gimth. Bluish or greenish;
back red. Spinous dorsal bluish black, the soft
lighter, with red spots along base. Anal with a
series of blue dots near base, caudal with ten cross-

225. Julis hifascUita, (Bloch.) Giinth. Head bluish;
body green; trunk behind the head black, with a
broad wliitish cross-band. The spinous dorsal

cv. genus Scards, Forsk.
Fi.-hes formerly referred to Scarus are now in part
refen ed to Psemios<;arus and Sparisoma. Callyodon
is also closely allied.
Sairus proper has the lower jaw projecting beyond the
upper, and only a single series of scales on the cheek.
229. Smriis frondosiis, " C. & V." Giinth. Olive, with
three indistinct light longitudinal bands. Fins
puiictulated with white, except sjiinous dorsal,
which is marbled with brownish.
230. S. rtdjripiimis, C. & *'. Violet-olive; fins, except
the spinous dtrsal, orange. Caudal truncated.
Perhaps only the adult state of S.fivnd/jsns.
231. S. aracaiiya, Giinth. Uniform dark purplish-violet.

232. S. chrysupti'ms, Bl., Schn.

S. radians (C. & V.) Bean. Grassy Ground Parrot.
Reddish- olive, lower parts of anal fin rose-colour,
anal with 4 oblique dark spots, &c.
cvii. genus, Pseudoscarus, Bleeker.
The upper jaw projecting beyond the lower ; two or
more series of scales on the cheek.
Pseufhscarus gnacanuiia, (C. & V.) Giinth. Parrot-
Fish. Brownish, with jaws and naked parts of
head green. Fins dark, margins of dorsal, anal,
and ventral green.
P. psittacus (L.) Giinth. Scarus vetula of Hill's list.

broad yellow band from above pectoral nearly to
middle of tail. Caudal green, with the upper and
lower margins yellow .
P. croireiisis {Bl.) P.s<Mi,cio?oi«ci3 of Qiinther. Sil-
very, with three red longitudinal bands. Scarus
alternans of Hill's list is a synonym.
P. chloris (Bl. ifc .'»chn.) Giinth. There are two
forms of this fish :—
(I.) chloris, type. Nearly uniform green.
(2.) var. quadrisjyinosiis (C. & V.) Uniform
brownish. Scarus quadrispinosus of Hill's
list.
P. vireus (C. & V.) Perhaps only a synonym of
P. chloris.
P. aeruleus (Bl.) Giinth. Uniform blue, jaws
whitish. Perhaps only the old state of P. chloris.
P. aracauga, (iitnther. Uniform violet-purple.
Jaws rosy. Has the same coloration as Scarus
aracaiiya " with which it may be easily con-
founded."
P. tcfiiiojiterus (Desm.) Giinth. Olive, a yellow band
laterally ; two green streaks on each side of snout ;
upper and lower margins of caudal green, &c.,
Scams diadeina of Hill's list is perhaps not specifi-
cally distinct from this.
P . JlacoiimryiiMtus (C. & V.) Giinth.
P. turchesius (0. & V.) Giinth.
P. ccelentinus (C.&V.) Giinth.
P. pxmctulatus (C. & V.) Giinth.
The last four are solely on Hill's authority as Jamaican,
Giinther, Cat. Fish. Br. Mus., vol. iv, p. xv. places
them in Pseudosairus, but treats them as doubtful or
insufliciently known.
cviii. genus, Callyodon, (Gronov.) C. & V,
Resembles Scams, but the dorsal spines are flexible,
and the upper lip is double posteriorly only.
Callyodon aiiropunctatus, C. & V. Greenish, verti-
cals with small rosy spots ; a reddish streak from
angle of mouth to eye, another on cheek, and a
third on temple.
C. ustm, C. & V. Brownish, marbled with darker.
Order ANACANTHINI.
Vertical and ventral fins without spinous rays.
Family O PHI DIID.^.

cix. genus, Bkotula, Cnvier.
Brotnla harbata (Schn.) Cuv. Browned Nose or
Deepwater Cod. Snout with barbels. Fins en-
veloped in thick skin.
It is worth noticing, that in ths subterranean caves of
Cuba there is a most remarkable blind genu.s of this
family, Lncifuya. Is it not possible that a caivful
search might reveal a similar form in the caves of
Jamaica I
Family, I'LEURONEGTIDyE (Fiat-Fishes).
ex. iienus Rhombus.
Eyes on the left side ; scales none or small.
Rhombus .canthurns.
R. marmoratus. These two fishes are given in Hill's
list : very probably they belong to some other
genus.

Rhomboidichthys Innatus (L.) Giinth. Rhombtt.i aryus
of Gosse .and Hill.
