for Orcijmis, Cuvier, was suggested by Cooper as
available, and afterwards taken up as a name for
the present genus by Gill himself (Proe. U.S. Na-
tional Museum, 1888, p. 319.). It seems to me,
however, that a name thus originating ought to be
neglected, as being at best but a synonym of Orcy-
JM6S ; and Jordan's title theref. 're remains valid,
unless with Giinther we merge the species with
long and moderate pectoral fin.s in a single genus.
Albicora alliterata (Kaf.) Bonito. Thyrmus thun-
nina of Giinther.
A. pelamiis (L.) Bonito. Back bluish ; 4 brownish
longitiidinal bands on each side of the belly.
A. cordta. (C. & V.) Uniform lead-colour above,
silvery beneath.
A. sloaiiei (C & V.) Auxis sluaiiei of Hill's list.
Giinther gives this as doubtfully identical with
Thynims alhacora, Lowe, but Sloane's figure has
the pectorals much too short for that, although it
agrees in the falcate second dorsal and anal fins.
Lxxv. genus Auxis, C. & V.
Aitris rochei (Risso) Giinth. Back blue, variegated
with darkei', — unifur ■■ in old age. Belly s-ilvery.
A keel on each side of tail.
Lxxvi. genus Cybium, Cuvier,
Has a keel on each side of tail.
Cyhinm regale CBl.) 0. & V. Pectoral scaly. An-
terior part of d rsal black.
C. cahalla, 0. & V. Pectoral scaly at base only.
First dorsal blackish above.
maculatum (Mitch.) Agass. Anterior part of
first dorsal black ; sides with rounded blackish
spots. Teeth rather conical.
C. solandii, C. & V.
C. invmamdatimi, C. & V.
C. accrmim, C. & V. This and the last two are given
by Giintlier as insufficiently known species.
Jordan calls this genus by Lacepede's name Scombero-
morus.
Lxxvii. genus Echeneis, Artedi.
Echeneis luiucrates, L. Sucking-Fish. E. alhicauda
of Hill's list.
Suctorial disc with 22 to 23 laminfe.
E. holbmokii, Gimther. Brown ; generally a black
band, edged with white, along the aide. Very
similar to E. naucrates, but disc longer compared
to length of fish, and composed of only 21 laminaj.
Jordan places this genus in a distinct family, Eche-
ncididie.
Family STEOMATEID^.

sions. Stromatevs was formerly placed in Scombridoe.

length. Jordan refers this to N. paru, Linn, in
Proc. U. S. N. Mus. 1886.
Family E LAC ATID.-E.
Formerly referred to Scombrid:e, b"t separated by
Gill as a distinct family.
Lxxix. genus Elacate, C. & V.

Oinstorjihathas cuvieri, C. & V. {lum Cuv., Rugne
Anim.). Has a black ovate spot between the 4th
and 8th dorsal spines.
Jordan puts this genus in a family OpistogiiathidiX.
Family MALACANTHID^.

small scales, and with very long dorsal and anal flus.
Lxxxi. genus Malacanthus, Cuvier.
Malacautlnt.i j'^ninicrii (Bl.) C. & V. Sunshine.
Scales minutely ciliated.

otherwise unknown to ichthyologists.
A. histrio (L.) Giinth. Chironectes scaber of Hill's

Gill to a separate tamily, as above. It has the
pectoral very long, adapted for flying, with the
lower pi)rtion detached and shorter.
Lxxxv. genus Dactylopterus, Lac^p.
