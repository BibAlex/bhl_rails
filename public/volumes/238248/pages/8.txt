LIST OF THE FISHES OF JAMAICA.
VERTEBRATA.
ICHTHYOPSIDA.
Class, PISCES.
Sub-class, PAL^ICHTHyES.
Order, CHONDOPTERYGII. (Sharks and Rays).
Family, CARCHARIID.E.
Sharks with two dorsal fins and a nictitating membrane.
I. genus, Cakcharias, Cuvier.
For figure of teeth, see Stud. Fish, 317. Teeth triangular.
1. Carcharias terrce-novw (Richards) Gill. Ground
shark. Tiger shark. Wliite shark. Caudal fin
with a narrow blackish edge. The Squalvs car-
charias quoted by Hill is more likely to be this
than Risso's species.
2. C.prionodon. Mentioned in Hill's list.
II. genus, Sphtrna, Raf.
3. Sphyrna zyycena (L.) Miill & Henle. Shovel-nose
shark. Hammerhead shark. Ztjijwna vulgaris of
Hill's list.
III. genus, MusTELUS, Cuv.
Teeth obtuse, arranged like pavement.
4. Mitstelus maculatus. Mentioned in Hill's list. This
cannot be the M. maculatus (Kner. & Steind.,
1867), as that is of later date.
Family, LAMNID.^.
Sharks with two dorsal fins and no nictitating mem-
brane.
IV. genus, Alopecias.
5. Alopecias vulpes (Gmel.) Bonap. Sqiutlus vulpes of
Hill's list.
Family, SCYLLIID.^.
Sharks with one dorsal fin and no nictitating mem*
brane.
V. genus, ScYLLiuM.
6. Scyllium caiUcula (L.) Cuv. Larger spotted Dog-fish.
Hill gives a Sqmdu-s canictda, which if rightly identi-
fied would be this. Giinther says " the fishermen of
some localities do not disdain to eat them."
VI. genus, GiSGLYMOSTOMA, Miill & Henle.
7. Ginglymostotna cirratum (Gmel.) M. & H. Uniform
brownish.
The Scyllium cirratum recorded by Gosse, Nat. Soj.
Ja.. pp. 241, 499, is presumably this.
Family, PRISTID.-E.
VII. genus, Pristis, Latham.
8. Pristis antiquorum, Lath The Saw-fish.
Family, RHINOBATID.E.
Rays with a long and strong taU, having a caudal and
two dorsal fins.
VIII. genus, Rhinobatus.
9. Rhinobatus umlulatus, Olfers. Sea-Fiddler.
Family, TORPEDINID.^.
Rays with a broad smooth disc, and an electric organ
IS. genus, Narcine, Henle.
10. Narcine brasiliensis (Olfers) Henle. Trembler. Tor-
pedo bancroftii of Hill's list.
Family, RAIID.E.
Rays with a broad rhombic disc and no serrated cau-
dal spine.
I. genus, Ra.ja, L.
11. Baja batis L. Quoted in Hill's list, but probably
an error, as the species is European.
Family, TRYGONID.E.
Rajs with the pectoral fins extending to end of snout.
XI. genus, Trygon, Adans.
12. Tryrjon jmstinaca (L.) Cuv. The sting-ray. Body
smooth, coloration uniform, or sometimes with
scattered whitish spots.
sii. genus, Urolophus, MfiU. & Henle.
13. Urolophus torpediniis (Desm.) M. & H. Tryyon ja-
maiceiisis of Hill's list is probably this : Upper
parts with numerous yellow, dark-edged ocelli ;
or more uniform. Figured by Sloane as Pasti-
naca marina, plate 246, fig. i.
Family, MYLIOBATID^.
Rays with very broad pectoral fins not extending to
end of snout,
XIII. genus, DiCEROBATIS.
14. 15. The species recorded by Hill as Cephaloptera
banksiana and C. manatis should belong to this
genus, bnt they require further investigation. A
species of the genus is figured in Stud. Fish, d.
347. . o
xrv. genus, Aetobatis Miill. & Henle.
16. Aetobatis nairinoyri (Euphr.) M. & H. Myliobatis
flagellum and M. nairinari of Hill's list. Body
smooth, disc generally with numerous rouad
bluish-white spots.
XV. genus, Ceratoptera, Miill. & Henle.
17. Ceratoptera vampyrus (Mitch.) Dum. Tail about
as long as body ; body and tail rough, covered
with small protuberances. This species grows
to an immense size, as much as 15 feet broad, and
three or four feet thick.
Sub-class, TELEOSTEI.
Order, ACANTHOPTERYGII.
Family, PERCID.E.
Marine or freshwater carnivorous fishes, with oblong
bodies usually covered with toothed scales. No
barbels. American writers divide this large family
into several, which are perhaps better regarded as
sub-families,
svi, genus, Labrax, Cuvier.
According to Gill, there is a genus Labrax of prior
date, comprising some North Pacific fishes. The
American Labracinas have been referred by Jordan
to Borxiis and Morone.
18. Labrax. lineatus (Bl.) Cuv. & Val.
19. L. pilwialis. Hill. "Marked with bands like the
Perca fluviatilis of Europe."
20. L. mucronatus, 0. & V. Has no lines or black
bands.
XVII. genus, Centropomus, C. & V.
21. Centropomxis undee-imalis. (Bl.) C. & V. Snook.
According to Hill, there are two forms, the Sea
Snook, long and silvery, and the River Snook,
broad and brassy. â– 
xvin. genus, Centropristis, Cuv.
22. Centropristis tabacarius, C . & V. Red-brown dar-
ker above, paler beneath, with a whitish spot on
each side.
23. C. aurorvhens,C. &y. Back vermilUon, flanks with
irregular yellow spots.
24. C. rufus, C. & V. UniformUy dark red.
XIX. genus, Trisotropis, Gill.
25. Trisotropis bonaci, Poey. Violet-brown, with ob-
scure bluish- white blotches on the head and bodv
Rock Cod. ^
26. T. guttatus (Schn.) Gill. Serranus cardinalis and
S. ru2)estris of Cuv. & Val.
XX. genus, Enneacentrus, Gill.
27. Enneacentrus panctatiis (L.) Poey. Serranns guati-
viri and 6'. ontalibi of Cuv. & Val. Butter- Fish,
XXI. genus, Serrantts, Cuvier,
This genus of .Sea l-erches formerly included Triso-
tropis, Epinepheliis and Enneacentrus. The follow-
ing species may in part at least have to be distri-
buted in other generi, but I know nothing of them
beyond what is given by Hill and Cuvier i Valen-
ciennes.
28. Serranus tigris. Given in Hill's list.
