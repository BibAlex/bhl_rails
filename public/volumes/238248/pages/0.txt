325. 0. cornutus. Recorded by Hill, but it appears to be

which the carapace and tail have round bluish and
blackish spots, and the interorbital space is deeply
concave.
Family GYMNODONTES.
Jaws modified into a beak.
cxLix. genus Tetkodon, (L.) Giinth.
326. Tetrodon testudineus, L. Poi-poise (so-caUed). T.
ammocryptus of Goase. Brownish-black above, with
whitish lines : sides yellowish with brown spots :
abdomen and tins immaculate.
327. T. jjsittacus, Bl. Schn. Brownish, with six dark
brown bands across the back. Very doubtfully
Jamaican.
CL. genus DioDON, L.
328. Diodou liturosus, Shaw. Sour-sop Fish. Our form
has the spines long : and two bands, and three
spots, which generally liave a light edge, also
