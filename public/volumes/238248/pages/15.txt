Marine fishes, somewhat resembling freshwater Silu-
ridse. Barbels none. Air-bladder none,

fin, and pharyngeal teeth only, the mouth being
toothless,

understood by Giinther. In Bean and Dresel's list
three species are placed in Tyhsiirus. as below. The
rest I leave in Belone as they appear in the Tecords.
274. Tylo.iwrus notatus (Poey) Jord. & Gilb. Long-Jaw.

Giinth., an East African species.
283. B.anjalus.C.&Y.
284. B. cicouella,C. & V. This and the last are given by
Giinther as doubtful or insufficiently known
species.

cxxv. genus Esox (Artedi) Cuvier.
285. E so.i: nicjer, Lesaeiir. Given in Hill's list as i?. ameri-
camis ; it must liave been introduced. Has a very
distinct blaok suborbital band.

form.
cxxix. genus Chatoessus, Cuvier.
289. Chatoessvs trapowj. Mentioned in Hill's list : may
it be Ceteiujrdidis ? " Trapong" is perhaps not
intended as part of a scientific name. Compare
the original list with the reprint of 1881.
cxxx. genus Opisthonema.
290. Opisthonema oejlina, (LeSueur) Croode & Bean.
Sprat. Clupea thrls.w of Gimtlier. No teeth in
the palate. An indistinct bluish spot on the

Chatoessus eumorphus of Gosse is perhaps a syn-
