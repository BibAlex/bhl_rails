east of Hickmans Harbor Point. At HIckmans Harbor Point
the Signal Hill conglomerate of the Avalon series is well ex-
posed, and above, to the eastward, the Random terrane. The
summit of the latter is very beautifully shown at the slate quar-
ries about half a mile east of Hickmans Point, where the strike
of the upper bed of the Random sandstone is N. 50° E., dip
70° S.E. Immediately on this band of reddish-tinted sandstone
there is a thin layer of conglomeratic limestone that forms the
basal bed of the Cambrian. (Plate XXVI.)

I a. Conglomerate formed of small pebbles of the subjacent
Random rocks, and small quartz grains and pebbles, all
cemented together by a fine calcareous sandy matrix.
Often there is scarcely a trace of calcareous matter 6

A change of dip and overturn occurs here, which breaks
