mostly concealed, well developed, generally projecting, 15 x 25mm in
diameter, surrounded by narrow bract scars, the central portion solid
and showing the scars of floral organs ; armor 3-5cm thick, definitely
but irregularly joined to the axis, the leaf bases penetrating to different
depths ; wood 2-3cm thick, clearly exposed on longitudinal and trans-
verse sections; cortical parenchyma icm thick, irregular on its outer,
even on its inner face ; fibrous zone consisting of three very definite
exogenous rings of wood, the outer 5mm thick, the middle one 2mm
thick, and the inner one icm thick, all with radiate structure, the
medullary rays visible across the entire zone, the inner wall of which
is scalloped by the rounded inner edges of definite woody wedges,
8mm wide, and the sharp reentrant angles between them ; medulla
when circular 4cm in diameter, when elliptical 3 x 5cm, in one speci-
men 5 X 7cm in diameter.
This species is represented by 7 different numbers in the collection,
but Nos. 500.13 and 500.72, Nos. 500.40 and 500.73, and Nos. 500.53
and 500.61, each match and complement each other. No. 500.37 i-s
larger than the rest and represents most of the lower part of a trunk.
With the exception of Nos. 500.53 and 500.61 all the specimens so
closely resemble one another that the suspicion arises that they may all
belong to the upper part of No. 500.37. But a careful examination
negatives this view, and it seems necessary to suppose that they repre-
sent at least two different trunks. The combination Nos. 500.44 and
500.73 may be a part of the same trunk as No. 500.37, but the combi-
nation Nos. 500.13 and 500.72 must be distinct, as it forms nearly
half of a trunk of different shape with the large mamillary terminal
bud and a small portion of the base, which show that this trunk was
low and vertically compressed if at all.
The combination Nos. 500.53 and 500.61 constitute more than two
thirds of a handsome little trunk broken longitudinally through the
center of the axis, and one of the halves transversely above the middle,
the fractures being as clear and perfect as if sawn. This specimen
shows the internal structure more perfectly than any other in the col-
lection, especially the three exogenous rings of wood as described.
