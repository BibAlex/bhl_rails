causes of a general nature should be heard in the several parts
of the state in a county court by the Chief Justice of the Province
for the time being, "or" as the bill read, "by and before such
other commissioner or commissioners as the Lord Proprietary
of this Province or the Lieutenant General shall authorize to
hear and determine the same," The bill further provided for a
register to attend each session of the County Court and that
"the said Chief Justice or Commissioners for the time being and
the said register shall be a court of record and shall be called
the County Court, and the said court shall or may have, use,
exercise and enjoy all 0/ any the same or the like powers,
privileges, authorities and jurisdictions within this Province (in
the causes aforesaid), as one of the King's courts of common
law in England useth or may use and exercise within the realm

levies were made upon the counties and in others upon the sev-
eral hundreds within the counties, and in every instance the levy
was upon the taxable freemen or upon such freemen and the
"visible estates in the Province."
In later years the duties of the County Commissioners in respect
of the levies were performed by the justices of the peace, who
had also been provided for at the same time as the count}^ court ;
and by a gradual process, but one in entire harmony with the
manner of growth of all institutions under our English system,
the justices of the peace wholly supplanted the Commissioners
in the respect under consideration ; until finally the meeting of
the justices of the peace for the purpose indicated came to be
designated as Levy Courts, and in 1794 (Act of 1794, ch. 53),
