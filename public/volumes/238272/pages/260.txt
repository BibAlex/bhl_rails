LOWER CAMBRIAN TERRANE 339
Ordovician, Silurian, etc. It appears to be inapplicable for such
use, as it is equivalent to Georgian. For the Lower Cambrian
formation on Hanford Brook the best name is Hanford, as that is
the typical locality where the terrane may be studied. It was
applied to the formation in 1891.^ For the Lower Cambrian of
Newfoundland the local name Placentia was used in 1891. In
1889 Terra Nova was used in the same sense as Mr. Matthew
uses Etcheminian.^ Both names are unnecessary, as Georgian
includes all the Lower Cambrian terranes and formations.
The term St. John should be limited to a definite formation
or group of formations. We now have the St. John quartzite, St.
John shales and St. John group. It has long been applied to the
St. John terrane, and I think should be used in the broad sense.
If this is done the basal quartzite should receive a local name,
as well as the shales above. The quartzite might be called the
Seely quartzite, from the fine exposure on Seely street in the
city of St. John, and the shales the Ratcliff formation, from the
typical locality on Ratcliff's mill stream.
Conclusions.
(a) The ' Etcheminian ' terrane of Matthew is of Lower
Cambrian age.
(3) The Olenellus fauna is older than the Paradoxides and
Protolenus faunas of the Middle Cambrian.
{c) The Cambrian section of the Atlantic Province'"* of North
America includes the Lower, Middle, and Upper Cambrian di-
visions as defined by me in 1891.

"I do not think it is necessary to discuss the Cambrian rocks of Massachusetts.
Once the typical ' Etcheminian ' is shown to be of Lower Cambrian age, all
correlated formations go with it.
