140 COULTER AND ROSE
f erred to the genus Arracacia. The species at first suggests A. atro-
ptirptirea^ but the two are to be kept separate, as the following differ-
ences appear to be constant, A. cegopodioides is low and herbaceous,
arising from a deep-seated, long, spindle-shaped tuber, while A. atro-
purpurea is half shrubby ; the former has yellow flowers, the latter
purple; in the former the bractlets of the involucel are linear and fili-
form, insignificant and entire, and not conspicuous and serrate; while
the leaflets are more obtuse, with more regular and blunter teeth, etc.
