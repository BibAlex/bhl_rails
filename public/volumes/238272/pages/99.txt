2. MICROPLEURA Lag. in Ocios Esp. Emigr. 4 : 347. 1825.
A genus of a single species, endemic in the Mexican and Central
American region. Both Urban and Drude refer the genus to Cen-
tella^ recently separated again from Hydrocotyle^ but in our judgment
it should be kept distinct. It is restricted to the high mountains,
while Centella^ at least our American species, belongs to the low
ground.
Micropleura renif olia Lag. 1. c. ; also Obs. Aparas. 15. 1826.

Pose 2056, August 7, 1897.
3. BOWLESIA Ruiz. & Pav. Prod. Fl. Peruv. 44. pi. 34. 1794.
Chiefly a South American genus, but two species extending into
our region. In addition to B. lobata Ruiz. & Pav., given by Hemsley,
we cite the following :
Bowlesia palmata Ruiz. & Pav. Fl. Peruv. 3: 28. pi. 2^1. 1802.
Chihuahua : under cliffs, canyons of the Sierra Madre, Pringle
1248, October 3, 1887.
4. SPANANTHE Jacq. Collect. 3: 247. 1789.
A genus extending from the Mexican and Central American region
into Tropical South America. Hemsley gives the following two
species: S. a7igulosa Turcz. and S. paniculata Jacq., but, as he re-
marks, the former is probably a variety if not merely a form of
the latter.
