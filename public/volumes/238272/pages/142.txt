crease between that period and 1820 was less than between
1800 and 1810, in the latter period being but 9000, or 37^ per
cent. At the next census (1830) the increase was still less,
being but 6795, or 20.57 percent; and still lower in 1840,
when the total population was 43,712, an increase in ten years
of but 3878, or 9.75 percent, the lowest percent of increase
during the history of the District.
Washington was at a very low ebb in 1840. The city govern-
ment proved entirely inadequate in its comprehension of the real
future of the city ; Congress had been criminally neglectful of
its interest and it was left to grow without stimulation and with-
out exertion. In 1850, however, there was a little improvement,
the increase in the number of the population being double what
it had been between 1830 and 1840, for the census of 1850
showed a population of 51,687, an increase of 7975 or over 18)^
percent in the ten years. In i860 the results were still better, the
population being 75,000, the increase in numbers being 23,393,
as against 7975 in the previous decade, the percentage of in-
crease being 45.25 percent.
During the next ten years a more remarkable increase was
shown and it demands special consideration. The war began
in 1861 and the city of Washington attracted the attention not
only of the country but of the world. Troops from all parts
were brought here, Washington being the central post of the
armies. Strangers who knew nothing of Washington but the
brief statements they had seen in their school geographies were
now brought to see the town itself. The business of supplying
the great armies, everything connected with the equipment and
dispatching of large bodies of troops brought business men in
great numbers to the capital. Washington received its greatest
advertisement through these means, but another force came in.
Slavery had never amounted to very much in the District. In
i860 the population of 75,080 consisted of 60,763 white and
14,317 colored people. Of this number of the colored, only
3185 were slaves. There had been a constant reduction in the
number of slaves through various causes, the largest number at
an}^ one time being 6377 in 1820. At the next census there
was a slight reduction, while in 1840 the number was reduced
