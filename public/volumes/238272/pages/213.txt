organs of the armor upwardly appressed, especially on one side ; rows
of scars from left to right making an angle of 35°, those from right to
left of 50° with the axis; scars subrhombic, i8-22mm wide, 8-iomm
high ; leaf bases on the sides of the specimen appressed to the trunk
but exposed at their summits and on their lower sides, the keel distinct,
rough or honeycombed on the exposed ends, but on fresh fractures
fine in structure and white-punctate with small narrowly elliptical,
white pores appearing as short white lines; vascvilar bundles faintly
visible forming a row part way round the petiole on the side next the
trunk; walls i-2mm thick, striate with alternating light and dark
lines ; reproductive organs few, poorly developed, sometimes raised,
2 X 3cm in diameter, the interior porous or heterogeneous ; armor 2cm
thick, joined to the axis by a definite line of appreciable thickness
(libro-cambium layer) ; wood 2cm thick; cortical parenchyma icm
thick, of coarse structure; fibrous zone icm thick, consisting of two
rings of equal thickness separated by a light colored band, the structure
radially disposed ; medulla 2 x 6cm in diameter, hard and coarse with
white punctuations or variously shaped markings.
This small specimen. No. 500.63 of the collection, is so totally dif-
ferent from all the rest that it was necessary to regard it as constituting
a species by itself. It weighs i .5 kilograms and has the highest spe-
cific gravity observed, feeling almost like heavy spar, whence the spe-
cific name.
CYCADELLA VERRUCOSA n. sp.
Trunks large (3o-40cm high, 20— 30cm in larger diameter), obo-
vate, contracted at the base, much laterally compressed, unbranched
or with a few small Secondary axes; rock hard and fine at least in the
interior, light colored or brow^n on weathered surfaces, dark or black
on freshly exposed ones, of medium specific gravity; organs of the
armor horizontal; leaf scars subrhombic, i5-2omm wide, J-iomm
high ; leaf bases hard, rough or porous, with a raised ridge near the
margin indicating the position of the vascular bundles which are them-
selves sometimes visible in the form of pits; walls 2-5mm thick, hard
and somewhat porous, light colored with darker striae; reproductive
organs numerous, well developed, prominently projecting in the form
of large warty protuberances distorting the arrangement of the leaves,
elliptical in cross-section, 20x30mm in diameter, surrounded by large
narrowly subrhombic bract scars in several rows passing into leaf
scars, central portions heterogeneous, marked by the scars of the es-
sential organs ; armor 2-5cm thick, clearly but irregularly joined to
