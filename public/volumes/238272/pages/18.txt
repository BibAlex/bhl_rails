FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
[Read to the Academy January i8, 1899.]
It has seemed best to prepare this report in such way that it
may serve not onl}^ for the information of persons present at this
meeting, but also as a permanent record to be printed in the
Proceedings. With a view to such pubhcation it has been
made to cover the transactions of the Society and its Board of
Managers, as recorded in the Secretary's minutes, but without
following the language of the minutes.
It has seemed best also to precede the account of the Acad-
emy's work with a brief statement of the conditions and events
which led to the Academy's organization.
I. NARRATIVE OF EVENTS ANTECEDENT TO THE FORMATION
OF THE ACADEMY.
Of the associations from which the membership of the Acad-
emy is drawn the one earliest formed is the Medical Society of
the District of Columbia, which was organized in 1819. The
subject matter of its work is and has been medical science, in-
cluding sanitation. More than fifty years afterward the Philo-
sophical Societ}^ of Washington was organized, beginning its
work in 187 1 and choosing 'science ' as its subject without ex-
pressing any limitation. Although the field of the younger
society nominally included the field of the older, there was
practically no duplication of work as medical papers were rarely
presented to the Philosophical Society.
