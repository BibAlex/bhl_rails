DEVELOPMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 1 99
we find the Assembly speaking of the Levy Courts as definitely
established bodies, and providing that such courts may impose
assessments for repairs of their court-houses and the county
prisons, and for the erection and repair of bridges ; and, further,
that the justices of the peace in the respective counties, or any
five of them, shall meet annually between the first of March and
the first of October "to adjust the ordinary and necessary ex-
penses of their several counties," and to levy the necessary and
proper assessments in the premises ; and finally, so far as we
have to do with Maryland in the matter, in 1798 (Act of 1798,
ch. 34), it was enacted that seven justices of the peace of those
annually commissioned should be commissioned by the Governor
and Council as justices of the Levy Court in each county, and
designated in their commissions as 'Justices of the Levy Court.'

Washington (as the Virginia portion of the original District was
created a county by the name of Alexandria), provision was
made for the appointment by the President of oflScers familiar to
the people of the territory, including the constituents of a Levy
Court, namely, justices of the peace, and by act of March 3,
iSoi (2 Stats. 115), it was specifically enacted:
That the magistrates, to be appointed for the said district,
shall be and they are hereby constituted a board of commission-
ers within their respective counties, and shall possess and exer-
cise the same powers, perform the same duties, receive the same
fees and emoluments, as the levy courts or commissioners of
county for the state of Maryland, possess, perform and receive ;
and the clerks and collectors, to be by them appointed, shall be
subject to the same laws, perform the same duties, possess the
