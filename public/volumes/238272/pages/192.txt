A CONSIDERABLE number of fossil cycadean trunks have been
obtained from the Jurassic of Wyoming. The locality is in

The history of the discovery of these fossil trunks only dates
back to 1898. The first intimation that I had of it was con-

was received. As the new locality is not in the Black Hills it
