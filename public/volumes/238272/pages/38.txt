SQLTIRRELS OF MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA 25
and Microsciiinis are South American groups with numerous
species, and occur as intrusive elements in Central America,
where each is represented by one or two species. Otoscmrus
and Hesferosciiirus have few species and beloncr to the western
United States, but cross the border into Mexico.
The first name available for a subgenus of American Squirrels
is Guerlingiietus Gray, 1821, of which Macroxiis'is a synonym.
3facroxus, the name which has been commonly used, has been
curiously diverted from its original application to include nearly
all American squirrels. Lesson was the first to misuse the name,
after which Gray went to even greater extremes, in which he was,
to a certain extent, followed by Trouessart in 1897. In 1880 the
last named author established several subgenera of American
squirrels, several of which were accepted by Merriam and
Allen; yet in 1897 he again lumped several of them in the
ancient confusion under Macroxiis. The most recently described
subgenus is Microsciurus Allen, 1895.
