cesser to territory and all rights therein is surely under no
hamper of delegated authority.
The fate of the territorial government, as it is generally called,
is too freshly in mind to call for extended comment ; and it suf-
fices to say that between the riot of extravagance of the Board
of Public Works and the orgy of suffrage, which some of our
good citizens long to have restored, that government, after a
fevered life of a little more than three years, deservedly fell.
And its fall ushered in what I hope is to be the last stage of the
District's political development.
When Congress could no longer endure its creature of 187 1,
it enacted on June 20, 1874 (18 Stats. 116), that all provisions
for an Executive, Secretary, Legislative Assembly, Board of
Public Works and Delegate to Congress from the District should
be repealed (saving the term of office of the then sitting dele-
gate), and that for the time being, and until otherwise provided
by law, the government of the District should be committed to a
board of three commissioners to be appointed by the President
and Senate and vested with all the powers formerly belonging to
the Governor and Board of Public Works, except as otherwise
provided by the act ; and that the powers of the Chief Engineer
of that Board should be exercised by an officer of the Engineer
Corps of the Army of the United States, to be detailed by the
President. In addition, a Board of Audit, consisting of the First
and Second Comptrollers of the Treasury was provided, with the
authority and duty to audit all claims growing out of the acts of
the Board of Public Works in the execution of its " comprehen-
sive plan of improvements," the cost of which the District is yet
paying and to pay through the medium of the familiar and
much-to-be-desired 3.65 bonds.
After a four years' trial of this form of government for the
District, Congress very wisely decided to make it, with certain
improvements, permanent, and on June 11, 1878 (20 Stats. 102),
passed the act under which, as amended and supplemented from
time to time, we now live. The Government of the District
under this legislation which at the outset I made bold enough to
speak of as the best possible for a municipality may be gener-
