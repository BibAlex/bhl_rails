DEVELOPMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 213
Georgetown, one from the County, and one a civil engineer.
This Board was given entire control of, and authorized to make
all regulations which it should deem necessary for keeping in
repair the streets, avenues, alleys and sewers of the City (its
powers were extended to the County by the Legislative As-
sembly), and all other works which might be entrusted to it by
the Legislative Assembly or Congress. The principle of divis-
ion of expense between the United States and the District was
again recognized here, as in the further provision of the act that
all officers to be appointed by the President were to be paid by
the United States and all others to be paid by the District for
their services.
An interesting provision of the scheme, though one that was
never acted upon, indicates the extent to which the principle of
local government in local affairs still held sway ; for it was pro-
vided by the act that the Legislative Assembly might divide the
portion of the District outside of the cities into townships, not
exceeding three, and create township officers and prescribe their
duties, but that all township officers should be elected by the
people of the townships respectively.
The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia in the case
of Roach V. Van Riswick (MacA. & M., 171, decided No-
vember 18, 1897), held that much of this act, so far as it con-
cerned the Legislative Assembly, was unconstitutional and
void, for the reason that , Congress had no power to delegate
general legislative authority to the local government of the Dis-
trict, but could give that government only such powers as
might properly be conferred upon a municipal corporation ; a
decision which may yet be brought under review, to somebody's
disaster, as I think : for it seems to me clearly wrong, seeing
that the Constitution only gave Congress the potential right of
jurisdiction over the District, and that it was Maryland, the
sovereign of the territory, that "ceded and relinquished" that
territory, — not delegated any powers — "to the Congress and
government of the United States, in full and absolute right,
and exclusive jurisdiction, as well of soil as of persons residing
or to reside thereon." This is not delegation : it is absolute ces-
sion of territory and abdication of all rights therein, and the sue-
