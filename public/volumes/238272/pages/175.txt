2IO DAVIS
City of Washington remained to the end substantially as the act
of 1848 left it. There were thus for some years side by side in
the District three separate municipal governments, the Corpor-
ation of Washington, the Corporation of Georgetown and the
Levy Court. Each of these governments had and exercised
the power of making* ordinances and laws, and there accordingly
existed at the same time one set of such ordinances or laws for
Washington, another set for Georgetown and a third set for the
county. Perhaps no greater anomal}^ than this can be presented
for a territory of sixty-four square miles, especially when it is
considered that this territory is the seat of Time's latest and best
offspring in the way of government ; and I am constrained to
wonder what the Puritan forebears of sturdy New England would
have thought could they have come to life so lately as within
the past quarter of a century to find that the same act committed
on the same Sunday would have met with one punishment in
Georgetown, another in the county and none at all in Washing-
ton. Yet this very fact, for fact it is, is the highest possible
testimonial to the conservatism which characterizes the origin
and growth of law and institutions in our English system : the
conservatism which has made us and our kin beyond the sea
the foremost in the universal brotherhood now happily becoming
so generally recognized.
In the growth and administration of these three municipalities,
helped along by the oversight of the Federal power, there of
course came into being as occasion required the needful detail
agencies of government : courts greater and smaller, judicial
and fiscal officers, surveyors, school officials, boards of health,
constabularies, and the like. And although our institutions
were thus growing and being added to in strict conformity to
the principles of the distinction between Federal and local govern-
ment which underlies the whole American system, there was at
the same time coming more and more into play the other seem-
ingly inevitable principle, so far as result is concerned, that the
national must and will to a great extent override the local, and
the general must and will supplant the particular.
This was first manifested in the establishment of courts and
judicial officers and general laws, of jurisdiction and authority
