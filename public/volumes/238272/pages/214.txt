FOSSIL CYCADEAN TRUNKS FROM WYOMING 279
the axis; woody zone i5iTim thick, not differentiated; medulla a thin
slab 3-6cm thick, 15cm wide, of a fine uniform structure resembling
the white iron ore of the Potomac beds of Maryland.
Nos. 500.27, 500.32, and 500.64 are referred to this species. The
last is anomalous and shows relatively few of the characters, but it has
the same shape. The fruits are little elevated but otherwise this lead-
ing character holds for it. No. 500.27 is probably the top of the same
trunk as No. 500.32, but there is an interval between them, and they
have been subjected to different conditions since they became fossil-
ized. On a casual view, therefore, they do not seem so closely to re-
semble each other as they do when carefully inspected. They are
then found to have almost exactly the same width, thickness, and gen-
eral form, so that it is easy to see which sides correspond. All the
characters also agree except that the fruiting axes are more prominent
on No. 500.32, representing the lower portion. This is partly due to
the fact that this specimen has suffered more from erosion, and, owing
to the greater hardness of these organs, they are made to stand out
more conspicuously. It was the appearance thus produced that sug-
gested the specific name.
No. 500.27 weighs 5.19, No. 500.32, 8.31, and No. 500.64, 4.68
kilograms.
CYCADELLA JEJUNA n. sp.
Trunks of medium size (i8cm high, 7— 12cm in lesser, and 16— 20cm
in greater diameter), ovoid or subconical, laterally compressed, un-
branched ; rock hard, gray on weathered surfaces, drab in the in-
terior, black on fresh exposures, with rather high specific gravity;
organs of the armor horizontal ; rows of scars forming an angle
in either direction of 45°-5o°; leaf scars subrhombic, i5-2omm
wide, 7-9mm high; leaf bases hard and firm, rough on the exposed
ends; walls 2-4mm thick, light colored and contrasting with the leaf
bases, sometimes with a median ridge; reproductive organs few and
poorly preserved ; armor 2-4cm thick, joined to the axis by a clear
line; wood i5-2omm thick; outer zone 5mm thick, traversed by rays
or vessels ; inner zone consisting of two rings, the outer 5mm thick
with fine radiate structure showing medullary rays and woody wedges,
the inner 5-iomm thick of a less definite structure; medulla elliptical
in cross-section, lesser diameter 2-3cm, greater Scm, homogeneous.
The two specimens Nos. 500.28 and 500.31, which I have brought
together here, have at first view very little to mark them or interest the
student, but while they differ essentially from all others in the col-
