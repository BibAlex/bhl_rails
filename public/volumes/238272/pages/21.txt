The plan was adopted in its entirety by the Anthropological
and Biological Societies but was rejected by the Philosophical,

In 1884 were organized the Chemical Society of Washington
and the Entomological Society of Washington, in 1893 the Geo-
logical Society of Washington, and in 1888 the National Geo-
graphic Society with headquarters in Washington. The Chem-
ical, Geological, and Geographic trenched on the field of the
Philosophical Society, and the Entomological on that of the
Biological.

annual address of the presiding officer. This custom has con-
