provisions in relation to the territory in general and the city of
Washington in particular, enacted specifically as follows :
That all that part of the said territory, called Columbia,
which lies within the limits of this state, shall be and the same
is hereby acknowledged to be forever ceded and relinquished
to the congress and government of the United States, in full
and absolute right, and exclusive jurisdiction, as well of soil as
of persons residing, or to reside, thereon, pursuant to the tenor
and effect of the eighth section of the first article of the con-

That nothing herein contained shall be so construed to vest in
the United States any right of property in the soil, as to affect
the rights of individuals therein, otherwise than the same shall
or may be transferred by such individuals to the United States :
And Provided Also, That the jurisdiction of the laws of this
state, over the persons and property of individuals residing
within the limits of the cession aforesaid, shall not cease or deter-
mine until congress shall by law provide for the government
thereof, under their jurisdiction, in manner provided by the
article of the constitution before recited.
Similarly, the State of Virginia, in making cession of its
part of the original District enacted :
That nothing herein contained shall be construed to vest in
the United States any right of property in the soil, or to affect
the rights of individuals therein, otherwise than the same shall
or may be transferred by such individuals to the United States.
And Provided Also, That the jurisdiction of the laws of this
commonwealth over the persons and property of individuals re-
siding within the limits of the cession aforesaid, shall not cease
or determine vmtil congress, having accepted the said cession,
shall, by law, provide for the government thereof, under their
jurisdiction, in manner provided by the article of the Constitu-

provision should be made by the Congress of the United States
