FOSSIL CYCADEAN TRUNKS FROM WYOMING 259
or injured, all the organs have this uniform black or brown
color. It is, however, fortunate that while this interferes se-
riously with an ordinary macroscopic examination, the applica-
tion of a lens removes the obscurity to a considerable degree,
and in photographing the specimens it is observed that the dark
surfaces come out almost as clearly as the light or variegated
ones.
Besides the lime incrustations on the under surface there was
usually a coating of lichens on the surface which lay uppermost,
and this, where it existed, was quite as fatal to an examination of
the parts thus concealed as the coating of lime. This, though
somewhat more difficult to remove, yields to a strong alkali
which has no effect upon the underlying structures.
The cleaning of the specimens by both the processes em-
ployed was undertaken as soon as possible after the collection
had been unpacked and I commenced the systematic study of
the trunks almost at once, thoroughly noting and recording the
characters and peculiarities of every specimen and of all parts
of each, and by the end of May, 1899, ■'■ ^^^ completed this
part of the work. I have compiled tables of the characters
and the subdivisions into specific groups has been based mainly
upon such characters. Notwithstanding considerable sameness
among these characters it is possible to classify them, and there
seems no doubt that could their foliage and reproductive organs
be known the cycadean flora of the Jurassic of Wyoming would
be represented by a considerable number of species if not of
genera, although it would be rash to assert that the lines would
be drawn in all cases where we must draw them here.
The most marked feature that struck me on first casual in-
spection of these trunks, aside from their relatively small size,
light color, and soft calcareous structure, was the frequency of
a sort of smooth, to the naked eye, structureless, dull, uniform,
covering: that invests their outer surfaces and cuts off the view
of the normal organs of the armor. A closer examination re-
vealed the fact that this was not an occasional condition, but the
normal state of these cycads, and that the cases in which this
outer coating is wanting represent the abnormal state. It further
became clear that there really are no cases in which it is naturally
