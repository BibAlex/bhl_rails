A SYNOPSIS OF MEXICAN AND CENTRAL AMER-
ICAN UMBELLIFER^E.
By John M. Coulter and J. N. Rose.
The Mexican and Central American Umbelliferse were first
brought together by Mr. W. B. Hemsley in the Biologia Cen-
trali- Americana. The fascicle containing them was published
in 1880, and the Supplement, including some additions, in
1886. This pioneer work was one of great difficulty, and has
been an invaluable assistant to us in the further study of the
Umbelliferai of the region. In that enumeration twenty-five
genera are recognized and seventy-six native species named,
thirty-two of which belong to the genus Eryngium. Four of
these genera are now to be excluded from the Mexican flora,
viz., Carum, Cymoptenis, Eiilo^hus, and Smyrniuin^ leaving
twenty-one of the Hemsley genera that are to be retained.
Since 1886 the following new genera from this region have
been described, the number of species indicated including
those described in the present paper: Coaxana (i species).
Coulter ofhy turn (4 species), Deanea (7 species), Donelhmithia
(i species), Enantioj^hylla (i species), Mtiscmopsis (19 species),
Myrrhidendron (i species), JVeogoezia (3 species), JVeonelsonia
(2 species), Prionosciadmm (15 species), and Rhodosciadium
(3 species). Apiastrufn, Conioselinum^ Mustneon, and Pimpi-
nella have also been found to be members of the Mexican flora ;
and to these should be added Ammoselmuin, Caucalis and Le^-
iocaulis, whose species Hemsley had included under other
