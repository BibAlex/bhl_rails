DEVELOPMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA I97
ing a palatinate under the all but royal rule of Lord Baltimore.
Again I must resist a temptation : the temptation, namely, to
give you a glimpse of the system of manors and hundreds pre-
vailing throughout the Province, and to tell you the very inter-
esting story of the early assemblies of the freemen, their make-
up, proceedings and the rest. It must suffice, however, that I
point out to you the fact that, in the absence of the Lord Pro-
prietary of the Province, the general executive powers were
vested in the Governor or Lieutenant General, while the gen-
eral legislative powers (subject to the approval of the Lord
Proprietary and liable to the disapp4|-oval of the crown), were
vested in the general assembly of the freemen of the Province ;
and quite from the beginning there was a Lord Chief Justice of

these various officials and the Assembly, but as early as the
Session of 1638-9 a system of Government of the Counties was
inaugurated, and in this system began the local government of
the District of Columbia.
For in March of that year, more than two hundred and sixty

less than twenty-eight years ago.
The bill so introduced into the Assembly so many years ago,
and which ultimately became a law, is a perfect illustration of
the way in which all Anglo-Saxon institutions have grown up.
You will recall that in the beginning of the English judicial sys-
tem the King, as the fountain of justice, was the ultimate
judge, and that he first appointed justiciars or justices to aid
him in his judicial work, and then, in the person of that very
greatest of all English monarchs, Henry 11, sent certain per-
sons, constituted justices for that purpose, into the several shires
or counties of England to hold court and administer justice for
him. Similarly, our legal ancestors of Maryland, sitting in
that early assembly at St. Mary in 1638-9, provided that all
