thick and 'jcm long, in vertically compressed specimens circular, 2cm
in diameter.
This species embraces six much flattened specimens, viz., Nos.
500.4, 500.18, 500.22, 500.35, 500.68, and 500.69. Of these Nos.
500.4, 500.18, and 500,35 are nearly complete trunks. No. 500.18
being vertically or somewhat obliquely compressed. All the rest are
laterally compressed. Nos. 500.22, 500.68, and 500.69 may all be-
long to the same trunk, the last two especially resembling each other,
but none of them are contiguous. They all bear a general resemblance
to one or other of the species already described but, aside from their
great compression and small size, not specific characters in themselves,
there are numberless features which forbid their union with any of
these.
The weights are as follows :

CYCADELLA JURASSICA n. sp.
Trunks rather small (io-i5cm high, io-20cm in diameter), very
irregular in shape, more or less compressed in various directions and
distorted, often much branched with several primary axes, sometimes
with secondary axes only, the branches usually terminating in regular
buds; rock substance soft except where excessively mineralized, light
ash colored with dark, sharply contrasting stripes and spots, usually
of low specific gravity ; organs of the armor mostly ascending and ad-
justed to the axes of the branches; phyllotaxy not generally traceable
except in secondary arrangement around certain branches; leaf scars
subrhombic or somewhat elliptical, i5-2omm wide, 8-1 2mm high;
leaf bases dark and affected with white fistular punctations ; walls
2-4mm thick, soft-sandy, white or yellowish, striate, often with a me-
dian groove, depression, or crack ; reproductive organs somewhat rare,
often well-developed, either flush with the surface or raised above it,
elliptical in cross-section, variable in size, i5-3omm in diameter, sur-
rounded by large triangular bract scars, the central portion solid and
marked by the scars of the essential organs; armor 4-6cm thick,
joined to the axis by an uneven, more or less definite line ; wood
2-3cm thick; cortical parenchyma i-2cm thick; fibrous zone i-2cm
