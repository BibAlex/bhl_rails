uted throughout America and perhaps elsewhere.
10. OREOMYRRHIS Endl. Gen. Plant. 787. 1839.
A genus of wide distribution, represented within our range by the
single polymorphic Andean species O. andicola Endl. (cited by
Hemsley as O. andifia). The two new species doubtfully referred
by Hemsley to this genus he has since transferred to his new genus
Neogoezia.
II. NEOGOEZIA Hemsley, Kew Bull. 354. 1894.
Mr. Hemsley founded this genus upon two species that he had ten-
tatively described under Oreomyrrhis^ viz., N. gracilipes and N.
planipetala^ and added a new one, A^. minor. The genus is restricted
to Mexico, so far as known, and there are indications of a fourth
species not yet described.
