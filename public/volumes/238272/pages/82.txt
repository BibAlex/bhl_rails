SQUIRRELS OF MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA lOI
to dingy ferruginous; tail above black, thinly washed with dull yel-
lowish ; below, with broad median area grizzled yellowish brown, in-
distinctly and narrowly bordered with black and thinly edged with
dull yellow. Hairs on back, black with narrow subterminal (some-
times median) ring of rusty yellow.
Variation. — The series at hand shows comparatively little variation.
Four specimens representing the summer pelage (Ma}' lo to Sept. 27)
are rather darker above and dingy ferruginous below. Specimens
in winter pelage (October to May) have more ochraceous backs and
yellower bellies. Apparently there is no seasonal difference in the tail.
Measiirei7ients. — Average of five adults from type locality : total
length 361.4; total vertebrce 169.4; hind foot 51.6.
Cranial characters. — Premolars \. Skull averaging a little smaller
than that of S. hoffmaiini but otherwise very similar. Five adult
skulls from the type locality average: basal length 42.1; palatal
length 22.1 ; interorbital breadth 16.3; zygomatic breadth 30.4 ; length
of upper molar series 8.3.
General remarks. — Sciuriis richmondi bears a general resem-
blance to 6". deppei but is readily recognized by its yellow washed
tail and single premolar. It differs from the still nearer S. cestuans
ho^nianni of Costa Rica by the yellower back and underparts and the
slender, yellow washed tail.
Specimens examined. — Eighteen : all from the type locality.
