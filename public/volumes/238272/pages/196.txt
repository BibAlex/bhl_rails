FOSSIL CYCADEAN TRUNKS FROM WYOMING 257
tock hunting for others that were wholly buried and succeeded
in exhuming two or three more. All the specimens collected
by us were packed up by Mr. Charles Schuchert, who was with
the party and remained after I left, and these were shipped with
his other collections to the National Museum where they now
are. I have not had time to study them or to ascertain whether
they include any additional species to those described in this
paper, but as others are on their way and as there is a prospect
of more extensive excavation and the discovery of many more,
all this may be left for a future paper.
The section of the Freezeout Hills immediately to the east of
the cycad bed and including the ledges formed by the stratum
in which they occur was carefully measured. It is a character-
istic section since it extends from the Red Beds at the bottom of
the valley to the Cretaceous which caps the hill and is supposed
to represent the Dakota group, although such an examination
of it as I was able to make led me to suspect that it is the equiv-
alent of the Lower Cretaceous of the Black Hills, possibly ex-
tending, in some places, to the true Dakota group of Meek and
Hayden.
The following is the section :
Lower Cretaceous capping the hill 50 feet.
Base of Cretaceous to top of cycad bed 100 *'
Thickness of cycad bed ' 10 "
Bottom of cycad bed to top of Marine Jurassic 80 *'
Thickness of Marine Jurassic to bottom of valley on Red
Beds 115 ♦'
Total exposure 355 '•
This section leaves no doubt of the Jurassic age of the cycad
bed and at the same time fixes its position in the fresh water
Jurassic with sufficient exactness for all practical purposes.
LABORATORY PREPARATION.
The collection received from Professor Knight consisted of
83 specimens of cycads and three specimens of silicified wood.
The specimens of cycads bore the numbers 500.1 to 500.83,
and those of the wood 500.85 to 500.87, of the Museum of the
