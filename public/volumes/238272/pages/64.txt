SQUIRRELS OF MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA 79
border and still narrower white edge. Hairs on back, black with a
broad dull buffy or yellowish gray median ring.
Variation. — The ground color of the back varies from grayish
brown with a light suffusion of reddish, to clayey brown with an
overlying wash of shiny black. The rusty suffusion on outside of
legs is strong in some and light in others. An August specimen is
practically the same as others taken in November, thus indicating
little or no seasonal change. One from the Segovia River, Honduras,
is like those from the type locality, except that the underparts are
deeper rufous. Another from the same locality has a brownish shade
in the rufous of underparts, and large irregular pectoral and abdom-
inal white areas connected by a narrow white median line. A third
has the underparts grizzled rusty brown with a large, irregular
median white line. These specimens (June and July) have the
back heavily washed with black and in some respects are intermediate
between typical boothice and belti. A single melanistic specimen
from Nicaragua is the only one seen.
Measurements. — Average of five adults from type locality: total
length t;i3; tail vertebrae 261.6; hind foot 61.7.
Cranial characters. — Premolars \. Skull (pi. H, figs, i and 5)
generally similar to that of S. aureogaster, but rostrum broader and
heavier, anterior end of nasals broader and more flattened, interorbital
width greater, occiput usually broader; the small premolar heavier,
thus resembling S. thofuasi. Four adult skulls from the type locality
average: Basal length 48.8; palatal length 25.5; interorbital breadth
19.6; zygomatic breadth 33.7 ; length of upper molar series 11. 4.
General notes. — This subspecies is named in honor of Thomas
Belt, the well known author of ' A Naturalist in Nicaragua.'
Habits. — Dr. Richmond found these squirrels living in the forests
along the borders of clearings or other openings.
Specimens examined. — Eight: from Escondido River, Nicaragua;
and Segovia River, Honduras.
