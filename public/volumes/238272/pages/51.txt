taro, and near Encarnacion, Hidalgo, Mr. Goldman took specimens
at an altitude of over Sooo feet. The northern part of its range is an
arid tropical region where it occurs mainly in heavy woods along
streams and canyons. Farther south, on the borders of the humid
tropical region, it finds suitable forests more generally distributed ; and
on the mountain slopes it is usually found in areas of heavy tree growth.
Throughout their range these squirrels do considerable damage to
cornfields, and while corn is in the ear it is an easy matter to find
them about the edges of fields cleared in the forest. At other times
they are dispersed, seeking food wherever wild fruits or nuts may be
in season. Their occurrence at an altitude of Sooo feet in Hidalgo
and Qiieretaro is probably due to a migration in search of food, for
this is far above their usual range.
Specimens examitied. — Ninety-eight, from the following localities :
Victoria, Forlon and Alta Mira, Tamaulipas ; Valles, San Luis
