The following is a list of the twenty species of Cycadella in the
order in which they have been described :
1. Cycadella reedii.
2. Cycadella beecheriana.
3. Cycadella wyomingensis.
4. Cycadella knowltoniana.
5. Cycadella compressa.
6. Cycadella jurassica. ,
7. Cycadella nodosa.
8. Cycadella cirrata.
9. Cycadella exogena.
10. Cycadella ramentosa.
1 1 . Cycadella ferruginea.
12. Cycadella contracta.
13. Cycadella gravis.
14. Cycadella verrucosa.
15. Cycadella jejuna.
16. Cycadella concinna.
17. Cycadella crepidaria.
18. Cycadella gelida. ,
19. Cycadella carbonensis.
20. Cycadella knightii.
The order can scarcely be called a classification. There is, how-
ever, something in common in the first twelve, viz., their general light
color and calcareous structure, while the last seven are darker, coarser
grained, and less calcareous. C. gravis and C. verrucosa are inter-
mediate in these respects, but the former differs in its high specific
gravity. These distinctions all relate rather to the mineral than to the
vegetable character, and although there is always some connection
between them as arising out of differences of structure, still it can
scarcely be called a systematic grouping. The strictly botanical char-
acters traverse these more conspicuous ones in such a manner that it is
impossible to arrange the species according to both, and it was con-
sidered more satisfactory upon the whole not to attempt any finer
classification until the internal structure can be studied, which should
be done and promises most interesting results.
