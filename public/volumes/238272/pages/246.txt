Introduction.
Since the publication of the correlation memoir on the Cam-
brian, in 1891/ a number of articles by Mr. G. F. Matthew-
have appeared from time to time advocating the dropping of
the term Middle Cambrian and using the two terms Upper
Cambrian and Lower Cambrian, the Lower Cambrian to in-
clude the Middle Cambrian (Paradoxides beds) and strata
containing the subjacent 'Protolenus' fauna, which was regarded
as the equivalent of the Olenellus fauna. ^ Mr. Matthew was
led to advocate this division of the Cambrian largely by reason
of his failure to find the Olenellus^ fauna in the ' Basal or
iBull. U. S. Geol. Survey, No. 81.
