No. 500.50, 2.55 kilograms.
" 500.55, 1-70
" 500.60, 1.53
" 500.66, 2.33 "
" 500.81, 0.68 "
The large combination, therefore, has a total weight 8. 19 kilograms,
and Nos. 500.50 and 500.60 together weigh 4.08 kilograms.
The specific name is not meant to imply that thei'e is anything ex-
ceptional in the ramentum of this species, although most of the speci-
mens have a well developed outer coating of it, but some of the frac-
tures afford fine examples and the detailed study of the generic
characters has chiefly been made on this species and C. kfioivl-
totiiana.
CYCADELLA FERRUGINEA n. sp.
Trunk small (iScm high, 9x22cm in diameter), ovoid, laterally
compressed, unbranched ; rock hard, rust-colored without, striped and
spotted with the same in the interior, of medium specific gravity ;
organs of the armor horizontal at the middle, descending below and
erect at the summit; leaf scars subelliptical, lomm wide, tjmm high;
leaf bases fine-grained, not porous nor punctate; walls 2-3mm thick,
soft, rust-colored, with a median groove; reproductive organs much
obscured, sometimes raised, elliptical, 15 x20mm in diameter, sur-
rounded by thin obscure involucral bract scars, the central portion
only clearly shown on the fractured surfaces, heterogeneous and much
altered by mineralization ; armor 2-3cm thick, irregularly j(;ined to
the axis; wood icm thick; cortical parenchyma 5mm thick; fibrous
zone 5mm thick, not clearly differentiated into rings, but longitudi-
nally striate, parallel to the axis of the trunk; medulla a thin slab
visible only on the narrow edge where it is icm thick, apparently 4-
5cm wide.
This species includes the two fragments Nos. 500.51 and 500.74,
exactly alike in all their characters and certainly belonging to
the same trunk. The fracture in both cases is longitudinal in the
direction of the minor axis, starting in obliquely near the top and be-
coming vei'tical near the middle. In No. 500.51 this vertical direc-
tion continues to near the base and then runs out on the same side
it went in. In No. 500.74 it describes a sort of curve, cutting in to
near the center and out again at a still sharper angle long before it
reaches the base. The true base and summit are therefore lost in
both specimens. There is one point at which the two pieces proba-
bly are contiguous, though the surface of contact is not large enough
to demonstrate this.
