and with white margin ; upper stem leaves sessile, aurlculate at base,
clasping, gradually smaller upward ; heads in threes, or solitary on the
lateral branches, long peduncled, hemispherical, shorter than the bracts ;
involucre of 9 to 12 rigid, narrow oblong bracts, 6 to 1 3 mm. long,
mostly rounded at apex, very short spinose, mostly with 3 spinose
teeth above the middle, with rarely 2 or 3 additional teeth ; involucels
of subulate incurved bractlets from a broad base, at length rigid, ex-
ceeding the flowers ; calyx-teeth narrow, ovate, subspinose-apiculate ;
carpels about 2 mm. long, covered mostly above the middle with acute
scales; styles elongated, recurved; oil-tubes small, mostly 5, of which
2 are on the commissural side.

1897. Plate III b.
Perennial, apparently stoloniferous, glabrous throughout ; stem
erect, very slender, 2 to 6 dm. high, almost naked, bearing 3 to 5
heads ; leaves thick, somewhat fleshy ; basal and lower ones long-
petioled, oblong or elliptical, without the petiole 3.5 to 4.5 cm. long,
slightly cordate at base, rounded at apex, crenulate and margined,
conspicuously veiny beneath, on a slender petiole 5 to 7-5 cm. long;
upper leaves few, sessile, narrower, half-clasping ; heads mostly 3 to 5,
subglobose, 6 to 8 mm. in diameter, on slender peduncles, lateral
peduncles bibracteate near the middle, terminal peduncles naked ; in-
volucre of 7 to 10 (mostly 9) thick, rigid, oblong-lanceolate bracts 4
to 8 mm. long, subacute, entire or very rarely bidenticulate, at length
reflexed, blue ; involucels of scarious bractlets, abruptly subulate-
acuminate from a broad base, curved, exceeding the flowers ; flowers
few, blue; calyx-teeth lanceolate, scarious, apiculate, scarcely I'igid,
as long as the carpels ; carpels semiovoid, without the calyx-teeth about
I mm. long, with very few scales; styles divaricate, exceeding the
calyx-teeth; oil-tubes very small, 5, of which 3 are on the commis-
sural side.
