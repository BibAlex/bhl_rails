date December loth of that year there should be erected out of
Prince George county a new county named in honor of Prince
Frederick, son of George II, and " beginning at the lower side
of the mouth of Rock creek and thence by a straight line join-
ing to the east side of Seth Hyatt's plantation to the Patuxent
river." This new county embraced part of the present county
and original City of Washington and all that part of the present
City of Washington formerly known in law, and still colloquially
known as Georgetown ; the remainder of the present District
continuing in Prince George county.
On September 6, 1776, the Revolutionary, or Provincial, Con-

side of Rock Cr^ek and running thence with the Potomac River
to the mouth of the Monocacy, thence to Par spring and thence
with the line of the original Frederick county to the place of
beginning. This, it is seen, threw Georgetown and part of the
remainder of the present District into the new county of Mont-
gomery, and thus, at the time of the creation of the District of
Columbia the Maryland portion, that is to say all of the present
District, comprised parts of Prince George and Montgomery
counties.
The interest of this seemingly unnecessary detail lies in the
fact that the beginnings of the local government of the Dis-
trict were in these respective counties, and the political devel-
opment of the District starts with the institutions in existence
"therein. I regret that time forbids my giving you a complete
picture of a Maryland county government in those early days,
but I must forego the temptation to do so. I must, however,
ask attention to some features of that government, for the reason
that those features survived in the District until within a very
few years, as we shall presently see.
Maryland, as we all know, was settled in March, 1634, upon
the landing of the first emigrants at St. Mary. Those emi-
grants brought with them the principles of law and government
of the mother country and the charter of Maryland establish-
