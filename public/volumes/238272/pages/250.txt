LOWER CAMBRIAN TERRANE 307
Cambrian, and corresponds in stratigraphic position to
the St. John quartzite of the New Brunswick Cambrian.
One observes no difference, in either strike or dip, between
the shales beneath this band of nodular limestone and
conglomerate and the shales above it until one passes to
the east of the faidt-line that cuts through and breaks
the band a few feet above the water's edge.

2a. Reddish-purple argillaceous shale with'greenish shales in
bands at irregular intervals and a massive band of
greenish shale near the base 284
Dip near base 20° to 23° W.
At no feet from the summit fragments of a'large undeter-
mined trilobite were noted. On the south side'of Smith
Sound, at Britannia Cove, Olenellus (H.) broggeri oz-
curs at a horizon corresponding to 140 feet below the
summit of the stratum.
Near the base of 2a the following fossils were found :
Obolella atlantica
Hyolithes sp.
Orthotheca sp.
Microdiscus sp. undet.
Olenellus (^Holmia~) broggeri
Solenopleiira? bombifrons?

2b. Greenish-colored arenaceous limestone, passing into an
intraformational conglomerate formed of nodules of
pinkish limestone mixed with fine sand and carrying
numbers of fragments of trilobites 16
Pinkish-colored nodular limestones 8
Fossils : Fragments of trilobites and a small brachiopod.
