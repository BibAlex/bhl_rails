to about 4700 and in 1850 to 3687 and in i860, as stated, to
3185. As a war measure, President Lincoln issued his proc-
lamation of emancipation January i, 1863, but prior thereto
and after much discussion, slavery was abolished in the Dis-
trict of Columbia, April 16, 1862, under an act approved that
day. This act appropriated $1,000,000 for the compensation
of the owners of slaves. Under this law 3100 slaves were
emancipated and their owners received $993,406 as compensa-
tion for them. With this double action the negroes of the sur-
rounding country of Maryland and Virginia, flocked to Washing-
ton, so that the census of 1870 showed a total population of 131,-
700, an increase of 56,620, or 75.41 percent, a most remarkable
increase; of the total 88,278 were white and 43,422 colored.
Contrast this with the colored population ten years before, when it
was only 14,317. Here then, was an increase between i860 and
1870 of only 27,515 white persons, or 45.28 percent, and an
increase of 29,105 colored, or 203.29 percent. During the
decade from 1870 to 1880, the white population increased 29,728,
or -33.68 percent and the colored only 16,196, or 37.30 per
cent, as against 203.29 percent in the previous decade. From
1880 to 1890, when the population of the District was 230,392
and the total increase 52,768, or 29.71 percent, the white
population increased 36,689, or 31.09 percent and the colored
population 16,079, ^^ 26.97 percent.
With these facts in view, it is also interesting to learn the
proportions of the white and colored of the total population at
different periods, and in this, strangely enough, it is found that
the proportion varies very little- In 1800 the colored constituted
28.57 percent of the whole population, and in 1810, 33.07 per-
cent. This proportion has never been exceeded, except at one
census, that of 1880, when it was 33.56 percent. The per-
cent was lowest in i860 when it was 19.07. To make a gen-
eral statement, therefore, and looking at the percentages at the
different censuses it is seen that the colored population has
varied around one-third of the whole, where it now stands.
Sometimes it has been a little below and sometimes a very little
above, but at the present time it is perfectly safe to say that the
colored population constitutes one-third of the total population
of the District of Columbia.
