tain. It is the constitution of the District, and its grants of
power are to be taken as new and independent grants, and ex-
pressing in themselves both their extent and limitations. Such
was the view taken by the court below : and such we believe is
the true view to be taken of the statute.
The last act in what may be termed the unification of the
District was the passage by Congress of the law of February
II, 1895 (28 Stats. 650), abolishing the city of Georgetown
and its name, repealing all of its general laws, regulations and
ordinances, and extending to it all general laws, regulations
and ordinances of the city of Washington. And by an agency
more effective than the most solemn statute, namely, the usage
of the people, the further result has been accomplished that to
all practical intents and purposes, and in the eyes of the nation
at large, the entire District now passes by the name of the
Father of our Country, originally given to our city, but which,
like the illustrious character from whom it was taken, has drawn
to itself its whole environment.
And the political development of the District of Columbia
suggests to me the plan of this beautiful city of ours, not built
upon an uninviting plain and not laid out in exclusively right
lines, but set in an environment of rare attractiveness ; with
its system of wide streets overlaid by intersecting avenues
which break the otherwise mathematical stiffness of its thor-
oughfares, and set with beautifying and refreshing parks un-
rivaled by any intra-urban park system of the world. So
with our political growth and development : begmning with
the simple institution of the Lev}'^ Court, taking up as occasion
required the forms of municipal government felt to be adapted
to the situation from time to time, and finally taking the form of
a wisely-conceived and skillfully-constructed scheme of local
government, and yet all the while under the play of the essen-
tially American distinction between the National and local
systems. While on every hand we find statutory provisions,
with their artificiality of conception and rigidness of expression,
we yet meet at every point the freer action of those natural and
more elastic elements of usage, tradition and fundamental prin-
ciple which are at the bottom of all things English and out of
which only all true law and political development spring and
