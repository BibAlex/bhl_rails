FOSSIL CYCADEAN TRUNKS FROM WYOMING 267
500.26 may be a lower segment of the same trunk, but if so it must
have been contracted at the base, as is the case with No. 500.3. Nos.
500. 8 and 500.67 fit each other and the former, which was shattered
when received, has come in three pieces. It represents a section be-
tween two oblique but chiefly vertical fractures. No. 500.52, a thick
somewhat cubical piece, almost certainly belongs to No. 500.8 as
shown by the identical structure of its principal fracture.
The weights of the specimens are as follows :

In PI. XVII, which is a side view of No. 500.14, the distinction
between the parts covered with the ramentaceous cortex on the right
and those from which this has peeled off on the left, with the exposed
edge of this layer, are clearly brought out.
CYCADELLA KNOWLTONIANA n. sp.
Pis. XVIII, XIX and XX.
Trunks of medium size (25cm in diameter), cylindrical, bearing a
few small secondary axes ; rock soft, light colored without, dark and
variegated within ; organs of the armor horizontal ; leaf scars sub-
rhombic, 8-1 2mm wide, 4-6mm high; leaf bases relatively dark,
punctate with minute, white-walled tubes ; walls thick, sometimes
5mm, soft, white on their outer edges, brown within as shown on the
fractures, contrasting strongly with the nearly black leaf bases, the
ramentaceous hairs very distinct, showing their mode of origin in the
petioles and their passage from the armor into the outer coating which
they form, to a thickness in places of nearly 2cm ; reproductive organs
few but distinct, usually raised, 16 x25mm in diameter, surrounded
by two or more rows of narrow involucral bract scars, the bracts dis-
tinctly traceable in longitudinal section to their origin in the receptacle
from which also proceed the essential organs in an advanced stage of
decay and mineralization ; armor 3-4cm thick, joined to the axis by
a very irregular but somewhat definite line, the petioles emerging from
different depths as projections of the wood substance ; wood 2-3cm
thick, very imperfectly differentiated into two zones, the inner wall,
