named species are A. seatoni C. & R., A. fielsoni C. & R., and
probably A. polycarpa C. & R. The fourth Arigelica of the flora is
A, fringlei C. & R.
Angelica polycarpa C. &. R., sp. nov.
Nearest A. pringlei C. & R., but a stouter plant; leaves much
coarser, somewhat pubescent, 6 dm. long including the very long pet-
iole, twice or thrice ternate ; leaflets 5 to 7.5 cm. long; rays more
numerous (about 40), very unequal, 5 to 7 cm. long; fruit larger, 4 to
5 mm. long, with lateral wings thinner and broader (2 mm.), the
dorsal and intermediates more prominent especially at base.

32. PRIONOSCIADIUMWatson, Proc. Am.Acad.23: 275. 1888.
This endemic genus was established by Watson in 1888, and in-
cluded three species, P. tnadrense^ P. f}texicana, and P. prmglei.
Recent collections have remarkably increased it, no less than twelve
additional species being described, and with indications of still others.
The genus is justified not only by these additional species, but also by
the fact that the earlier known forms were variously referred to such
dissimilar genera as Angelica, Peucedamim, and Ciczita.
As at present understood it contains the following species.
Synopsis of Specific Groups.
