grow. While we find everywhere minute regard for the local,
as in the case of the Levy Court and the simple forms of
municipal government of the cities, we are everywhere also
brought face to face with the National, as in the original Com-
missioners of the city, the Superintendent of the City, the Com-
missioner of Public Buildings, the Chief of Engineers of the
Army, the Metropolitan Police and the Board of Public Works.
And, strangest of all, at the very heart of a nation grounded in
the notion of " government of the people, by the people and for
the people," we see from the beginning the almost aggressive
expression of distrust of the popular vote, the absence of which
has so often been remarked as the most striking feature of the
government of the Capital. Thus always the Levy Court was

and orderly beyond all other cities ; rich in wealth and richer
still in intelligence : the very Mecca of the patriotism and intel-

our land and the depository of its priceless archives and scientific
and literary collections, which are at once the possession and the
pride of the people of the whole nation ; in a word, truly the City
of Washington : Washington, who has been aptly characterized
as " the greatest of good men and the best of great men," and of
whom the soundest of English historians, John Richard Green,
has truly said that " no nobler figure ever stood in the forefront
