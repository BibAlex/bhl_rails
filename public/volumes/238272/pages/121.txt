146 COULTER AND ROSE
25. BERULA Hoff. in Bess, fenum. PL Volh. 44. 1S22.
A genus of one or two species, which are said to be of nearly world-
wide distribution. Our single species, Â£. erecta^ was cited by Hems-
ley as Slum angustifolium L.
Berula erecta (Huds.) Coville, Contr. Nat. Herb. 4: 115. 1893.
Berula angustifolia Mert. & Koch, in Roehl. Deutschl. Fl. 2: 433. 1826.
Sium erechmi Huds. Fl. Angl. 103. 1862.
State of Mexico: Lago de Chalco, Alta?nira?io 17, June 1891.
Chiapas: above San Cristobal, altitude 2100-2640 meters, Nelson
3132, September 18-22, 1895.
26. CENANTHE L. Sp. PI. i : 254. 1753.
A genus of wide distribution with a single Mexican species. Hems-
ley reported it in the Mexican flora to include a single unnamed spe-
cies which later he discovered to be an Arracacia. It is restored to
the Mexican flora, however, by the discovery of CE. pringlei C. & R.
27. LIL^^OPSIS Greene, Pittonia 2 : 192. 1891.
A genus represented in the United States by four species, one of
which extends into Mexico and South America. This species, L.
schaffneriana C. & R. (^Cra?ttzia scha^neriana Schlecht.), Hemsley
referred to the common United States species of the Atlantic seaboard,
L. lineata Greene ( Crantzia lineata Nutt.). The genus is also rep-
resented in Brazil and Australia.
Lilaeopsis schaffneriana (Schlecht.) C. & R. Bot. Gaz. 24: 48. 1897.
Crantzia sckaffnct'iana Schlecht. Linnaea 26: 370. 1853.
Federal District: near Chapultapec (type locality), Rose & Hough
4545. June 11, 1899.
Jalisco: Orendain, Rose & Hough 4799, July 5-6, 1899.
28. LIGUSTICUM L. Sp. PI. 1 : 250. 1753.
A genus widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere, and
represented in Mexico by two species. The only species included by
Hemsley, L. dubium H.B.K., is to be excluded, as it is not a Ligusti-
cum^ although on account of the disappeai'ance of the type it is difficult
to determine its exact place. Specimens collected by Rose (no. 4450,
June I, 1899) near the type locality, and satisfying the description,
belong clearly to Prionosciadium . The genus is represented in Mex-
ico, therefore, only by the two new species described below.
Ligusticum goldmani C. & R., sp. nov.
Resembling L. nelsoni C. & R., but differing in its less sharply cut
