308 WALCOTT
This is one of the most important horizons in the Lower
Cambrian of Newfoundland (Smith Point limestone).
It is very persistent about Trinity Bay, and it occurs,
although much thinner, at various exposures in Concep-
tion, St. Marys and Placentia Bays, The upper 24 feet
at Smith Point is practically solid limestone layers.
The lower layer of limestone, i foot in thickness, is
separated by 2 feet of reddish shale in which 3 inches
of limestone occurs.
Fossils :
In the upper 6 inches of the top layer of limestone nu-
merous fragments of Ohnelhis {/I.) 6 ro£-£-eri and So-
lefwpleura ? occur. About 3 feet below this, in the next
bed of limestone, immense numbers of Hyolithes friftceps
are found in association with the fauna that marks this
limestone band wherever it is found. The following
species were collected in a few hours :
Iphidea labradorica {Kuto7-glna granulatayi.^
FordiUa troyensis
Scenella retictdata f
Randomia aurorce
Hele?iia bella
Orthotheca pitgeo
Hyolithes princeps
Coleoloides typicalis

Feet.
26. Green argillaceous shale 23
2f. Massive stratum of nodular limestone, divided into 18
inches of a pinkish limestone, and 3 feet of purple to a
pink, mixed with purple argillaceous shale 414
Fossils :
Coleoloides typicalis.
2g. Green argillaceous shale in massive bands, with numerous
small pinkish limestone nodules scattered irregularly on
the line of bedding. At 51 feet from the base the lime-
stone nodules increase in number and size, and form the
greater part of a layer 2 feet in thickness. Above this
the reddish-purple and green shales occur in bands vary-
ing in thickness 62
Fossils :
Hyolithes rugosus Matt. ?
Coleoloides
Urotheca pervetus Matt.
Crustacean, n. g., n. sp.
