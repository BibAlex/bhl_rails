FOSSIL CYCADEAN TRUNKS FROM WYOMING 277
No. 500,51 weighs 1.36 and No. 500.74, 0.81 kilograms, total 2.17
kilograms.
Named from the ferruginous or rusty color peculiar to these speci-
mens.
CYCADELLA CONTRACTA n. sp.
Trunks of small or medium size (height not known, 15— 25cm in
diameter), probably conical above, strongly contracted at the base,
laterally compressed, more or less branched; rock hard and fine-
grained, of a nearly uniform drab color or dull reddish on the outer
surface, of medium specific gravity; organs of the armor ascending
at their origin, curving outward and becoming horizontal or declined;
rows of scars (traceable in one specimen) from left to right forming
an angle of 40° with the axis, those from right to left 55°; leaf scars
subrhombic, i2-2omm wide, 6-1 2mm high: leaf bases of uniform
color, punctate with white tubular pores; walls i-3mm thick, rather
soft, depressed, striate, with a median line or crack; reproductive or-
gans imperfectly developed, somewhat raised, 15 x 22mm in diameter,
surrounded by large bract scars passing into leaf scars, central por-
tion solid, roughened, warty; armor about 3cm thick; wood i-3cm
thick, differentiated in one specimen, the outer zone 5nim thick, the
inner icm, longitudinally striate; medulla i5-3omm in diameter, hard,
fine-grained, and homogeneous.
The specimens constituting this species are Nos. 500.56, 500.57,
500.58 and 500. 79- With the exception of the last their general re-
semblance is obvious, which probably accounts for the contiguity in
the numbers. No. 500.79 is probably a thin segment from much
higher on the same trunk as No. 500.56, where the size and shape had
considerably changed, but the same structui-e persists. Nos. 500.57
and 500.58 are portions of the lower end of two different trunks.
The weights of the several fragments in the order of the numbers
are as follows :
No. 500.56, 1. 13 kilograms.
" 500-57. 1-25
" 500.58, 1.92 "
" 500.79, 0.76. "
The specific name refers to the contracted base.
CYCADELLA GRAVIS n. sp.
Trunk small (12cm high, Sx 13cm in diameter), conical-flattened,
rounded at the summit, laterally compressed, unbranched ; rock very
hard, coarse-grained, of a gray color and very high specific gravity;
