MEXICAN AND CENTRAL AMERICAN UMBELLIFER^ 1 27
Neogoezia planipetala Hemsl. Kew Bull. 1894: 335. 1894.
Tepic : summit of Sierra Madre near Santa Teresa, Rose 2107,
3745' August 8-13, 1897.
Durango : in tlie high mountains, Rose, August 16, 1897.
Zacatecas: in the high mountains, Rose, August iS, 1897.
These specimens have been referred by Mr. Hemsley to JV. plani-
petala, a species collected but once and then not in fruit. The plants
collected by Dr. Rose differ strikingly from JV. planipetala in size
and shape of the bracts as described and figured. They represent a
species common on both ranges of the Sierra Madre in the states
cited above, at an elevation of 1500-2400 meters, and on the slopes
and summits of the mountains. The flowering scapes are about 5 dm.
high ; leaves 10 to 20 cm. long, with somewhat bipinnatifid segments ;
involucral bracts 12 to 20 mm. long, 3 to 7-toothed or laciniate near
the tip (perhaps sometimes entire) ; pedicels slender, 8 to 12 mm.
long; flowers white, with prominent sepals; fruit 4 mm. long.
The type locality of JV. planipetala is given as ' Bolanos,' in Ja-
lisco. Of course Hartweg did not get it exactly at Bolanos, as this
village is in a hot tropical valley, at an altitude of but 840 meters. It
may have come from the mountains to the west, although Dr. Rose
found no specimens of this genus in these mountains, his specimens
coming from mountains one hundred miles to the north.
12. APIASTRUM Nuttall in Torr. & Gr. FI. i : 643. 1840.
A North American genus of two species, the following being found
in Lower California and its neighboring islands.
Apiastrum angustifolium Nutt. 1. c.
Cedros Island: Pal?}ier 679, in 1889; Anthony 310, in 1897.
Lower California: San Qiiintin, Pahner 6/i^2)i '^^ 1889.
13. NEONELSONIA C. & R. Contr. Nat. Herb. 3: 306. 1895.
A genus of two species, the type species being Guatemalan; the
other, heretofore referred to Arracacia, as seen below, is South
American. The genus, therefore, stands as follows :
I. Neonelsonia acuminata (Benth.) in Engler & Prantl, Nat. Pflanz-
fam. 3^: 167. 1898.
Arracacia aciiminata Benth. PI. Hartw. 187. 1845.
South America : Qiiitensian Andes near Pichincha, altitude 3600-
3780 meters, J. P. Couthony,\r\ 1855 (in herb. Gray); New
Granada, Purdie (in Ball collection).
