The members of the committee appointed by the Joint Com-
mission to draft a constitution for the Academy were chosen as
incorporators, and a committee was appointed to make nomina-
tions for the immediate enlargement of the membership.
The act of incorporation was executed February iSth at the
office of the United States Geological Survey, and the incorpo-
rators met again on the 5th of March for the purpose of giving
legal status to the by-laws, membership and officers. Under
the laws of the District of Columbia the Academy technically
began its existence with the act of incorporation, and the incor-
porators were then its original and only members. The incor-
porators, therefore, as a matter of form, adopted the by-laws,
elected to membership the seventy-five chosen by the Joint Com-
mission as a nucleus, and elected the officers chosen at the
preliminary meeting.
At a meeting of the Academy held March 17th Vice-Presi-
dents were elected on nomination of the several societies as
follows :
J^or the Anthropological Society, J. W. Powell.
For the Biological, L. O. Howard.
For the Chemical^ H. N. Stokes.
