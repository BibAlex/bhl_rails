DEVELOPMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 1 73
ing to the last census, that of 1890, the manufactures reached
the handsome sum of ;^39j33 15437- This latter statement under
analysis indicates a peculiar state of affairs. There were 2295
manufacturing establishments reported, with an aggregate
capital of $28,865,089. These establishments employed, on
the average, over 23,000 persons, to whom was paid in wages
$14,622,264. The analysis shows further that but very little of
the manufactured product was sent out of the city of Washing-
ton. Among the largest items are to be found the products of
bakeries, the building of carriages and wagons, clothing, en-
graving, flour and grist mills, painting and papering, plumbing
and gasfitting, printing and publishing, each of these industries
producing more than a million dollars worth of goods or work.
An examination of the list in detail shows that the goods made
by the manufacturers of Washington are practically consumed
by its inhabitants.
If we turn to the wealth of the city the most satisfactor}'^ re-
sults are observed. Taking the true valuation of real and per-
sonal property, that is, the market value and not the value for
purposes of assessment, it is found that in 1850 the total amounted
to over $14,000,000, being $271 per capita, while the per capita
for the United States at large was $308. Eighteen sixty showed
a vast increase, owing, first, to lack of completeness in the sta-
tistics of 1850, and, second, to the real progress of the town, to
over $41,000,000, the per capita rising to $547, more than that
for the United States taken as a whole, when it was ^514; the
per capita wealth of the District has kept in advance of that of
the whole country since that period. In 1870 the total valuation
was nearly $127,000,000, or $963 per capita, as against $780
for the United States at large. In 1880 it was $220,000,000, or
$1239 per capita, as against $870 for the United States. In
1890 it was over $343,500,000, or nearly $1500 per capita, as
against $1036 for the United States. It is to be regretted that
the per capita wealth of different cities cannot be brought into
comparison with that of Washington.
These figures must not be considered as accurately represent-
ing the wealth of the District of Columbia, but only as indicating
it, and yet for 1890 I am inclined to the opinion that the figures
