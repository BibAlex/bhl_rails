FOSSIL CYCADEAN TRUNKS FROM WYOMING 273
on the weathered surfaces, dark within with w^hite stripes, of medium
specific gravity; organs of the armor ascending, especially above the
middle, towards the summit, as seen on the fractured surfaces, curving
first upward and then gracefully outward in continuation of the clearly
marked strands from the interior of the axis ; leaf scars subelliptical or
subrhombic, 1 2-1 5mm wide, 5— 6mm high; leaf bases hard, dark
and porous; walls 3-5mm thick, hard and smooth, light colored or
nearly white; reproductive organs few and obscure; armor 3-5cm
thick, irregularly joined to the axis ; woody zone 2cm thick, undif-
ferentiated, medulla 2-3cm in diameter, black, striped and blotched
with white flinty patches.
This species includes the specimens numbered 500.42, 500.46,
500.59, 500.71, and 500.75, but they all probably belong to the same
trunk. No. 500.46 matches No. 500.42 and No. 500.75 matches No.
500.46 by a narrow facet, with the loss of intervening chips. No.
500.71 has exactly the same markings as No. 500.42 on the side op-
posite No. 500.46. These markings are too definite and peculiar to
recur, and amount to a proof of identity, although a thin plate between
has disappeared. No. 500.59 is evidently the downward continuation
of No. 500.42. On one side there is almost complete continuity, but
a large triangular piece is wanting on the other side.
The weights of the pieces are as follows :
No. 500.42, 1.53 kilograms.
" 500.46, 0.57
" 500.59, I. II "
" 500.71, 0.28 "
'' 500-75' 0-70
After all are put together we still probably have less than half the
original trunk.
CYCADELLA EXOGENA n. sp.
Trunks small or of medium size (i2-2ocm high, 8-2ocm in diam-
eter), ellipsoidal, somewhat compressed laterally or (in one specimen)
vertically, unbranched ; rock hard and fine-grained, light colored on
the weathered surfaces, dark within, variegated with brown or white
stripes or spots, of medium specific gravity ; organs of the armor hori-
zontal ; rows of scars making an angle of 50° with the axis in both
directions (traceable only in one specimen) ; leaf scars subrhombic,
i2-2omm wide, 6-9mm high; leaf bases hard, fine in structure, punc-
tate or porous; walls i-3mm thick, soft-sandy, and more or less de-
cayed, light colored, sunken between the leaf bases, striate or wrinkled,
sometimes with a median line or commissure; reproductive organs
