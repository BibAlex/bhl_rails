INTRODUCTION.
The arboreal squirrels inhabiting the region between the
southern border of the United States and the Isthmus of Pan-
ama have been studied by several authors, notably J. E. Gray,
E. R. Alston and J. A. Allen. The material at the disposal of
these revisers was of the most fragmentary character, often
without definite localities and in poor condition, hence it is
hardly surprising that their conclusions are unsatisfactory.
During the past few years the quantity of material has been
greatly increased and its quality much improved. Mr. G. K.

W. Richmond in Nicaragua ; Mr. A. Forrer, the Lumhollz Ex-
