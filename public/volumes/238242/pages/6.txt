NOTES ON A COLLECTION OF BIRDS
FROM SURINAM
Philip S. Humphrey and Rudolf Freund
During the period November 18 to December IT, 1961, Mr.
and Mrs. Rudolf Freund traveled in Surinam and made small
collections of vertebrates and insects for the Yale Peabody Mu-
seum of Natural History. They collected birds at three locali-
ties in southern Surinam. One of these localities (Kayserge-
bergte Airstrip) had been visited in October of the same year by
Mr. Harry A. Beatty who collected birds there for the Chicago
Museum of Natural History (Blake, 1961). To our knowledge
no previous collections of birds have been made at the two
other localities visited by the Freunds (Sipaliwini Airstrip and
Paru Savannah).
The Freunds collected a total of 117 birds which they pre-
served in 10 per cent buffered Formalin. When the specimens
arrived at the Peabody Museum they were washed in water and
then stored in 70 per cent alcohol. All specimens were dried
with a jet of compressed air and then identified; 32 specimens
were prepared as study skins by Mr. David H. Parsons.

The Freunds' trip to the interior of Surinam would have
been impossible without the generous assistance of the govern-
