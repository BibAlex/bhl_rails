continuation of prosperity and usefulness for it.

Ateneo Veneto.
Venezia, li 23 February, 1912.
Honoured Sir:
The Ateneo Veneto gratefully accepts the kind invitation of The Academy
of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, but, being unable to send a special deputy to
the celebration of your centenary festivities, we beg your illustrious President
to represent our Academy.
A hundred years have lately elapsed since the foundation of the Ateneo
Veneto that has always been faithful to its scientific, artistic, and patriotic
programme, and it very gladly hails the Hundredth Anniversary of its sister
Academy, with hearty wishes for an ever prosperous, active, and fruitful life, like
that to which your acts (records) of these hundred years are witness.
With sincere congratulations and best respects,
The President,
Filippo Nani Mocenigo.
To the Secretary of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
