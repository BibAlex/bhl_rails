PROCEEDINGS OF THE CENTENARY MEETING. cxxvii
University of Notre Dame.
Notre Dame, Indiana, June 1, 1912.
To the Secretary of The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
Sir: The Centenary of The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia
offers an appropriate and most welcome occasion to express the admiration
which the University of Notre Dame has always entertained for the work of that
distinguished body. The history of its activities during the hundred years of
its existence shows its connection with so many of the great achievements and
its services to individuals and causes have been so great and so many that the
story of the Academy must have an important place in any history of scientific
development in the nineteenth century.
Its work has been done unselfishly and in a spirit of high devotion to the
advancement of learning and the profit of humanity. For this reason the world
of learning acclaims it in its centenary year and wishes it continued power in its
beneficent mission.
The University of Notre Dame feels it an honor to associate itself with the
great schools that pay tribute to this venerable Academy.
Very truly yours,
John Cavanaugh, C.S.C.,
President.
