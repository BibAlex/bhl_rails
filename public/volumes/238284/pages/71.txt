Northwestern University offers congratulations to The Academy of Natural
Sciences of Philadelphia on the arrival of its One Hundredth Anniversary, and
takes pleasure in paying a tribute to its helpful and uplifting influence on the
progress of the natural sciences.
Through its museum exhibits and public lectures, as well as through the
personal influence of its distinguished members, the Academy has promoted a
widespread interest in the natural sciences. At the same time, it has stimulated
research by providing means of publication for many notable scientific investi-
gations that have been produced by its members and correspondents.
This activity establishes between the Academy and the Universities a bond
of sympathy, based on similarity of aims and purposes in promoting the spread
of education among the people, and in offering encouragement to gifted investi-
gators.
In recognition of this high service to the cause of scientific learning, North-
western University not only offers felicitations for past achievements, but also
wishes for The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia continued prosperity
and success in the prosecution of its noble work.
