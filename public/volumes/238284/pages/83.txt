K. Svenska Vetenskapsakademien.
To The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia:
On the occasion of your esteemed Academy celebrating the One Hundredth
Anniversary of her existence, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences desires to
join the various other scientific societies both in the New World and the Old,
who just now direct their congratulation to you.
The connection of scientific interests which exists between your country and
our own dates back into the past. Peter Kalm, a pupil of the great Linnaeus and
a member of our Academy, devoted his researches to the virgin fields, which the
people of the United States have converted into one of the world's richest civilized
countries. Our published transactions and our archives contain many contri-
butions giving us information concerning the natural productions and conditions
of America. Among the thousands of emigrants which our country send you,
not a few have made themselves known as scientific students and have thus in
their adopted country done credit to the education they have received in the
homeland.
The work of American scientists has, here in Sweden, always been studied
and appreciated, and has had a most beneficial effect on Swedish scientific work.
For the part your Academy has taken in our efforts we, therefore, desire to
express our gratitude, and to wish you continued success in the great field of
natural science from which modern culture has reaped such rich harvests.
