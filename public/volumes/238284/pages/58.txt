PROCEEDINGS OF THE CENTENARY MEETING. lxvii
The Carnegie Museum (Department of the Carnegie Institute).
Pittsburgh, March 19, 1912.
To The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia:
On behalf of the Carnegie Museum, which represents at the headwaters of
the Ohio the same forms of activity which are represented by The Academy of
Natural Sciences upon the banks of the Delaware, we have the honor of extending
our sincere congratulations upon your first Centenary, and we desire to express
the hope that many centenaries, as fruitful as has been the first, may follow.
We have with pride caused to be carved upon our walls, where all can read it,
the name of your own honored and immortal Leidy, for whose achievements we
are no less grateful than you.
Geo. H. Clapp,
Chairman of the Committee of the Institute upon the Affairs of the Museum,
W. J. Holland,
Director.
Beautifully engrossed.

Office of the Rector,
The Catholic University of America, Washington, D. C.
The Catholic University of America sends its heartiest congratulations to
The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia on the occasion of the cele-
bration of its first Centenary. The foundation of the Academy is probably
the most important event in the history of American science, since it marks
the initial steps in the path of intellectual and material development that has
kept ever broadening until it has become one of the world's splendid highways of
progress and culture. We are certain that in the century to come the Academy
will continue its noble work of inspiration and encouragement in the vast province
of the natural sciences; above all that it will help materially to keep them corre-
lated to all that is truly beautiful and uplifting in the social, political, and religious
life of our American mankind.
With best wishes, I remain,
Very sincerely yours,
Thomas J. Shahan,
Rector.
The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
