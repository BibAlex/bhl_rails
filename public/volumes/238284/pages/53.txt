The American Microscopical Society, in common with other similar societies
the world over, rejoices in the century of honorable and useful activity of The
Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and extends to you its greetings
and congratulations on the completion of one hundred years of productive
effort. We confidently hope that the century upon which you are now entering

To the President and Board of Trustees of The Academy of Natural Sciences of
Philadelphia, Greeting:
The President and Board of Trustees of The American Museum of Natural
History, through their delegate, Doctor Frederic A. Lucas, desire to tender to
The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, their congratulations on the
completion of a century of active and earnest work.
In this, the New World, few institutions can claim so long a career as yours,
few are so important, none can number among its members a more brilliant
galaxy of men of science than that which includes the names of Morton, Wistar,
Leidy, and Cope.
May the progress of the Academy be ever upwards, may its career be as
prosperous, as vigorous in the future as in the past; may it ever stand, as it has
done for an hundred years, for all that is best in the cause of science in America.
Henry Fairfield Osborn,
President.
Archer M. Huntington,
Secretary.
New York City, March the eighteenth, 1912.
