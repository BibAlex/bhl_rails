cxxx PROCEEDINGS OF THE CENTENARY MEETING.
C. K. Universytet imienia cesarza Franciszka i Lemberg.
The Rector and the Senate of the Universytet imienia cesarza Franciszka I
in Lemberg have the honor hereby to transmit their sincere congratulations and
the expressions of highest esteem and respectful friendship to The Academy of
Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, on the day when the Academy is celebrating
the joyful event of its Centenary Anniversary.
The University of Lemberg is one of the only two surviving Polish universities,
while the places of learning in other parts of Poland have been destroyed by
foreign tyrannic force and oppression.
The University sympathizes deeply with the Academy, as one of the most
ancient and most renowned scientific institutions of the New World, not only
because of the common bond of affinity, uniting the learned societies and insti-
tutions of all countries and all nations, but also because the Academy is a repre-
sentative of the Country of Freedom.
May the Academy continue the scientific work which has made famous its
name all over the world, and may Science contribute towards raising of mankind
from tyrannic barbarism to real humanity.
Lemberg, March 10th, 1912.
L. FlNKEL,
