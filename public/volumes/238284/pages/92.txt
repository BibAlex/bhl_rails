PROCEEDINGS OF THE CENTENARY MEETING. cxxix
University of Virginia.
University of Virginia, March 12, 1912.
The President and Faculty of the University of Virginia desire to present to
The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia their hearty congratulations
on the completion of a century of scientific activity and achievement. Founded
at a time when the study of nature in this country was followed by but few
students, and organized societies for the advancement of such study were in
existence at but two or three widely separated points, the Academy has held an
honorable place and has contributed largely to the results of scientific research in
America. May the second century of its existence be marked by as vigorous
and fruitful life as that which closes so auspiciously.
Edwin A. Alderman,
President.
