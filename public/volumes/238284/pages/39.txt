xlii PROCEEDINGS OF THE CENTENARY MEETING.
Dr. Conklin:
Now, gentlemen, we have come to the close of the first century of the
Academy. Some of you may think we have got further but we are only enter-
ing upon the second century, and I propose that we all rise and drink to the
continued growth and glory of The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
The toast was drunk standing and with the singing of Auld Lang Syne the
company adjourned at 11.45 P. M.
