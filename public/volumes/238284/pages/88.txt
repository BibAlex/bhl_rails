University of Cincinnati.
Office of the President.
The President and Faculties of the University of Cincinnati acknowledge,
with much appreciation, the invitation to be represented at the celebration of
the One hundredth Anniversary of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Phila-
delphia. They regret that it is not possible to send a delegate to convey to the
members of the Academy their hearty congratulations upon the completion of
one hundred years of noble service, and their cordial good wishes for the successful
continuation of its important work.
The twentieth of March, Nineteen Hundred and Twelve.
University op Colorado.
The University of Colorado begs to convey to The Academy of Natural
Sciences of Philadelphia its most sincere congratulations on the occasion of the
Centenary of the Academy. At a time when our State was a wilderness
unvisited by scientific men, the Academy was laying the foundations of
American Biological Science. During the past century its unceasing activities
have contributed enormously to the knowledge of the fauna and flora of the West.
We hope that the Academy will enjoy even greater prosperity in the future than
it has in the past, and that the coming century will see active cooperation between
it and our developing western institutions.
Beautifully engrossed.
