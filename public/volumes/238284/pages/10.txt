PROCEEDINGS.
INTRODUCTION.
Early in January, 1911, the Recording Secretary in letters to the President
and the Chairman of the Library Committee, urged the desirability of
a fitting observance of the one hundredth anniversary of the foundation of
the Academy. He prepared an outline program which, having been elaborated
by a preliminary committee consisting of Henry G. Bryant, LL.B., George
Vaux, Jr., Henry Skinner, M.D., Sc.D., Thomas H. Fenton, M.D., and the
Secretary, was approved by the Council, the proposed celebration was authorized,
and the President was directed to appoint a Committee of Arrangements of
which he should be the Chairman.
The President appointed a general committee, which, appropriately divided
into sub-committees, was charged with the details of management as follows:
