Announcing the adjournment the President remarked:
On behalf of the Members of The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia
I assure you that we all appreciate the disadvantages under which specialists
labor who leave their homes to attend a general scientific meeting where they
will probably hear only a few papers on the particular subject in which they are
interested. We therefore regard it as a high compliment to the Academy that
after having contributed your communications to the program, we have received
from you the moral support and encouragement of your presence during the
whole period of the sessions. This is greatly appreciated by the members of
our institution.
And now adjourning for the last time in the present century we will visit the
Museum, and the microscopic exhibit in the Reading Room. Some of our
members will join with the delegates from sister institutions tonight in welcoming
the second century of the Academy's existence.
The rest of the afternoon was devoted to the examination of one hundred and
thirty-two microscopes displayed in the Reading Room, and a selection from the
Academy's superb collection of butterflies arranged on the gallery surrounding
the New Hall.
