To the President of The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia:
The University of Stockholm Stockholm's Hogskola wishes to send to The

most hearty congratulations on the admirable evolution of Natural Science in
North America, which has taken place during the past seculum, and in which
your Academy has taken such an active part.

send a representative, we must confine ourselves to send you in this way our very
best wishes.

To The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia:
The Swedish Anthropological and Geographical Society begs to acknowledge
the receipt of your invitation to the Centenary Celebration of the founding of
your Academy.
We very heartily rejoice at the occasion for congratulating your Academy, the
oldest institution of its kind in America for the pursuit of natural history re-
searches. We send this message to you with all the more eagerness and ardour
from the circumstance that your society originated and has flourished in a district
of America where fellow-countrymen of ours of an earlier day were among those
who first sowed the seeds of civilization.
