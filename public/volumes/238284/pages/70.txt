PROCEEDINGS OF THE CENTENARY MEETING. ci
Nederlandsche Entomologische Vereeniging.
Rotterdam, the 7th of February, 1912.
To The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
Dear Sirs:
Our Society, though greatly honoured by your kind invitation to send a
representative to the celebration of the Centenary Anniversary of your Academy,
regrets much to be unable to accept it, as the travel to Philadelphia is too far.
The Board of our Society takes the liberty to offer you the best wishes for the
future prosperity of your Academy and hopes that it will be able to continue with
the same devotion and success the scientific labor, which is highly appreciated
also by the members of our Society.
I remain, Dear Sirs,
Yours faithfully,
D. van der Hoop,
Secretary.
New York Academy of Sciences.
The New York Academy of Sciences sends most hearty greetings to The
Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia on the occasion of the latter's
celebration of the One Hundredth Anniversary of her founding.
Next younger in age among such institutions in the country, the New York
Academy feels an especial right to congratulate her sister Academy upon rounding
out the first century of an existence that has been honorable for work accomplished
along several lines, but particularly in conchology and geology. Now that there
are so many centers of scientific work and thought in America there is danger of
overlooking the claims to recognition of the great original source of inspiration.
May Philadelphia maintain for centuries to come the front rank in this regard
that has been hers for more than the century now closing.
Emerson McMillan,
President.
Edmund Otis Hovey,
Recording Secretary.
