The Central Physical Observatory of Nicolas at St. Petersburg begs The
Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia to accept the sincerest congratu-

of most active devotion to the cultivation of the natural sciences, one branch of
which forms the task of the Observatory.
We wish most heartily that the Academy, the oldest institution of the United
States for the study of the natural sciences, which has so much contributed to
the progress of these sciences, may in the next centuries of activity continue its
work with the same success.

The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia:
We return our hearty thanks for your kind letter, inviting us to send a delegate
to attend the glorious celebration of the Centenary Anniversary of your Academy.
Your Academy, born as it was in the days when Geography was in its cradle,
has ever since rendered great services to the progress of the natural sciences in
the world. As the celebration assumes the double importance on that account,
we should feel very anxious to be present at the celebration if we could. We,
however, greatly regret to have to inform that various circumstances hinder us
from sending you a delegate of our own.
Again with many thanks for your kind invitation and with our heartfelt
wishes that the celebration will prove a great success,
We have the honour to remain, Sir,
KlNOSUKE INOUYE,
General Secretary.
