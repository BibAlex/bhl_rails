cxxvi PROCEEDINGS OF THE CENTENARY MEETING.
University of Edinburgh.
20th March, 1912.
Dear Sir:
On behalf of the Senatus Academicus of the University of Edinburgh, I beg
to convey cordial thanks to The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia
for the invitation to be represented at the Celebration of the Academy's Cen-
tenary Anniversary. I am to say that the Senatus greatly regret that the invi-
tation did not reach them in sufficient time to enable them to arrange for the
attendance of Delegates.
The Senatus send their warm congratulations to the Academy on the auspi-
cious occasion and their best wishes for the Academy's future prosperity, and
they trust the Celebrations are being carried through with the greatest success.
Yours faithfully,
L. J. Grant,
Sec. Sen. Acad.
Corresponding Secretary, The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
