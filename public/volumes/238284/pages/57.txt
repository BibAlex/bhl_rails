Dear Sir:
I beg to thank you for your kind invitation to the Canadian Institute to
be represented at the Centenary Anniversary of the Academy, and I greatly
regret that it is impossible for me or any of my associates to be present with you.
You have had a long and successful career, and the President and Members
of the Canadian Institute extend you most hearty greetings, with the hope that
your future achievements may not only equal, but may far outdo, your accom-
plishments in the past.
Yours sincerely,
J. B. Tyrrell,
President, Canadian Institute.

The Trustees and the Investigators of the Carnegie Institution of Washington
extend greetings and congratulations to The Academy of Natural Sciences of
Philadelphia on the occasion of the celebration of its One hundredth Anniversary.
The century of progress achieved by the Academy in the cultivation of the
Natural Sciences commands admiration for the devotion of our predecessors,
gives confidence in the fruitfulness of the labors of our contemporaries, and
warrants sanguine expectations for continued advances by our successors.
