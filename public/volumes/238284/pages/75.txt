cviii PROCEEDINGS OF THE CENTENARY MEETING.
Royal Society of Edinburgh.
To The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia:
The Royal Society of Edinburgh takes with great pleasure the opportunity of
expressing to The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, its congratu-
lations upon the celebration of the Academy's Centenary.
Sharing as it does the proud duty of advancing and diffusing knowledge, the
Society recognises the debt due to those who, under the aegis of the Academy,
have so zealously and so successfully laboured with the same end in view, to the
benefit not of one country only but of mankind.
The Society feels it a peculiar pleasure to convey upon so auspicious an oc-
casion, by the hands of its personal representatives, these sincere congratulations
to an Academy of a country with which Scotland has had such long and intimate
connections, and with cordial greetings expresses its confident hope for a continu-
ance of the Academy's distinguished career.
Wm. Turner,
(Seal) President,
C. G. Knott,
Secretary.
