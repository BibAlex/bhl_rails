disturbances, is embalmed doubtless in the tradition of the Ogy-
gean Deluge, Ogygea being the original name of Boeotia. A simi-
lar trouble must have occurred about the time of Alexander the
Great, who appears to have contemplated the reclaiming of the

basin. Strabo says : " When the outlets were again obstructed.
Crates, the miner, a man of Chalcis, began to clear away the
obstructions, but desisted in consequence of the Boeotians being in
a state of insurrection, although, as he himself says in the letter
to Alexander, many places had been already drained."
These statements of Strabo would lead to the inference that
the drainage of the basin by the ancients consisted only in keep-
ing free from obstruction certain subterraneous passages through
which the waters flowed to the sea ; and this would probably have
been the conclusion to-day but for the recent efforts of the Greek
government to reclaim the submerged lands. These efforts, under
the supervision of experienced engineers, have resulted in nearly
draining the basin, and have led to the discovery of a complete
ancient system of hydraulic works dating from so remote a period
that all record or tradition of their construction has been lost.
This system, so vast and comprehensive as to excite the wonder
of modern engineers, taking into consideration the primitive
appliances of the ancients, served to convert this now miasmatic
basin into a fruitful plain, the home, a thousand years before
our era, of a thriving and numerous population.
To give a clear conception of these ancient works and of the
problems which the prehistoric engineers had to solve, it will be
necessary to take a brief topographical survey of the region.
