very resistances which divergence from them entails he none
the less, on his return home, finds his actions in social intercourse
determined by the same need of conforming to some larger or
smaller group of which he may happen for the time to be a mem-
ber. It is because of this " doing at Rome as Rome does " that
social gatherings are said to succeed best and to be most enjoy-
able when the guests are all alike each other on certain social
sides of human nature, or are willing to appear to be thus alike
during the period of their association. The fact that the social
code, as it is sometimes called, frowns upon the guest who would
take more than his share of the attention or time of the company,
and encourages the host to an equal distribution of his favors to
all of them alike this shows how thoroughly, even in the social
circle, imitation of the group is the direction of greatest ease, and
how it is the stress of the resistances offered to unlikeness by the
group as a whole which impels the members of it to those acts
of imitation by which they are more or less temporarily assimi-
lated.
The very description, again, of costumes as de rigueur for cer-
tain special occasions contains a suggestion of the resistance which
the social group opposes to unlikenesses in dress. The attacks
sometimes made upon strangely attired persons in so highly con-
servative a country as China have had their parallels even in the
highly progressive countries of Europe and America. A similar
antagonism is manifested to nonconformity in social manners ;
and all formulae of such manners the etiquette at baptisms, wed-
dings, and funerals ; established methods of paying and receiving
visits ; prescriptions of what to do and what not to do at the din-
ner table are simply means, among those who attach importance
to these minutias, of avoiding the resistances that would inevi-
tably be encountered were there many ways, instead of a gener-
ically common manner, of behaving on social occasions.
The resistance offered to unlikenesses among associated indi-
viduals is also announced in that universal human character, the
passion for equality among men the tendency, however vaguely
or vividly it may be felt, to insist upon it that those with whom
we come into contact shall, in as many respects as possible, be
likes of ourselves. Jealousy of special privilege, with its spirit
embodied in such phrases as " fair play," " start equal," " share
and share alike," " a fair field and no favor," begins to manifest
itself very early in the life of the individual : mere children, when
associated, insist in multifarious ways on likeness of treatment ;
anything like favoritism in the distribution of gifts or the be-
stowal of attention, as well as all unfair advantage in games,
they resent with surprising promptness and vigor, often also
with indignation. In adults this jealousy of unequalness finds
