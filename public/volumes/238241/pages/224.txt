PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION. 307
made familiar. In practically carrying out this idea, the chair-
man of the commission put himself in direct and frequent com-
munication with revenue officials and representative business men
from every section of the country ; and availing himself of the
power to take testimony, under oath, he often came into the pos-
session of important facts which in daily life had been screened
from the eye of the public. The result was that the commission
presented to Congress, in January, 1866, a report which gave for
the first time a full, clear, and exact statement of the curious and
complex scheme of internal and customs revenue that had been
evolved, as it were, out of the financial necessities contingent on
the prosecution of a gigantic war : which involved the raising by
taxation during the war period (and exclusive of loans) of an ag-
gregate of over $2,000,000,000, and a not infrequent daily disburse-
ment (expenditure) of over two millions of dollars ; and in addi-
tion to this feature the report contained special and elaborate ex-
hibits on distilled spirits, fermented liquors, petroleum, cotton,
tea, coffee, sugar, spices, proprietary articles, and patent medicines
as sources of Government income, with estimates of the amount
of revenue which the Treasury might annually expect if taxation
at various rates on the same was to be continued ; the whole being
really the first practical attempt in the United States to gather
and use national statistics for great national purposes.
On the termination by statute of the Revenue Commission, in
January, 1866, its chairman was appointed to an office specially
created by Congress, for a period of four years, with the title of
"Special Commissioner of the Revenue" of the United States;
and the duties of which were thus defined by statute :
''He shall from time to time report through the Secretary of the
Treasury to Congress, either in the form of hill or otherwise, such
modifications of the rates of taxation, .or of the methods of collect-
ing the revenues, and such other facts pertaining to the trade, in-
dustry, commerce, or taxation of the country as he may find by
actual observation of the law to he conducive to public interest."
In this office, and invested with large powers, its incumbent en-
tered upon the work of co-operating with the appropriate commit-
tees of Congress " Ways and Means " of the House and " Finance "
of the Senate in reconstructing the then existing and extraordi-
nary system of the United States internal revenue ; and under his
initiation and supervision were originated almost all the reforms in
this department of the Government that were considered or en-
acted by Congress between the close of the war and the year 1870 ;
namely, the redrafting of nearly the whole body of complicated
and often conflicting statutes ; the reduction and final abolition
of the taxes on crude products especially cotton, salt, lumber, pe-
troleum, and the metals and most of the taxes on manufactures ;
