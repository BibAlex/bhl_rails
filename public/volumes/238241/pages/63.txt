doubt that the psychical faculties of the individual as soon as
they reach outward expression fall under the control of natural
laws as fixed as those of inorganic nature."
As the endless variety of arts and events in the culture history
of different tribes in different places, or of the same tribe at different
epochs, illustrates the variables in anthropologic science, so these
independent parallelisms prove beyond cavil the ever-present con-
stant in the problem to wit, the one and unvarying psychical
nature of man, guided by the same reason, swept by the same
storms of passion and emotion, directed by the same will toward
the same goals, availing itself of the same means when they are
within reach, finding its pleasure in the same actions, lulling its
fears with the same sedatives.
The anthropologist of to-day who, like a late distinguished
scholar among ourselves, would claim that because the rather
complex social system of the Iroquois had a close parallel among
the Munda tribes of the Punjab, therefore the ancestors of each
must have come from a common culture center; or who, like an
eminent living English ethnologist, sees a proof of Asiatic rela-
tions in American culture because the Aztec game of patoIU is like
the East Indian game of parchesi such an ethnologist, I say,
may have contributed ably to his science in the past, but he does
not know where it stands to-day. Its true position on this crucial
question is thus tersely and admirably stated by Dr. Steinmetz :
" The various customs, institutions, thoughts, etc., of different
peoples are to be regarded either as the expressions of the differ-
ent stadia of culture of our common humanity or as different
reactions of that common humanity under varying conditions and
circumstances. The one does not exclude the other. Therefore
the concordance of two peoples in a custom, etc., should be ex-
plained by borrowing or by derivation from a common source
only when there are special known and controlling reasons indi-
cating this ; and when these are absent, the explanation should be
either because the two peoples are on the same plane of culture or
because their surroundings are similar."
This is true not only of the articles intended for use, to supply
the necessities of existence, as weapons and huts and boats we
might anticipate that they would be something similar, otherwise
they would not serve the purpose everywhere in view; but the
analogies are, if anything, still more close and striking when we
come to compare pure products of the fancy, creations of the
imagination or the emotions, such as stories, myths, and motives
of decorative art.
It has proved very difficult for the comparative mythologist
or the folklorist of the old school to learn that the same stories
for instance, of the four rivers of Paradise, the flood, the ark, and
