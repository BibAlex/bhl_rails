THE VELOCITY OF ELECTRICITY.
Br GIFFOED LE CLEAR.
THE determination of the velocity of electricity has been the
ambition of many physicists ; yet at present it is generally
conceded that the velocity may be anywhere from the fraction of
an inch per hour to millions of miles per second.
By the popular use of the words " current of electricity " we
have grown to think of a fluid flowing through a wire, yet we do
not know that there is any such fluid, and consequently we can
hardly say that it has a velocity. However, the attempt was
made, some years ago, to find the velocity of electricity, consider-
ing it as a fluid, by finding the time taken for a signal sent from
the Harvard Observatory, Cambridge, to reach St. Louis. The
distance between the two places was known, and the gentlemen
who conducted the experiment easily found what they supposed
was the velocity of electricity by dividing the distance by the
time. To understand why this velocity is not really the velocity
of electricity, as well as to understand the direction in which
physical research is now directed, we must consider what we really
do know about electricity.
When the two poles of a battery are connected by a wire we
say a current of electricity is flowing through the wire. The
evidences of the so-called
current are two: in the -'^-'-- - - __.-,,-...

force, and the direction in which the north end of the needle is
pulled we call the direction of the magnetic force.

over a plate through which a wire is thrust, perpendicular to the
plate. A current is passing through the wire whose cross-section
