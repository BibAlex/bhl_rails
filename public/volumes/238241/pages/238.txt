PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION. 323
were due to fraudulent practices, rather than to an impairment
of ability to consume on the part of the masses.
(4) The average annual increase in the receipt of internal
revenue from fermented liquors for the ten years from 1883 to
1892 was $1,306,057, and for the four years ending with the fiscal
year 1893 about $1,617,000. That this latter ratio of annual in-
crease under the present rate of tax is likely to indefinitely con-
tinue is almost demonstrated by the fact that the popularity of
fermented or malt liquors as beverage among the American
people is unquestionably increasing ; and also that large, seem-
ingly, as is their present average per capita consumption namely,
sixteen gallons the present per capita consumption of the people
of several other nationalities is much greater ; that of the United
Kingdom being estimated at thirty gallons ; of England and
Wales, thirty-six ; of Belgium, forty ; and of Germany, forty-five.
An important fact pertinent to the prospective consumption of
beer and its permanent value as a source of national revenue
is, that the cost of the materials used in its manufacture has
decreased in comparatively recent years, in the United States,
Great Britain, and probably other countries characterized by its
large consumption, to the extent of at least forty per cent ; and the
advantage from this change which has accrued to British brew-
er was stated by the British Chancellor of Exchequer, in May,
1895, to have been upward of 2,000,000 ($10,000,000) per annum.
Another point of interest in this connection which is especially
worthy of attention is, that if moral influences have ever materi-
ally affected the general consumption of distilled spirits or fer-
mented liquors in the United States, the tabulated tax experi-
ences of its Government, which constitute the only reliable basis
for forming an opinion, do not afford any indication of it.
Having reformed and radically reduced the war taxes in the
Department of Internal Revenue, it was next in order for Con-
gress to consider the readjustment of the customs system of taxa-
tion, which had also been evolved, as it were, out of the war's fis-
cal exigencies ; and it accordingly in 1867 instructed the Secretary
of the Treasury to present at its next session the draft of a tariff
embodying reductions of war rates. The responsibility of prepar-
ing such a draft having been next intrusted by the Secretary to
the Special Commissioner of the Revenue, the latter, with a view
of qualifying himself for the trust, visited Europe under a Gov-
ernment commission, and investigated under almost unprece-
dented advantages nearly every form of industry then competi-
tive with the United States in Great Britain and on the Conti-
nent. The results of this visit and investigation effected an
enlightenment on his part in respect to two salient and funda-
mental points :
