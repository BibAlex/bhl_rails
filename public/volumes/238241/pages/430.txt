PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION. 583
and twenty-five years before the establisliment of the empire
under Csesar, were enabled, through the great spoils of war ob-
tained from subjugated nations, to relieve themselves from taxa-
tion for the support of their government ; and, in so doing, it ap-
pears that they first threw off their direct taxes, and at a later
period those taxes that were indirect. But when under Csesar it
became necessary to reimpose taxes, they established them in a
reverse order that is, the indirect taxes were renewed first and
in preference to those which were direct ; thus recognizing and
affirming in practice the idea that characterizes the fiscal policy
of most modern governments namely, that it is expedient to con-
ceal as far as possible the burden of taxes from the people who
are to pay them.
The gross amount of annual revenue which the empire of
Rome collected in its best day is estimated by Gibbon to have
been about twenty million pounds sterling ($100,000,000) ; later
authorities place it at a much higher figure, or $200,000,000, In
default, however, of exact information as to the purchasing power
of money at the time, it is obvious that neither of these esti-
mates can give us any true idea of the real amount of the
Roman revenue ; but, taking the probable price of wheat in
Rome at the close of the republic as an indication of the price of
other commodities, the purchasing power of Gibbon's twenty
million pounds sterling ($100,000,000) must have represented a
much greater sum, or at least $150,000,000. If the largest of these
estimates of the revenue of imperial Rome should seem inade-
quate for the support of a government that extended over the
greater part of the then known surface of the earth, that included
a population of at least 150,000,000, and maintained a military and
naval establishment of 450,000 men, it should be remembered
that, apart from the greater increased purchasing power of money
than now prevails, the expenditure by the state for the support
of its military forces was comparatively small (" the ratio of mili-
tary draft upon society before the inception of Rome's decadence
being but little more than one third as great as that of the seven
principal states of present Europe " *) ; that the present com-
plexity and magnitude of expenditure in the form of taxes did
not exist ; and that a Roman national debt, with its burden of con-
stantly accruing interest the one thing most grievous to modern
states was entirely unknown.
The taxes, or rather exactions, on the people of the conquered
provinces of Rome were always more numerous, discriminating,
and onerous than those levied upon the population of the im-
perial city and its adjoining districts ; and from the time of the
