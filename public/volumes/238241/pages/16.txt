PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION. 9
Ion. The average annual consumption by the people of Illinois at
the time, supposing that they actually paid the tax on their prod-
uct of whiskey, must have also been at the rate of over six gallons
per head for every man, woman, and child of its population.
When " an act to reduce taxation to provide revenue for the
Government and for other purposes" passed August 28, 1894
was under consideration by the Senate of the United States ; and
pending a proposition to increase the revenue by increasing an
existing tax of about seven hundred per cent on the average prime
cost of distilled spirits to a rate of near nine hundred per cent, a
Senator of long experience, apparently utterly oblivious that the
subject involved had years before been thoroughly considered by
the United States Treasury Department and declared to be im-
practicable, submitted a motion, permitting the use of alcohol in
the arts, or in any medicinal or other like compound, without the
payment of any internal revenue tax. The motion in question,
after very brief consideration, was accepted and incorporated in
the statute and now forms a part of the fiscal obligations and laws
of the United States. The result was that the Secretary of the
Treasury reported, that in default of any appropriation to defray
the expenses of the administration of the act and the repayment
of taxes, and ^' after full consideration of the subject, and an un-
successful attempt to frame regulations which would protect the
Government and the manufacturers, the department was con-
strained to abandon the effort." It was also estimated that the
expense to the Government of attempting to administer the act
would probably be not less than one million dollars per annum ;
that the legitimate loss of revenue contingent on its enforcement
would be about ten million dollars yearly, or " more than one half
of the estimated increase of revenue" that it was expected to
accrue from the increase of the tax, and that the loss of revenue
from the opportunity for illicit and fraudulent practice, which the
act would facilitate would be unquestionably very considerable
probably an equal amount. The inference from all of which is,
that when a State sends a representative to the United States Sen-
ate who, through indifference or gross ignorance of the most com-
mon principles and domestic experiences of taxation prospective-
ly, entails a loss to the Government of some twenty million dol-
lars per annum, it pays a very great price for such a privilege.
During another comparatively recent fiscal debate in the
United States Senate, a Senator, who is popularly and justly ac-
credited with statesmanship, advocated certain proposed appro-
priations of the public money, which were opposed on the ground
that they were in the nature of extravagances, by saying that
they could not be grievous to the people " since they would not
amount to more than three cents per day per capita." But three
