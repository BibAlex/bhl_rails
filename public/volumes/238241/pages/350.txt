IMITATION AMONG ATOMS AND ORGANISMS. 493
the association of unlikes involves tlie utmost degree of resist-
ance. It follows that where nnlikes are associated, the resistance
offered to their union will tend (1), where they are forcibly held
in association, to make them likes ; and (2) where they are free
to move, to dissociate them. This law of assimilation, as we may
briefly call it, finds illustration over so vast a field that it may
fairly be described as a universal character.
If we begin, then, with the most C9mplex of all the phenom-
ena known to us, our first illustrations will be drawn from the
realm of mind. The fact that cognition is a process of the associ-
ation of like and the dissociation of unlike impressions, and the
further fact that all the activities of thought, from reasoning of
the lowest to reasoning of the highest kind, involve the association
of like and dissociation of unlike elements these are psycho-
logical truths of the utmost certainty. At the outset of all know-
ing is the indispensable condition that unless we can connect the
thing perceived with some other things already known, and thus
recognize our object as a like of those things, we can not know it
at all, and it can not become a part of our store of mental experi-
ences; while the very act by which we know it involves dissoci-
ation of it as an impression from all the impressions which it
does not resemble. From this, the simplest form of knowing, to
the most elaborate process of the reasoning faculty; from the
recognition of single objects as like others to the recognition of
classes of objects as like other classes ; from the discovery of a
causal relation between one set of objects or changes that is like
the causal relation between another set of objects or changes to
the discovery of the causal likeness connecting great groups of
objects and activities, and finally all objects and changes whatso-
ever, there is throughout the same process at work the process
of the association of likes and the dissociation of unlikes that
conditions the mode of all our mental operations. So-called
thought or reflection, for example, is simply the recovery into
consciousness, for the purposes of knowledge, of cognitions more
or less simple, more or less complex ; cognitions recoverable as
images, symbols, or terms from the classes in which they have
been first associated by the mind; and the sense of pleasure felt
by a thinker in discovering analogies can spring oiily from satis-
faction of the demand, even in mental processes, that likes shall
be brought together and unlikes separated. Classification in all
its forms, whether in the ordinary business of life, as a means to
scientific investigation, or for the ends of philosophic thought,
illustrates the same necessity : at first unlikes and likes are
mingled indiscriminately, and at first the mind regards them, if
roughly, as being alike ; but a sense of unrest leads to further
examination of the aggregated elements until, by a more con-
