tion of a system of useful knowledge, its
greatest value lying in affording the only
course in strict reasoning with which the ma-
jority of students will become acquainted."
With these two beliefs as guides, the author
has made an attractive and useful little text-
book.
Magnetism: Us Potency/ and Action, is the
title of a volume in which George W. Holley
has recorded some of his observations, ex-
periments, and speculations on the magnetic
force (Arena Publishing Company, $1.25).
Among the topics that he discusses are the
influence of magnetism on animal and vege-
table life, the experiments of M. Hertz,
" electric girls," spiritual phenomena, thought
transference, hypnotism, and the action of
the planchette. He sees magnetism mani-
fested in the action of the brain and the
heart, in the homing faculty of animals, the
transformation of grubs, and various other
phenomena. In this volume also the author
outlines a new cosmography, which he illus-
trates by a diagram.
