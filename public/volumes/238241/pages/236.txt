have exerted the slightest influence on the production and con-
sumption of distilled spirits in the United States. But the ad-
vent in 1894 of a similar state of affairs in the latter country
speedily manifested itself, reducing the current per capita con-
sumption from 1*48 gallons in 1893 to 1'33 gallons; the direct
revenue from $89,231,000 in 1893 to $79,899,000 ; the current per
capita consumption from 1'48 to 1"33 gallons, and the total annual
revenue to the extent of $9,461,008.
The normal consumption of distilled spirits in the United
States in 1894, as indicated by withdrawals from distilleries and
warehouses, was about 8,000,000 gallons a month. The extent to
which the increase in the direct tax on spirits by the act of
August 28, 1894, from ninety cents to one dollar and ten cents per
gallon, was anticipated by speculators is strikingly illustrated by
the fact that an average monthly revenue from the lesser tax
of about $8,000,000 per month during the first six months of 1894
increased during the month of July and the first twenty-seven
days of August to $19,064,000 and $21,470,000 respectively, and
declined in the succeeding month of September to $510,696.
Any review of the comparatively recent tax experiences of the
United States would be incomplete that failed to notice its taxa-
tion (concurrent with that on distilled spirits) of domestic fer-
mented liquors (beer, etc.). The internal revenue tax on this
commodity has been practically uniform since its first authoriza-
tion in 1863, namely, one dollar per barrel, holding theoretically
thirty-one gallons. The tax was originally assessed and collected
on the returns of the brewers, and was largely evaded. After
July, 1866, it was successfully enforced through thfe employment
of stamps, one of which, " denoting the amount of the tax," is re-
quired to be affixed upon the spigot hole or tap (of which there
shall be but one) in such a way that the stamp shall be destroyed
upon the withdrawal of the liquor from the barrel or other re-
ceptacle. The following table exhibits in detail the experience
which has characterized each fiscal year since the inception of this
source of revenue in 1863 down to and including 1894 :
