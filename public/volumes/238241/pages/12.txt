PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION. 3
never as yet fully tested experiment of universal suffrage, have
become, at least theoretically in the United States, the sole arbi-
ters of the policy of their Government and of the selection of the
legislators who are to enact laws in conformity with such policy.*
The problem of the acquisition of wealth having thus been
solved, that of the proper distribution of wealth logically and
necessarily follows, and the character of the measures which
directly or indirectly involve what is called taxation for the at-
tainment of such result, which seem to commend themselves to
the people of the United States, are especially worthy of attention.
They are indicated in part by the adoption of a pension system
unlike anything of the kind ever known in history, and which
necessitates an annual expenditure of money (raised by taxation)
to meet the military expenses of the country army, navy, and
pensions in excess of that entailed by the immense military estab-
lishment of any of the countries of Europe, and the enactment of
an income-tax statute whose primary object was not to raise reve-
nue for the support of the Government, but an unmistakably po-
litical and socialistic measure, which threatened to annul the most
important and exceptional feature of the Federal Constitution.
That the diminishing rate of returns, in way of interest or
profits, by the force of laws which no combination of capital can
resist, is seriously impairing the relative value of wealth, and may
eventually reach a minimum which will greatly diminish the in-
ducement to individuals to economize or save it, although not gen-
erally recognized or appreciated, can not be denied. And neither
is it recognized that the current rate of taxation on capital in all
civilized countries even now approximates, and to an extent actu-
ally exceeds, the current rates of interest or profit on its use.
Thus, for example, the rate of discount at the Bank of England
during the greater portion of the years 1894 and 1895 has not
been in excess of two per cent, and the discount (borrowing) rate
for three months during this period was not infrequently less
than a rate of three quarters per cent per annum. If taxes, ac-
cording to popular theory, do not diffuse themselves, but remain
a burden on the person, business, and property subject to their
travel they gather knowledge, but they are, after all, subject to recollections mixed with
regret ; their affections are weakened by being extended over more objects, and they learn
new habits which can not be gratified when they return home."
* " The great, the unanswerable argument in favor of universal suffrage is, not that it
insures a better or purer government, but that all must be contented with a government in
which all have an equal voice. If it be deficient in this particular, if it fail to protect the
poor against the oppression of the rich, or the rich against a destruction of their property
by the poor, it is pro tanto a failure, and another method of representation should be
adopted." Address of Justice Brown, United States Supreme Court^before the Law Depart-
ment of Yale University, July, 1895.
