of conducting commerce ; imposed for the purpose of revenue
only, and without the slightest reference to any contingent in-
fluences on trade or industry. In fact, the idea of promoting (pro-
tecting) industry through taxes on exchanges appears to have
found no place in Roman or any other ancient economic history
or experience.
In accordance with a practice on the part of the ancient Ro-
mans of deifying abstractions as war, love, navigation, thievery,
and the like we find mention of the Genius of the Custom House,
or of Indirect Taxes {genius portorii puhlici), a divinity that
seems to have survived to our own times ; inasmuch as many of
the curious phenomena that have occurred in connection with
modern efforts to prevent free exchanges through the agencies
of customs taxation, seem only capable of explanation on the as-
sumption that some occult jDower has been more potential in
shaping economic events in this department of government than
any proper exercise of man's reasoning faculties ; and that it is
the part of wisdom that large sacrifices should be made by the
people in order to propitiate this deity.
Throughout the whole course of their history the principal
taxes levied by the Romans appear to have been collected through
the instrumentality of a class of ofiicials known as " iniblicans,^'
who paid the government for the privilege of so doing ; and who,
intrusted with extraordinary powers, were allowed, by way of
compensation for their services, to collect and retain as much of
additional revenue as they could force or extort from the tax-
payers for their individual and private benefit. Such an admin-
istration of the publicans necessarily involved and required the
employment of a large number of subcontractors and deputies,
who, stationed at seaports, on public highways, at the gates of
cities, and the market places, examined all goods exported, im-
ported, or offered for sale, estimated their value, and collected the
taxes to which they were legally liable, and as much more as they
could extort with impunity, for the benefit of their masters or
themselves which last, in disorderly times and under the bad em-
perors, had a very wide latitude. This wretched system of " farm-
ing " or discounting the revenues of the state, which appears to
have been a permanent feature of the government of Rome at all
periods under its kings, under the republic, and under the em-
pire has, moreover, a feature of general interest, as it clearly
illustrates the exceeding limitation and narrowness of the general
Roman policy in the sphere of civil administration.
Another fact pertinent to the general philosophy of taxation,
which the historical study of Roman polity has developed, is also
especially worthy of notice in this connection. As has been pre-
viously stated, the Romans, for a period of at least one hundred
