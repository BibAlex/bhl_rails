THE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY.
glorious bimetallic days, the farmer got but twenty-five cents
a bushel for his wheat. In those times the western farmer lived
chiefly by consuming his own products, buying almost noth-
ing. It is too clear for argument or dispute that it has been rail-
roads, telegraphs, produce exchanges, and such-like means of
facilitating exchange, and not gold or silver, that have caused
the fall of the great staples in commercial centers a fact easily
verifiable by any western man who will consult the oldest resi-
dents of his town.
In a late number of The Forum, that excellent statistician, Mr.
Edward Atkinson, has given a most interesting table which, in
the present connection, I can not do better than copy. The table
was constructed to show at a glance the variations in price of the
principal commodities as expressed in gold.*

In brief, the table shows that the prices of many commodities
rose very much between 1845 and 1865, and afterward fell a little
lower than the 1845 level ; while wages, on the contrary, not only
did not recede, but continued to advance after 1865. It shows
another interesting fact that 1865 is the date ivhen prices began to
fall, and not 1873; and thus discloses the purely artificial nature
of the effort to make the era of cheap prices coincide with the
" demonetization of silver " in that year.
In Mulhall's History of Prices (page 7) the author brings to-
gether in a short comparison a statement of the views of various
authorities on the subject of the rise and fall of prices.
* For the excellent discussion as to the price variations of the different commodities, the
reader must be referred to the article itself, which is a good antidote for the reckless asser-
tions and hasty theories current on this subject.
