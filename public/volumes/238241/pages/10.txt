PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION".
Bt DAVID A. WELLS.
" Tlie principles of good government are far from easy to learn accurately ; and very much
harder to put in practice." F. B. Sanborn.
INTRODUCTION.
IT is the purpose of the writer in the chapters which follow,
to discuss the principles of taxation from a broader basis and
by different methods than have heretofore been attempted, special
consideration being given to the experience of the United States.
Such a discussion primarily involves the inquiry, of how far
the varied and curious experience of nations leads up through
what may be regarded as a process of evolution, to a recognition
of the underlying and essential principles of a just and at the
same time an efficient system of taxation. And it also necessi-
tates, for the attainment of correct conclusions in the prosecution
of such inquiry, that illustrations drawn from the world's great
record of experience should take precedence of theory, espe-
cially in the way of example and exhibit of the many abuses of
the power of taxation which the ignorance of legislators and the
cupidity of designing men have inflicted upon nations.
The subject is one of transcendent importance, perhaps more
universally important than any other that can invite public
attention. Its discussion .opens questions of the widest possible
range. There can be no civilization without government and no
government without an adequate supply of revenue obtained
from the persons and property of the people governed. There
can be no health in the body politic without sound finance, and
no sound finance without a sound system of taxation. In fact,
