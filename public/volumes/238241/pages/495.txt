the essential principle of memory; and it is particularly apj)lica-
ble to the automatic memory, upon which, as already said in sub-
stance, the teaching of the symbolic subjects must depend. The
object is to have thought spontaneously suggested by symbols,
with no conscious attention upon the symbols themselves ; and,
of course, there is the co-ordinate purpose to acquire power to
use the means of expression automatically to convey thought.
Neither of these objects may be secured if the learning of forms
is divorced from their constant use in the ready acquisition and
clear conveyance of thought ; which, when applied to the work of
the schoolroom, means that the study of arithmetic, language,
grammar, or the mechanics of reading, writing, and drawing,
apart from their natural connections with the pursuit of the con-
tent subjects, history, literature, science, and geography is a mis-
take. Common sense maintains, in everyday life at least, that
the mechanism necessary to the performance of any art may be
most advantageously acquired through actual practice of the art ;
and one never learns the mechanics of bicycle-riding, baseball-
playing, typewriting, and similar arts before he begins to ride the
bicycle, play ball, or use the typewriter ; but he acquires skill in
doing these things by applying himself to their execution at the
outset. A child at its mother's knee learns to talk by talking,
and to walk by walking, rather than in either case to acquire
beforehand the theory and mechanics of each in the hope to ap-
ply them some time later in life. But common sense, which has
always been slow in carrying its philosophy of the activities of
daily life into the work of the schoolroom, is just now beginning
it seems to appreciate in a way that what is true concerning the
mastery of the mechanics of doing things in daily life applies also
to the formal subjects of education, in the sense that they may be
most serviceably acquired in an incidental manner, while using
them, continually to acquire and express thought aroused by the
study of real things. It is, no doubt, necessary to have much
drill upon these formal things to make their use automatic ; but
this drill must follow and depend upon the use of the symbolic
subjects in the study of the real subjects at any time rather than
to aim at mastering a body of forms which may be applied at
some future period.
From the foregoing (and there are other arguments, such as
the greater interest which the pupil will have in the study of the
formal subjects when they are thus connected with the real sub-
jects, which can not be entered into here) it may be concluded
that the formal branches of instruction acquire a value from
their connection with the study of content subject-matter; and
taught by themselves they are, comparatively speaking, empty
and valueless. What has been said of the symbolic studies may
