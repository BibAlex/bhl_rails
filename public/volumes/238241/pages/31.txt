connection between the Glacial period and the flood, and the
probable reason why no tradition has descended to us of the
former ; first, because man was born during its epoch and was
formed by it and accustomed to it, and living in the one temper-
ate zone on the equator saw nothing strange in his surroundings,
and, secondly, because the only change that man saw was the
sudden accumulation of waters descending from the earthquake-
riven and colder portions of his then unexplored globe.
Thus, man's remains have been found with those of the mam-
moth a mammal of the warm, subtropical Pliocene period, that
lived on into the cold Pleistocene epoch. Probably his origin was
previous to that of man ; but man may not have appeared until
the end of the Pliocene period and the commencement of the cold,
which, in all likelihood, gradually and surely came on, as the
interior of the globe shrank farther and farther away from con-
tact with the easily chilled outer crust, which it left to fields
of ice bordering a narrow temperate zone ; the ice reaching from
the north pole as far south possibly as 50 north of the equator,
and from the south pole as far north as 40 south of the equator ;
thus the present temperate zones became arctic, and the tropical
zone became almost unvaryingly temperate. Man probably in
his first ages had spread far and wide north and south of the
equator, but not so far as at present we find ourselves ; he had
been gradually driven back by the advancing cold, yet so slowly
that the change did not make itself noticeable to him, and as his
civilization advanced to the time when he began to build and to
establish great cities he found himself settled near the equator,
even further south than ancient Thebes, and probably where the
great deserts of Arabia, Nubia, and those of the Sahara stretch
their vast plains of sands, and jjerchance now cover works even
older than the stepped pyramid of Ata. However long, therefore,
these periods of change may have been, it seems very probable
that man first appeared in a fresh, temperate clima,te, the only
proof of which is that he has several times been found with the
remains of the mammoth, an animal that outlived the primal
warm periods. Probably no preglacial period existed for man. As
for the length of time that must have elapsed between the first
appearance of vegetation upon the earth until the time that the
climax of the Glacial period arrived, when the flood took place,
ten thousand years need not be too much. Midst the surround-
ings of that Glacial period, however, man's remains have been
found, but not in those.of the preglacial ages that lead back to the
ichthyosaurus, plesiosaurus, and other monsters of the deep, or of
the age of gigantic flora, huge pine trees, and enormous ferns.
If the flood, then, as some have calculated, was only five or six
thousand years ago, then the coldest period of the Glacial age can
