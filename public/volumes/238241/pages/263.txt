374 POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY.
the tilings which are most deeply significant in these closing years
of the century are not the newly gained skill in diagnosis, not the
marvelous strides which surgery has made, beneficent as these
may be, not the more exact and purposeful and moderate use of
drugs, not the insight which has been gained regarding the com-
plex nature of the nervous system, nor even in the high achieve-
ments, too numerous and varied to be even mentioned here, which
the new science of bacteriology has made possible.
Beyond all these accomplishments, notable enough though
they be for any age, the things which more than all else, it seems
to me, will signalize this time, are that we have now definitely
freed medicine, in all its borders, from the thralldom of mystery
and superstition, have finally and clearly recognized that its
problems are the problems of biology, and are to be solved only
by such patient research and guarded inference as all science has
learned to trust ; that the doctor is in command of no mysterious
forces, and that the only chance for the full and speedy fruition
of our hope in the prevention of disease lies in general education,
and in the enlistment of the interests of the people, of whom the
medical profession should be the teacher and the guide.
Of course, the shadows here and there will linger on ; of course,
one and another for some time to come will still invest his calling
with the puerile mysteries which were fostered in ignorance, and
which should have been put aside with the scarlet cloak and the
wig and the ponderous walking stick. Of course, so long as the
people are largely ignorant of elementary facts regarding the hu-
man frame, quacks will flourish and more or less well-meaning
advocates will be found of water, of electricity, of faith, of exor-
cism, of infinitesimal dosage, and of every sort of named and un-
named folly, as panaceas and as substitutes for science. But, after
all, when medicine is once placed where it belongs, close to its sister
disciplines, from which it gathers light and in its turn inspires,
the shadows are certain soon to fade and the truth to prevail.
You will observe, ladies and gentlemen, that the current of my
thought has led again and again to the outlooks which command
the field of preventive medicine. This is not only because here
the new light shines brightest, and gives clearest glimpses of
definite achievement, but also because upon this field success is
possible only if we can secure general and earnest co-operation in
the spread of the new ideals of cleanliness.
In truth, the exactions of our modern sanitary codes, so far as
they affect the performances of the individual and the routine of
the household, are neither complex nor burdensome ; and a very
moderate amount of care, if happily joined to informed intelli-
gence, will suffice, under almost all conditions, for the maintenance
of a safe regime.
