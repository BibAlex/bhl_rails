For example, the chest measurements of 5,738 soldiers gave the
following results :
If the number of events had
heen five hundred thousand or
five million instead of five thou-
sand, the agreement between the
computed and observed frequency
of each degree of departure from
the mean would have been very
much closer. When the number
of cases is unlimited, the agree-
ment is perfect.
Galton gives the following il-
lustration of the significance of a
type:
Suppose a large island inhab-
ited by a single race, who inter-
marry freely, and who have lived for many generations under
constant conditions, then the average height of the adult male of
that population will undoubtedly be the same year after year.
Also still arguing from the experience of modern statistics,
which are found to give constant results in far less carefully
guarded examples we should undoubtedly find year after year
the same proportion maintained between the number of men of
difi'erent heights. I mean if the average stature was found to be
sixty-six inches, and if it was also found in any one year that one
hundred per million exceeded seventy-eight inches, the same pro-
portion of one hundred per million would be closely maintained
in all other years.
An equal constancy of proportion would be maintained be-
tween any other limits of height we please to specify, as between
seventy-one and seventy-two inches, between seventy-two and
seventy-three, and so on. Now, at this point the law of deviation
from an average steps in. It shows that the number per million,
whose heights range between seventy-one and seventy-two inches,
or between any other limits we please to name, could be predicted
from the previous datum of the average, and of any other one
fact, such as that of one hundred per million exceeding seventy-
eight inches.
Suppose a million of the men to stand in turns with their
backs against a vertical board of sufiicient height, and their
heights to be dotted off upon it. The line of average height is
that which divides the dots into two equal parts, and stands, in
the case we have assumed, at the height of sixty-six inches. The
dots will be found to be ranged so symmetrically on either side of
the line of average that the lower half of the board will be almost
