dation in this particular found favor, it would have resulted in
an accretion of many millions to the national Treasury, a relief
from espionage and other frictions to the trade, and a larger
diminution of administrative expenditures both to the trade and
the Government.
The experience of the Federal Government in its taxation of
distilled spirits is extraordinary, and so replete with instruction
to economists, moralists, and social reformers as to merit a more
extended notice.
The product of distilled spirits in the United States for the
year 1860, as returned by the census, was about 90,000,000 gallons.
It would be 'an error to assume that all of this immense pro-
duction of spirits was used for intoxicating purposes, or in the
way of stimulants, inasmuch as the extreme cheapness of spirits
or alcohol in the United States during the period under consid-
eration occasioned their employment in large quantities for vari-
ous industrial purposes ; which uses were subsequently in a great
degree discontinued when the price of spirits was enhanced from
one hundred to one thousand per cent and upward by Federal
taxation. For 1860-'G1, the year preceding the war, the average
price of proof spirits in Cincinnati was 14'40 cents per gallon.
From 1822 to 1862 distilled spirits, in common with all other
domestic industrial products, were exempt from Federal taxation.
In the latter year, under the necessity for revenue occasioned by
the war. Congress imposed a tax of twenty cents per proof gallon
on all distilled spirits of domestic production. This tax went into
effect on the 1st of September, 1862, and continued in force until
March, 1864. The total revenue derived from this source, includ-
ing the receipts from licenses for rectifying, vending, and the
like, for the fiscal year 1863, was $5,176,530. The receipts from the
direct tax on the spirit itself was $3,229,990, indicating a domestic
production of only 16,149,954 gallons as compared with a produc-
tion of 90,000,000 gallons returned under the census of 1860, three
years previous. The explanation of this result is to be found in
the fact that a large amount of whisky was manufactured in
anticipation of this low tax, and that there were doubtless some
evasions of the tax after it was enacted conditions that were re-
peated, as will be presently shown, in a greater degree on every
occasion when an advance in the tax was enacted.
The tax of twenty cents continued in force until March 7, 1864,
when the rate was advanced to sixty cents per gallon. The reve-
nue accruing under these two rates for the year ending June 30,
1864, was $28,431,797, and the number of gallons returned as hav-
ing been assessed was 85,295,393. The striking discrepancy be-
tween the number of gallons taxed in 1864 at twenty and sixty
cents and the number taxed the previous year (1863) at twenty
