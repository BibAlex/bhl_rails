PREHISTORIC ENGINEERING AT LAKE COPAIS. 213
Lake Copais is the receptacle of tlie drainage of the valley of the
Cephissus and of the plain of Chseronea, which is watered by the
Hyrcinns, Permessus, Olmeus, Lophis, and other streams that
descend from Helicon. All these streams flow in on the south
and west sides, where the shores of the lake are simply a continu-
ation of the adjacent plains ; but on the north, east, and southwest,
where the waters would naturally find an outlet to the sea, the
banks form steep, rocky shores.
At the southeast extremity the lake ends in the Bay of Car-
ditza, which is inclosed in a fold of Mount Sphingium, an off-
shoot of Helicon, and at the northeast in the Bay of Topolias or
Kephalari, inclosed in Mount Ptoum. A depression in the flank
of Sphingium is called the Hill of Carditza, and behind this, be-
tween it and Mount Ptoum, is a smaller lake, Hylice or Hylicus
(Likeri). Further east, near the seacoast, lies Mount Messapium,
with another small lake, called Paralimni, between it and Mount
Ptoum. A similar depression in Mount Ptoum, east of the Bay of
Kephalari, is called the Hill of Kephalari. The Copaic basin is

thus a natural cul-de-sac, with no apparent outlet ; but the pent-
up waters have worn fissures through the limestone rocks under-
lying the hills and formed for themselves, perhaps with some
volcanic aid, as Strabo suggests, subterraneous outlets into the
Euripus or channel of the sea between Boeotia and Euboea.
There are twenty- three of these subterraneous passages, locally
called katabothra, but many of them unite underground and
only four reach the surface on the east side of the hills. Of
