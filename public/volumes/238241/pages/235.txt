320 POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY.
annual taxed production of spirits went up from 50^704,189 gallons
in 1878 to 79,616,901 gallons in 1884, and the per capita consump-
tion from 1'07 gallons to 1*45 gallons in the corresponding years.
During the period from 1871 to 1880 there was a decrease both in
the quantity of spirits on which the Government was able to col-
lect a tax and in the apparent per capita consumption of the
people, and this, too, notwithstanding an increase during this
same period of thirty per cent in the population of the country ;
1871 showing a tax on sixty-two and one third millions (1"58 gal-
lons per capita), while in 1879 the tax was collected on only fifty-
three million gallons (1'09 gallons per capita).
The decade from 1870 to 1879 was further characterized by two
periods of disturbance which ought to be instructive in view of
future legislation occasioned by an advance in 1873 of the gallon
tax from fifty to seventy cents, and again in 1875 from seventy to
ninety cents. In both cases these advances in rates were followed
by large annual reductions in the quantity of the spirits taxed
and in an apparent per capita consumption, which in turn indi-
cated extensive revivals of illicit practices which the reduction of
the tax to fifty cents in 1868 had nearly extinguished, and which
indications were also made certainties by abundant direct evi-
dence.
The decade of 1880 to 1889 showed, on the other hand, an in-
crease in the aggregate amount paying taxes from sixty-two and
one eighth million gallons in 1880 (1*23 gallons per capita) to sev-
enty-seven and one eighth million gallons in 1889 (1'25 gallons
per capita), an aggregate increase approximating a concurrent in-
crease of twenty-two per cent in the population of the country.
During the fiscal years from 1888 to 1893, inclusive, under a
uniform and prospectively stable rate of tax, an apparently good
and efficient administration of the law, and a fairly prosperous
condition of the country, the results in this department of our
national revenues were very exceptional and interesting. The
continuous increase in production, in per capita consumption, and
in revenue was remarkable, the average increase in spirits paying
taxes having been nearly 4,600,000 gallons per annum, or in a
ratio greater than any concurrent increase in the population of
the country ; in average per capita consumption, nearly one third
of a gallon; in average increase in revenue of nearly $5,000,000
($4,910,000) per annum, the whole culminating for the fiscal year
(1893) in a product of 99,000,000 gallons, an annual revenue of
$89,000,000, and a per capita consumption of 1*48 gallons. During
the same period the per capita consumption of all spirits, domestic
and foreign, in Great Britain was about 1'063 gallons.
The financial troubles and business depressions in Europe and
other countries during the years 1892 and 1893 do not appear to
