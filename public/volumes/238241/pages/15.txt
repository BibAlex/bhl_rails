mand that lie be given his freedom, had followed precedents, he
would have denied the application, for such precedents were
opposed to it. But recognizing the change which an advanced
civilization had effected in the government of the English peo-
ple, and that the slave was held, to quote his language, " in virtue
of positive law " (precedent), " which preserves its force long
after the reasons and occasions from whence it was created are
erased from memory," he granted the application ; and incorpo-
rated into the policy of the English Government the 'principle of
which the British people have ever since been proud that no
person can continue to be a slave after he has planted his foot on
English soil.
Other obstacles, at present almost insuperable, in the way of
establishing a correct system of taxation, are that the subject is
not properly taught, if taught at all, in the higher institutions of
learning of the United States and Great Britain ; that up to the
present time there is rarely if ever given a correct and scientific
definition of the terms "tax" and "taxation," which makes it
somewhat doubtful if those who talk about their meaning and
incidents know what they are talking about ; that there are no
text-books on the subject generally accepted as authoritative ;
that there is no clear and settled understanding even as to what
constitutes the main subject of taxation namely, property ; that
the meaning of terms which have formed the basis of statutes
and legal practice is entirely different in the United States and
other leading civilized nations ; and that, as a rule, professors of
economic science in the United States have failed to recognize in
their reasoning and teachings of this whole subject, that the Gov-
ernment of the United States, both Federal and State, differs in
many respects, both in theory and practice, from any other gov-
ernment that has heretofore existed ; and that therefore ideas and
experiences which are regarded as the basis of sound policy in
respect to taxation in the former are not accepted as such in the
latter. Thus the United States, alone of the great nations of the
world, regards debts and credits as property rightfully subject to
taxation. The United States is also the only nation in which the
taxation of exports is forbidden both to Federal and State gov-
ernments under any circumstances. To no other government,
furthermore, than that of the United States is applicable the fol-
lowing principle enunciated by the United States Supreme Court
(116 United States Reports, p. 631) respecting the assessment and
collection of taxes : " Any compulsory discovery, by extorting the
party's oath, or compelling the production of his private books
and papers to convict him of a crime or to forfeit his property, is
contrary to the principles of a free government. It is abhorrent
to the instincts of an American. It may suit the purposes of
