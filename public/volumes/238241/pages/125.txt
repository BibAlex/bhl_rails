of gravel in tlie old rock gorge is connected with the Glacial
period is clearly shown by the fact that these lower terraces can
be followed up the banks of every stream which comes out of the
glaciated region to the old ice border, where they emerge into the
moraines which were deposited directly by the ice. This is shown
in our map, on which a small portion of the glaciated area ap-
pears with Big Beaver and Little Beaver Creeks flowing out from
it. The gravel terraces at Brilliant and Steubenville are shown

on this, together with other remnants of this terrace farther up
the river.
Only those streams which rise in the glaciated area have such
terraces. The contrast between the Monongahela and the Alle-
ghany in this respect is very marked. The Alleghany River
throughout its course was gorged with this glacial gravel, but
the Monongahela River neither had the gravel within reach nor
the floods of water coming from the melting ice to distribute it if
it had been within reach, therefore the gravel terraces are absent.
