inconvenient but inevitable surplus. And it is a curious fact, and
one perhaps altogether unprecedented and almost unrecognized
in history, that from the years 1837 to 1857 there was rarely a sin-
gle fiscal year, in which the unexpended balance in the national
Treasury derived from a few sources at the end of the year,
was not in excess of one half of the total expenditure of the pre-
ceding year.*
To provide for the use, or rather to get rid of a continual sur-
plus, various plans were from time to time suggested. In one in-
stance the House of Representatives, on motion of Henry Clay (the
leading statesman of his day), seriously considered the question of
the expediency of the national Government becoming by purchase
and investment a partner in various stock corporations or enter-
prises; and pending any conclusion the surplus funds were de-
posited in the local or small State banks, with reiterated injunc-
tions " to loan liberally to merchants."
In 1836, the unexpended cash balance in the Treasury of the
United States reported as available for public purposes, being
$65,723,959 $46,001,467 of which was on deposit in ninety-one
different State banks Congress (by act of June 23d of that year)
appropriated the sum of $37,468,859 for distribution among the
States ; of which $27,063,430 was officially certified in September,
1837, as having been actually paid. Most of the States applied the
amount apportioned to them for educational purposes. Others
used it differently and less wisely: Massachusetts, for exami)le,
dividing her share proportionally among her towns and cities,
where it was expended at the discretion of the local authorities ;
in one instance, in a small fishing town, for the construction of
walks on the sands for the benefit of pedestrians ; and in others
for the purchase of houses and lands for the use and settlement
of the town's poor.
As might have been expected under such circumstances, fiscal
and economic subjects were during the period under considera-
tion, those that least of all attracted the attention of the Ameri-
can people. Few books or essays on such topics were either writ-
ten or read, while the continually increasing agitation and interest
respecting the existence or extension of negro slavery furnished

the United States were $12,390,000, or at the rate of %l.Q1 per capita of its whole popu-

From 1831 to 1841, $24,740,000, or $1.61 per capita.
From 1841 to 1851, $33,760,000, or $1.63 joer cajnta.
From 1851 to 1861, $57,870,000, or $2.06 _per capita.
For the year 1894 the total expenditures of the Federal Government, as officially re-
ported, were $442,605,758, or $6.08 per capita of the entire population of the country ; or
$4.50 less expenditure for pensions.
