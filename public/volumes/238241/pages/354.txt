IMITATION AMONG ATOMS AND ORGANISMS. 499
wear clothes, partly by social intolerance for human nudity in
public, and partly because of the facilities for obtaining clothes,
with all which that implies ; there will now be no game to pur-
sue and no need to pursue it, since the man's food supplies will
come from the agents of the industrial system ; he will soon lose
his primitive, many-sided industrial capacity, for he will have an
army of stock-raisers, farmers, tailors, shoemakers, house-build-
ers, and doctors at his service ; while in time society will impose,
in place of the powers which it abstracts, new functions and ac-
tivities, assimilating him industrially to the units of which it is
already composed. In both these cases, moreover, likeness will
be enforced by the resistance offered to unlikeness, and not by
any inherent superiority of one system or any inherent inferi-
ority of another ; for savages who have not yet learned to co-
operate are as much held to their rude industrial methods by the
stresses that impel to likeness as civilized men are held by such
stresses to the vastly more complex and highly organized activi-
ties of the modern society.
The same is true of nonindustrial forms of social organiza-
tion. As a community imposes its industrial methods upon its own
and upon intruding members, whether it represent a high or a
low stage of human society, so does a community, quite irrespect-
ive of the degree of its development, insist upon a certain like-
ness of habits and customs in the units of which it is composed.
A civilized man forced to live among savages will find it impos-
sible to avoid barbarous methods of living, just as a savage com-
pelled to sojourn in a civilized community will inevitably adopt
the manners of the race among whom his lot is cast. In all com-
munities whatsoever, and under ordinary circumstances valid for
the majority of men, it is vastly easier to imitate others in general
characters than to diifer from them in those characters, while the
difliculty of differing becomes almost insuperable when the stresses
tending to assimilate the individual to the sum of individuals are
exerted directly by the group or community as a whole. All acts
of race assimilation in history many of them already accom-
plished, some of them still going on all so-called civilizing pro-
cesses, whether carried out by individuals or by peoples, and all
proselytizing movements, by whomsoever conducted, are but so
many illustrations of the general process. Such modifications,
moreover, as have been wrought in the native races of India, and
in the negro of the United States, by dominant populations in
those countries, are going on within each nation, each city, and
every social group, however large or small its dimensions may be.
For if the traveler, when living in strange countries, finds it
expedient, if only temporarily, to conform to the customs of the
people he meets such customs being imposed upon him by the
