made a north and south section across the
island from Havana to Batabanos. Going
to Baiacoa, he examined the country west
of Yunque Mountain and east to Cape Maysi.
Having completed his work of an original
examination of the phenomena, uninfluenced
by preconceived hypotheses, he read what
others had written of Cuba, and was pleased
to find a general agreement between their
views and his. The notes are published by
the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zo-
ology.
8elf Culture is the name of a monthly
magazine devoted to the interests of the
Home University League, edited by Edward
C. Towne and published by the Werner Com-
pany, Chicago and New York. Among the
subjects of articles in Vol. I, No. 2, are : Eli
AVhitney, a Shakespeare of Invention ; The
Supposed Electrical Character of Vitality;
The Principle of Evolution in Nature ; Primi-
tive Man ; The Story of the Plague in History ;

Under the title The JEnsential Man, an
argument in support of the belief in immor-
tality is presented by Gewge Croncell Cres-
set/ (Ellis, 15 cents). Among the circum-
stances which he deems indicative of a
future life are the great difference between
the mind of man and the material forces,
the fact that no force is ever destroyed, the
eventual cessation of all physical life on the
earth, and the general diffusion of the doc-
trine in one form or another.
