increases and tlie demand for it becomes more urgent. The pro-
portion of increase of carbonic acid and of diminution of oxygen
wliich has been found to exist in badly ventilated churches,
schools, theaters, or barracks is not suflBciently great to account
for the discomfort which such conditions produce in many per-
sons, and there is no evidence to show that such an amount of
change in the normal proportion of these gases has any influence
upon the increase of death-rates which statistical evidence has
shown to exist among persons living in crowded and unventilated
rooms. It has been well established by observation and statistics
that tuberculosis and pneumonia are the diseases most prevalent
among persons living and working in unventilated rooms. But
consumption and pneumonia are caused by specific bacteria, which
for the most part gain access to the air passages by adhering to
particles of dust which are inhaled, and it is probable that the
greater liability to these diseases of persons living in crowded and
unventilated rooms is to a large extent due to the special liability
of such rooms to become infected with the germs of these diseases-
The discomfort produced by crowded, ill-ventilated rooms in
persons not accustomed to them is not due to the excess of car-
bonic acid, nor to bacteria, nor in most cases to dusts of any
kind. The two great causes of such discomfort, though not the
only ones, are excessive temperature and unpleasant odors. The
cause of the unpleasant, musty odor which is perceptible to most
persons on passing from the outer air into a crowded, unven-
tilated room is unknown; it may, in part, be due to volatile
products of decomposition contained in the expired air of per-
sons having decayed teeth, foul mouths, or certain disorders of
the digestive apparatus, and it is due in part to volatile fatty
acids given off with, or produced from, the excretions of the skin.
The results of this investigation, taken in connection with the re-
sults of other recent researches, indicate that some of the theories
upon which modern systems of ventilation are based are either
without foundation or doubtful, and that the problem of securing
comfort and health in inhabited rooms requires the consideration
of the best methods of preventing or disposing of dusts of various
kinds, of properly regulating temperature and moisture, and of
preventing the entrance of poisonous gases, like carbonic oxide
derived from heating and lighting apparatus, rather than upon
simply diluting the air to a certain standard of proportion of car-
bonic acid present.
It would be unwise, however, to conclude from the facts given
in this report that the standards of air supply for the ventilation
of inhabited rooms, which are based on the results of Pettenkofer's
work, are too large.
