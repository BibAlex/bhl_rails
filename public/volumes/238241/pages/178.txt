HAS IMMIGRATION INCREASED POPULATION? 249
lation. France is pointed out as an instance wliere the rate of
growth has become very low because of the fashion the French
have acquired, even in the middle classes, of restricting the size
of their families.
The illustration, however, is not altogether fortunate for those
who use it. The French annual rate of increase, it is true, sank
very low during the four or five years previous to the Prussian
War, being only seven per thousand inhabitants in 1870. But
since then it has steadily risen, and in 1890 was thirty-seven per
thousand.* In fact, France is an excellent illustration to show
how mere ideas and opinions affect the growth of population, and
how the rate of increase may be depressed by discontent or disas-
ter, or raised by the desire to conquer an old enemy or by the suc-
cess of a new form of government.
But is it true as a general proposition that advanced civiliza-
tion decreases the rate of population ? There is a feeling among
many people, who have not thought much on the subject, that the
more animal-like we become, the more we multiply, and that the
lower types of civilization necessarily increase more rapidly than
the higher. But this is very far from the truth.
Savages and uncivilized races are not, as a rule, of very rapid
increase. They often recede and whole tribes of them become
extinct. If we look at the whole world, it is the uncivilized popu-
lations that are disappearing. Before the coming of the English
to the United States the red men had held the country with all its
natural fertility and resources for hundreds of years, and yet had
not been able to increase themselves to a million. During the
middle ages, from the year 500 to 1500, a period of a thousand
years, we find the population of Europe in all stages of barbarism
and low civilization, and yet the increase of population was very
slow. In the year 500 Europe was supposed to have something
over 40,000,000 people. In the year 1500 the highest estimate is
70,000,000. Thus in a thousand years the population had not
doubled. But after the year 1500, under the influence of the Refor-
mation and modern civilization, the population doubled in three
hundred years. f
Another excellent illustration to show the effect of modern
civilization is the growth of the English people.
