HAS IMMIGRATION INCREASED POPULATION? 253
wliole population, with the greatest immigration added, kept
steadily falling.
What shall be said of the last decade, 1880-'90, when the increase
of the whole population, with a still greater immigration added,
has fallen to a rate which is four per cent lower than the rate of
the native whites during the Revolution ? Is this a crowded coun-
try ? We have sixty-five millions in a territory which every one
admits can easily support four hundred millions. Is this a
luxurious, worn-out, jaded country ? Where, how, and by what ?
Possibly among a fraction of the population in a few great cities.
But they do not constitute the country. Look at the small towns,
the great country districts, the masses of the people, and where
are the signs of the luxury that enervates ? Fashionable society
has grown in recent years ; but even admitting that it has grown
to the fullest possible extent, and that it is guilty of all the folly
with which it is charged, it has not yet become one fortieth part
of the population.
Spain is said to be an old, worn-out nation, but during the ten
years from 1880 to 1800 she increased the annual rate of her
growth from 35 per thousand to 54 per thousand. Even France,
though her rate had fallen very low in 1870, has steadily increased
it in the last twenty years, and raised it from 7 per thousand in-
habitants in 1870 to 37 per thousand in 1890. England has stead-
ily increased her rate in the last twenty years. So has Russia,
whose rate is very high, being 105 per thousand in 1870, 130 in
1880, and 140 in 1890. Holland, a very old and closely settled
country, has increased her rate in almost the same proportions, 80
per thousand in 1870, 118 in 1880, and 135 in 1890. Belgium's rate
is not far behind.*
Of all these countries none are superior to the United States
in natural fertility and resources. Most of them are much infe-
rior, and have a larger proportion of people to the square mile.
The United States has only 21"31 to the square mile; f but Russia
has 42, Spain 86, Great Britain 184, France 320, Holland 350, and
Belgium 530.
If we are right in believing that the lowering of the rate of
native growth was due to the increase of foreigners, then immi-
gration has not materially increased, but, on the contrary, has
somewhat decreased the American population. If the native
population had kept up an increase per decade of only 34 per
cent, which was less than it had in the twenty years 1790 to
1810, and immigration had ceased, the white population would

f The average of 21-31 per square mile for the United States is calculated on the total
land area, exclusive of Alaska and Indian Territory.
