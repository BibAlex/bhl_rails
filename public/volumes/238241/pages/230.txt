PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION. 313
found little favor in respect to its recommendation of tax abate-
ment ; and the general sentiment both in and out of Congress was
expressed by a leading member of the House of Representatives,
who publicly declared that " he was not ready to admit that the
nation which had put down such a great rebellion at the cost of
so much blood and treasure could not collect a tax of two dollars
a gallon on whisky." * The two-dollar tax therefore was allowed
to remain in force, and the tax experiences of the United States
from 1865 to 1809 inclusive, in respect to spirits, viewed from the
standpoint of finance, economics, and morals, constitute one of the
most interesting, instructive, and disgraceful chapters in its his-
tory. Under the strong temptations of large and almost certain
gains, men rushed into schemes for defrauding the revenue with
the zeal of enthusiasts for new gold fields ; and the ingenuity of
the American people has never had more striking illustrations
than was offered in their devices for evading the tax and provid-
ing for security against detection and punishment in so doing.
The parties concerned in these transactions also showed through-
out more ability than Congress and more shrewdness than the
revenue department of the national Treasury; and at a later
period a Secretary of the Treasury was obliged to resort to the
use of a cipher for his telegraphic and written correspondence, in
order to prevent the frustration of his plans for the enforcement
of the laws by Treasury ofiicials who were specially charged with
their administration. The evidence in part confirmatory of these
statements is as follows :
The revenue directly collected during the fiscal year 1866 (the
first full year under the two-dollar tax) from spirits distilled from
other materials than fruits f was $29,198,000, and in 1867 $28,296,000,
indicating an annual product respectively of 14,599,000 and 14,148,-
000 gallons. But during the succeeding year, 1868, with no ap-
parent reason for any diminution in the national production and
consumption of spirits, and with no increase, but rather a diminu-
tion, in the volume of imported spirits, the total direct revenue
from the same source was but $13,419,092, indicating a production,
of only 6,709,546 gallons.
As the consumption of distilled spirits in this latter year was
probably not less than 50,000,000 gallons, and as out of this the
Government collected a tax upon less than 7,000,000, the sale of
the difference at the current market rates of the year, less the
* Of the then leading members of Congress, only two the late President Garfield and
Hon. W. B. Allison, both members of the House of Representatives indorsed the recom-
mendation of the commissioner at the outset.
f The revenue derived from the taxation of spirits distilled from fruits has always been
comparatively small: $283,499 in 1866 ; $868,145 in 1867.
