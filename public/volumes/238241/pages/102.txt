foreign-born denizens ; sickness does not pre-
vail in them to any greater extent, and most
of the bacteria found in the air of the tene-
ments are harmless ; the occupations of the
slum population are as varied as those fol-
lowed in other districts, and their earnings
are " quite up to the average earnings of the
people generally and at large." But few
tenements could be reported as in excellent
sanitary condition ; in Philadelphia and Bal-
timore those classed as good formed the
largest division, while in New York and Chi-
cago those reported as fair were the largest
class. Cases of overcrowding were numerous.
Part XXVII of the Proceedings of (lie
Society for Psychical Research opens with an
account of some experiments in thought
transference, by Henry G. Rawson, in which
drawings were reproduced and cards were
named correctly in a large proportion of
cases. The chief contribution in the num-
ber is a second installment of the experiences
of the late W. Stainton Moses, communicated
by r. W. H. Myers. These experiences are
what are commonly known as spiritual com-
munications. There is also a paper on the
Apparent Sources of Subliminal Messages,
and reviews of books on hypnotism, the ex-
posure of Mme. Blavatsky, and other psy-
chical subjects.
In The Coming Revolution (Boston,
Arena Publishing Compnny) the position is
assumed by Henry L. Call that the prevail-
ing discontent among the " toiling masses "
is a sign that the present conditions of so-
ciety and the relations of the rich and the
wage workers are all wrong and a revulsion
is imminent. The author accordingly begins
his diagnosis with an examination into the
condition of society, and follows it up with
inquiries into the causes that have produced
that condition ; the nature of these causes,
and whether they rightfully admit of a rem-
edy and its justification ; the application of
the remedy to each of the causes in turn ;
the effects of the remedy ; and the manner
in which it is to be achieved. The causes
of the trouble are abuses of privilege of a
political nature and origin. The remedy is
to enforce the law of freedom of social
and industrial as well as political freedom ;
and it is to be secured by political means.
