The garden of forestry, situated about halfway up the old vol-
cano of Gedd, is planted chiefly with Australian and Japanese trees
and shrubs. Of these, perhaps the most remarkable are the curi-
ous specimens of the Australian Xantoroa actinis in front of the
mountain pavilion. The forest of Tjibodas, in which the garden

spots.

Gedd, and seems to grow more and more interesting. Translated
for the Popular Science Monthly from La Nature.
