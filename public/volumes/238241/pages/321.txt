POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY
2. A prize of two thousand dollars for the most satisfactory
essay upon (a) the known properties of atmospheric air, consid-
ered in their relationships to research in every department of
natural science, and the importance of a study of the atmosphere,
considered in view of these relationships ; (6) the proper direction
of future research, in connection with the imperfections of our
knowledge of atmospheric air, and of the connections of that
knowledge with other sciences.
3. A prize of one thousand dollars for the best popular treatise
upon atmospheric air, its properties and relationships (including
those to hygiene, physical
and mental). This essay
need not exceed twenty
thousand words in length ;
it should be written in sim-

popular instruction.
4. The Hodgkins medal
of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution will be awarded an-
nually, or biennially, for
important contributions to
our knowledge of the na-
ture and properties of at-
mospheric air, or for prac-
tical applications of our ex-
isting knowledge of them
to the welfare of mankind.
The medal will be of gold,

or bronze.
The treatises may be

Provision was made in the circular for a committee of award,
