seven million dollars for the entire country.
Finally, there has been one most serious and unfortunate mis-
take, which nearly all who have undertaken to discuss the prin-
ciples and practice of taxation have been prone to make a mis-
take, moreover, which more than all else is responsible for the
opinion which has come so generally to prevail, that the subject
of taxation, through lack of any fixed principles or axioms, does
not as yet rise to the dignity of a science ; and that its practice at
the best can be but a sort of empiricism, to be varied in propor-
tion to the strength which a Government possesses to enforce its
enactments, or in proportion to the prejudices of the people who
are to be called on for a contribution. The mistake consists in
taking up the subject for investigation and discussion, if we may
so express it, wrong end foremost ; or in devoting time and effort
to warring against abuses ; or in attempting to show how certain
forms of taxation commend themselves in respect to productive-
ness, freedom from personal inquisition, and economy in collec-
tion, and how others are to be avoided for contrary reasons ; and
in not attempting to inquire whether the whole subject was un-
derlaid by any general laws in accordance with which the contri-
butions which the State is compelled as a condition of its exist-
ence to exact of its citizens diffuse themselves ; and which laws,
being once determined, will constitute a certain and sure founda-
tion on which practical administration can be based and conducted.
The fact that such laws exist and only await discovery may
be predicated, as it were, from surface indications, in the form of
a great variety of disconnected economic facts, with just as much
of certainty as the miner who, picking up here and there in the
beds of streams fragments of coal or ore which the elements have
scattered, predicates that somewhere there must be a larger vein
or deposit from which the fragments have been derived.
The aggregates of the sums required by the governments of
the world for their support are annually increasing, but probably
in no greater ratio than the increase in their wealth, or property
rightfully subject to taxation ; and in those states in which there
is a marked and continued increase in the control of the forces of
nature for production, the ratio of taxation to aggregate wealth
undoubtedly tends to diminish.
That there are, however, some striking illustrations that seem
to prove to the contrary, is not to be denied. Thus, we have a
recent statement that the expenses of the city of Philadelphia in
eight years have increased two hundred and thirty per cent, while
the taxable valuation of property in the same time has increased
only twenty-five per cent. In 18G2 the aggregate taxation of the
