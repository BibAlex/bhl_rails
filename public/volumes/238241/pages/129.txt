five per cent of those measured (see Chart A, No. 1), his length of
legs rises to the hundred-per-cent class. The girth of the neck is
small, but the low chest measurement is due to its rounded shape.

Its expansive power of seven inches is extraordinary in a chest of
that shape. The muscle girths of his arms are exceeded by eighty
per cent of young men, while the elbows and wrists show rather
heavy bones. The rather small thigh girths will be due partly
to their great length. The size of his calves shows about average
development to be attributed to bicycling largely but the in-
steps are very large, and his photos show a flat foot. The neck
and chest are broad, as would be the shoulders if he had better
arm muscles. The " bicycle stoop," amounting almost to deform-
ity in his case, brings the depth of chest up to the one-hundred-

pull himself up by his arms more than two and a half times, and
one dip on the parallels is the extent of his ability. His pulse is
