11. THE PLACE OF TAXATION IN LITERATURE AND HISTORY.
ONE of the great historians of the present century has ex-
pressed disappointment at what he terms the "emptiness"
of historical study, and accordingly inclines to the opinion that
guidance in respect to human affairs in the future is to be sought
for in present rather than in past experiences. Nevertheless,
it would seem to stand to reason, that when any department of
knowledge, especially one characterized by controverted ques-
tions, is to be comprehensively examined, with the prime object
of determining the best methods for human action, it would not
be expedient to attempt to discover or discuss any abstract prin-
ciples which ought to govern such action, until at least a sum-
mary of facts derived from experience and essential to correct
conclusions had been presented and made familiar, and, acting
on this assumption, it is proposed next to ask attention ^rs^, to
the place of taxation, considered as a department of knowledge,
in general literature ; and, second, to some points of historical
interest, growing out of the appropriation of states or rulers of
the property of their citizens or subjects for real or assumed
public purposes. It is believed that in this way the discussion
at a later period of the principles growing out of the exercise
by governments of this great prerogative may be facilitated and
rendered more attractive.*
