height of over three hundred feet, directly from the water at
ordinary level. On the Ohio side there is a flood-plain from fifty

low water. Along the west side of this flood-plain is located the
river division of the Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad, along the
foot of the high-level terrace. This terrace ranges from sixty-five
to eighty feet above low water. Excavations in this terrace to a
depth of forty-three feet show it to consist of interstratified sand,
fine gravel, and clay in small quantities, all with rare exceptions
