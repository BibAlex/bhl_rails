If it be an axiom in political and social as well as physical and
natural science, that the first requisite for progress consists in the
correct observation and recording of phenomena, whereby old laws
or principles may be verified or extended and new ones discovered,
it would be difficult to imagine a field more fruitful for investiga-
tion and more promising of reward than the financial and indus-
trial experiences of the United States immediately anterior and
subsequent to the outbreak of the civil war experiences which
had truly the character of vast social and political experiments,
made on a scale of magnitude rarely if ever before equaled ; for the
most part emphatically tentative in character, and affecting in
their results not only the growth, the income, and the industrial
pursuits of the nation directly and immediately concerned, but also
in a greater or less degree the trade and commerce of the whole
world.
At the breaking ont of the civil war in 1861, the United States
was in the anomalous position of a great nation practically unen-
cumbered with a national or public debt. Excise, stamp, income,
license, and direct or general property taxes under the Federal
Government were absolutely unknown ; the expenses of a simple
and economical administration being defrayed almost entirely by
indirect taxes, levied in the form of a tariff on the importation of
foreign products or merchandise. In fact, the only other notice-
able source of national revenue was from the sale of public lands,
which, at a maximum price fixed by law of one dollar and a quar-
ter per acre, returned to the Treasury an average income of from
one to three millions of dollars per annum ; rising in a few in-
stances, during periods of wild speculation to six, fourteen, and
in one exceptional year (1836) to even twenty-four millions of
dollars.
The average rate of duties imposed on the aggregate value of
foreign importations during the thirty years immediately preced-
ing 1860 was about twenty per cent ; but for a portion of the time
the annual rate was much less, and for a number of years 1834,
to 1843 and 1858 to 1861 inclusive it was not in excess of fifteen
per cent.
But notwithstanding these limitations on the sources and
amount of income, the requirements of the national Government
for all purposes were so moderate that the receipts of its Treasury
continually tended to exceed its disbursements ; and the difficulty
which most frequently presented itself to its financial administra-
tors, was not the customary one in all other countries, of how to
avoid an annual deficit, but rather how to manage to escape an
