ance unnecessary.* And, pending its modification for the pur-
pose of reduction, a desire to evade the payment of taxes every-
where manifested itself, until it seemed at one time as if the
whole country and the Government itself were becoming cor-
rupted and demoralized. For example, the revenue receipts
from the income tax, without any change in the law, declined
from $72,982,000 in 1860 to $66,014,000 in 1867; and those from a
uniform tax on distilled spirits, from about $29,000,000 in 1867 to
a little in excess of $14,000,000 in 1868.
It was under such circumstances that the Revenue Commis-
sion entered upon its prescribed duties. The work of investiga-
tion devolved mainly on its chairman, the second member being
debarred by age and feeble health from any active exertion ; while
the third assumed from the outset that the best and most feasible
way of meeting the financial difficulties of the situation was to
abandon the " whole system" (of existing taxation) "in the short-
est time consistent with the general interests of the country," and,
by an amendment to the Federal Constitution, authorize and re-
quire the Federal Government to levy " a duty, payable in lawful
money, of one per centum per annum " on the income of all inter-
est-bearing indebtedness issued by the United States and payable
in lawful money ; and " a duty, payable in specie, of seven tenths
of one per centum on the principal of all indebtedness of the United
States, which shall belong to any person or corporation, and the
interest on which may be payable in specie." He was also of the
opinion that such taxes on the income or principal of the indebted-
ness of the United States, should be " in addition to any ordinary
duty or tax equally imposed upon all incomes, or directly upon
all personal and real property within the United States subject to
taxation."
A subsequent report to this effect was not received with any
marked disfavor by the general public, and had the indorsement of
not a few leading American bankers and capitalists. As the aver-
age annual rate of interest accruing on the market price of the
gold bonds issued by the United States from January, 1862, to Janu-
ary, 1866, was 8"82 per cent, and on investments in the debt of the
United States payable in lawful money, from 1863 to 1866, was
10'68 per cent, the proposition to levy a tax of one per cent on the

the termination of the war finds striking illustration in the following examples of actual
experience. Thus the tax of six pcsr cent, levied and collected during the fiscal year 1864-
'65, on the value of the products of the woolen industry in Massachusetts alone ($48,430,-
6*71) was ecpiivalent to nearly twenty per cent on the whole capital ($14,735,671) in-
vested in this business ; while the tax on the value of boots and shoes manufactured in the
same State during the same year ($52,915,243) was equal to thirty per cent on the whole
capital employed ($10,067,474).
