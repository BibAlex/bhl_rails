THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 463
First Prize, of ten thousand dollars, for a treatise embodying
some new and important discoveries in regard to the nature and
properties of atmospheric air, to Lord Rayleigh, of London, and
Prof. William Ramsay, of the University College, London, for
the discovery of argon.
Second Prize, of two thousand dollars, not awarded, owing to
the failure of any contestant to comply strictly with the terms of
the offer.
Third Prize, of one thousand dollars, to Dr. Henry de Varigny,
of Paris, for the best popular treatise upon atmospheric air, its
properties and relationships. Dr. de Varigny's essay is entitled
L'Air et la Vie.
Besides these capital prizes, three silver medals and six bronze
medals, coupled with honorable mention, were awarded to gentle-
men for essays of great merit. To name all those awarded honor-
able mention would occupy more space than at our command.
On November 7th, Lord Rayleigh and Prof. William Ramsay
called at the United States embassy, London, and received from
the Secretary a check for ten thousand dollars, communicated by
the Smithsonian Institution. It was a fortunate circumstance
that the Smithsonian had the opportunity of awarding the first
prize for so momentous a discovery as that of argon.
