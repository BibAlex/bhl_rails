A study of any of these tables will convince one that there is
an enormous exaggeration in the way the cheap-money men talk
about the fall of prices. While there has been to some extent a
fall in the price of most products in centers of trade, it is by no
means very extensive or portentous.
According to Mulhall (History of Prices, page 7), cotton in the
United States averages thirty-three per cent higher in 1881-'83
than in 1841-'50 ; and wheat two per cent higher. Owing, how-
ever, to the great fall in transportation, and to improvements in
agricultural machinery, the farmers' increased remuneration is
by no means expressed by these figures. For corn the showing
is still better, probably amounting to something like one hundred
per cent for the average American farmer. During the same
period pork has risen fifty-six per cent ; tobacco, forty-four per
cent ; butter, forty-five per cent, and cheese eighty per cent all in
centers of distribution, while they have risen still more in the
hands of the producer. If my personal recollection is at all
reliable, we pay in Toledo, Ohio, to-day more for eggs, chickens,
potatoes, and fruits than twenty years ago in greenbacks. Thus,
by a little discrimination, we see that the " great fall in prices,"
so often and so lugubriously spoken of, is in the great centers
where the consumers and not where the producers live. In-
stead, therefore, of being a calamity, this fall in prices has
been an unmixed blessing. The farmer gets more for his prod-
uct; the city man pays less. Such has been the result of the
construction of railroads, the most beneficent and far-reach-
ing of all practical inventions. And yet, with locomotive whis-
tles reaching well-nigh every ear in the country, from lines of
railroads having a mileage of nearly one hundred and seventy
thousand in the United States, our free-silver friends ignore their
existence, and, on the basis of London prices in former times,
build up a purely imaginary farmers' paradise in contemporary
America.
The evidence afforded by wages shows either that the money
standard has not risen, as claimed, or that the working classes
have received an astounding increase of wages. Take the trades
in which the conditions are wholly or comparatively unchanged
