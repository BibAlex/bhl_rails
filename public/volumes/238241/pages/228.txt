PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION. 311
cents again finds explanation in tlie fact that when it became evi-
dent to the distillers that the fiscal necessities of the Government
would soon compel an advance in the tax upon their product, and
that such increase would not be made applicable to stocks on hand
on which the lower rates had been assessed and paid, they pushed
their production to the uttermost in order that they might take
advantage of the great increase in the market price of all spirits
after the advanced rates had taken effect ; all which anticipations
were fully realized. Thus, of the 85,295,393 gallons on which the
Internal Revenue Bureau assessed and collected the spirit tax for
1864 69,000,000 in excess of the product of the preceding year at
least 70,000,000 gallons were manufactured prior to the 7th of March
and were released from Government control by the payment of
the twenty-cent tax only ; and as after the 7th of March, 1864, the
market price of the greater part of this increased product, which
had not been allowed to pass into consumption, was advanced in
accordance with the advance in the tax i. e., forty cents per gal-
lon it is clear that $28,000,000 at least were thus at once legislated
into the jjockets of the distillers and speculators concerned.
Again, immediately after the imposition of the sixty-cent rate
in March, 1864, nearly all the distilleries once more suspended
operation ; the country was acknowledged to be overstocked with
tax-paid whisky, and the Government almost ceased to collect
taxes upon its manufacture. In May, however, the project for a
further increase in the rates began to be again agitated in Con-
gress, and as soon as its realization became probable, all the dis-
tilleries speedily resumed operations. How great at that time
was the capacity of the loyal States for production may be in-
ferred from the circumstance that the number of distilleries in
the country, which according to the census of 1860 was 1,138, had
increased in 1864 to 2,415.
On the 1st of July, 1864, the tax was again advanced from sixty
cents to a dollar and a half per gallon ; and during that month the
entire product of the country of which the revenue officials could
take cognizance was only 697,090 gallons. How great a "stock on
hand," the result of manufacturing under the twenty and sixty
cent rates of tax, was carried over the 1st of July and experienced
the advance of ninety cents per gallon in market price in conse-
quence of the advance in the tax from sixty cents to a dollar and
a half, can not be accurately known ; but 60,000,000 gallons would
certainly be a low estimate ; and on this amount the profit that
accrued to private interests was at least $50,000,000.
On the 1st of January, 1865 (the succeeding year), the tax was
further advanced to two dollars per proof gallon, when all the
operations above described were repeated, with all the benefits to
private or speculative interests derived from former experiences,
