But the most tangible and solid evidence that can be found
on the subject lies probably in the history of the production
of gold. On page 174 of the Report of the Director of the
Mint for 1894 is a table giving a statement of the annual
product of gold from the discovery of America. It may be
summarized as follows :
Periods. Average annual product.
1493 to 1520 $3,855,000
lYOl to 1*720 8,520,000
1801 to 1810 11,815,000
1850 to 1855 132,613,000
1890 1 18,849,000
1893 157,222,000
Prior to the Californian period the average product for three
hundred and fifty years was about $8,794,000. Before 1493 it was
still less. The value of gold therefore its standing relatively to
other commodities may be said to have been determined by this
long-continued rate of production. Then almost in the twinkling
of ai;i eye came the Californian and Australian discoveries. The
annual product of gold became nearly twenty times what it had
been : and this rate of production has not only been substantially
maintained, but is now showing a rapid increase. The extraor-
dinary contrast between the annual product of gold prior to and
after 1850 deserves a diagram :

It is therefore difficult to imagine that gold has appreciated
fifty per cent, or to any other extent, in the face of this wonderful
and continuous production.! The facts above stated its standing
relative to labor, land, and commodities not greatly affected by
modern conditions, the economy in its use effected by banks and
checks, and its novel rate of production lead me, on the contrary,
to think that since 1845 gold has suffered a slight decline, some-
* Mulhall, History of Prices, p. 11. "Notwithstanding the gi'cat increase which has
taken place in the means of all classes during the interval, the average Englishman of the
present day consumes less gold than the Englishman of fifty years back." (J. E. Cairaes,
Essays, p. 134.) M. Chevalier likewise finds a decrease in the consumption of gold for
tableware purposes during the present century, both in England and France.
f J. E. Cairnes (Essays, p. 115) states the gold production of the three hundred and
fifty-six years from 1492 to 1848 to have been, in round numbers, 400,000,000 an
amount nearly supplied, as he states, every decade at the present rate of production.
