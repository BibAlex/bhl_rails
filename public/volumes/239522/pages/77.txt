the red form changing to yellow at this temperature, and that presum-
ably the yellow had the larger volume, so that the transition line would
rise with increasing pressure. It will be easier to follow the descrip-
tion of the many runs made with this substance to turn at once to the
phase diagram of Figure 24. The first run was made at room tempera-
ture, and no transition was found to 12000. Temperature was then
raised to 150°, and transition found at about 8000 with very wide limits
of indifference. Other points were then found at 108°, 141°, 159°;
the pressure limits are indicated in the diagram. Temperature was
then raised to 200°, and no trace whatever of the transition could be
found between 12000 and 700. Pressure was then raised to 6800, and
temperature reduced to 160°, but no transition could be found down

Figure 26. Mercuric Iodide. The computed values of the heat of transi-
tion and the change of internal energy
to 700. This was difficult to explain. What had become of the
transition found at lower temperature and also of that at atmospheric
pressure at 127°? On starting again at room temperature, raising
pressure to 8400 and temperature to 162°, the transition was found
again where expected, but on raising temperature to 180°, the transi-
tion disappeared. Another run at 185°, however, indicated a transi-
tion at 9600, but this was later traced to leak. Several other curious
effects between 160° and 200°, and 8000 to 12000 kgm. were also later
traced to leak, but were at first thought to be due to another transition.
At this stage the most plausible explanation seemed to be a rising
transition curve from 1 kgm. and 127° to about 7500 and 160°, and
here a triple point with the curve found below 160°, and the supposed
curve above 160°. To test this, temperature was raised from 126°
