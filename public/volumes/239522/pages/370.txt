11. NEW, RECLASSIFIED, OR OTHERWISE NOTEWORTHY
SPERMATOPHYTES.
By B. L. Robinson.
Cleome aculeata L. Syst, ed. 12, iii. 232 (1768). To the synonymy
of this species should be added C. sinaloensis Brandegee, Zoe, v. 198
(1905). Authentic material of the latter, now in the Gray Herbarium,
appears to agree in all features with South American specimens of C.
aculeata L. The species has also been found elsewhere in Mexico, in
Guatemala (Beam, no. 349), and in Honduras {Thieme, no. 5135 of
J. D. Smith's distrib.). It thus seems to be an annual weed of rather
wide distribution in tropical and subtropical America. The species
was originally described by Linnaeus from American material and has
been generally regarded as exclusively of this continent, but it is diffi-
cult to find a single character on which to separate from it the West
African C. ciliata Schum. & Thonn. Besk. Guin. PI. ii. 68 (1828)
and C. guineensis Hook. f. in Hook. Nig. Fl. 218 (1849).
C. Fischeri, nom. nov. C. serrulata Pax in Engl. Bot. Jahrb. xiv.
293 (1892), not Pursh, Fl. Bor. Am. ii. 441 (1814). Pursh's homonym,
rejected by Dr. Gray and by many other botanists owing to its in-
appropriate and undescriptive character, is now being re-established
according to the International Rules of Botanical Nomenclature.
Consequently the later homonym of Pax must be renamed.
The next three new combinations, found necessary during recent
work of Mr. George Safford Torrey, temporary assistant at the Gray
Herbarium, are here published at Mr. Torrey's request.
HosACKiA AMERICANA (Nutt.) Piper, var. glabra (Nutt.) G. S.
Torrey, comb. nov. H. elata, j3. glabra Nutt. in Torr. & Gray, Fl. N.
Am. i. 327 (1838).
PiRiQUETA CAROLiNiANA (Walt.) Urb., var. viridis (Small) G. S.
Torrey, comb. nov. P. viridis Small, Fl. S. E. U. S. 794, 1335 (1903).
Distinguished from varieties of the variable P. caroliniana merely by
the degree of pubescence, and possessing no distinctive habitat or
geographical range, this form seems hardly worthy of specific rank.
Lyonia fruticosa (MicLx.) G. S. Torrey, comb. nov. Andromeda
ferruginea /3. fruticosa Michx. Fl. Am. Bor. i. 252 (1803). A. ferruginea
Pursh, Fl. Am. Sept. i. 292 (1814), not A. ferruginea Walt. Fl. Car.
