Introduction. â€” It is the chief purpose of this paper to present the
results of a quantitative microscopic and chemical study of certain
perthitic feldspars from granite pegmatites.
The feldspars here considered are all from granite pegmatites from
widely separated localities. They show a considerable range in the
relative proportions of the two feldspar phases present, and were
found upon examination to be satisfactorily free from foreign inclu-
sions and from alteration. The number of specimens originally chosen
for study was ten. Of these four were unfortunately sent to Europe
during the early summer of 1914 for sectioning and have been held
there because of the war, so that the results of the investigation
can not, at this time, be made quite as comprehensive as was origi-
nally planned. However, as it is believed to be unlikely that the
results obtained from the study of these four feldspars would have
materially modified those obtained from the six remaining prepara-
tions, plus the two studied by Makinen, and here included, it has
