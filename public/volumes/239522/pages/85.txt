of sensitiveness of the pressure measurements. We conclude, there-
fore, that the transition Hne rises to the triple point with no percepti-
ble change of direction, and that the curvature found by Tammann
must have been an effect of the impurity.
Tammann determined the phase diagram with two specimens, one
somewhat purer than the other. In the following comparison of
his results with those found here only the data of his pure sample
will be used. His L-I curve is 0.3° lower than mine at atmospheric
pressure, and 1.2° lower at 2000. At 20° his I-II line is 50 kgm.
higher than mine, and 4 kgm. lower at 60°; this is an effect of the
curA'ature found by Tammann. Above the triple point, his L-II
curve runs lower than mine and with a smaller slope; at 2600 it is
about 3° lower. He finds as the coordinates of the triple point 2196,
kgm. and 62.8° against 2085 and 64.0° of mine. The discrepancies
are at least in part due to impurity. Tammann's value for AT at
atmospheric pressure, 0.0163, is much lower than mine; he recognizes
that his value is too low, due to impurity. His value for AV, I-II,
is also very much lower than that found here, 0.0315 against 0.0568 at
40°. Curiously, however, his value for AT, L-I, at the triple point is
almost exactly that found here, 0.0273 against 0.0270.
Besides Tammann's values at low pressures there are also a number
of other values for comparison. Hulett ^^ has measured the effect
of pressure on the melting point up to 300 kgm. He finds for the
melting point 40.75° against 40.87° above, and for the initial slope
0.0149° per kgm. against 0.0140 above. It should be remarked that
the value of Hulett for the melting point is sometimes misquoted as
41.11°, because of a misprint in the original paper by which the
melting point under 25 kgm. is given twice, once as that at atmospheric
pressure. Other values for the melting point are 40 to 41° by Calvert,
quoted by Schiff,^^ and 42.5° to 43° by Behal and Choay ^^ for a
specimen of phenol s>Tithesized by a new method. For the change
of volume we have 0.054 to 0.051 by Heydweiller ^8 and 0.0532 by
Block ^^ against 0.0567 above. For the latent heat, there is 24.93
cal. by Pettersson and Widman,^° and 26.9 cal. by Eykmann,^^
against 29.7 above.
