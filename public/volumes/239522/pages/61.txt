is necessary to compute these three quantities. But at a horizontal
or vertical tangent, the relations simplify in such a way as to determine
uniquely two of these three quantities without the necessity for a
third relation. We shall assume for the deduction that we know
AV and AH along the transition line. These date are, as a matter
of fact, determined in the following work. We are at liberty there-
fore to use the following relations:
dAv dT .- .
-r- = —A^-Aa
dp dp
dAH ^ dr
dp dp'

Now at a horizontal tangent, "i- = 0. We immediately see that at
such a point the equations give us the means of determining both Aa
and Aj8 from the transition data alone. These values are;
dp
^ T dp
We cannot find ACp from the equations; the only method is direct
experimental determination. These relations are of application to
Hgl2. The equations furthermore show that for those substances
which we may call normal [Aa>0, A/3>0], the maximum of the AH
curve must come before the maximum of the transition curve.

At a vertical tangent, 3" ~ 0, and we get
These relations are of application to water or benzol. We cannot
determine Aa at a vertical tangent from the transition data alone.
Two of the relations may be written in a simpler form, involving
the curvature of the transition line. These relations are ;
Aa = X curvature, at a horizontal tangent [~r — ^ j>

ACp = — r Ai) X curvature, at a vertical tangent ( ;/" = °°
