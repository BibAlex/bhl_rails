Tests of several telephone receivers, made before and after a removal
and replacement of the screw cap, were found, at times, to differ con-
siderably. This led to an investigation of the influence of screwing
on the receiver cap with varying degrees of tightness. The caps were
of the same molded composite material as the receiver cases. A lever
clamping device was designed and constructed as shown in Figure 16.
It consists of a brass rod AB, with a known sliding weight applied
at a measured horizontal radius arm r. The rod terminates in a
brass fork containing notches, which engage with pins p p screwed into
the cover. The receiver is clamped by its shell in a horizontal posi-

tion. The cap is then screwed on slackly, and the final screwing is
accomplished with the measured torque. The instrument is then
tested for motional impedance under these conditions. The torque
is expressed in gram-perpendicular-meters; i. e., in grams weight act-
ing vertically at a horizontal radius arm of one meter.
The effects of varying the screwing-on torque upon the motional-
impedance circle of the particular receiver tested, (B with No. 36
diaphragm), are shown in Figure 17. It will be seen that with zero
imposed torque; i. e., with the cap laid on the diaphragm, but not
screwed, the motional-impedance circle has the smallest diameter,
and is nested within the others. The resonant frequency of the
diaphragm was 859 <^ . As the screwing-on torque is increased, the
