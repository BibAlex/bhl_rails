the value 32.0°. There are only three measurements of the transi-
tion IV-V. Lehmann (in a personal letter quoted by Behn) ^^ gives
— 16°, Wallerant gives the limits — 14° to — 16°, and Behn finds — 18°.
I have adopted this last value as more probably exact. For the melt-
ing point I have adopted the value of Lehmann, 168°, which is some-
what higher than the value given by Behn, 166°, as the average of
several other determinations. As already stated, I made no attempt
to measure this point myself.
The change of volume at atmospheric pressure has been measured
by Bellati and Romanese ^* for the transitions JV-III and II-III.
For III-IV they give 0.01964 cm.^ per gm., but from a recomputation
of their data I should prefer the value 0.01955, although their data
show enough irregularity to admit a value as low as 0.01915. Behn ^^
gives for this transition 0.022 (he pretends to give only two significant
figures), and I find by extrapolation from 77 kgm. (the extrapolation
correction is less than one percent) the value 0.02026. For the
transition II-III Bellati and Romanese give —0.00854 cm.^ per gm.,
Behn gives 0.0081, and I find by extrapolation from 77 kgm. a some-
what lower value, 0.00758, the total extrapolation correction in this
case being about 3%. The change of volume I-II was not measured
by Bellati and Romanese. Behn gives 0.0132, and I find by an extra-
polation from 77 kgm. 0.01351. Lussana ^^ did not measure the
change of volume, but calculates from his other data for the pressure
effect the value 0.01465, assuming Bellati and Romanese's value for
the latent heat. The change of volume IV-V seems to have been
measured only by Behn, who found that it lies between the values
0.0155 and 0.0185, but was not able to get it more accurately because
of the lag already mentioned.
The latent heats of transition have been measured only by Bellati
and Romanese/* who give for III-IV 5.02 gm. cal. per gm., for
III-II 5.33 cal., and for II-I 11.86 cal. I find by calculation from
Clapeyron's equation the values 4.66, 4.00, and 13.0 cal. respectively.
The only measurements of the eft'ect of pressure are by Lussana ^^
and Tammann.^® Tammann's measurements extended to 2800 kgm.
and include points on the II-III, III-IV, and II-IV curves, but he
made no measurements on the phase I. Lussana's pressure range
was only 250 kgm.; he measured the three transitions III-IV, III-II,
and II-I. Tammann states that there is no possibility of agreement
between his values, those of Lussana, and those computed from the
thermodynamic data of Bellati and Romanese. The discrepancy
stated by Tammann as existing between Lussana's data and those to
