GLACIAL-CONTROL THEORY OF CORAL REEFS. 167
to the proofs that glaciers, doubtless Pleistocene in date, existed in,
or close to, the coral-reef areas of the ocean. Among the more telling
instances are those in Hawaii, Japan, Mexico, and East Africa.
Locating all these lands on a world map, the reader will note how
inevitable is the conclusion that the tropical seas were considerably
cooler during the Pleistocene. Philippi finds further evidence of that
fact in the character of the deep-sea ooze collected in the Indian ocean
(between 0째 and 55째 S. Lat.) by the "Gauss" expedition. He shows
that the content of calcium carbonate in this deposit decreases with
increasing depth and he attributes this decrease to special chemical
conditions due to Pleistocene chilling. -"^^
Much more difficult is the question as to the actual amount of
Pleistocene chilling of the tropical seas. The lowering of snow-line at
that time was at least 900-1,000 meters in Hawaii and Japan, ^^ about
1,500 m. in equatorial America, and at least 2,000 m. in equatorial
East Africa. With those estimates the Pleistocene lowering of snow-
line 1,000 to 1,500 m. for Central Europe, about 2,000 m. for southern
British Columbia, and nearly 2,000 meters for the northeastern United
States, may be compared.
In the lowlands of Java the Selenka expedition found the remains
of Pleistocene species of plants wliich now grow in that island at
levels from GOO to 1200 m. higher. ^^
The average decrease of air temperature with increase of altitude
in mountainous districts, for the first 5,000 m. above sea, is al)out
0.56째 C. per 100 m. The a^'erage decrease determined only from
summit stations is nearly 0.65째 per 100 m,, which is close to the gradient
for free air. These mean values for the decrease practically apply
both to the temperate and tropical zones. ^^
Since the relative precipitation, the relative effect of insolation, and
other factors of Pleistocene climates are not determined, the beha\ior
of the Pleistocene snow-line cannot, in general, give a direct value
for the average lowering of air temperature within the tropics at that
time. The best estimates are doubtless those to be derivefl from lands
exposed, then as now, to an oceanic climate; for example, Auckland
island, New Zealand, Hawaii, Vancouver island, the Coast Ranse of
