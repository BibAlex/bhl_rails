III. CERTAIN BORRAGINACEAE, NEW OR TRANSFERRED.
By J. Francis Macbride.
In the course of ordering up portions of the Borraginaceae at the
Gray Herbarium it has become necessary from time to time to make
new names and new combinations of names in order to have the work
conform to the International Rules of Botanical Nomenclature. In
addition, an attempt to classify the unnamed material in some of the
groups has led to the discovery of a few species and varieties appar-
ently undescribed. It seems advisable, therefore, to place these
matters on record at this time.
Tournefortia Miquelii, nom. nov. — T. syringaefolia Miquel, Stirp.
Surin. 137 (1850), not T. syringaefolia Vahl, Symb. Bot. iii. 23 (1794),
a name which must be revived to replace the more generally used but
later synonym T. laurifolia Vent. Choix PI. 2 (1803).
Tournefortia Aubletii, nom. nov. — T. glabra Aubl. PI. Guian. i.
118 (1775), not T. glabra L. Sp. PI. 141 (1753), which must replace
T. cymosa L. Sp. PI. ed. 2, 202 (1762).
Heliotropium fragrans, nom. nov. — H. odorum (Fres.) Giirke,
Nat. Pflanzenf. iv. Ab. 3, 96 (1893). Heliophytum odorum Fres. in
Mart. Fl. Bras. viii. pt. 1, 45 (1857), not Heliotrojpiwn odorum Balf.
f. Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinb. xii. 81 (1884). Article 53 of the Inter-
national Rules states that: "When a species is moved from one genus
into another, its specific epithet must be changed if it is already
borne by a valid species of that genus." Therefore H. odorum Fres.
requires a new name on being transferred to Heliotropium because of
the presence there of H. odorum Balf. f., a valid species which cannot,
according to these rules, be renamed H. Balfouri as has been done by
Giirke, 1. c.
Heliotropium foliosissimum, spec, nov., multicaule decumbens
subgriseo-pubescens; radice et caudice lignescentibus atrobrunneis;
caulibus 5-14 flexuosis gracilibus basi ad apicem aequabiliter foliosis-
simus 3-12 cm. longis; foliis elliptico-oblongis margine vix revolutis
obtusis nunc alternis nunc suboppositis vel irregulariter dispositis
5-10 mm. longis 2-4 mm. latis; racemis bracteatis brevibus; calycis
laciniis oblongo-ovatis; corollae tubo calycem non superante; nuci-
bus strigosis. — Southern Mexico in the State of Oaxaca: Hacienda
Blanca, July 25, 1895, L. C. Smith, no. 627 (type, in Gray Herb.) ;
