in that section. From sections 57 to 61 the size remains nearly
constant, but below this it decreases until they end, on the right at
section 106 and on the left at section 102.

Only mesenteries / to IV are complete.
The gastrovascular cavity extends orally between the mesenteries
as in larva B. At the oral end however it is found between the first
four pairs of mesenteries only (Fig. ^, A). Where these diverticula
of the gastrovascular cavity occur the fifth and sixth mesenteries do
not reach to the oesophageal wall.
Group III. Larva H.
This larva, which is in about the same stage as larvae F and G,
is very much contracted along the oral-aboral axis, the aboral surface
being retracted to form a deep concavity. The individual was fixed
in a saturated solution of corrosive sublimate plus 1% acetic acid.
The sections were stained with Heidenhain's iron haematoxylin and
Congo red, and the oral end of the larva was cut first, the right side
being slightly in advance. The 71 sections are each 7 ju thick.
The oesophagus is elliptical in cross section, the long axis of the
ellipse being dorso-ventral. It is interrupted on the dorsal side in
section 14 and on the ventral side in section 21, its ventral side extend-
ing therefore 7 sections beyond its dorsal side.
The mesenterial filaments of the first and second pairs of mesen-
teries, the only ones present, extend nearly the whole length of the
larva, almost but not quite touching the mesoglea of the aboral end;
their position is as follows: those of the first pair of mesenteries on
the right reach from section 22 to section 41, and on the left from
section 23 to section 44; those of the second pair of mesenteries on
the right reach from section 22 to 41 and on the left from section 23
