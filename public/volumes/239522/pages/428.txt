EFFECTS OF PRESSURE ON NITRATES. 013
temperature form are of great interest. Wallerant was able to find
that its crystalline system was the same as that of II, and he suggested
that it was in fact the same modification. This appearance of the
same phase in two isolated parts of the phase diagram is unique, if it
should be proved, but seems to be not contrary to any of the thermo-
dynamic necessities. Behn has subjected the question to a very
careful experimental examination, measuring the various thermal and
crystallographical properties of II and V to see whether it is possible
to state an indentity. His data did not allow of a definite answer to
the question, but seem to suggest that II and V are not the same
phase. I did not make any measurements on this transition for the
reasons already stated, but did investigate one questionable point.
One might expect, since the transition IV-V is of the ice type, that at
higher pressures another phase would exist, so that the falling transi-
tion curve between IV and V would be replaced by a rising curve
between IV and the new modification. I did not find any such new
modification out to 12500 kgm. at room temperature.
The following transition temperatures are found in the literature.
For I-II Lelimann ^^ gives 127°, Bellati and Romanese ^* give the
limits 124° to 125°, Lussana ^^ found the limits 124.9° and 125.6°, and
Schwarz ^ has found the value 125.6° by one method, and the limits
123.5° to 125.5° by another. In the table I have given 125.5° as
agreeing best with my own data and the best results of other observ-
ers. For the transition II-III Lehmann ^^ gives 87°, Behn ^^ gives
83°, Bellati and Romanese ^* give the limits 82.5° to 86°, Schwarz ^
gives the limits 82.5° to 86.5° by one method, 82.8° to 82.7° by another,
and 83° by a third, Wallerant ^ gives 82°, Tammann ^^ gives by
extrapolation from his measurements at higher pressures the value
84.6°, and Lussana ^^ finds that the transition takes place at 85.85°
on heating, but does not give the value on cooling. I have adopted
the value 82.7° as agreeing best with my own data and those of
others. For the transition III-IV Lehmann ^^ gives 36°, Bellati and
Romanese^* give the limits 31° to 35°, Schwarz^ gives the limits 31°
to 35° by one method, 32.4° (best) by another, and 35° by a third,
Wallerant ^ gives 32°, Behn ^^ 32°, Tammann ^^ finds by extrapola-
tion from his high pressure measurements 31.8°, and Lussana ^^ finds
the limits 35.45° and 30.55° on heating and cooling. I have adopted
