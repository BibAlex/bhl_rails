platform edges, the reefs would there be specially strengthened also
because of the extra supply of coral larvae emanating from the suc-
cessful colonies. The young corals, as well as the adults, would feel
the benefit of a location on the phitform edges.
The resulting reef must be more or less unsymmetrical. While
corals could live on the lagoon side, they would tend to suffer from
occasional clouds of sediment washed up from the lagoon floor by
major storms. To mud-control one may again appeal as a partial
explanation of the more advanced development of atoll reefs on the
side of the prevailing wind.
"Drowned" Atolls and Other Banks. Mud-control may have an
important bearing on the abnormal condition of the Great Chagos,
Pitt, Macclesfield, Tizard, and some other banks. These are all large,
flat platforms, rimmed with dead or living reefs Avhich are covered
with 5 to 30 m. of water. Principal data concerning these banks are
entered in the following table (IV).
