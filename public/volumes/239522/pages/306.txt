ing constant A = r/i2m), or the logarithmic decrement per second,
as determined from the distribution of angular frequencies around the
circumference of the motional-impedance circle. Column VII gives
the equivalent mass m of the diaphragm, as obtained in each case from
formula (5). It should be constant according to theory, if formula
(5) holds; i. e., if the relative distribution of vibration amplitudes
over the surface of the diaphragm remains unchanged under different
loads. The computed equivalent mass m of the unloaded diaphragm
is seen to vary between 0.968 and 0.953 gm. Column VIII gives the
inferred mechanical resistance r, in dynes per kine. It will be seen
that r increased, when the load increased. This increase in mechani-
cal resistance might be partly accounted for by the increased frictional
