to 41. The filaments of the same side are not fused, as in some previ-
ous larvae, except that on the left side they are united at their origin,
(section 23). The enlargement of the filaments of the first pair of
mesenteries reaches from section 29 to 38; the sections of the second
pair are of almost uniform size throughout their length.
The mesenteries extend practically the entire length of the larva;
their positions are shown in the following table:

Mesenteries I to IV are the only complete ones.
Group IV. Larva 1.
This larva is slightly larger than any of the previous ones, and shows
an advance in the development of the primary mesenteries and of the
mesenterial filaments. It was fixed and stained like larva G, and
then cut into 133 transverse sections, each 5 fj. thick, the aboral end
being cut first. Figure 4 (A-F) shows the 15th, 19th, 23rd, 25th, 73rd
and 93rd sections. Photomicrographs of sections 19 and 26, are
shown on Plate 5 and of 73 and 93 on Plate 6.
The oesophagus is slightly more invaginated than in larva B. It
is oval in cross section (Fig. 4, A) from the oral end to section 17. In
section 17 it is U-shaped, the ectoderm being interrupted on the dorsal
side. This is also the case in section 19 (Fig. 4, B). Beyond this
section the ectoderm is interrupted also on the ventral side (Fig. 4, C).
On the ventral side of the oesophagus in sections 16 to 19 a diverti-
culum of the gastrovascular cavity extends forward in the region of
the third pair of mesenteries (Fig. 4, B). The mesenterial filaments
of the first and second mesenteries (Fig. 4, D) are fused on the right
(left as seen in the figures) as far as section 29, on the left as far as
section 38.
The mesenterial filaments of the first pair of mesenteries extend on
both sides into section 112. The transverse sections of these fila-
ments are smaller than those of the filaments of the second pair of
