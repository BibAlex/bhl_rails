EFFECTS OF PRESSURE ON NITRATES. 619
back to 1857/^ says that LiNOs is trimorphic. Other authorities,
Groth included, do not mention this, however, and the supposed
polymorphism is doubtless to be explained as due to the transition
points of the hydrates, because LiNOs crystallizes with H2O. I made
especially careful search for other forms, isothermally at 20° and 200°
to 12000 kg., and at constant volume between 100° and 160° at ap-
proximately 3000 kg. and between 30° and 160° at 8000 kg.
Hg2(N03)2+H20 does not crystallize isomorphously with the other
univalent nitrates. The anliydrous salt showed no new form at 20°
or 90°. At the higher temperature there was probably some decom-
position; temperature was not raised higher for fear of further de-
composition. The salt crystallizing with one molecule of water
probably has a transition point at 20° at 8000 kg. ; no other tempera-
ture was tried. The substance is a difficult one to investigate, because
beside containing water of crystallization it is hygroscopic. It is
difficult to remove the absorbed moisture without dehydration. The
material deserves further investigation, however.
Hg(N03)2 was the first of the nitrates tried which was not univa-
lent. I know of no cases of polymorphism among this class; there
is no particular reason to expect other forms at high pressures.
Hg(N03)2 showed nothing new at 20° to 12000; on heating to 180°
at 1000 kg. it decomposed with almost explosive violence, depositing
metallic mercury throughout the apparatus.
Pb(N03)2 is stated by xA-rzruni ^^ to exist as a mineral in two forms.
I found no new form up to 12000, however, at 20° or 200°.
A1(N03)3 was tried at 20°, 100°, and 200° with no effect. After
the run it was found to have decomposed into a brownish mass,
actively deliquescent. It was somewhat moist before the run.
Discussion.
IVIost of the facts described in this paper are collected and exliibited
qualitatively in Figure 16, which shows the phase diagrams, pressure
against temperature, and indicates other data also. The drawings
are made with some exaggeration, so that the direction of curvature
of each transition line may be readily' noticed. The arrows on the
lines show the directions in which Av decreases numerically. An a, (3,
