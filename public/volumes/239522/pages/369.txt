plant soon afterward described and figured by David Don as Calliopsis
Drummondii, which has generally passed in American literature as
Coreopsis Drummondii. The seed from which the plant was grown at
the Berlin Garden was stated by Otto & Dietrich to have come from
Missouri, but as it was included in a large lot of seeds received at second
hand from an unknown collector there was obvious chance of error in
regard to its origin, and there can be no doubt that it really came from
Texas, to which the species is apparently confined. The probable
identity of Calliopsis basalis and C. Drummondii was first brought to
my attention through a manuscript note on a sheet in the British
Museum by Mr. S. LeM. Moore, to whom I am indebted for permis-
sion to publish this note.
The form with linear or linear-oblong leaf-lobes described by Gray
(Syn. Fl. i. pt. 2. 291 (1884)) as Coreopsis Drummondii var. Wrightii
becomes C. basalis (Dietr.) Blake var. Wrightii (Gray) Blake, n.
comb.
