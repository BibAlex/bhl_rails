shall use. Or, rather, we shall use this form if the numbers 5i and 82,
which were introduced earlier and figure now in the coefficients of yi
and yo, are conjugate imaginaries, but shall multiply it by i if 5i is
the negative of the conjugate of 62. We have then in either case
V
(22) un (.r) = Z [(Jt] e'"'"''^
where di and do, in particular, are conjugate imaginary quantities
different from zero. It is clear that if x is positive and n is large, all
the terms after the second will be insignificant in comparison with
either of the first two. Let
where Jh and I12 are real. Then
(23) di e""""^ + di e""^^^ = 2e^' + p,.xcos{^/r) ^^g | f^^ _^ ^^^ gjj-^ (^/j,) | _
This identity is of course none the less valid for the circumstance that
the numbers pn are not necessarily real.
Suppose that a succession of constants ^^ an, 71 = g, g -]r 1, g -^ 2, . . . ,
is such that anUn(x) remains uniformly finite throughout an interval
included in (0, tt), or, in symbols,
(24) I anUn (x) I < G
for Xi < X < xo, where < .I'l < .I'o ^ tt. It is to be shown that
throughout the interval ^ .r < xo the series

must converge and represent a function possessing derivatives of all
orders.
Because of the relations (20) and (21), the difference between the
last factor in (23) and the expression
(26) cos { h2 + (mo + n) x ]
25 This notation is adequate only if all the characteristic values from the
very beginning are simple roots of the determinant equation. In order not to
raise questions irrelevant to the main issue, it will be assumed, in the contrary
case, that the series (25) begins with such a value of the index n that only
simple roots are involved. In the extension of Theorem II, where the formal
expansion of a definite function is under discussion, it is possible to assign
values to the first terms of the expansion immediately; cf. Birkhoff II, p. 380;
but we shall not be in any way directly concerned with these terms.
