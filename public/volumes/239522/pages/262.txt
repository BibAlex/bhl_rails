EXPANSION PROBLEMS WITH IRREGULAR BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS.
By Dunham Jackson.
Keceived, May 12, 1915.
The expansion problems which form the subject of the following
discussion are associated with ordinary linear homogeneous differen-
tial equations having no singular points in the interval of variation of
the independent variable. In nearly all the problems of this sort
that have been studied at length, the boundary conditions are of the
type which Birkhoff ^ designates as regular. A notable exception
occurs in the papers in which Liouville ^ shows that a considerable
part of the classical Sturm-Liouville theory of equations of the second
order, including the formal expansion of a given function in series of
characteristic functions, is capable of extension to certain special
systems of higher order. It is readily seen that ^ the boundary condi-
tions there considered are irregular.* Consequently the question of
the convergence of Liouville's special series, which Liouville himself
does not discuss at all, is still left open by Birkhoff's general theory.
The present paper is devoted to a study of this question, to which
the author's attention was called by Professor Bocher. No attempt
is made to attain the greatest possible generality in the coefficients
of the differential equation; in the matter of boundary conditions, on
the other hand, the hypotheses are sufficiently general to include all

(1908).

The definition of regular boundary conditions is introduced in II, 382-383.

but it is immediately apparent that they are equivalent to a set of homogene-
ous conditions.
