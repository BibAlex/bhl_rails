Vsiv)=0, s=v+1,p+2,...,2p,
constitute the boundary conditions adjoint to (16). We will denote
the matrix of the forms W by a. and that of the forms V by /?. What-
ever these matrices may be, the matrix of the bilinear form -lWs{u) Vs{v)
is a'/3, where a' is the conjugate of a, and so the determination
of the adjoint conditions amounts to the solution of the matrix equa-
tion a'i3 = T], which gives
i5 = (aO-^r?.
Of course the reciprocal of a is the same as the conjugate of a~^.
Let us examine the form of the matrix /?.
The choice of the v forms Wy+i,. . .,W-2v, is arbitrary, provided that
the condition of linear independence is fulfilled. We will choose them
in a particularly simple way. We will set Wv+i equal to that one of the
variables ui, . . . , ih, which does not appear as leading term in any of
the conditions Wi,. . ., Wv-\, in (16), and will let Wv+2,- ■ ■, Wiv, be
equal respectively to the variables Mj/+i, . . . , Woi/, with the omission of
the one which forms the leading term of Wv It is clear that if the
variables u are expressed in terms of the quantities W by solving the
linear equations which give the latter in terms of the former, the first
V of the It's will be completely determined by the fu-st v — 1 equations
and the {v -{• l)th, and so will not involve Wv nor Wv+i,- ■ ■, Wov
That is, since the matrix of the new equations is a~^, the last v — 1
columns of a~^ (and the vth column) contain no elements different
from zero in the first v rows. The last v — 1 rows of the conjugate
of a~^ contain no elements different from zero in the first v columns.
Consequently, since the first v columns of rj contain non-vanishing
elements only in the first v rows, the last v — 1 rows of the product
(a)~^7] will have all their elements in the first v columns equal to zero.
This means that v — 1 oi the adjoint boundary conditions F =
28 The use of subscripts here is different from Birkhoff's; the change is
made for the sake of convenience in using the language of matrices.
