and sixth pairs, when a difference can be observed between the two
sides of the mesenteries, the fibres are most numerous on the dorsal
side (Fig. 2, E). In the mesenteries in which a mesenterial filament
is developed (first and second pair), the muscle fibres are most
numerous in that region of the mesentery which is about twice as
far from the body wall as from the internal margin of the mesentery,
in those sections in which the filament appears. In all other cases
the muscle fibres are most numerous along the internal edges of the

mesenteries and are usually numerous on both sides of the mesentery
along this edge.
The musculature of the body wall consists of a layer of longitudinal
fibres developed in the inner ends of the ectoderm cells where they
abut on the mesogloea and of a layer of circular muscles developed in
the endoderm cells where they reach the mesogloea of the body wall.
The mesoderm of the body wall, although thin, is everywhere clearly
to be seen.
