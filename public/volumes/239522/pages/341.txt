mesenteries as far as section 80 on the right and on the left up to sec-
tion 83. They are largest (Fig. 4, F) on the right between sections
87 and 108 and on the left between sections 87 and 1 10, where they are
larger than any of the transverse sections of the filaments of the second
pair of mesenteries. The mesenterial filaments of the second pair of
mesenteries extend on the right into section 89 and on the left (Fig.
4, F) into section 95. The transverse sections of these filaments
(Fig. 4, E) are largest on the right between sections 54 and 87 — where

up to section 80 they are larger than the filaments of the first pair
of mesenteries in the same sections, — and on the left between sections
58 and 90, where they are larger than the filaments of the first pair of
mesenteries as far as section 83. The filament of mesentery /// on
the right side of the larva (left in the preparation) is not continuous
with the ectoderm of the oesophagus, being absent in sections 20 to 26.
On the left side of the larva the filament of the corresponding mesen-
tery if present at all is reduced to a few scattered cells in these sections.
Both filaments are enlarged beyond these sections but are always much
