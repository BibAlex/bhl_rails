always positive; hence Ar is negative, and the transition line is de-
pressed.
The procedure is easily modified so as to give the pressure shift of
the equilibrium line. Let now the pressures only be altered. The
pressure on (2) is increased by Ai>y, and that on (1) by Api. (See
Fig. 3.) Under these conditions pure (1) at p + Api, t is to be in

Api, equal to the osmotic pressure of the impurity dissolved in (1),
then we have impure (1) at p + Ap2, r in equilibrium with pure (1)
at p + Api, T, and hence in equilibrium with pure (2) at p + Ap2, r.
That is, Api gives the pressure shift of the transition line.
We have
