from which it was obtained; but the argument is so similar to the
corresponding ones already given that its details may be omitted.
For the proof that the development of a particular analytic function
is divergent, the form of the adjoint system is to be taken into account.
The adjoint differential equation is of course the same as Ijefore. The
boundary conditions may be discussed by an appropriate modification
of the method used in the case oi v — l specialized conditions. It is
found that v—2 of the adjoint conditions contain the point tt only,
while the remaining two not only may but surely do involve the
point 0, in such a way that the sets of terms relating to this point
in the two conditions are linearly independent.^^ The conditions
may be simplified and arranged in a manner corresponding to our
previous practice. The characteristic functions may be written in
the form
(44)
Vn (.r) = [d'l] gP-^^C'r- a;) + [d'2] fP-J^jU- x)^
where the numbers pn are those already determined, d'l and d'o are
conjugate imaginary quantities different from zero, and the approach
of the bracket functions to their limits is uniform throughout any
closed interval interior to (0, tt) . This expression, however, is not
sufficient for the present purpose; for in determining the order of
magnitude of the coefficients in the series it is precisely at the point
a; = 0, where the formula breaks down, that the value of I'i(.t) is
needed. At this point, terms involving eP"(^'^-"'>^) and eP"(^'^-"'>^)
must be explicitly taken into account.
The characteristic function (44) was obtained from the determinant
corresponding to*° (33) by dividing out a factor e''"^'^^, independ-
ent of X, and a constant factor depending on neither p nor x. By divid-
ing out the same exponential factor, but a different constant factor,
a characteristic function is obtained which may be represented ade-
quately, in a sense presently to be explained, by the expression
Vn {x) = 52'
g — pnWlX gPnlVliir — X)
-53'
g — PnWlX ppnlOliir — X)
39 The latter part of this statement may be proved either by making use of
the fact that the matrix corresponding to that which was called /3 must be
non-singular, or by observing that if the statement is assumed to be untrue
a direct determination of the characteristic values for the adjoint system leads
to results inconsistent with those found for the given system.
40 This determinant in the present case has elements of the form
^kz^PnWiTT ^jj _|_ ^/^^ 7 2j^,^K 2 |^-|^j jj^ j|.g gecond row, where k'2, y'2, and K'2 are
integers, of which 7'2 may be negative, and 0'^ is a constant; cf. the deter-
minant from which (43) was obtained.
