characteristic values occur on the ray arg p = t^Iv, which bounds So,
the corresponding values on the ray arg p = — tt/v may be left out of
account. It will be convenient now to have a definite understanding
as to four of the subscripts of the roots uy, we shall write
iri W 3)r» Sttx
Wi = e " , 102 = 6", wz = e " , Wi= e " ,
so that the first four subscripts are assigned to the four right-hand
vertices of the j'-sided regular polygon w^hich represents the v roots.
If the polygon is rotated in the positive direction through an angle
6 between and ir/v, the vertices representing the numbers wie*', ....
?f"4e^^ will be those furthest to the right, in the order of decreasing
abscissas. The order of the remaining subscripts is immaterial.
The quantities Wg (yi) have the asymptotic expressions:
TVs (yt) = (pwO*« e ""^t^ [1] + as {pwiYil], s=v-1,p,
where Ks is the order of the highest derivative whose value at the point
actually enters into the s-th. condition, for the last two values of s,
and as is the corresponding coefficient, or is zero if the condition does
not involve the point at all. Let the factor p ^s be divided from the
s-th row of the determinant of these quantities, s = 1, 2, . . ., v, and
in the last two rows let js he \\Titten for Ks — kg- Then the condition
for a characteristic value is expressed by the vanishing of a determi-
nant Ai of the following form : ^*
V'[l] w-z'^'ll] ••• t^>[l]

section, as no exponential factor has been divided from the last rows.
