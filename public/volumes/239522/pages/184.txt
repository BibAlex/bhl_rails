AUSTRALIAN HONEY-ANTS.

pointed, vestigial mandibles, showing that the food of the larva is
purely liquid and imbibed directly from the regurgitating workers.
The sensory papillae on
the maxillae and labium
are well-developed. The
body shows three well-
marked thoracic and five
or six abdominal seg-
ments. It is covered
with extremely short
hairs. The larva of L.
varians var. ruficeps is
similar, but the skin is
entirely naked. The
larva of L. unicolor has a
short, rounded head (Fig.
4 c), much like that of
other ant larvae, though
the mandibles are very
feebly developed. The
body is covered with
hairs which are some-
what sparser and stiffer
than in nigriveiitris.
On disturbing the colonies I found that the ants seldom attacked
me with their mandibles, but usually hurried about over my hands,
face and clothing like a lot of long-legged spiders, filling the air with
the rank, rancid butter, or " Tapinoma" odor so characteristic of most
species of Dolichoderinae. This excretion is discharged as a liquid
from the anal glands and is so sticky that my skin felt as if it had been
varnished. This was especially noticeable after opening nests of
L. varians var. ruficeps. L. unicolor, however, emits a more delicate
and pleasant modification of the Tapinoma odor and the liquid is not
discharged in sufficient quantity to make the skin perceptibly sticky.
Additional notes on habits are given in connection wdth the taxonomic
descriptions of each of the species and varieties in the latter part of
this paper.
I found no myrmecophiles in the nests which I examined, but the
following brief notes show that the species of Lcptomyrmc.r, like other
ants, have their Arthropod guests, enemies and mimics. October 19
on a footpath near Katoomba, N. S. W., I picked up a specimen of
Figure 4. a. Larva of Leptomyrmex nigri-
ventris, b. head of same from above, c. head of
