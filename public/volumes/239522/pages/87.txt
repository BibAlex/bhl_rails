Urethan. This was obtained from Eimer and Amend, and further
purified by crystalhzation at constant temperature in the thermostat.
Beautiful, colorless, transparent crystals were obtained, columnar in
form, some of them 2 or 3 inches long. The melting isothermals
showed very little rounding of the corners, so the purity must have
been fairly high. A remarkable property of the crystals is their
great flexibility; they may be bent in the fingers like paraffine. It is
possible that this may be due to twinning, as in the case of calcite;

it would be an interesting subject for investigation. Two fillings of
the apparatus were used. The first gave the low pressure point and
nine points at higher pressures. After this, the splitting of the steel
shell necessitated the using of another sample, with which twelve
points at high pressures were obtained, completing the phase diagram.
The quantities used were 17 and 13.5 gm. The urethan was melted
into the inverted nickel steel shell and pressure transmitted to it by
mercury.
Two new solid modifications were found; these are so situated in
the phase diagram that all the triple points and equilibrium lines
