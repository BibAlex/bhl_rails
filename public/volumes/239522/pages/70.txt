has also remarked on the sharpness of the transition at atmospheric
pressure. The essential agreement of Wahl's and my results at high
pressures for the width of the band of indifference, by methods entirely
different, would seem to indicate some real physical significance in the
absolute values found by us, characteristic of the substance, and not a
property of the particular form of apparatus. The width of the II-III
band was distinctly greater than that of the I-II band, being from
70 to 100 kgm., while that of the I-IIT band was less, 11 to 33 kgm.
There seem to be no previous determinations of either AV or AH for
the transition.
The data do not justify any attempt at estimating Aa, A^, or ACp.

was necessary in getting the high pressure points, and one for the low

trouble from lag as was found by Tammann.^^ The dry powder was
