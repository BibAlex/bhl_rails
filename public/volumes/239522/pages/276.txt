EXPANSION PROBLEMS. 401
approaches zero, uniformly for ^ .t ^ tt, when n becomes infinite.
When 71 is sufficiently large, hi + (/xo + n)x will vary by more than 2x
as X increases from .I'l to .To, and there will surely be an intermediate
value X = X7i' for which the expression (26) is equal to 1. If this
value is substituted for x in (23), for the successive values of n, the
last factor remains from a certain point on numerically greater than a
positive constant. Independently of this particular choice of x,
the quantity
gPnX COS (ir/f) I g(/io +n) X cot (tt/j') _- a^nX COt (jr/y)
remains numerically greater than a positive constant beyond a certain
point. Consequently the whole expression (23) remains for .r = a-/ nu-
merically greater than a constant positive multiple of g(w+n)a;/cot(ir/:')^
and the same is true of Un{xn'). The inequality is strengthened if xn
in the exponent is replaced by .I'l; it follows from (24) that
(27) \an\< c'e -('«+'») ^^ cot (^/.)^
where c' is independent of 7i.
We have now to consider the order of magnitude of the derivatives of
un{x). Suppose X restricted to the interval ^ .r ^ X2, where X2 < xi.
If k is one of the numbers 0, 1,. . ., v — I, it is at once deduced
from (17) and (18) that
(28)
<C. c"'n^6 ('*'+'') ^- cot {ir/n)
where c" is independent of n. This inequality may be established
step by step for larger values of k, by combining the inequalities
already found with the given differential equation (15) and the equa-
tions obtained from it by successive differentiation. Different values
of the constant c" will be found for different values of /.-, but this is
immaterial.
Because of (27) and (28), the series
Y, an TJ Un (x)
converges uniformly for ^ .r ^ X2, and consequently represents a
continuous function, inasmuch as the individual terms are continu-
ous. The statement of the hypothesis for any particular value of xi
implies its validity for any larger value of Xi which still remains less
than xo, and hence Xi may be any positive number less than .ro. With
