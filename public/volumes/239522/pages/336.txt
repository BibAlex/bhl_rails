internal ends. Only mesenteries / to IV are complete.
Group III. Larva F.
This larva (text, Fig. 2) is not so much contracted along its oral-
aboral axis as the one last described, and the oesophagus is only slightly
invaginated. It was fixed in a saturated solution of corrosive subli-
mate and the sections stained in Mallory's phosphotungstic acid
haematoxylin. The oral end of the larva was cut first. The sections
are almost exactly transverse. The oesophagus appears as a com-
plete circle of ectoderm in the third section, the first two sections
showing the dorsal side only. The sections are 6 /x thick and there
are 86 of them. Of the sections, Figure 2, A-I, shows numbers 9, 13,
18, 21, 33, 45, 61, 71 and 74 and Plates 3 and 4 show photomicro-
graphs of numbers 12, 17, 61 and 73.
The oesophagus is elliptical in cross section, the long axis being
dorso-ventral. It ceases on the dorsal side at section 9 (Fig. 2, A).
Below this its cross section is U-shaped until section 13 (Fig. 2, B)
is reached. Below section 13 it is interrupted on the ventral side also.
The invaginated ectoderm of the right side of the larva is joined by
the first, second and third mesenteries, that of the left side is joined
by the first and second mesenteries (Fig. 2, C).
Below section 20 the ectoderm is continued on both sides as the
separate mesenterial filaments of the first and second pairs of mesen-
teries. The filaments of the first pair extend on the right as far as
section 70 and on the left as far as section 73, which is practically the
whole extent of the gastrovascular cavity. The filaments of the second
pair extend on both sides as far as section 56. The mesenterial fila-
ments are enlarged as follows: those of the first pair of mesenteries
on the right between sections 49 and 66, on the left between sections
52 and 70, those of the second pair of mesenteries on both sides between
sections 32 and 54 (Fig. 2, E-H).
The six pairs of primary mesenteries extend practically the whole
