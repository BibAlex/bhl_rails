fact that in L. unicolor, which is probably the only species that does
not have this habit, the organ is much smaller, the valves proportion-
ally shorter and the layer of musculature much thinner.
The venation of the fore wing in the male Lcptomyrmex, too, is
unlike that of any kno^vn ant (Fig. 3). The pterostigma is reduced
to a mere vestige. The radial vein is well developed and with the costa
encloses a long, narrow radial cell. The cubitus comes off from the
radius and describes a curve, terminating near the tip of the wing.
The media is well developed, its terminal portion describing a curve
similar to that of the cubitus. There is no cubital or discal cell.
The short transverse vein running from the pterostigma to the media
is divided into two portions, the anterior of which is regarded by Emery
as the base of the radius, the longer, posterior portion as representing
a fusion of a transverse cubital with the recurrent nervure. He

believes, therefore, that the basalis, which is a fundamental cross-vein
in the Hymenopteran wing, is completely lacking in Leptomyrmex.
In support of this view he calls attention to a male ant from the
Sicilian amber (Miocene), which he formerly called Leptomyrmex
maravignoe, but for which he has recently established a new genus,
Lepfomyrmula. This insect is more primitive than Leptomyrmex in hav-
ing a vestige of the basalis arising from the media and in possessing
a developed pterostigma.
Another peculiarity of the genus Leptomyrmex, to which attention
has not been called heretofore, is the absence of a queen, or female
caste in any of the known species. At any rate, no one has ever seen
a female Leptomyrmex. I shall return to this subject in the sequel.
Very few observations have been recorded on the habits of any of
the species. Gilbert Turner has published a note on L. erythrocepha-
