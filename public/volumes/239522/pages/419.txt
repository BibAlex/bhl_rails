The interesting features of the diagram, apart from the two new
modifications, are the pronounced curvature of the II-III hne, and
the great proximity of the I-II-III triple point to atmospheric pres-
sure. It suggests itself that it might be possible under the proper
conditions to realize III at atmospheric pressure as an unstable form,
and as a matter of fact Wallerant has found an unstable form on

uniaxial, but Wallerant was not able to further characterize its crystal-

There are a large number of determinations at atmospheric pressure.
