The transition line I-II is somewhat unusual in that A F increases with
increasing temperature.
The band of indifference shows interesting variations. On each of
the three curves, I-III, I-II, and II-III, the band decreases in width
with increasing temperature; but besides the general effect of tempera-
ture, there is a very marked specific effect of the nature of the reacting
phases. Both the bands I-II and II-III are broader at their lower
ends than I-III is at its upper end, although the temperature of the
lower end of the first two bands is the same as that of the upper end of
the I-III band. The actual widths are as follows. I-III is 200 kgm.
wide at 0°, and 60 kgm. wide at 25.2°; I-II is 250 kgm. wide at 35.3°,
75 kgm. at 50°, 20 kgm. at 58°; II-III is 60 kgm. wide at 35.3°, 20
kgm. at 50°, and 3 kgm. at 70.2°. Along with this change in the width
of the band there goes a parallel change in the reaction velocity. No
trouble was ever found in forcing the desired reaction to take place;
but no observations were made of the precise amount of subcooling
or superheating. It was observed once at 50° that I had to be car-
ried 650 kgm. across the line before II appeared.
No other transitions were found to 12700 kgm. at either room tem-
perature or 153°.
The efltect of pressure on the melting point of urethan has also been
measured by Tammann,^^ who did not find any other modifications.
Tammann's pressure range was to 2905 kgm. At the upper end of the
melting curve he must therefore, have had the modification II without
knowing it. Tammann remarks that below 1500 kgm. the melting
curve is parabolic, but that above 1500 it is nearly linear; this linear-
ity is evidently the effect of the overlooked transition. In fact, if one
plots Tammann's points, he will find some evidence for the change in
direction of the curve above the triple point, although the points are
rather irregular. Tammann also looked for other modifications of the
solid out to 3000 kgm. at 40°; if he had tried 60° instead, he would
probably have found II. The melting point at atmospheric pressure
was 48.14° against 47.90° above. The presumption from this alone
would be, therefore, that Tammann's specimen was purer than mine.
But at high pressures his curve drops below mine, being 1 .8° lower at
the upper end, and he also states that the reaction was unusually slow
for a melting reaction. Both of these points suggest impurity. In
the work above, the melting set in as rapidly as for any normal liquid.
It almost seems as if the design of Tammann's apparatus had been
