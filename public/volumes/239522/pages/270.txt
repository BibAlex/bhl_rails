readily established by writing the characteristic equation in the real

II. Differential Equation of Order v with v — 1 Specialized
Boundary Conditions.
The properties of the series studied in the preceding paragraphs are
typical of a large class of expansion problems connected with differ-
ential equations of order higher than the second. We shall consider
now the differential equation ^^
(15) ^ + 2>2(.f)^^+... +P.(^)" + P''w = 0, .^3,
where the coefficients p are real or complex functions of the real vari-
able X, continuous with their derivatives of all orders, in an interval
which we may still take as the interval ^ .r ^ tt. The v linearly
independent boundary conditions associated with this equation are
to be subjected to the essential restriction that v — 1 of them involve
the values of the solution and its derivatives only at the point 0, while
the remaining condition may involve both end-points or the point tt
alone. ^^ These conditions can be reduced by linear combination to the
form
1 8 It is understood that any or all of the derivatives of orders from to ^ — 2
may occur in the equation; only the {v — l)th is assumed to be absent. As
is well known, a more general differential equation can be reduced to this
form by a change of variables; cf. Birkhoff II, p. 373, footnote. The differ-
ential equation which Liouville considers in the paper II is specialized in a
different way.
19 Of course it amounts to the same thing, if a number of the conditions
involve the derivatives at tt in such a way that these can be eliminated from all
but one of the conditions by linear combination. A similar remark is applic-
able to the cases treated later. The conditions must include at least one
which involves the point tt, otherwise they are equivalent to the set
it(0) = u'ifi) = ... = w(''-i) (0) = 0,
and no characteristic solutions are possible. In the system treated by Liouville,
the j/th condition involves only the point tt, and the coefficients are subject to
further restrictions.
