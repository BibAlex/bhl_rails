involve only the point tt and not the point 0. The latter point
surely will be involved in the remaining condition of the adjoint set.
For ^^ the j/th row of the product matrix, like the last v — 1 rows,
involves only zeros in the first v columns, and it follows that the
remaining v rows, the (v + l)th in particular, must contain elements
different from zero in these columns, since the determinant of the
matrix can not vanish. The adjoint conditions may be simplified
by linear combination to a form resembling that of the original condi-
tions in (16). No confusion will be caused if we denote the simplified
conditions by Fg (i") =0, 5=1, 2,..., v; the conflicting notation
hitherto used will not be referred to again. We may write
fa'— 1 ;-— 1
Fi (v) = i;(^-'') (0) + Z a/ v^''^ (0) + Z ft' ^'^^■' (tt) = 0,
(30) ^-
Vs (v) = ij(*^') (tt) + Z ^y' ^^'^ (tt) = 0, s = 2,3,...,v,

For each value of p, a fundamental system of solutions of the equa-
tion (29), 2;j(.T, p), s = 1, 2,. . ., V, can be assigned in such a way that

It is important for us now, however, to notice that the bracket symbol
may be given a much more precise interpretation than was done before.
Both the relations (31) and the relations (17), (18), remain true ^°
if [a], where a is any constant, is understood to mean an expression of
the form
I 'AiC^O , hi'i-) , , 'Am-i( .r) E(x, p)

where m is an integer that may be assigned arbitrarily in advance, the
functions \pj{x),j — 1, 2, . . ., m — 1, are continuous with their de-
rivatives of all orders for ^ .r ^ tt, and E{.v, p) is a function of x

assumption the adjoint conditions could be reduced to the form i'(7r) = v'iir) =
. . = I' (""!) (tt) =0, and the adjoint system could have no characteristic
values.
