the exponent k — /.> in the last row of this determinant may be posi-
tive, negative, or zero.
It is at this point that the import of the remarks made at the close
of the last paragraph but one becomes apparent. As p becomes infi-
nite in the region Tq, the first element in the last row of Ai approaches
Uiiiformly the limit Wi^^, and the elements from the third to the last
uniformly approach zero. The second of the two terms which make
up the second element of the row is also uniformly infinitesimal.
Let us expand the determinant according to the elements of the last
row, and examine the cofactor of the first element. If we suppose
each bracket symbol replaced for the moment by unity, the cofactor
is a determinant whose value is surely different from zero, not because
its rows consist of like powers of a set of distinct quantities (it is not
assumed that all the exponents kg are sxccessive integers), but because,
after division of the s-th row by ^^2*^ s = 1, 2, . . ., i/ — 1, an operation
which of course does not affect the vanishing of the determinant, each
column may be regarded as consisting of like powers of the v — 1
distinct quantities iVi^'"'^, iV'f^'^, . . . , loi'^v-i^ the exponents of these
powers in the several columns being the integers from to v — 2
inclusive, in some order; the numbers Wz/ W2,. ■ .w^/ w^, are even
powers of w^. If the brackets are restored, the cofactor is a function
which uniformly approaches a limit different from zero when p becomes
infinite. Similar reasoning, with a like conclusion, applies to the
cofactor of the second element. Representing the limiting values of
the cof actors of the first and second elements by 5i and ^2 respectively,
we see that A] has the form
(19) Ai = [5i wi^^] + [52 w-^^] e "'^^ ""'=-"'1) ;
the terms in the expansion which involve the last v — 2 elements
and the second part of the second element have been merged here in
the first bracket symbol.
If A2 is the expression which results when the bracket expressions
in (19) are replaced by their limiting values, the equation A2 = can
