EXPANSION PROBLEMS.

It is a diflference between the present problem and the special
one treated in the preceding section that the coefficient of e''''"'^'^-^)
in (34) is not a constant, in general, but an expression of the form

The additional terms, however, are readil}' taken into account. The
arbitrary number vi has not yet been assigned; let it be set equal to
g + 3. Every one of the functions f{x) \pj{x), j = 1, 2, ...,?«, — 1,
vanishes with its first q derivatives at the points and tt. Hence it
may be shown by integrating by parts that

Since each integral of this sort is multiplied by the reciprocal of at least
the first power of pn, and, of course,

A corresponding inequality holds for the integral involving the
second term of (34), the constant C4 being replaced, if necessary, by a
new constant C5. For t^S, the quantity gP-wK^-*) remains less in
absolute value, as n becomes infinite, than e"""'"^ divided by any
power of 71, and we may write
