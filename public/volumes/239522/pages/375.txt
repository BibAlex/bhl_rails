In a recent attempt to verify the identification and labelling of the
Verbenaceae in the Gray Herbarium, corrections were noticed which
should be made in the current treatment of two species of the Gala-
pagos Islands, namely:
1) The plants which have been treated as Avicennia tomentosa Hook.
f . Trans. Linn. Soc. xx. 195 (1847) ; Anderss. Om Galap.-oarnes Veg.
201 (1853), also reprint, 82 (1857); Robinson & Greenman, Am. Jour.
Sci. ser. 3, 1. 147 (1895); and A. officinalis Robinson, Proc. Am. Acad,
xxxviii. 194 (1902), not L., are referable to A. nitida Jacq.
2) The plants of the Galapagos Islands treated as Lippia lanceolata

Robinson & Greenman, Am. Jour. Sci. ser. 3, 1. 147 (1895), not Michx.;
and L. canescens Robinson, Proc. Am. Acad, xxxviii. 196 (1902), not
HBK., are all to be referred to L. keptans HBK. Nov. Gen. et Spec,
ii. 263 (1817), a species fairly well marked as to its firmer veins and
more salient teeth of the leaves.
Ageratum Houstonianum Mill., var. muticescens, var. nov., sta-
tura foliis pubescentia floribus etc. formae typicae simillimura differt
squamis pappi flosculorum vel omnium vel plurium valde reductis
muticis ca. 0.1-0.2 mm. longis.â€” Mexico: Wartenberg, near Tanto-
yuca, prov. Huasteca, collected in 1858, L. C. Ervendberg, no. 100
(type, in Gray Herb.); without locality, from the herbarium of the
late Dr. F. W. Klatt (Gray Herb.) ; cultivated in the Missouri Botani-
cal Garden, from 1886 (when collected by Pammel) to 1896 (when
a second specimen was prepared by H. C. Irish). The specimens, now
in the herbarium of the Missouri Botanical Garden, show by their
labelling that the plant has passed under several horticultural names,
"Stella Gurney," "Cope's Pet," etc. The seed is said to have come
from Haage & Schmidt's establishment. In these specimens the
pappus, though for the most part short and muticous, shows some
variability on one and the same plant or even in the same head, certain
florets, especially the central ones and those of the terminal heads,
tending to have awned scales in the manner of the typical form.
