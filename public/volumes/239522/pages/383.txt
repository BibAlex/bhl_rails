542 MACBRIDE.
sterile hills, Telixtlahuaca, July 27, 1895, L. C. Smith, no. 471;
near Oaxaca, July 26, 1896, C. Conzatti, no. 157, in part; gravelly
soil near Oaxaca, July 3, 1900, Charles C. Deam, no. 11; Cerro San
Antonio, June 26, 1906, C. Conzatti, no. 1411. These specimens were
labeled H. limhatum Benth., but that species is a more canescent plant
of rigid erect habit, and with narrower longer leaves (10-15 mm. long,
1.5-2 mm. wide) and almost glabrous nutlets. The aspect, too, is
very different both from the dissimilar manner of growth and because
the stems of H. limhatum are leafiest at the base, where the leaves
persist, while in H. foliosissimwn the stems are equably leafy and the
lower leaves soon die.
Heliotropium jaliscense, spec, nov., suffruticosum erectum, ramis
hispidis et adpresse strigillosis; foliis petiolatis ovato-lanceolatis
subacuminatis basi attenuatis integerrimis 5-10 cm. longis 2-3 cm.
latis utrinque strigillosis et subtus in nervis hispidis; racemis flexuo-
sis gracilibus ebracteolatis -pedunculatis ; pedunculis subterrainalibus;
calycis lobis hispidis latitudine inaequalibus subacuminatis; corollae
tubo calycem ca. 2 mm. superante; corolla 3.5-4 mm. longa; an-
therae media in parte tubi insertae; stigmate late conico basi annu-
lato stylum vix superante; nuculis 4 glabris forsan maturitate
reticulatis. — Mexico: bushy slopes near San Sebastian, Jalisco,
March 16-19, 1897, E. W. Nelson, no. 4083 (type, in Gray Herb.).
A species bearing a superficial resemblance to H. parviflorum L. but
by style and fruit characters a member of the section Euheliotropium.
Heliotropium phyllostachyum Torr., var. erectum, var. nov.,
caulibus erectis 1-4 dm. altis; foliis oblongo-lanceolatis 1-3 cm. longis
ca. 3 mm. latis; corollae tubo calycem superante, limbo 3-5 mm. lato.
— Mexico: CuHacan, Sinaloa, Oct. 24, 1904, T. S. Brandegee (type,
in Gray Herb.); between Guichocovi and Lagunas, Oaxaca, June 27,
1895, E. W. Nelson, no. 2743; Real de Guadelupe, Sept. 14, 1898,
E. Langlasse, no. 351; near Cuernavaca, Morelos, July 25, 1896,
C. G. Pringle, no. 7183; near Iguala, Guerrero, Sept. 22, 1905, C. G.
Pringle, no. 13,681; Yucatan, 1895, G. F. Gaumer, no. 790. H.
phyllostachyum Torr. in its typical form is a low (rarely 1 dm. high)
diffusely spreading plant with short broad leaves and inconspicuous
flowers, the corolla 1.5-2 mm. long, scarcely exceeding the calyx.
It is mostly of more northern range than the variety, although it has
been secured at Manzanillo, Colima, by Dr. Palmer (no. 891) and at
Guaymas (no. 232). No. 891 is quite typical but no. 232 represents
a transition to the variety in its erect habit. Because of these facts
it seems best to give the southern plant varietal rather than specific
rank.
