Theorem I. If a series of the form (8) converges uniformly throughout
any interval
(9) ^ .r < a-o,
where < .To ^ tt, its sum must have continuous derivatives of all orders
throughout the interval (9).
Let xi and X2 be any two numbers subject to the inequalities < Xi
< xi < xq. Since the series converges uniformly throughout the
interval (9), it converges uniformly for
(10) Xi^X< .To,
and there must be a number G such that ^^
(11) \anUn(x)\<G
for all values of x in (10) and for all values of n.
Now if n is sufficiently large, pn will be real, and the interval from
I V3pn.ri to I VSpn.To will be of length greater than 2t, and so will
contain at least one value of | V3p«.T whose sine is 1. That is, there
will be one or more values of x in (10) for which the parenthesis in (7)
takes on the value V3. Let x'n be such a value. Then un{x'n) is
positive, and
Since (11) must be satisfied when .r = x'n,

and the statement of the theorem might have been made correspondingly
more general.
