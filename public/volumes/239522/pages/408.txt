EFFECTS OF PRESSURE ON NITRATES.

required to reach approximately stationary conditions, and at each
of the high pressure points about 50 minutes. As for most soHds,
the velocity was distinctly greater with falling pressure than with
rising. It is possible to pass across the equilibrium curve in either
direction without the reaction starting, but only to a slight extent
The experimental results are shown in Figure 4, the computed

The ciu-vatm-e of the y-t curve is normal ; the AV cu^^â€¢e falls with
rising pressure, as is normal, but the experimental accuracy was not
great enough to surely determine the direction of cur\'atiu-e, so it is
drawn as a straight line.
