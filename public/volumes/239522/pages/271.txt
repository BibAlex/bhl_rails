and we shall assume them in this form. It would be possible to
simplify them still further, if there were any object in doing so. The
coefficients a^-, aj, /?y, are any real or complex constants, and in
particular some or all of them may vanish.
The facts which we shall need concerning the form of solutions of the
equation (15), apart from the question of any particular boundary
conditions, may be taken from the papers of Birklioff already referred
to. Following his notation, we shall use the symbol [a], where a
is any constant, to represent a function of p = re^*, or of p and a second
variable, which approaches the limit a uniformly with respect to 6, or
with respect to d and the other variable, when r becomes infinite; the
same symbol will be used to represent as many different functions of
this sort as may occur. Furthermore, the roots of the equation
w" -\- 1 = are denoted by wi, W2, . . . , i<v. Then it is possible to assign
to each value of p a fundamental system of solutions of the equation
(15), T/^.T, p), s = 1,2,. . ., V, in such a way that
(17) ys{x,p) = e'>^s^[l],
and at the same time

These solutions have continuous derivatives of all orders with regard
to .T, for each value of p. If I is any one of the numbers 0, 1, . . . , 2^ — 1,

the choice of this fundamental system may be so made that the func-
tions t/g(.T, p) and their derivatives with regard to x shall be analytic
functions of p for each value of x, at least throughout the part of the
sector exterior to a circle of sufficiently large radius about the origin.
