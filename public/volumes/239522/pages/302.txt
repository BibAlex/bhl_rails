of the voltaic cell E. Readings of the advance of the point P, could be
made on the micrometer head to 10"^ inch (25 fj.) and could be well
estimated to 10~* inch (2.5 fx). Impressed forces were used in suc-
cession up to about 100 grams wt. (10^ dynes).

Figure 9 shows the results obtained, with ordinates deflections in
microns, and abscissas impressed central force in dynes. The different
curves refer to diaphragms of different thickness. In every case the
clamping circle of the diaphragm in the receiver had a diameter of
5.0 cms. The dotted curves show the deflections with the permanent
magnet of the telephone removed. The full curves show the corre-
ponding deflections with the permanent magnet present.
It will be seen that the deflections obtained with varying impressed
forces, follow substantially straight-line laws, up to say 50 microns,
a range of deflection considerably in excess of what the telephone dia-
pl ragm has ordinarily to undergo in practice. There is, however, a
considerable difference between the deflection produced by a given
impressed force when the permanent magnets were present, and when
they were removed. This difference is accentuated in the cases of the
thinnest diaphragms. The presence of the permanent magnet causes
the diaphragm to be bowed from the plane of the clamping circle,
and subsequent deflections, due to impressed forces, occur from this
distorted position of equilibrium.
