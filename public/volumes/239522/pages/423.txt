he could be sure that the reaction was complete, and on raising the
temperature he found the same lag also. The phenomenon is more
unusual with rising temperature. Upon the repetition of the experi-
ment, error from this effect was avoided only by very careful work,
profiting by the experience of the first run. It is necessary to run the
pressure several thousand kilograms beyond the equilibrium point
in order to be sure of the completion of the reaction. The completion
of the reaction is also greatly facilitated by running the pressure back
and forth several times over the transition before beginning the
measurements. In the neighborhood of the triple point II-III-IV,
where it is not possible to secure completion of the reaction by running
the pressure over a considerable range, because the pressure of equili-
brium is too near atmospheric pressure, the same end was attained by
raising or lowering the temperature, as occasion might require, and
then bringing it back to the temperature of the measurement. I had
