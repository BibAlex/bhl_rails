sion in the first section, and partly by the argument just completed.
It is found that if .Tq is any fixed value in the interval < 0*0 < tt,
the absolute value of un{xo) is equal to f"^cot(x/.) multiplied by a
quantity which may be small for particular values of n, but certainly
does not approach zero as a limit when n becomes infinite. It is
possible to assign a positive constant Cu, such that
for infinitely many values of 11. It follows that anMn(.ro) does not
remain finite, and
The statement of Theorem II is valid for the series discussed in the
present section.
III. Differential Equation of Order v with Fewer than v — I
Specialized Boundary Conditions.
If two of the boundary conditions, instead of a single one, involve
the point x, the resulting series still show essentially the same char-
acteristics, provided that the order of the differential equation is
greater than 4, so that the specialized conditions remain in the major-
ity. We retain the differential equation (15) of the preceding section,
assuming now that j' ^ 5, and associate with it the following boundary
conditions :

The differential equation being the same, the asymptotic expressions
(17), (18), are still available,^^ and the regions Si and Ti may be de-
fined as before. In determining the distribution of the characteristic
values, it is sufficient to consider those in the sectors »So and S^v-i;
all but a finite number of these will be in the regions To and T^v-i- If

at the beginning of the preceding section, without the refinement which was
introduced later.
