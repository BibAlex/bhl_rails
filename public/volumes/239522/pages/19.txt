receptacle is triseriate; the lower halves of the basal cells of the two
lateral series in contact, the upper separated through the intrusion of
the basal cell of the middle series. Cells of the middle series slightly
longer than broad, for the most part, thirty-two to thirty-four in
number, their walls becoming suffused with yellow brown from below
upward; the distal eight or nine small, flattened, with rounded con-
tour, partaking of the yellow brown suffusion of the perithecium to
which they are united; the series ending a short distance below the
base of the deeply suffused tip, and opposite and within the basal cell
of the primary appendage. The anterior row consisting of from
forty-two to forty-four cells, the lower two or three deeply suffused,
the suffusion decreasing upward; these, and a few cells above them,
decreasingly ol)lique in relation to one another; three or four of the
distal cells of the series, which ends abruptly at the persistent insertion
of the trichogyne which subtends the deeply suffused tip of the peri-
thecium, being without appendages; while of the remaining cells,
about eight or ten at both the upper and lower ends of the series, cut
off one, or two, appendiculate cells from the upper outer angle; while
all the rest cut off three such cells, the successive groups of threes
forming a continuous and more or less symmetrically disposed lateral
series, the successive groups partly separated by the external pointed
prolongation which characterizes each of the cells of the main anterior
axis in this region; the appendiculate cells bearing, subtended by the
usual cup-shaped suffused septa, either short hyaline inconspicuous
appendages, or longer curved flask-shaped purplish brown antheridia,
the venters of which are at first quite hyaline, two antheridia more
commonly associated with one appendage in these sets of three.
The posterior row ending in the two-celled base of the primary append-
age, the subbasal cell of which is small and free, while its basal cell
appears to end the distal row, from the members of which it is in no
way distinguished, and which comprises from thirty-five to forty cells
similar in general to those of the anterior series, and producing an-
theridia and appendages in a similar fashion, and subsymmetrically
placed in relation to them. Perithecium rather long, slightly and
subsymmetrically inflated, erect, or turned slightly to one side, deeply
suffused with brown, translucent; almost wholly enclosed, except the
broad short nearly symmetrical abruptly distinguished opaque tip,
and a very small portion of its anterior margin; the apex hyaline,
contrasting, abruptly distinguished, the distal margin slightly uneven
from the minute projecting lip-cells. Perithecia 100-112 X 28-30 ^u,
or including the marginal cells of receptacle, X 46-55 /x. Total
