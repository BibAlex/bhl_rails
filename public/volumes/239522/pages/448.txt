EFFECTS OF RADIANT ENERGY OX THE EYE. ()59
Marked haze of cornea. Epithelium intact. Pupil widely dilated.
After 48 hours : Condition about the same. Microscopic examination
(48 hrs.) : Corneal stroma swollen to | normal thickness. Epithelium
intact. Corneal corpuscles completely invisible in central portion of
exposed area. At the periphery of the latter they show active pro-
liferation many of them being in mitosis. Endothelium absent
beneath exposed area. Iris and lens epithelium normal. Retina
normal â€” pigment epithelium unaffected.
With flint glass screen {335 h/jl), hut without ivater cell.
Experiment 91. Pigmented eye. Exposed 30 minutes. After
24-48 hours: No reaction, cornea clear. [Microscopic examination
(48 hrs.) : Cornea, lens epithelium, and retina normal. Pigment epi-
thelium of retina normal.
SUNLIGHT. BLUE L"\"IOL SCREEN AND .001% SOLUTION OF AURAMIN O
IN QUARTZ CELL 5 CM. THICK.
Light focussed on cornea by large quartz lens 12 cm. in diameter
and 25 cm. in focal length. Atmosphere not perfectly clear (April 2,
1913):
Experiment 92. Albino. Exposed 45 minutes. After 24 hours:
^'ery slight conjunctival reaction. Cornea hazy, epithelium intact.
Iris congested. After 48 hours: Condition about the same. Corneal
epithelium intact. Microscopic examination (48 hrs.): Corneal epi-
thelium intact. Stroma swollen to about f normal thickness. Cor-
puscles and endothelium completely destroyed in exposed area. At
periphery corpuscles show proliferative changes. Affected area wider
posteriorly than anteriorly. Xo characteristic abiotic changes made
out. Iris normal. Retina congeni tally defective (coloboma of optic
disc, ganglion cells few in number) shows no abiotic or heat effects.
Pigment epithelium normal.
MAGNETITE ARC. QUARTZ SINGLE LENS. WATER CELL. CROWN GLASS
SCREEN (295 fXfJ.).
Experiment 93. Right e^^e exposed 8 minutes. Left e^e exposed
4 minutes. One hour later; Left eye exposed 4 minutes. After
twenty-four hours : Slight reaction in each eye without loss of epithe-
lium. After 3 days: No reaction. Magnetite arc. Double lens
system. Water cell. Crown screen (295 /x/x). Exposed left eye
