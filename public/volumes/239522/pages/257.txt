PLATE 8.
Plasmotomy after binary fission (Figs. 95-97) and multiple fission (M^;:-
98-104) in Eutrichomastix serpentis (Dobell). X 2175. All from Cwlalus
oregonus Holbrook except Figures 96, 98-100, which are from Pituophii>
catenifer Baird and Girard.
Figure 95. Late telophase. Daughter nuclei diverging, plasmodesnose
taut.
Figure 96. Daughter nuclei 180Â° apart in favorable position for plasmo-
tomy; paradesmose and axostyles parallel.
Figure 97. Unequal division of cytoplasm in rounded-up phase about
daughter nuclei.
Figure 98. Multiple fission, formative phase; second synchronous division
forming 4-nucleate Plasmodium; two paradesmoses present.
Figure 99. Same stage with paradesmoses crossing.
Figure 100. Somatella with eight nuclei. Three axostyles visible; nuclei
with intranuclear chromidial cloud.
Figure 101. The same, with large karyosomes forming in the nuclei, proba-
bly an earlier stage than Figure 100.
Figure 102. Disintegrative phase, 6-nucleate somatella.
Figure 103. The same, 3-nucleate sometella.
Figure 104. Binucleate stage, a late stage of binary fission or of the dis-
integrative phase of multiple fission, the seventh and eighth
merozoites in the last phase of plasmotomy.
