If a function /(.c) is the sum of a uniformly convergent series (8),
the coefficients in the series must be the numbers
(13) On = —^
A Un{x)Vn{x)dx
The number N being given, let q be the first number greater than or
equal to N which is congruent to 2 (mod. 3). We shall examine the
terms of the formal series for the special function
.T5+l(7r-x)«+2
(14) fix)
TT^ + ^X^+l)!
This function, a polynomial in x, is of course analytic from to tt,
and vanishes with its first q derivatives at both ends of the interval,
while the (q + l)th derivative takes on the value at the point tt
and the value 1 at the point 0.
To determine the order of magnitude of the numerator in (13),
when f{x) is the function just defined, let us break up the integral
into three, corresponding to the three terms in the right-hand member
of (12), and consider for the moment the second of these. The index
n may be supposed so large that pn is real and positive. Integrating
by parts q -\- 2 times, we find that

and hence, by one more integration by parts and the application of
obvious inequalities, that

where c is independent of n A corresponding inequality holds for
the third integral, with the same value of c. As for the first, it ob-
viously remains finite ^^ as n becomes infinite, and so it is certainly
true that
