Introduction.
In this paper the thermodynamic elements involved in the poly-
morphic changes of a group of closely related univalent nitrates
are given over a considerable pressure and temperature range. The
apparatus, the experimental methods, and the methods of computa-
tion are in every way the same as were described in a previous paper ^
on a similar subject.
Particular interest attaches to the group of the univalent nitrates
because of the wide occurrence of polymorphism in this group, the
unusual number of polymorphic forms, and their complicated rela-
tionships. Here, one would expect, is a particularly favorable field
in which to look for new forms, stable only at high pressures, which
will supply the gaps at atmospheric pressure. It turns out, however,
that there are comparatively few new forms in the range reached here :
one new form for ammonium nitrate and two for potassium nitrate;
