phone-receiver terminals. With the diaphragm unloaded, the natural
angular frequency was found to be coo = 5645 rad/sec. and the damping
constant A = 211 per second.
A small brass cylindrical mass of 0.98 gm. was then fastened, by
shellac, to the center of the diaphragm. Its diameter was approxi-
mately 3 mm., and its height about 6 mm. The diaphragm thus
loaded, was found to have a natural angular frequency of woi = 3980
rad/sec. with a damping constant Ai = 132 per second.
Combining these two sets of observations, as in equations (4) and
(19), we obtain, as the equivalent mass of the unloaded diaphragm,
m=^^^ = 0M8 gm. (5)
Again, from (1) s = wq- m = 30.86 X 10« dynes/cm. (6)

Similarly, from (2) r = 2m A = 409 dynes/kine (8)
and (4) n = 2 (m + wi) Ai = 514 " " (9)
The increase in the mechanical resistance of the loaded diaphragm
may be accounted for either by increase in air resistance of the load,
or in internal friction.

The results of adding this load, and also two other successive loads,
to the center of the diaphragm, are given in Table III. Here Column
II gives the mass of the load in grams. Column III gives the measured
angular velocity coo of resonance, as obtained from the circle diagram
in each case. It will be observed that with the heaviest load, the
angular velocity was reduced nearly to one half of the initial angular
velocity, unloaded. Column IV gives the motional-circle diameters
in absohms. It will be seen that adding load to the diaphragm, first
increased, and then reduced the dimensions of the motional-impedance
circle. Column V records the depression angle of the diameter of the
motional-impedance circle in each case. Column VI gives the damp-
