pressure, 145° for the transition temperature by Wallerant.^ The
value found above for the transition temperature was 153.7°. In
view of the exceptional purity of the sample used above, it would
seem that 153.7° should be given the preference.
Direct measurements were made of the difference of thermal ex-
pansion of the two phases at low pressures (77 kgm.), and of the
difference of compressibility at higher pressures. The measurements
are better than usual, and give more consistent results. Three
measurements of the difference of compressibility at high pressures
were made; one of these was somewhat too large, but the other two
agreed within 5%. The values follow.
At 77 kgm.
Aa = 0.0649
A/3 - O.O433
At 5000 kgm.
ACp= 1.0
Aa = O.OeSl
A/S = O.O4I5
ACn= 0.28
At 77 kgm., A|3 was the observed value, and at 5000, Aa. We see
that at both pressures the high temperature phase is the more com-
pressible, has the greater expansion, and the greater specific heat.
The differences between the two phases become less at higher pres-
sures. The decrease of Aa with rising pressure was unmistakably
shown by the direct measurements. This behavior of CsNOs is what
one would perhaps be inclined to call entirely normal. The difference
of compressibility between the two phases is of the order of the com-
pressibility of platinum.
Especially careful search was made for other modifications, since
others were expected in analogy with the other nitrates. None were
found to 12000 kgm. however, at 20°, 177°, or 200°.
Rubidium Nitrate. I have to thank the kindness of Professor
T. W. Richards for this rare substance. He personally prepared the
samples by repeated crystallization. The purification was continued
until the flame test, very sensitive in these cases, showed no trace of
any of the other alkali metals. The salt as finally provided by Pro-
fessor Richards was crystallized from acid solution, and gave an acid
reaction. It was unfortunate that I did not succeed in removing all
