DEVELOPMENT OF AGARICIA. 509
d. Stage with Twelve Primary Septa.
A number of skeletons in this stage were obtained (Plate 5, bottom
photograph). They show six primary entosepta and six exosepta.
The epitheca covers the outer portion and is in the form of the base
of a cone. It is decorated with ridges running toward the oral end
of the polyp. The theca is seen joining the entosepta and exosepta.
The primary entosepta extend beyond the theca but do not reach the
epitheca. In a few of the skeletons a slight indication of the bilateral
symmetry described for the earlier skeletons could still be recognized.
3. Comparison of the Development of the Skeleton in
Agaricia fragilis with that in other Hexacorallidae.
In Astroides calycularis Lacaze-Duthiers ('73) found that each of
the six primary entosepta was formed from three centres of calcifica-
tion, the septa being in consequence Y-shaped with the upper part
of the Y toward the periphery. The two septa on the left in Plate 5
(top figure) are forked at their peripheral ends, although the prongs
of the fork are not so large as in A. calycularis. Lacaze-Duthiers
found that the other septa appear irregularly. The same species
has been studied by Koch ('82), who also finds the primary septa
forked. Both these authors find that the primary entosepta are
developed before the theca or epitheca.
In Caryophyllia cyatlnis and C. claws Lacaze-Duthiers ('97) found
similar stages in the development.
In the development of Sidcrastrea radians, studied by Duerden
(:04), six primary entosepta are developed as single continuous rods
without connection with the theca or epitheca. An outer ring, the
beginning of the epitheca, similar to the ring described in skeleton A,
surrounds the basal plate. The primary exosepta are developed in
dorso-ventral succession and independently of the entosepta.
