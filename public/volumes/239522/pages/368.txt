COMPOSITAE NEW AND TRANSFERRED. 525
The four species of Chrysactinia now known may be conveniently
divided into two sections, habitally well marked but without differ-
ential characters of technical importance.
I. Chrysactinia Gray (PI. Fendl. 93 (1849)) sect. Euchrysactinia
Blake, n. sect. Folia subulata integerrima. Corollae radii discique
aureae. — Type C. mezicana Gray.
1. C. MExiCANA Gray, 1. c. (1849). — Leaves subulate, flattened
above, hirtellous on the margin, mostly alternate, 4.5-12 mm. long,
0.7-1.2 mm. wide, with rather numerous glands. Phyllaries appar-
ently uniformly 12 in number, 4-5 mm. long. — • Pedis taxifolia Greene!

3. C. PINNATA Wats. ! Proc. Am. Acad. xxv. 154 (1890). — Leaves
opposite, oblong, pinnatilobed almost to the midrib with 9-17 oppo-
site oblique oblong to (uppermost) deltoid mucronate acute lobes,
sparsely gland-dotted, 2.5^.9 cm. long, 1.2-1.9 cm. wide, the lowest
pair of lobes reduced and stipule-like. Rays 8, whitish, orange-tinged
outside; disk orange. — Nuevo Leon: Pringle 2524 (type). — Described
by Watson as herbaceous, but apparently frutescent like the other
species of the genus.
4. C. truncata Wats. ! I. c. (1890). — Leaves opposite or the upper
alternate, ovate to ovate-oblong in outline, pinnatilobed nearly to the
midrib with 3-7 mostly alternate lobes, the lobes entire or with 1-few
spinulose teeth, truncate and glandular-mucronate at apex (or the
terminal sometimes acute), 1.5-2.4 cm. long, 8-12 mm. wide. — Nuevo
Leon: Pringle 2601 (type). — The rays are described by Watson as
