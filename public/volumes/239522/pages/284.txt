EXPANSION PROBLEMS. 411
Let p be restricted to the region To. Suppose first, for simplicity,
that the last two of the boundary conditions do not involve the
point 0, so that a^-i and av are zero. Then in each of the minors of
the last two rows of the determinant, an exponential factor can be
taken from each column, and the expansion according to these minors
has the form
(40) Z5y/f,ye''^"'^+"^')Ml],
where 5^;^/ and ^jjf are determinants of i' — 2 rows and 2 rows respec-
tively, with powers of the quantities lOt as constituents. Of these deter-
minants, 5i2, 5i3, ^n, and fi3 are surely different form zero, having
essentially the same form as 5i and 82 in the preceding section ; it is im-
portant to observe that when the roots Wj are arranged in cyclic order, Wi
and W2 are adjacent, and likewise Wi and W3. It is immediately recog-
nized that if p is in the remote part of To, all the terms of (40) excepting
possibly that with the subscripts 1, 3, are insignificant in comparison
with the term that has the subscripts 1, 2, and may be merged with
the latter term, by virtue of the latitude that is allowable in the
interpretation of the bracket symbols. We may write
(41) Ai = [dioSioleP^"^' + W2)n^ [Sisrisle"^"" + '^^''.
This is on the assumption that a^^i and a^ are zero. Among the terms
which have to be added to those already taken into account, if this
restriction is removed, the worst that can occur is e"^'^ multiplied
by a power of p, with a further factor which remains finite. Such a
term will be negligible in comparison with e''^^i + ^^'^, provided that a
power of p is negligible in comparison with e''^'^, which will be the case
if the vertex W2 of the polygon representing the I'oots remains at the
right of the axis of imaginaries after the polygon has been rotated
through an angle of t/v, that is, if 27r/V < ^tt, v > 4:. As the condi-
tion last stated was imposed at the beginning of the section, the
terms containing power's of p may be incorporated in the expression
[5i2fi2]e''^'^'+ ""'^^ and the validity of (41) is general.
Suppose the bracket symbols in (41) replaced by their limiting
values, and the resulting expression set equal to zero. Since
W2 — Ws = e" — e " = e " \e " — e " j ,
the equation so obtained, which obviously has only roots of the first
order, is equivalent to the relation
(42) 2pTi e "sin — = log ( — r^^ ) -f- 2mri,
