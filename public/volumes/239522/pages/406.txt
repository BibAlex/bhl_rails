EFFECTS OF PRESSURE ON NITRATES. 585
the large probable error because of the great width of the region of

tabulated for this part of the curve.
The feature of particular interest for AgNOs is the remarkably
sudden increase of curvature of the transition line beyond 6000 kgm.,
a feature unique to this substance. In fact, the increase of curvature
is so great that when I first found the transition at 20°, it seemed as
if there must be a third modification, and that the phase diagram would
look like that of Agl. The whole of the field was very carefully
explored for other modifications; the strongest motive for repeating
the measurements was that the discordant At; points lent color to the
suspicion that there might have been an undetected third modifica-
tion near the bend with a small A?;. No other form could be found,
however, to 12000 kgm. at room temperature, or at 200°, and on the
repetition of the experiment none could be found in the neighborhood
of the bend.
It is possible to pass over the curve at any point without the reac-
tion starting. The width of the region of indifference within which
the reaction does not run after it has once started changes in a curious
way with the pressure. The detailed data for this effect are to be
given in the succeeding paper.
There are several measurements of the transition data at atmos-
pheric pressure. Schwarz ^ gives 159.2° to 159.7° by an optical
method for the transition temperature, Hissink ^ finds 159.8° with a
dilatometer, and Guinchant * gives 159°. The value found by extra-
polation of the above data of my own was 159.4°. The change of
linear dimensions during the transition has been measured by Guin-
chant,* who found an increase of from 0.22 to 0.25% on cooling, and a
decrease of 0.17% on heating. Assuming 4.3 for the density, this is
equivalent to about 0.00047 cm^ per gm., against 0.00250 found
above by direct methods. This shows that the change of volume
during the transition does not take place equally in all directions, an
effect shown by other substances also. Guinchant ^ has also found
the latent heat of the transition to be 4.9 cal. against 3.4 found above.
The agreement should be closer.
The difference of compressibility of the two modifications was
