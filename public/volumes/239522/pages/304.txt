TELEPHONE DIAPHRAGMS. 437
Method of loading the Diaphragm with a Central Mass.
It is shown in Appendix I, at formula (19), that the natural or reso-
nant angular velocity of vibration of a diaphragm, considered as a
simple vibrator, is expressed bv the relation ojq = — • If, therefore,
a known mass mi grams, is applied at the center of the diaphragm,^
and the resonant angular velocity, under load, determined, we should
expect it to be:
't-'oi = ■vl radians per sec. (4)
^w+mi
provided that the vibratory behavior of the loaded diaphragm is the
same as in the original unloaded condition, except in regard to reso-
nant frequency. By combining (19) of App. I, with (4) immediately
above, it should be possible to evaluate both s and m 'in terms of wq,
wi and nil.
Effect of Adding a Mass ini to the Center of the Diaphragm.
The effect of adding a small metallic cylindrical mass mi grams,
to the center of the diaphragm, so as to obtain equation (4), was in-
vestigated by Messrs. H. A. Affel and O. C. Hall, in a thesis for
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on "Telephone-Receiver
Characteristics," in 1914.
A standard bipolar Bell telephone receiver was used with the fol-
lowing dimensions:
Area of each pole in cm. X cm 1.4X0. 225
Distance separating poles in cm 0.85
External diameter of diaphragm in cm 5 . 40
Diameter of clamping circle in cm 4.94
Thickness of diaphragm in cm . 031
Total weight of diaphragm in gms 4. 181
Direct-current resistance of coils, ohms at 20°C .... 73 .
The electrical connections employed were the same as those in Fig. 1
of the 1912 paper, above referred to. The electrical measurements
were all taken at constant voltage (0.42 volt r. m. s.) across the tele-
