compressed by ramming into an open steel shell, and pressure trans-
mitted directly to it by kerosene. Apparently there was no soluble
impurity present, because no rounding of the corners of the isothermals
was ever detected. The quantities used were 85 and 103 gm.

The width of the band of indifference was not nearly so great for
this substance as was expected. It was greatest on the I-II curve,
being here nearly constant at 80 kgm., least on the I-III curve, where
it varied from 16 to 25, and intermediate on the II-III curve, where it
varied from 20 to 60, being greatest at the lowest pressures. The
