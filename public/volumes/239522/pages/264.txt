must occur in conjugate pairs. -^^ Returning to the rejected part of
the sector (4), we need not inquire minutely what roots may be present
there ; it is sufficient for our purposes to recognize that, as <p is analytic
in the finite region in question, there can not be infinitely many of
them. There will be an index g, positive, negative, or zero, such that
if the characteristic numbers ^^ are arranged in order of increasing
absolute value, and the first is denoted by Pg, the second by Pg+i,
and so on, the number pn will be nearly equal to p'n, for large values of n.
To summarize :
The system (1), (2) has infinitely many characteristic values on, of
which not more than a finite number can be imaginary. ^^ The
characteristic numbers can be written in the form
Pn = —]=+ -i=-\-en, 11= g,g-\-l,g-\-2,...,

where
lun f.
en = 0.
n= 00
To this we may add at once that there is just one characteristic
function un{x) corresponding to each characteristic number,
Un (x) = e-""^ + coe""""^ + oi'^c-'^P'^^
(7) f I- ^3 V3 \
= 6-""^+ e J""-' ( V3 sin — PnX - cos — pnxj,
the latter expression involving only real quantities if pn is real.
Now if the usual expansion theory were capable of extension to the
present problem, it would be possible to develop any function, satisfy-
ing certain not very restrictive conditions, in a uniformly convergent
series of the form

n = g
But we shall see that the series is very far from possessing the necessary
flexibility. In fact, we shall prove the following theorem :

of Mathematicians, Cambridge 1912; see the last paragraph of §6, containing
a reference to Birkhofl.
11 If some of the characteristic numbers in the finite region just mentioned
should lie on the rays that form the boundary of the sector, we should take
into account only the values on one of the rays.
12 Laudien (loc. cit., pp. 73-76) gives a proof, which he ascribes to Teich-
mann, that the characteristic values are real from the very beginning.
