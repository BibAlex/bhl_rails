produced by mercury set free by decomposition, in the presence of
steel, either of the Hgl2 of this experiment, or of other mercury salts
used in previous experiments. ^:
The Hglo was obtained from Eimer and Amend, "c. p." and was
used without further purification. For the first runs it was hammered
cold into a thin steel shell, and pressure transmitted directly to it by
kerosene. After this first run small transverse holes were drilled
through the sides of the shell to facilitate the reaction, and cut down
the width of the band of indifPerence, but no effect from this could be
observed. For the later runs, the Hglo was initially melted into the
steel shells and then the lateral holes drilled. Xo effect of the greater
initial compactness in increasing the reaction velocity was tobe

observed. Three different samples were used, from 86 to 100 gm. in
amount, but each of these samples was used for a number of settings
up of the apparatus, and one was used for both high and low pressure
measurements. The effect of pressure is to compact the Hgl2 into a
mineral like mass, without the slightest tendency to dissolve in the
kerosene. After long use a slight amount of decomposition with
setting free of minute globules of metallic mercury could be detected
where the surface of the Hglo comes in contact with the steel. This
is to be expected, because iron will deposit mercury from mercury
salts, but the decomposition was too slight to produce a perceptible
change in the total volume of the reacting ciuantity of Hgl2.
In view of the importance of the maximum temperature exhibited
by this substance, a detailed description of the experiment will be
given. When I started to investigate this substance, all that I knew
about it was that it had a transition at atmospheric pressure at 127Â°,
