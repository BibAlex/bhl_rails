Trichomonas augusta Alexeieff.
This flagellate occurs abundantly in the intestine of Diemydylus
torosus, Rana boylci, R. drayioni, and R. pipiens, Hyla regilla, and
Bufo halophilus. The following table indicates the proportions of the

The Vegetative or Premitotic Stage.
This phase is found free in the intestinal lumen or actively moving
about in the mucus covering the intestinal epithelium. It is the type
found most frequently in our culture slides and in sterilized inoculated
media where it may be accumulated on the under surface of floating
cover glasses.
The form of the body in this phase is distinctly pyriform, (PI. 1,
Fig. 4) with the larger end anterior, and its total length to tip of the
axostyle 2-2.5 times it greatest diameter which is located at 0.3 of the
total length from the anterior end. It is usually nearly symmetrical
as it rotates in locomotion, but in some preparations (PI. 1, Fig. 1)
the ventral side is flattened and the dorsal, bearing the undulating
membrane, is convex. The axostyle lies in the major axis of the body
and extends from near its anterior end to, and generally beyond, the
posterior limit of the cytoplasm, projecting for a distance equal to half
or two-thirds of the diameter of the body.
The form of the body is frequently subject to the elongation and
accumulation of the cytoplasm posteriorly, even beyond (PI. 1, Fig. 2)
the axostyle, in the form of a subspheroidal blob which may detach
itself from the parent mass and slip off from the tip of the axostyle.
These forms in various stages of elongation and constriction are often
