where the first term on the right is a particuhir value of the logarithm,
and n is any integer. As in the case previously treated, the logarithm
is a pure imaginary. Consider, for example, the relation between
the determinants 5i2 and Si^. The latter may be regarded as obtained
from the former by replacing w'3 in the first column by w^. But it
may also be regarded as obtained by replacing each of the roots from
W3 to %v by the root next to it cyclically in the negative direction
(whereby W3 goes into one of the roots with a subscript greater than 4,
and Wi goes into w-z) and then interchanging columns. This process
amounts to a multiplication of each row of 812 by a root of unity, and
so to a multiplication of the whole determinant by a quantity of the
same sort. Similar reasoning applies to f 12 and f 13, and it follows that
the ratio 613^13/512^12 has its absolute value equal to unity, and the real
part of its logarithm equal to zero. The successive values of p in
(42) are not real, because of the factor e'"^", but follow each other at
equal intervals along a ray inclined to the axis of reals at an angle of
tt/v. The correspondence between these values and the roots of the
equation Ai = is established as in the earlier cases.
The roots of Ai = in the region T2V-1 are similarly determined.
There will be infinitely many of them, situated asymptotically along
the ray arg p = — tt/v. But since the original problem involves
p only in the j'th power, as has already been pointed out, the existence
of roots p along this ray implies the existence of roots pe-'^*^" which
will be in the region To, at least from a certain point on, and so will
be among those already found. Thus the consideration of the region
T^v-i adds only a finite number to the list of independent character-
istic values. Hence:
The characteristic values of the system (15), (39), are simple roots
of the determinant equation from a certain point on, and are expres-
sible in the form ^^

the lower border of jS-jv-i, and then the formula will give instead of these the
equivalent values in Si] but the latter will serve as well and will be more con-
