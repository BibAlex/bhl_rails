EFFECTS OF RADIANT ENERGY ON THE EYE. 729
tain other portion goes to heating the electrode or containing tube and
the surrounding mechanism. While therefore the spectrum which
can be seen or photographed is linear, there is superimposed upon it
the continuous spectrum of the radiating solid at rather low tempera-
ture and of relatively large extent, since the radiation is not only from
the arc or its containing tube but from the immediately heated sur-
roundings. Much of the loss of efficiency in both sources referred to
comes from this secondary heat radiation. This is particularly the
case in the quartz mercury arc of which the actual light-giving effi-
ciency is very high, much higher than is indicated even by its really
small specific consumption per c. p.
The existence of this secondary radiation which is mainly of very
long wave length, make comparisons between such sources and the
ordinary radiating solids very difficult. The following table gives
for the magnetite arc the transmission with respect to the total energy
of the most important of the various media which we employed, as
determined by a Rubens thermopile.

It will be observed that the actual transmission of the empty quartz
cell consisting of two 3 mm. polished plates was only 53% of the total
energy. Of the 47% lost, roughly 15% should be in the reflections
from the four surfaces of the two 3 mm. polished plates. The re-
mainder, that is more than a third of the total energy, is mainly
