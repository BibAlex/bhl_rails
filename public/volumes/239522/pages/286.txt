EXPANSION PROBLEMS.
413
When n is large, a characteristic solution may be obtained by setting
p = pn in the determinant Ai, and replacing the t-th element of the
last row by ijt{x, pn) = e""^''' [1], t = 1,2,. . ., v; and this is except for
a constant factor the only characteristic solution ^^ for p = pn. The
numbers pnWi are situated along the positive axis of reals, the numbers
pmvo and pniv^ along the rays making angles of 2ir/v with the positive
axis of reals, and so on. Hence, when the determinant is expanded
according to the minors of its last two rows, two terms are predominant
over the others when n is large and x is not equal to or tt, namely
the terms involving" gP"(Â«'iT+t^:x) ^^^ ^pn{mir+w,x) ^ ^pj^g coefficients
of these expressions are quantities which have already been seen not
to vanish for large values of p. The limits approached by these
coefficients are equal in absolute value, and if the whole determinant
is divided by either square root of their product, they will be replaced
by limits which are conjugate imaginaries. Dividing out also the
factor e"""'"^, we may write
(43) Un (x) = [di] e""^^^ + [do] e"""'^^,
where f/i and do are conjugate imaginary quantities different from
zero,^^ and the limits indicated by the bracket symbols are approached
uniformly in x for .r' ^ x ^. x", if < x' < x" < tt.
This expression for un{x) is sufficient to suggest the proof of the
first theorem, that a series of the form ^anun{x) which converges uni-
formly throughout an interval ^ .r < .tq must represent a function
continuous there with its derivatives of all orders. In calculating the
order of magnitude of the terms of the derived series it will be necessary
to go behind the relation (43) to the complete determinant expression
venient. If the problem is real at the start, all the characteristic numbers
from a certain point on will be actually on the ray arg p = tt/v, and not merely
approach it asymptotically. For if p is a characteristic number, the conjugate
of p is a characteristic number, and e^^^ /" times the conjugate of p is a character-
istic number, and unless arg p = tv/p the number last obtained is distinct from
p, and there are two characteristic values where, if p is large, there ought to
be only one. It may be remarked that in the plane of the variable \ = p",
the characteristic values in this case are real from a certain point on, and
become negatively infinite.
36 Cf . footnote in connection with the corresponding passage in the preceding
section. It is readily shown that the solution indicated can not vanish identi-
cally.
37 When X = a number of terms are of the same order of magnitude, and
when X = TT the terms involving gp-Cwx+w^^) ^^^ ^Pn(w,x+W3^) become com-
parable with those indicated above.
38 They are not the same as the numbers di and di of the preceding section.
