With regard to the magnitude of the denominator in (13), it suffices
to observe that, when pn is real and positive,
\un{x)\^3 e^""'', I Vn (x) \ ^ 3 e^'""('^- ^\
and so
I Jo Un (x) Vn (x) dx \ ^ 9 IT 6^""^.
This inequality, with the one obtained for the numerator, shows
that as n becomes infinite

where Ci is positive and does not depend on n.
From this relation it is apparent that the general coefficient does not
approach zero rapidly enough to enable the terms of the series l^anUn{x)
