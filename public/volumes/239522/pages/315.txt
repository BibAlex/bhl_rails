The second part of the Table gives the results obtained from the
motional-impedance circle, and from the amplitude measurer. The
circle diagram for the case of receiver b, is given in Figure 14. The
outer circle is the motional-impedance circle, plotted to a scale of
ohms, from observations with the Rayleigh bridge (Fig. 12). The
inner circle, is a circle of maximum cyclic vibration velocities, at the
center of the diaphragm, as deduced from vibration amplitudes ob-
served with the vibration explorer, plotted vectorially from the origin
O. It is shown in Appendix I (40) that the motional impedance,
when the sinusoidal testing current is maintained constant, becomes the
product of the vibrational velocity x and a constant. The inner circle,
thus conforming satisfactorily to the impedance circle, supplies a
check upon the theory of the case. Theoretically, the mean vibra-
tion amplitude should be measured over the air-gap, instead of at the
center of the diaphragm; but the difference is probably not material.
It will be noticed that the resonant frequency fo, on the diameter of the
impedance circle, is 1020.4 ■^^ , with a corresponding resonant angular
velocity wo, of 6412 radians per second. The frequencies at the
