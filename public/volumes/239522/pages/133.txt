shoals, which, arising precipitously, uniformly reach to within a
few feet of the surface. It was to me most remarkable that we did not
meet wath a single knoll of any sort jutting up to indeterminate
depths."^* Gardiner also speaks of the Seychelles bank as "extraor-
dinarily level," with depths of from 55 m. to 65 m.; and of "the
wonderfully constant depth" of about 60 m. on the great Nazareth
bank (Indian ocean). ^^ (See Fig. 18.)
Among the conclusions reached by Bassett-Smith after his long
study of the Macclesfield bank, one reads: "The evenness of depth
is the most striking feature of the chart." ^^ (See Figs. 19-20.)
Wharton, one of the leading experts on oceanic bathometry, writes
concerning large banks southwest and south of the Ellice islands:
"The remarkable thing about these banks is the absolute uniformity
of the depth of water over their areas, inside the low rim of growing
coral which encircles their edges in \arious degree. This depth is 24 to
26 fathoms." (See Figs. 34 A and 34B.) In the same article he adds:
" I have no hesitation in saying that a flat floor is an invariable char-
acteristic of a large atoll and I cannot find his [Darwin's] 'deeply
concave surface' in any large atoll. On the contrary, a flat surface is
found in all these, whether the rim be above, or below the surface." ^^
Wharton explained the flatness by wave-cutting, with the sea surface
at its present level, though he did not show why such abrasion was
once possible, while the defending reefs now make it largely impossible.
Notwithstanding the incompleteness of his theory of coral reefs,
Wharton's choice of the agency which produced the flatness of lagoon
floors and of banks seems irresistible. He rightly regarded this flat-
ness as no less than fatal to the Darwin-Dana theor3^ (See page 240.)

The shallowness of the shelf at 24° 30' S. Lat. is explained by Recent, rapid
aggradation due to the local configuration of the coast, and by a corresponding,
special abundance of sand. Depths in fathoms. Uniform scales; vertical scale

lined.
