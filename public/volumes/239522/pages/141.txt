The table is far from being complete but the writer believes it to
illustrate the general situation. Where comparatively recent uplift
has occurred, the island either has no encircling submarine shelf
(Nos. 12, 13, 15, 17, 20-22, 24-20, 36, 37, 42, 45, 47, 54, 55, 63, 65-68
71 72 and 74. See Figs. 25-27 and 31) ; or has a shelf at a depth
less than that of a shelf encircling an undisturbed island, by an amount
roughly equal to the local uplift (Nos. 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 28, 29 31, 32,
38 58, 59, 61 , 73, 75, and 76) . For apparently all but one of the cases
so far reported, the depths of the central hollows in recently uplifted
atolls are less than 40 m.; the single exception is Santa Anna island
in the Solomon group, where the depth may be as much as 90 m.
Specially instructive are the regions where the sea bottom has been
differentially upwarped. From the work of E. C. Andrews, A. Agassiz,
