the double maximum amplitude of the luminous band, divided by the
magnification factor, as found for the setting, should give the true
maximum cyclic amplitude ,t^ of the diaphragm from its normal
position of rest.
The amplitude measurer is then removed from the receiver T, and a
damping device is applied to the diaphragm. A corresponding series
of simultaneous inductance and resistance measurements is then made
over the same range of frequency as before, with the telephone dia-
phragm damped, so as to suppress its vibrations. The application
■of a finger to the center of the diaphragm will serve to damp out the
vibrations; but this is not a satisfactory damping method; ])ecause,

first, the pressure is not uniform during the period of testing, and
secondly; because any pressure on the diaphragm, by diminishing the
air-gap, alters, to some extent, the magnetic characteristics of the in-
strument. A convenient form of damping device is indicated in Fig-
ure 13. It virtually applies a relatively large mass to the diaphragm,
without imposing any appreciable mechanical pressure; so that in-
ertia is depended upon for extinguishing the vibration. The receiver
is securely supported in a horizontal position. A small threaded
metallic disk K, is attached, by means of shellac, to the center of the
diaphragm. Thick shellac varnish appears to be a convenient material
for cementing a load to the diaphragm. The cylindrical metallic
mass M (4 cm. long and 2 cms. in diameter) is then connected mechani-
