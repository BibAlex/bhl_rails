be solved explicitly, having infinitely many roots given by the relation
PnV (W2 - wi) = log (^- ^^^j + 2 rnri,
where the first term on the right is understood to refer to a particular
determination of the logarithm, and n is any integer. It appears from
the determinant expressions for 5i and 59 that each of these numbers is
either the conjugate or the negative of the conjugate of the other;
consequently they have the same absolute value, SiWi^" and 52^2*"
likewise, and the above logarithm is a pure imaginary. Hence, noting
that
W2 — Wi = 2i sm -•,
V
we may write
Pn
sin (jr/vy
where ^uq is a real constant. These roots are all of the first order, for
the derivative of ZX2 never vanishes. The passage from the roots of
Ai to those of Ai is effected by reasoning of the same sort as that used
in connection with the simple case of the third order. The conclusion
is as follows:
The equation A = has an infinite number of roots, which can be
written in the form
(^^^ "'= sin(x/.) ' n = g,g+l,g + 2,...,
where g is some integer, positive, negative, or zero,^^ and ^'^
(21) ^'"^ en = 0.
With the exception of a finite number at most, the roots are of the
first order.
Of course it still remains to consider the possibility of the existence
of roots in the region Tov^i. But an argument analogous to that just
completed shows that, at least from a certain point on, this region can
22 Of course it would be possible to adjust mo so as to make g equal to zero.
