EFFECTS OF RADIANT ENERGY ON THE EYE.

radiation can enough energy be communicated into interior layers to
affect them in a similar manner. To put the thing in another way, it is
only relatively inactive rays that through consequent lack of absorp-
tion penetrate a medium easily. With sufficient incident intensity,
however, enough energy may penetrate the outer layers to produce
definite action within them.
In ordinary transparent media the loss of energy by real absorption
in the substance is less than the loss at the surfaces by reflection.
This loss depends on the refractive index of the medium with respect
to the entering or emerging ray, and for nearly normal incidence the
coefficient of reflection, that is the proportion of the ray transmitted
through a single reflecting surface is K =
(n - 1)
— . This coefficient
is the same for each successive surface of transition, so that for rn
surfaces the coefficient of transmission are Km = K™. Thus, if
a glass plate has an index of refraction n the light transmitted is K^

lenses, the reflection losses may be severe, particularly if some of the
glasses are of high index. Figure 1 shows in curve a the transmission
of a single surface for various indices of refraction, and in curve b
