POLYIVIORPHIC TRANSFORMATIONS OF SOLIDS. 63
practical conditions usually give us the total amount of impurity
present in the two phases together. The distribution problem is not
touched above; to solve it would require a knowledge of the heat and
volume effects of solution.
The Equation of the Transition Lines.
This equation has already been developed in a previous paper. ^
The equation is
(p - po) \Av + A^ (r - To) -i Aa (p - po)] - {Aso - ACp) (r - tq)
— ACp tIocj— =

For the slope of the line we find
cIt Ai'o + A|3 (r — To) — Aa (p — po)

and for the second derivative

The notation is as follows; A v is the difference of volume of the two
phases at the point po, tq of the transition line {Av = Vi — vo) ■ A|3 is
the difference of the thermal expansions.
Aa is the difference of the compressibiHties considered as positive.

ACp is the difference of the specific heats (ACp = Cp^ — Cp), and A^o
is the difference of entropy between the two phases (A^o = AH/tq).
The equation presupposes that throughout the range of application
Aa, A/3, and ACp remain constant.
In the preceding paper very little discussion was given of the shape
of the curve determined by the above equation, because the shape of
the melting curve is determined essentially by the variations with
pressure and temperature of Aa, A/3, and ACp. In particular, Aa
