TELEPHONE DIAPHRAGMS.

A small triangular mirror M of very thin silvered glass, and say of
1 mm. in length of each edge, is fastened to a little phosphor-bronze
strip, about 4 mm. long, stretched between two pointed metallic
abutments. The strip is so fastened that one point of the mirror is
pressed elastically into contact with the diaphragm D, to the center
of which it is presented. The purpose of the mirror is to reflect a
beam of light, from a powerful lamp, on to a graduated scale; so that
vibrations of the diaphragm will cause the reflected beam to extend
into a band of light on the scale. Since the effective radius of lever
arm in the mirror is about l/3rd mm., the amplitude of motion of
the diaphragm can readily be magnified, say 8000 times, on a scale

one meter distant. The ratio of the distance traversed on the scale
by the reflected image, to the motion of the diaphragm producing the
displacement, may be called the magnification factor of the instrument.
It depends upon the geometry of the mirror and reflecting system.
For any particular application, the magnification factor can be directly
measured by the micrometer screw-head shown at A. The brass rod
R, carrying the mirror on its forked extremity, moves in a guide, and
its movement parallel to the axis of the telephone receiver is con-
trolled by the screw head A. One turn of the screw head A advances
the mirror M towards the diapliragm through a distance of one thread.
