POLYMORPHIC TRANSFORMATIONS OF SOLIDS. 103
In addition to these very rough values at the triple point, there
have been several other determinations at atmospheric pressure.
It has been shown directly that the relations of I and II are abnormal
both in regard to expansion and specific heat. The form II has a
negative coefficient of expansion. We have no accurate measurements
of it at the transition point. The best are by Fizeau ^^ on cr^-stals.
He found at 40° for large crystals the average contraction of 0.0648
and for the precipitated salt b}^ a dilatometric method 0.0674 cm^./gm.
(I have taken the density at room temperature as 5.67 from data of
Rodwell ^^). Fizeau and Rodwell have both shown, however, that the
coefficient increases rapidly with rise of temperature. Rodwell's data
would give an average coefficient between 70° and 150° of — O.OaSSS.
From data of Rodwell we also find that the mean expansion of
I between 150° and 450° is about O.O55. These measurements of
the expansion are too uncertain to justify us in making calculations
of the difference. The data for specific heat are somewhat more
concordant. Two observers agree in finding that I has a smaller
specific heat than II. At the transition point Bellati and Romanese ^^
give for the specific heat of I 0.0577 cal. and for that of II 0.0654,
making a difterence of 0.0077 cal. Mallard and Le Chatelier ^^ give
for the specific heat of I between 154° and 347° 0.055, and for II
between 20° and 127°, 0.059. Since however, they estimate the
accuracy of the individual measurements as only 3%, we evidently
cannot place much reliance on their difference. If we assume the
value of Bellati and Romanese for the difference and combine with
the values given above for —. — (= —0.0653) and —. — (= 0.005),
dp dp
we find A/3 = — .00002, whereas we know A/3 to be positive. If A/3 is
to be positive with the above values for —, — and , — , the difference
dp dp
of specific heats must be at least twice as great as it is. We can get a
much better value for Aa. If we assume A/3 = 0, and it evidently is
very small, we find Aa is of the order of 0.065, the same as found above
at the triple point. We may accept this value with some confidence
therefore. Combined with the value of Richards and Jones ^° for the
compressibility of the ordinary variety, this means that I is about
twice as compressible as II, although it has the smaller volume. The
