edge, is subject to distributed attracting electromagnetic and opposing
resilient forces, with distributed mass or inertia, and distributed
frictional resistance to motion. In Figure 7, the system is simplified
to an equivalent central particle, of mass m, attracted electromagneti-
cally, and having its motion opposed by a localized elastic tension of «■
dynes per cm. of displacement, together with a localized frictional
opposing force ^ of r dynes per kine (dynes per cm per sec) .
The justification for the above simplifying substitution, lies in the
fact that the observed " motional-impedance circle," and its associated
phenomena, are found to be in satisfactory accordance with the simpli-
fied theory.
Deductions from the Motional-Impedance Circle taken
separately.
It was shown in the paper of 1912, that from an inspection of the
motional circle, it is possible to obtain the following data:
(1) The resonant angular frequency of the diaphragm *
=J
Wo = radians per second (1)
This frequency is found at the maximum motional impedance, i. e.
at OP, Figure 4, the diameter of the motional-impedance circle.
(2) The damping constant, or logn decrement per second of the
r
diaphragm: A = — numeric per second (2)
This damping constant is a function of the distribution of frequencies
around the motional-impedance circle. It is equal to half the differ-
ence between the angular velocities at the cjuadrantal points QQ',
Figure 4. In t seconds after the release of the diaphragm from a dis-
turbed position, the amplitude of residual disturbance is €~^' times
the initial amplitude.
(3) At resonance, i. e., at the natural frequency of the diaphragm,
the magnitude of the motional impedance, or the diameter of the
motional impedance circle, is defined by
A-
Zm = — absohms (3)

by the B. A.
