to remain finite as n becomes infinite. Let xo be any particular value
in the interval < .tq < t. Modifying the form of (7), we may write
Un{xo) = e- p""^ -{- 2 c''"""^ sin (-^ pnXo - '^j.
The sine in the right-hand member may be zero or nearly zero for
some values of n, but there are certainly infinitely many values of n
for which this is not the case. For

which ultimately becomes practically equal to .tq, so that the two
parentheses on the left-hand side can not both be nearly equal to
integral multiples ^"^ of tt. It follows that for infinitely many values

where Co, c^, and C4 are all positive and independent of 71. As the right-
hand member of the last inequality becomes infinite with n, the proof
of Theorem II is complete.
It may be remarked that no use has been made in this demonstra-
tion of the fact that all the characteristic numbers are given by the
asymptotic formula that we have employed. The proof would be
unimpaired if there were infinitely many others. It is sufficient to
know that there exist an infinite number of real characteristic values
distributed in accordance with the formula. And this latter fact is
17 More precisely, if 5 is the smaller of the quantities .xo, ir — xo, the index
n may be made so large that
and then the difference between the two parentheses is between ^5 and tt — ^5,
and one or the other of the parentheses must itself differ from the nearest
integral multiple of tt by at least \h.
