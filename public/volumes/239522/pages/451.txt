•lowing carbol-thionin solution devised by one of us retains its prop-
erties indefinitely and from it a powerful staining solution may be
made at once by the simple addition of water:
Thionin to saturation, about .3 gm.
Absolute alcohol, (>0 cc.
Phenol crystals (melted) 30 cc.
For use, add one full drop of this solution to 2 cc. of distilled water.
Sections are stained as follows :
(1) Lugol's solution 1:2:100, 1 minute, followed by water, 9»/o
alcohol and sodium hx'posulphite solution, to remove mercurial
precipitates. Water.
(2) 0.2% solution of water soluble eosin in 80% alcohol, 5 mmutes.
Water.
(3) Carbol thionin diluted immediately before use as above, 5 min-
utes. Water.
(4) Differentiate and dehydrate in 95% alcohol, two changes, until
excess of thionin is removed and sections show well marked
eosin stain, about 30 seconds.
(5) Oil of origanum.
(6) Place on slide, blot, wash in xylol, blot, xylol-balsam.
To obtain the most brilliant results it is important not to overstain
the sections in thionin solution as it is then impossible to produce
sharp differentiation of the Nissl bodies by treating with alcohol.
The results also are more brilliant the shorter the time that has
elapsed between the fixation of the tissues and the staining of the
sections.

conjunctiva and cornea.
Clmical: Our experiments show that the effects on the conjunctiva
and cornea of moderate exposures to waves less than 295 /xM m length
do not differ qualitatively in their clinical aspects from those produced
by longer exposures to waves from 295 MM to 305 mm m length. Severe
exposures, however, produce markedly different effects on the cornea
in the case of the short waves than in the case of the longer waves
owing to the fact that the latter are not fully absorbed by the corneal
stroma. The effects of severe exposures to very short waves is there-
