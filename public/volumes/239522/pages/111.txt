have been located in accordance with \'ogt's estimate, at 72% and
12% of orthochise respectively, which represents probably a fair
approximation to the truth. x\ssuniing that the diagram represents
in a general way the conditions of equilibrium for the crystallization
of these feldspars, it is evident that if we start with a melt having a
composition represented by a point lying well to the right of i, say
Or. 95% (composition .r), we should have, as the temperature fell to
ordinary temperatures, represented by the base line, assuming of
course that equilibrium was established throughout, as a final product,
a homogeneous mixed-crystal of the microcline type of the same

composition with which we started. If we start with a mixture say
of the composition represented by a feldspar like No. 4 with about 80%
Or. (composition ij on the diagram), crystallization would begin when
the curve AE was reached and the composition of the first crystalliza-
tion would be that of the point t/o. Assuming a continuous adjust-
ment of equilibrium as crystallization progressed, the composition of
the solid phase would change continuously along the line Ai until a
composition yz was reached when the whole mixture would become
solid. With still further lowering of temperature, if we assume that
at some temperature, say at that represented by the point C, an inver-
sion of the orthoclase to microcline occurred, then when the temperature
