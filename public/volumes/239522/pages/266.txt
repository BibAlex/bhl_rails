EXPANSION PROBLEMS. 389
or, in consequence of the inequalities

which hold for all values of n from a certain point on,

However large k may be, and however small numerically the negative
quantity X2 — xi, the series which has this last expression for its
7ith term is convergent. It follows that the series obtained by differ-
entiating (8) term by term k times is uniformly convergent ^* for
^ .T ^ xo; and as .^2 may be any number between and Xo, the
theorem is proved. -^^
The question is now inevitable: Is it possible to develop every
analytic function in a uniformly convergent series of the form (8),
with the restriction, perhaps, that the function shall vanish at the ends
of the interval? As in other problems of this sort, it is easy to deter-
mine what the values of the coefficients must be, if such an expansion
exists. The formal series being given, an answer to the question may
be expressed as follows :
Theorem II. // N is any positive integer, however large, it is possible
to define a function f{x), analytic throughout the interval ^ a; ^ ir,
and vajiishing with its first N derivatives both for x = and for x = r,
such that its formal expansion in a series of the form (8) diverges at every
interior point of the interval.
The system adjoint to (1), (2) consists of the differential equation
dx"^
and the boundary conditions
«(0) = 0, (j(7r) = 0, »'(7r) = 0.
Its characteristic numbers are the numbers p„, and its characteristic
solutions have the form
d2) Cr,{x) = ^P"(^--'-f a;c"''»(^-'^) + w-f?"'""'^-'^'.
14 Of course the terms of the series are continuous and in fact analytic func-
tions of X.
15 Professor Birkhoff points out that it may be shown by a slight modifica-
tion of this argument that the series converges uniformly throughout a region
of the complex x-plane including the segment (0, Xo) of the axis of reals in its
interior, and so represents a function analytic for ^ x < Xq.
