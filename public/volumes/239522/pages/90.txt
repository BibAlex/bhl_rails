such as to permit the comtamination of the Hquid at high pressures.
Tammann finds for AV at atmospheric pressure 0.0573, and at 1455
kgm. 0.0378, against the corresponding values 0.0599 and 0.0322.
The agreement at atmospheric pressure is comparatively good, but it
is unusual that the discrepancy should be in the direction it is at high
pressures. Other values for comparison are 47° to 50° for the melting
point by McCreath,^^ and 48.5° by Block.^^ Block gives for the
change of volume 0.0576. For the latent heat there is 40.8 cal. by
a direct method and 41 by a cryoscopic method by Eykmann.^^ The
value found above, 40.8, is in unusually good agreement.
Urethan has three triple points at each one of which the difference
of compressibility etc. between the phases can be calculated. The
data are not accurate enough, however, at the two triple points in-
volving the liquid to give accurate results. Thus a solution of the
equations at the triple point L-I-II demands that I be very much more
expansible than the liquid, which seems very unlikely. Probably a
large part of the error is occasioned by the abnormally rapid change of
slope of the AV curve for L-II. The only information of value is,
therefore, that given at the triple point I-II-III. We find on solving
the six equations at this point the following values,
Aai2 = O.O5II
Aa23 = O.O4II
Aai3 = O.O4I2
Ai8i2 = - O.O55
• Ai323 = O.O3I35
AjSis = O.O3I3O
ACpi2 = - 0.127 >
ACp23 = 0.43 r kgm. cm./gm.
ACpi3= 0.30 )
There is doubtless a large amount of uncertainty in these numerical
values; probably Aoios is too large, and Aj8i2 too small. The signs of
the quantities are of interest. The compressibilities follow the order
of volumes, as we should expect, and the specific heats the order of
temperatures. Thus as we raise temperature at constant pressure we
may change III to I, and then I to II. On passing through each of
these transitions the specific heat increases. As regards the thermal
expansion, we do not know whether to expect the phase at the higher
temperature or that with the larger volume to have the greater expan-
