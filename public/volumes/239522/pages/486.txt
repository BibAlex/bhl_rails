EFFECTS OF RADIANT ENERGY ON THE EYE.

complicated for complete analysis since fully to understand them
would require a knowledge not only of the chemical changes originally
produced, but of the vital processes of the cells. An interesting
question in regard to them is that concerning latency of their appear-
ance. In the case of abiotic action, as has been pointed out, abso-
lutely no visible change either histological or clinical takes place
immediately after the exposure, and usually not for several hours.
This is no doubt due to the fact that time is required for the chemical
changes to produce physical alterations. In the case of heat effects,
it is a matter of common experience that latency also occurs and that
the time interval varies with the intensity of the exposure, but it is a
far less striking phenomenon than in the case of abiotic effects. This
may be due, among other causes, to the fact that the energy required
to produce chemical changes by heat is so great owing to the rapid
dissipation of the latter, that under ordinary conditions the critical
point is quickly passed and an excessive effect produced.
Abiotic Energy in the Solar Spectrum.
As has already been noted the solar spectrum when filtered through
a thick layer of atmosphere as at sea level when the sun is low fades
out at about 305 njx. At high altitudes and with the sun running
