Introduction .
In this paper data are given sufficient for a thermodynamic specifi-
cation of a number of polymorphic transitions between soHds. Besides
the transition quantities themselves (change of volume, latent heat,
slope of the transition line) it has been possible in a good many cases
to give at least a rough approximation to the difference of compressi-
bility, thermal expansion, and specific heat of the reacting phases.
The field is a comparatively unworked one. Hitherto investigations
on polymorphic changes have been concerned for the most part with
the temperature of transition at atmospheric pressure. There are
not many measurements of latent heat or change of volume even at
atmospheric pressure. Still fewer measurements of the effect of pres-
sure have been made; many of these are due to Tammann, whose
pressure range was considerably lower than that of this paper. The
