The factor e'"""*, of course, is ec{ual to ( — 1)". The third factor
approaches a limit Hi—Hd as n becomes infinite. The second term
in the braces, without the power of pn, may be WTitten similarly as
^rnt cot (ir/;-) gTiTTi niultiplied by a factor which approaches the limit
Hi + Hii. Consequently the whole expression in braces is equal to
( — l)"pn~^~^ gWJT cot u/;-) multiplied by a quantity which approaches
2Hi. It follows that the absolute value of the expression is from
some point on greater than

where Cg is a positive constant, provided that Hi 9^0.
The condition that Hi be ec{ual to zero is that the imaginary part
of the limiting value approached by the exponent of the third factor
in (38), namely, the expression
(q + 2)Ti
V
be an odd multiple of ^iri. There is no apparent reason why this
condition should not be satisfied, in particular cases But it can
surely not be satisfied for two successive values of q. We may accord-
ingly adopt the following rule, with the assurance that the indicated
choice of q is always possible:
Let iV be any positive integer. Then q shall be the first integer
greater than or equal to N, for which Hi ^ 0.
Assuming that q is so chosen, we infer from (37) that

The remainder of the proof that the series diverges need not be
elaborated. The details are suggested partly by the special discus-
