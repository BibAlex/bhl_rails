indications are that the difference of specific heat between I and II
changes sign along the transition line; at atmospheric pressure I has
the smaller specific heat, but at the triple point that of II is the smaller.
It must be insisted, however, that all these values are exceedinglv

The form of I is cubic and that of II hexagonal, but the two forms
are very little different.

It is particularly difficult to get accurate results for this substance,
because of the unusually wide region of indifference. The interpreta-
tion of the earlier results was also obscured liy occasional leaks through
a minute flaw in the cylinder; this flaw was due to amalgamation
