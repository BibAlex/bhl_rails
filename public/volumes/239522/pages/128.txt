Though the conditions aflfecting these oceanic areas are, and long
have been, highly variable, it is instructive to note the relation of the
maximum depth to width of the platform. Average values for the
two elements have been computed and the results given in Table II.
Similar averages for general depths on banks and in the deeper parts
of lagoons are also there entered.
