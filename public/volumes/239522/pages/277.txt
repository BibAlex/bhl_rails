the reservation that only characteristic functions corresponding to
simple roots of the determinant equation are to be taken into account,
we are entitled to make the assertion :
The statement of Theorem I is applicable to the series considered in the
present section.
There is a corresponding extension of Theorem 11. Let the left-
hand member of the differential equation (15), without the term p^u,
be denoted by ^(m). The differential expression adjoint to this is
and the equation adjoint to (15) is
(29) M{v) + p^v = 0.
The determination of the adjoint boundary conditions ^^ must be
carried through in some detail.
In Lagrange's identity,
vL{u) — uM{v) = -^ P{u, v),
the expression P(u, v) is a bilinear form in u(x), u'{x),. . ., u^"'^^ (.r),
v{x), v'{x), . . ., t)^""^^ (.t). If this identity is integrated with regard to x
from to TT, the resulting expression on the right, which may be de-

Let 7] denote the matrix of its coefficients, the coefficient of ngV/

way in which rj was obtained that the last v elements in each of
the first V rows vanish, and likewise the first v elements in each of the
last V rows.^^ Let the linear forms Wi{u),. . ., WvCu), which occur

27 As a matter of fact, nearly half of the remaining elements also vanish;
but this point is not of importance for the present discussion.
