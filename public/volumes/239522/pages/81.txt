slightly pinkish, but it had a melting point 0.02Â° higher than that of
the first lot, and a trifle higher than any previously recorded for
phenol. The purity is apparently, therefore, as great as can be
obtained by ordinary means. The pinkish specimen was used for
the high pressure determinations. This specimen was not perfectly
pure, however, because some rounding of the corners could be detected.
It was melted into the inverted steel shell and pressure transmitted
to it by mercury. Four different fillings of the apparatus were used;
one for the point at low pressures and the other three for the points
at high pressures. The quantities used varied from 13.5 to 17.5 gm.
