Tables I and II illustrate the following rules.
(a) Both maximum and general lagoon depths increase with the
width of the platform, until that w^idth reaches a value of about 20 km.
These rules apply not only for world averages but also for averages
calculated respectively for the Fiji and Maldive groups. It appears,
therefore, that, where the conditions are not far from uniform, the
filHng of the lagoon is in direct proportion to the width of the platform;
yet more clearly than when many archipelagoes are considered.
Where the platform is extremely narrow, the lagoon is almost, or quite,
filled to sea-level. (Compare P'igs. 5-20, 38-43.)
(b) Atoll and barrier lagoons of similar widths usually have
maximum and general depths of the same order of magnitude.
(c) The lagoons of "drowned atolls" are deeper than those of
normal atolls having respectively the same widths of platform. This
fact is expected, since the periodic destruction of reef corals must
mean slower filling of a lagoon with coral detritus. (See page 214.)
(d) The new theory demands that lagoon depths shall be generally
less than those on reefless banks; Table II shows the corresponding
fact.
(e) The maximum depth of ordinary atoll lagoons is almost never
more than 91 m. (50 fathoms). In only one case is the lagoon depth
of a "drowned atoll" more than 100 m.; the Macclesfield bank, which
is not completely rimmed with a reef, bears water 110 m. deep.
Since probably not more than 5 m. to 25 m. can be allowed for the
thickness of the Post-Glacial calcareous veneer in the wider lagoons,
the accordance of platform depths for the wider lagoons and reefless
banks seems clear. Their range of 60-90 m. represents magnitudes
