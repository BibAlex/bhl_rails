GLACIAL-CONTROL THEORY OF CORAL REEFS. 213
On the Great Chagos bank the peripheral reef crown, now covered
with 7 m. to 20 m. of water, carries only a small proportion of living
coral. Darwin suggested that this bank was formerly a normal atoll
and he attributed the killing of most of its corals to a very rapid
subsidence. To this view there are several direct objections. The
assumption that the species of the once living reef would be killed by a

subsidence, even one nearly instantaneous, is not proved. If the
sinking took place at a rate comparable to the average rate of obserA^ed
epeirogenic movements elsewhere, the coral species could easily keep
pace with the deepening and retain their favored depth below sea-level.
Moreover, the subsidence would have to be incredibly uniform over a
vast area, to explain the nearly uniform depth of the present rim on all
sides of the bank.
