dii'ectly measured at several points. These values, which are some-
what more self consistent than usual, are shown in Figure 3. At low
pressures (high temperatures), the form with the larger volume is
more compressible, but as we go along the transition curve to higher
pressures and lower temperatures, the difference of compressibility
become less, and finally reverses sign in the neighborhood of the
region of rapid curvature. Below 70° the modification stable at the
higher temperature is the more compressible. This is perhaps what
one might be at first inclined to call the normal behavior, but it is to
be noticed that there are two opposite factors here. It is natural to
think that the phase of greater volume, as well as the high tempera-
ture phase would be the more compressible. Evidently both of these
things cannot happen at the same time on this curve. At low pres-

sures it is the phase of greater volume which is the more compres-
sible, but at high pressures it is the high temperature phase which is
the more compressible. The relations in this regard at the high
pressure end of the curve are similar to those on the melting curve of
water and ice I, where water, although of smaller volume, is more
compressible than ice. It should be remarked that this reversal in
the sign of the compressibility is not to be regarded as remarkable
in view of the sudden change of direction of the transition curve.
The transition curve is unusual in this respect; one may expect
unusual features in the behavior of the two phases to correspond.
The differences of the expansion and of the specific heats may be
calculated from the difference of compressibility, and are shown in
Table II. The difference of expansion runs roughly parallel to the
