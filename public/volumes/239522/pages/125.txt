Pleistocene Temperatures of the Tropical Ocean.
In spite of conflict of views as to the cause of Pleistocene glaciation,
it is clear that it was accompanied by some fall of average air tempera-
ture and of average ocean temperature, in the northern hemisphere at
least. In that hemisphere the great ice-caps, then larger than the
present ice-caps by nearly 16,000,000 square kilometers in total area,
were not merely the result of an atmospheric condition very difi"erent
from that of the present time. The ice-caps in their turn must have
seriously affected the wind system and therefore the system of surface
currents in the sea. The annual shifts of the currents and changes in
the paths of great storms, characterized by extremes of air temperature,
must have often lowered the sea temperature below 20° C, even in
parts of the ocean where the mean annual temperature may have been
above 20° C. Though occurring but once a year, a few days' exposure
to a temperature below that point would seriously endanger the life
of the i-eef-building corals.
The growing l)elief among glacialists, that the southern hemisphere
was locally glaciated at the same time as the northern hemisphere, is a
second principal reason for postulating a great restriction of coral
reefs in the Pleistocene. The glaciers of the Andes, from the equator
to Cape Horn, were much larger than now, at a time which is most
probably placed in this geological period. Of similar date are the
formerly expanded glaciers of Central Africa and New Zealand, and
the Antarctic ice-cap seems to ha^'e been much thicker and more
extensive during the Pleistocene. The notable glaciation of southern
regions now bearing no perennial ice, as New South Wales (35° S.
Lat.), Western Tasmania (42^ S. Lat.), Campbell Island (52.5° S. Lat.),
the Auckland islands (51° S. Lat.), Macquarie island (55° S. Lat.),
the Falkland islands (51° S. Lat.), and the eastern highlands of South
Africa (28° S. Lat.), has been recently referred to the same period. ^^
