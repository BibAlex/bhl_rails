TELEPHONE DIAPHRAGMS. 429
Mechanics of the Receiver.
The four essential and characteristic constants of any receiver, from
the electromechanical point of view, are as follows:
A, the "force factor," or the electromagnetic pull, in dynes on the
diaphragm, per absampere ^ of alternating current, subject to the
restrictions that A varies somewhat with the frequency and strength
of the actuating current. The factor is supposed to be measured at a
standard frequency, and with feeble currents (less than 3 milliamperes).
m, the "equivalent mass" of the diaphragm, or the mass, in grams.

which, moving with the velocity at the center, has the same kinetic
energy as the whole diaphragm, with its actual distribution of mass and
velocities.
r, the "motional resistance" of the diaphragm, in dynes per unit
velocity (cm. per sec), referred to the motion of the equivalent mass.
This force, due to internal friction, eddy-current losses, and air pro-
pulsion on the diaphragm, is assumed to be directly proportional to
the velocity, and dissipates the energy of motion.
s, the "stiffness constant" or the force per unit displacement (dynes
per cm.), opposing the movement of the diaphragm, and referred to
the equivalent mass at the center.

2 C. G. S. Magnetic units are used in developing the theory, throughout
this paper, with the distinguishing prefix ab- or abs-. The angle sign Z ap-
pended to the unit of an equation indicates that each term is a complex
quantity or "plane-vector."
