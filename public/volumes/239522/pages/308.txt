presented in Table III, it will be seen that the effect of loading the
diaphragm, with masses up to nearly 2.5 gms., did not seriously affect
the equivalent mass m of the diaphragm, as deduced from the observa-
tions recorded in Column VII. On the other hand, similar loads,
applied to other diaphragms, have been followed by changes in equiva-
lent mass, with corresponding vitiations of results. ^^
It has also been found, in certain cases, that while the addition of a
load to the center of the diaphragm changed the equivalent mass of
the diaphragm considered by itself, the addition of further loads,
seemed to leave the equivalent mass of the diaphragm with the first
load practically unchanged. Consequently, if say three different
increasing loads are added in succession, the solutions of simultaneous
equations, using the unloaded and any loaded case, will not be con-
sistent; whereas solutions of simultaneous equations using different
loaded conditions may be consistent.
The following case may illustrate the preceding remark. A tele-
phone receiver with an active diaphragm weight of 4.94 gm. and 0.399
mm. thick, over japan, was tested by the motional-impedance circle,
first unloaded, and then with three successively increasing brass loads
of 0.615, 0.978, and 2.998 gms. The resonant angular velocities in
these four cases were respectively (1) 7570, (2) 6568, (3) 5990, and (4)
4289 radians per second. From these data, we obtain the following
results, using formula (5), entered with various pairs of observations: —
