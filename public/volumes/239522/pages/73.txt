greater lag than he did in his later experiments. He was not able to
repeat the early experiments, and was able to explain them only by
supposing that the particular specimen of machine oil which he had
used to transmit pressure had some peculiar property which the later
specimens did not have.
A comparison of the numerical values of Tammann's later paper and
the values found above gives the following results. Tammann found
the change of volume I-II between 1000 kgm. and the triple point to
be constant within the limits of error at 0.0095, the probable error
being 5%. I found above that AT' increases on the transition line
from 0.0086 at atmospheric pressure to 0.00102 at 3000. Tammann's
triple point is 2940 kgm. and 100°, against 2810 and 99.4° above.
Tammann found the I-II line straight within the limits of error, with
a slope of 0.01473; I found the slope to increase in absolute value from
0.0146 at 1 kgm. to 0.0182 at 3000 kgm. Tammann calculates the
slope of the I-III line at the triple point to be 0.0195; I find above
0.0140. The slope of the II-III line Tammann gives as —0.75, and
I find it to vary from —.415 to —.273. At the triple point Tammann
gives for the change of volume (uncorrected) of II-III, 0.0205, and
for I-III, 0.0115, against 0.0241 and 0.0140 above (corrected). Tam-
mann, however, had to leave an unexplained discrepancy of 7-10%
in the AV values for II-III, the change of volume being different
for the two directions of reaction.
For the values of Aa, A/S, and ACp, two methods of estimation are
available. At the triple point the various quantities may be com-
puted, and there are also experimental determinations of the difference
of compressibility. Neither of these methods gives satisfactory
results, however. The calculations at the triple point are uncertain
because the variation of AV along the II-III line is so slight that even
its sign is uncertain. The experimental values of the difl'erence of
compressibility are irregular and uncertain. We can, however, make
the following rough statements at the triple point. I is more com-
pressible than II, the difference being of the order of 0.065. The
difference of expansion between I and II is very small and is uncertain
as to sign. The specific heat of I is greater than that of II, and the
difference is of the order of 0.3 kgm. cm. per gm. Ill is more compressi-
ble than I, and the difference is fairly large, of the order of O.O55,
but there is a good deal of uncertainty as to the numerical value of
this difference. Ill is less expansible than I, the difference being of
the order of O.O44 and III has a smaller specific heat than I, of the
order of 0.3. From these values, of course, the differences between II
and III may be found immediately by a subtraction.
