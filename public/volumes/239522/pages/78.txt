to 153째 at 2200 kgm., but no transition line was found. Again the
question, what had become of the line starting at 127째? Very shortly
after this the flaw in the cylinder grew to visible size, a new cylinder
was made, the mysterious points found before at high temperatures
and pressures disappeared, and the correct explanation of the effects
was found.
In brief, the curious effects are due to a transition curve with a
maximum, combined with a region of indifference of unusual shape.
This region is indicated by the circles in Figure 24, which mark the

experimentally determined limits of this region; the transition curve
is drawn through the mean points. We see that the region of indiffer-
ence is of different shape on the two branches of the curve. If Hgl2 is
heated at atmospheric pressure, the red changes to yellow pretty
sharply on passing through 127째, but on cooling again, the yellow may
persist for several hours, even at room temperature. That is, the red
cannot be much superheated, but the yellow can be very considerably
subcooled. With increasing pressure and temperature, the shape of
the region changes as indicated, until on the descending branch of the
transition line, the equilibrium may be overpassed in either direction,
but to a very much less extent than at atmospheric pressure. This
