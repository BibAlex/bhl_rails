or Cp placed near a transition line, on one side, shows that the phase
on that side of the line has the greater compressibility, thermal expan-
sion, or specific heat. In addition, the Arabic numerals placed in the
regions of the several phases show the crystalline systems. The
Roman numerals give the designation of the phases used in the
early part of this paper. The information about the crystalline

work which deserves to be better known in this country.
It is evident in the first place that AgNOs belongs in a class apart
from the other five univalent nitrates. Its phase diagram is entirely
different in character, and it is known not to crystallize isomorphously
