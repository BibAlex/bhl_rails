against the tension of the spiral spring shown. In the particular
screw used, there were 24 threads to the inch, or 1 turn = 1.06 mm.
The semicircular divided scale s enables the advance of the screw to be
measured to ^ degree, and estimated to jq degree; so that the ad-
vance could be measured to 1.5 /x, and estimated to 5 /jl. With the
mirror in working contact on the diaphragm at rest, the position of
the reflected spot of light is observed on the scale. The screw head a
is now turned steadily, in one and the same direction, through several

successive angles, and the corresponding excursions of the spot of
light recorded. Knowing the advances made by the screw, and the
corresponding numbers of scale divisions in the excursions, the magni-
fication factor for the setting is immediately deducible. A calibra-
tion curve for magnification factor of spot deflection, versus-screw
head angular motion, usually follows a straight line, over sa}' 60
microns of diaphragm amplitude; provided that the range of scale
deflection does not commence with the mirror almost breaking contact
