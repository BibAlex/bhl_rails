GLACIAL-CONTROL THEORY OF CORAL REEFS. 163
duced in the sea surface by the gravitative attraction of an ice-cap
like that covering the northern part of North America in Pleistocene
time.*
The lowering of general sea-level by the abstraction of water from
the sea, to form one or more ice-caps, and the corresponding rise chie
to melting of the ice have been discussed by some of the authors men-
tioned. In 1882, Penck estimated that the Pleistocene glaciation in
the northern hemisphere alone sunk the general sea surface 66.5 m.
below its present level, assuming that the Antarctic ice-cap was then
as large as it is now. If that cap were then non-existent, the Pleisto-
cene sea-level would have been about 50 m. below its present position.^
Von Drygalski calculated that the rise of general sea-level chie to
melting of the Pleistocene ice-caps has been 150 m., a value later
adopted by Penck. ^
After the publication of the writer's first paper (1910), Professor
D. W. Johnson kindly drew his attention to Belt's statement of the
relation between such shifts of sea-level and the origin of coral reefs.
As this appears to be the earliest published remark on the subject, it
is worthy of "quotation: "Another class of phenomena, usually as-
cribed to a gradual sinking of the earth's crust, but which might also
be produced by the return of the sea to the level it stood at before the
Glacial period, is that connected with the growth of coral islands.
Darwin's celebrated essay on their formation first proved that they
were due to the gradual deepening of the water. Dana, closely
following Darwin in his theory, estimates that this deepening of the
ocean bed from which the coral islands rise has been at least 3,000
feet, and that the subsidence to which he ascribes it extends round one
fourth of the earth's circumference in the Pacific, being indicated by
atolls in that ocean for 6,000 miles in length and 2,000 in \\idth." '^
Four years later Upham briefly referred to the same theme. After
showing that the ocean was diminished as a whole by the growth of
