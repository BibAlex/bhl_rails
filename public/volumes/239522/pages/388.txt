their development, a and h, triradiate spores from the gall bladder of U. chuss;

V. Summary.
1. A new species of Ceratomyxa from the gall bladder of Urophycis
chuss, Zoarces angularis, and Pseudopleuronectes americanus is
described.
2. The earliest stage of Ceratomyxa acadiensis n. sp., found in the
gall bladder, contains a single nucleus.
3. By a heteropolar division of this single nucleus a trophic and a
propagative nucleus arise.
4. The stage of the mj^xosporidium with four nuclei probably arises
by the division of the trophic nucleus to form two tropho-nuclei and
the division of the propagative nucleus to form two propagative nuclei.
5. The origin of the sporoblasts by the coming together of cells
originally separate, as described by Awerinzew for Ceratomyxa dre-
panopsettae, is confirmed for C. acadiensis.
6. The presence of valve-cells and capsulogenous cells is established
for C. acadiensis.
7. The two germ-nuclei can be distinguished in the early stages
of spore-formation and until the spore is completely formed.
