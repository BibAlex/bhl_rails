as computed, without any adjustment. These figures would demand
that Hgl2 be abnormal in many respects. On the rising branch of the
curve the yellow modification is less expansible than the red, but above
6000, on the descending branch, the yellow becomes more expansible.
The place at which AjS changes sign need not necessarily coincide with
the maximum. In general, however, the phase with the smaller
volume, whether at the higher or lower pressure seems to have the
higher thermal expansion. AC'p calculated in accordance with the
assumption above as to Aa comes out negative, the yellow having
the smaller specific heat. But it has already been shown that ACp
is particularly sensitive to errors in the assumed value for Aa, and in
TABLE XII.

this case there is a direct determination of the specific heat by Guin-
chant, from which it appears that the yellow at atmospheric pressure
has the larger heat, the difference being 0.0040 cal. At higher pres-
sures, ACp calculated with the assumption as to Aa, decreases rapidly.
Combining this with the experimental value at atmospheric pressure,
we are probably justified in the conclusion that the difference of speci-
fic heats becomes less at high pressures. The sign of A^S found above
was verified by direct measurement on the rising branch of the curve,
but the direct measurements did not give regular numerical results.
