I HA.VE pleasure in bringing before your notice some facts
regarding that much-abused insect â€” -the Mosquito. It is difficult
to find in Australian literature, or society, anyone who has
anything good to say on his behalf. Our Scottish poet sings,
" Man's inhumanity to man makes countless thousands mourn."
But what shall we say of his treatment of this little insect
from its point of view ? If learned mosquitoes meet to discuss
ethical questions in their own royal societies, they probably have
grave doubts as to the wisdom of the Creator in formino- a
creature like man so viciously disposed to themselves. But,
notwithstanding all the ill-treatment received from mankind, he
manifests a most Christian spirit of friendliness, and loses no
opportunity of forming the most intimate acquaintance with his
most deadly enemy. As my papec is mainly intended to diffuse
information to non-scientific hearers, I have sought to divest it
of all technical terms using, where possible, only such language
as the ordinary hearer can clearly understand. The word
mosquito comes from the Spanish, and simply means " little
fly." Its first visible starting point is the egg, for the insect
does not bring forth her young alive, but she lays eggs. The
egg is in shape not unlike a miniature sailor's marline-spike,
one end rounded and tapering gradually down to the other, so
that it assumes a conical form. In fig. 1 two separate eggs are
seen on the left side. At the centre of the thick round end is
a little point slightly projecting. This is really a neat little cap
of beautiful structure, to which I shall refer presently.
