The ordinary yam-stick (won-na) was a rounded piece of
wood, not quite as thick as a broom-handle, about 6 feet long,
scraped, and hardened with fire at one extremity. Though
primarily devised for digging up roots and yams, the women also
used it for fighting purposes, in the procedure of which they
adopted three lines of defence : held with both hands vertically,
to the right, to the left, and horizontally over the head.
Nothing was observed on the immediate coastline here
with regard to rock carvings, mural paintings, etc., though
Austin discovered some beautiful examples subsequently on the
Murchison.
They were not an emotional people, and were able to ex-
press themselves by signs, independently of speech. The show-
ing of the teeth, with the beard firmly clutched in between, was
a common gesture indicative of anger, and the likelihood of a
row.
Austin does not believe that there were ever more than
from twelve to twenty heads of families constituting the groups,
each with its particular territorial divisions, who together made
up the tribe, extending between the Murray River and Koom-
bana Bay. They evidently avoided too close intermarriage.
On the whole these primitive people were amenable to the
standard of honour imposed by their tribe ; they were equally
expert in the use of weapons, and, while restrained by those
unwritten laws which tended to maintain order and insure the
general comfort of the community, they were prepared to fight
to the death, and go coolly and deliberately to mortal combat in
the face of all men.
