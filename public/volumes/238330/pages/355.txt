zinc in drinking water. The most striking of all these extracts
is the poisoning case in the Straits Settlements. The poisoning
there was without doubt caused by the presence of only one-third
of a grain of zinc per gallon in the drinking water. In Brisbane we
have on the average fully three times this amount. If elsewhere
zinc, present in less quantity than we have here, causes severe
and even fatal poisoning, may it not be causing serious harm in
Brisbane ? I realise that this is in many ways a serious question
to raise, but it would certainly be a most extraordinary circum-
stance if the presence of zinc in drinking water, which has
proved so harmful elsewhere, should be perfectly harmless in
Queensland.
