ON A METHOD BY WHICH A PURE WATER-
SUPPLY COULD PE OBTAINED
FOR BPJ8ABNE.
By THOS. L. BANCROFT, M.B., Edin.
[Read before the Roi/al Societi/ of Qiieenshind, lOth Axuim^t, 1809.]
If the Enoggera water be analysed, it will be found to be free
from inorganic matter with the exception of a very small
amount of common salt, [In March last, after a considerable
spell of dry weather, there was only 1.2 grains Chlorine to the
gallon.] but to contain an enormous amount of organic
impurity.
In March, I made an analysis to ascertain the amount of
organic matter, with the following result : â€”
Free Ammonia -00 )
Albuminoid Ammonia -24 J ^^'^' P^"^ ^^^^^^^o"-
A water containing -10 parts per million is generally con-
sidered too impure for consumption until subjected to filtration
and the amount of Albuminoid Ammonia reduced to -05 parts
per million.
Consumption of water containing -20 parts per million of
Albuminoid Ammonia by a community has been found to bring
about various conditions of ill health. In England, such a
water would be condemned as unfit for use, but here in Brisbane,
we are compelled to consume water of that discription.
How can water be freed from organic impurity '?
It has been found that this is possible in many instances
by filtration, but it must be remembered that efficient filtration,
on a large scale, entails a very serious expense and one that
Brisbane could scarcely afford at the present time.
