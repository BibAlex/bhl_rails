THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OE LIVING MATTER
(PROTOPLASM).
By A. JEFFERIS TURNER, M.D.
[Read before the Royal Society of Queensland, 13th May, 1899.]
Mr. Byram's exceedingly interesting paper on the " Beginnings
of Life " touched at its close on topics which belong, as he
remarked, rather to the realm of i)hilosophy than of science,
strictly so called. He described to us the simplest known living
beings, illustrated in a very able way their marvellous variety of
form and activity, and at the same time pointed out their
apparent simplicity of structure ; how that they all were but
modifications of a single cell, that is, a naked mass of jelly-like
protoplasm, containing a central portion of greater density
known as the nucleus. We were shown how cells of the closest
similarity of form and activity to these existed in the higher
animals and plants, how the tissues of all animals and plants
were composed of collections of such cells, modified more or less
from their primitive simplicity to perform special functions, yet
never departing very far from it ; and how, in fact, every animal
and plant, every one of us, originated from a cell of very simple
form, the ovum, closely comparable to an amoeba, or other
unicellular organism. So far our lecturer kept to the firm ground
of science. All that he told us is easily demonstrable, and very
much of it can be actually seen by anyone who will devote a little
pains to the investigation. But anyone so doing, if of a
thoughtful disposition, can hardly fail to ask himself certain
questions, which, as Mr. Byram remarked, are probably to be
regarded as insoluble. What is the nature of this glairy,
transparent, mobile substance we call protoplasm, which forms
the body of this shifting speck of life ? How does it differ from
other substances know to us as lifeless and inorganic, and is this
