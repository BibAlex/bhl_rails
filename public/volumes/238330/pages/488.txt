I have examined a specimen supposed to be the type of this
species. It is in perfect condition, but does not correspond in
detail to Mr. Lower's description. Furthermore, it belongs to
the genus Poujndia, and Sir Geo. Hampson, who examined Mr.
Lower's types, is hardly likely to have made a mistake as to the
genus. I cannot therefore accept it as the type, although so
labelled.
