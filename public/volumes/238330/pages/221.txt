Imcillifx (tnt/iftii-i.s, <■■** and that may b« taken as the year when
Bacteriology, as a special study, had its birth. Ita infancy was
both puny and capricious, and it was not until 1880, thai the
foundations of an absolutely sound constitution were laid ;
" the work done earlier than that was more likely to be
erroneous than correct." But the first and the greatest of
the bacteriologists was the Frenchman, Louis Pasteur ; to him
undoubtedly belongs the honour of having been the mosb
successful experinu nter, the most careful worker, and the most
original thinker in the new field of science. He led, others
followed !
Many attempts have been n.ade to classify Bacteria — a term
certainly erroneous, but now universally employed when referring^
to the Schizomycetes, or Fission Fungi — a group of minuta
unicellular vegetable organisms which reproduce themselves by
self-division or cleavage.
The simplest classification, '•'• based on morphological char-
acteristics, that is, shape and form, is : —
I. Cocci. — '^' Are small oval or spheroidal cells, always
retaining their shape, no matter in what natural or artificial
media they may grow.
1. Diplococci : **-^' When the cells are in pairs, as in the
pneumococci and others.
2. Streptococci : '"■'^' When the cells are in chains, short or
long, usually enca^jsuled.
y. Tetracocci : ''^' When the cells are grouped in fours, often
encapsuled.
4. Sarciuse : *^'" When the cells appear in packets of eight
or more.
0. Staphylococci: When the cells are in irregular clump*
of no particular shape or symmetry.
6. Zoogloea : When clusters of staphyloccoi are held together
by a tough mucous membrane
11. Bacilli. — Are rod-like structures, in which one diameter
is greater than the other. They may be long and thin, or plump
and almost round ; they may have square, '^^"^-' pointed,
rounded, "^S' or clubbed *^*' ends, and they may arrange themselves,
in pairs, clumps, chains, or filaments. When fusiform or spindle
haped they are sometimes called Clostridia.
The numbers in the text I'efer to the lantern slides exhibited during the
address. A list of these slides is given in an appendix.
