Your Council have pleasure in submitting their report for
the year 1899 : â€”
In February the Society removed from Wakefield's Buildings
"to the rooms now occupied in the Technical College, Ann
Street, where every accommodation is afibrded for lectures and
demonstrations, the use of the lecture theatre being granted
when required. In obtaining these rooms the Society is greatly
indebted to the President, who, as soon as he was elected to that
position, endeavoured to secure more commodious rooms for the
Society, with the above result.
Thirteen Council Meetings have been held during the year.
The attendance of officers will be found in Appendix A.
Ten Ordinary Meetings of Members have been held, and the
attendance has been very satisfactory. A list of the papers read
at these meetings is given in Appendix B.
In former years one of the most interesting features of these
meetings was the exhibition of specimens, models, etc., but the
Council regret that during the past two sessions very little has
been done in this direction, and would urge members to
endeavour to renew this instructive custom.
