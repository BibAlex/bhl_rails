I PROPOSE to show this evening, as briefly as possible, what
effect public abattoirs should have in checking the spread of
disease caused by the tubercle bacillus. Tuberculosis, in its
different manifestations is all too common among us, and it
becomes the duty of everyone in a position to do so, to point
out, if not from his own particular experience, from that of
others, by what means the disease may be arrested, and its
ravages mitigated. We have had the subject of tuberculosis
prominently brought before us at a recent public meeting held
for the purpose of forming a society to cope with the disease in
the human being, and a few days ago many of us were
privileged to hear a lecture, with lantern-slide illustrations, on
the tubercle bacillus, by Mr. Pond, so that the subject
has of late been tolerably well ventilated. As you are
doubtless aware an Act was passed last session — " The
Slaughtering Act of 1898," giving the Government power to
construct public abattoirs where it was found to be necessary.
Section 7 provides that — " The Minister may, out of any
moneys appropriated by Parliament for the purpose, establish,
maintain, and manage such, and so many public abattoirs as
are, in his opinion, necessary for slaughtering stock, and may
permit the use of the same by all persons upon payment of the
fees and observing the conditions prescribed by the regulations."
It is not sought by this Section to compel all those engaged in
