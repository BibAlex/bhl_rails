9G PUBLIC ABATTOIRS AM) THE PREVENTION, ETC.
slaughtering to give up their private slaughter-houses, but it is
proposed to give proper facilities to those who are unable to
meet the necessary requirements of the Act as to water supply,
drainage, and other sanitary measures, to carry on their business
under suitable conditions ; so that should the owner of a private
slaughter-house be unable to comply with the provisions of the
Act from the want of a sufficient supply of pure water,
inadequate drainage, or other causes, he may slaughter his
stock at the public abattoir for a moderate cost. The Act also
makes provision for the efficient inspection of slaughter-houses
by a duly qualified inspector who " may at all reasonable times,
enter, inspect, and examine any slaughter-house or butchers'
shop, and may inspect and examine all stock and all utensils,
machinery, apparatus, works, and things at a slaughter-house or
butchers' shop, or used in connection with stock or meat, and all
places, things and vehicles kept or used for storage, sale, carriage
or delivery of meat or stock." Section 9 gives the inspector
power to take action when he finds a slaughter-house or butchers'
shop in an unclean state, and when any stock at a slaughter-
house or elsewhere are diseased, and when any person employed
in or about the premises is found to be suffering from disease likely
to contaminate the meat. He may also order a sufficient supply
of pure and wholesome water in the case of an inadequate
supply, or when the water is not pure, and he may order any
vehicle or utensil used for the purpose of carrying meat to be
cleansed, disinfected, and otherwise rendered wholesome.
The inspector may order the removal or isolation of any
person found to be affected with disease after he has satisfied
himself by " reference to the Health Office of the district in
which the slaughter-house or butchers' shop is situated, or to
some duly qualified medical practitioner, that the disease with
which any person is affected is one or other of the diseases
mentioned in the second schedule." The inspector therefore
cannot, of his own authority, order the removal or isolation of
any person whom he supposes to be suffering from disease, but
only on the authority of a medical practitioner.
It is competent for any person who may feel aggrieved by
an order or decision of an inspector, other than an order to
cleanse, to appeal therefrom to any two justices sitting in Petty
Sessions on giving to such inspector the prescribed notice in
writing of his intention so to do.
