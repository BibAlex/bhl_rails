There are many other insects. Some conspicuous for size
are orthopterous, and commonly known as walking-stick insects,
one species of which, attached to the swamp mahogany, is at
least 6 inches long in the $, but has rather small wings, for they
do not expand more than 2i inches, hence are more ornamental
than useful ; the ^ , however, flies well, and is, for these insects,
quite an active creature.
However, as it would take up considerable time to go further
into the entomology of a tea-tree swamp, I draw these very few
notes to a conclusion, and would now respectfully draw your
attention to the exhibit partly in connection with same, as it
unfortunately only represents two orders of insects, the
lepidoptera and coleoptera.
