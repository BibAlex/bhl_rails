IMMUNITY, NATURAL AND ACQUIRED.

Immunity is the converse of predisposition. It maybe classified
under two great subdivisions, viz., Congenital (natural) and
Acquired.
Congenital (natural) immunity may be an individual
peculiarity or it may be common to the species (racial), and
in like manner acquired immunity may be temporary or
permanent ; in the latter case even it may be transmissible
from parent to offspring, hence the term natural is more correct
than congenital. Let us take first : —
Acquired Immunity. — This means that an animal sus-
ceptible to an infectious disease may become protected against
subsequent infection. This may happen in several ways.
(A) By Recovery from an attack.
(B) By inoculation (a) with attenuated virus, i.e., living
organisms of low virulence, as in vaccination against sraall-pox ;
[h) with small and repeated doses of living and fully virulent
organisms, as in the preparation of horses for anti-diphtheritic
serum ; (r) with toxins or bacterial products, as in anti-plague
prophylactic, i.e., chemical vaccination ; (d) with serum derived
from protected animals, e.y., anti-diphthedtic, anti-tetanic, anti-
rabic ; ic) by feeding animals with the living organisms or their
products — this is meif>ly a sub- phase of the preceding inocu-
lation methods of conferring immunity.
Let us consider each of these methods of establishing an
acquired immunity in more detail.
(A) The natural predisposition to an infective disease may
be removed by recovery from an attack. To use Kanthack's
words, " this is Nature's way." Certain infective diseases confer
