In the last segment in a central cavity lie three organs,
fig. 32. Two are alike round, and the third, slightly larger, is
oval. They are of a very dark brown colour, have a short neck
like a flask, from which a tube several times their length pro-
ceeds into the preceding segment ; the latter contains a dense
glutinous material which resists the action of most aniline dyes.
In thoce species which form their eggs into rafts, it is believed
to be the material which cements them together ; but as the
Scots Gray lays its eggs separately, it is not required for that
purpose, but it may form a protective varnish for them. The
former organs are the spermathecce, and in one of them I found
male spermatozoa. These are like fine hairs tapering to a point
at the tail, while the head portion is a little blunter, but with no
sensible mark of division at the neck.
