NATURALISED AND ACCLIMATISED PLANTS IN
VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD.

Acclimatisation in the widest sense, as intended artificial intro-
duction, and as unintended (natural or occasional) immigration
of organisms, has very different results. The self-acclimatising
power of plants and animals is also very different. There are
plants occurring only in an area of a hundred square miles.
Mr. F. M. Bailey, discovered a new sassafras tree on the Blackall
Ranges, named by him Cinnamomuru Oliveri, which is pro-
bably confined to an exceedingly small district. Other plants
are found from pole to pole all round the globe. The vegetation
of lakes and rivers, in and upon the water and on the shores, is
marvellously uniform on the whole earth. The same genera,
and even the identical species of aquatic plants, were seen by me
in the Wakatipu of New Zealand, the Chuzenji and Biwa in
Japan, the Chapala in Mexico, and the Titicaca in Peru. The
same waterlilies {Ni/mphaea), bladderworts [Utricidaria), frogbits
[Hiidrocharis), J'allisnerias, pondweeds (Potamogeton), quilworts
{Isoetes), watermilfoils {Mi/riophylluiu) hornworts [O eratophijl-
lum), duckweeds [Lemna), Naias and pilworts {Pilulnria), are
growing there in the water ; plants which I gathered thirty years
ago in the Malar lake in Sweden, and in the post-tertiary glacier
lakes of Switzerland and the Black Forest. An European
who comes to Australia and finds himself surrounded by a flora
altogether different from what he has been accustomed to, is
surprised in the highest degree, to find on the sources of the Mac-
quarie River, in lonely places scarcely trodden before by a
