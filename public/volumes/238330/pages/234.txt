PROCEEDINGS
OF THE
^ittmal inciting of Jlt^mkts,
HELD ON SATURDAY, 15th FEBRUARY, 1902.
The Annual Meeting of the Society was held on Saturday,
15th February, 1902. The President, Mr. W. J. Byram,
occupied the chair, and there was a large attendance.
The Report of the Council for the Session 1901 was read
by the Hon. Secretary (Mr. J. F. Bailey) as follows :—
To the Members of the Roijal Societi/ of Queensland.
According to custom your Council submit the annual
report for the year 1901 : —
The ordinary meetings have been fairly well attended, but
it must be admitted that the attendances cannot be compared
with those in the earlier stages of the Society's existence. It
is also a source of regret that several of the Society's members,
who are engaged in original research, have forwarded their
papers to southern societies for publication. The primary aim
of the Society is the encouragement of original research,
although it has as a subsidiary object the promotion of scientific
knowledge and the fostering of scientific pursuits. Your
Council hope, therefore, that the members who are engaged in
research of an original character will not pass over their own
Society and thus weaken its salient object.
With a view to assisting as well the original worker as the
demonstrator or lecturer your Council procured from
Ross and Co., Limited, of London, a microscopical attachment
for the science lantern previously supplied by them, and it is
to be hoped that members will make use of this instrument,
whenever practicable, in illustrating the results of their work!
A list of the papers read at ordinary meetings of the
Society during the year is given in Appendix A. Instead of the
ordinary meeting in October a lantern and microscopial evening
was held in the Centennial Hall, and was very largely attended.
Fourteen Council meetings have been held during the year,
and the attendance of members of the Council at the meetings
will be found in Appendix B.
