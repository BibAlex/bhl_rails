beneath costa at f , with a second longitudinally elongate dot
beneath it in disc ; an outwardly curved obscure whitish line
more or less edged with fuscous on both sides from f costa to
before tornus ; an interrupted blackish terminal line ; cilia grey,
apices and a fine median line whitish, sometimes pinkish before
apices. Hindwings with termen slightly rounded ; veins 3
shortly approximated to 4 + 5 near base ; whitish and thinly
scaled ; veins and termen fuscous; cilia whitish with a fuscous
line near base.
Type in Coll. Turner.
N.Q., Townsville, in October; four specimens received from
Mr. F. P. Dodd. Q., Brisbane, in December ; one specimen.
PHYCITA HADES.
Kcphopteriix hades*, Low., Tr. R.S.S.A., 1903, p. 51.
$ 20 TH,Tf[. Head, thorax, palpi and antennae fuscous.
Abdomen fuscous, apices of segments whitish. Legs fuscous
with some whitish scales. Forewings elongate, posteriorly
dilated, costa rather strongly arched, apex rounded, termen
rounded, slightly oblique; fuscous; markings dark-fuscous; a
transverse line in disc at |, not reaching margins ; an irregular
suffused blotch at mid-disc ; a line from f costa, first inwardly,
then outwardly, and again inwardly waved to {r dorsum ; this is
closely followed by a parallel slightly brownish line from apex
to tornus ; a series of terminal dots ; cilia fuscous, apices and
two fine lines whitish. Hindwings with termen rounded,
slightly sinuate beneath apex; vein 3 closely applied to 4 -t- 5
for some distance from origin ; whitish, thinly scaled ; a suffused
fuscous terminal line ; cilia whitish, with a fuscous line near
base.
The type, though in perfect condition, is more obscurely
marked than my specimen. After careful comparison I think
they are the same species.

and inappropriate names are so common.
