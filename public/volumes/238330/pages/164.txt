A PAPER by me under the above heading, read before the
Anthropological Institute of Great Britain in 1895, was the first
description of the inaugural ceremonies of the Wiradthuri tribes.*
The following year I contributed a supplementary article
containing further and more complete details, i In the present
paper it is intended to give a short account of another meeting
of the aboriginal inhabitants, which took place in June, 1898.
The general camp was erected about three miles farther
down the Bulgeraga Creek than the locality I visited and
described in my first article, and was on the right bank of that
creek. This place is situated on what is known as the " Mole
Country," on the Lower Macquarie River, Parish of Wullam-
gambone, County of Gregory, New South Wales. On one side
of the main encampment was the boorbiou/, an oval space, whose
diameters were 92 feet 8 inches, and 86 feet 5 inches respectively,
bounded by a nick cut in the soil about three inches deep and
four inches wide.
From the interior of the space referred to, all grass, stones,
and timber had been removed, and the surface made level and
smooth. In the side of the oval farthest from the camp, about
four feet of the perimeter was left intact, for the purpose of
affording ingress and egress when using the enclosure on
ceremonial occasions, it not being permissible at such times to
step over the nick or groove cut in the ground.
