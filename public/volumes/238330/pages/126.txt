MISCELLANEA ENTOMOLOGICA : OR
()T)[) NOTES ON THE HISTORY AND TRANSFORMA-
TIONS OF VARIOUS INSECTS.
By R. ILLIDGE.
[tteiuJ before the Roijal Societij of Queendand, December 16.^
A FEW years ago I wrote a short paper for the
Natural History Society of Queensland (now defunct), on
" Insects, whose food plant is the Native Fig ; " but, as this
paper was lost, I now propose to reproduce some of the matter,
together with facts concerning other insects under the above
title.
The figs, Ficus Australis, macrophylla, etc., appear to be
subject to the attacks of quite a number of insects, chief amongst
which are certain species of moths of the genus Hypsa, and
some pretty pyrale moths of the genus Glyphodes ; also, a
noctuid Ophyx ochroptera, together with others whose depre-
dations are not, however, confined to these trees.
Of Hypsa, there are three species found on the fig ; they are
H. chloropyga, H. nesophora (?), and H, plagiata. The first-named
has a rather pretty caterpillar, brownish, marked with brick red
and ochreous yellow ; the other two have larvce which bear
considerable resemble to birds' droppings. None of these
insects, however, are sufficiently common to do any appreciable
damage to the trees, in fact, chloropyga is a rare moth round
Brisbane, nesophora is never common, and plagiata, though
usually readily obtained, does not occur in numbers.
The noctuid moth, Ophyx ochroptera, in the larval form, is
brilliant green with a broad lateral band of bright yellow ; it
also is a rare species.
