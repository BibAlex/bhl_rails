lining it outwardly. They may be seen like minute pustules
from the inner surface. When one of these fertilised bodies is
pressed on a glass slide, myriads of so called germinal rods are

mosquito, but may be found in countless numbers in the
peculiar veneno-salivary glands connected with the proboscis.
These glands, two in number, consist of a number of plump,
clearly-defined cells, arranged along a branching duct ; in these
cells the germinal rods may be found in countless numbers,
and when the mosquito is feeding on human blood these rods,
which are really spores, are passed into the circulation and
give rise to the plasmodia.
