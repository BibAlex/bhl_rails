The discoveries of the last twenty years have established two
important facts with reference to pulmonary consumption. The
disease, which up till lately had been considered always to
end fatally, has been proved to be curable in almost any stage ;
moreover, with patients suft'ering from it in the first stage
recovery is the rule in the vast majority of cases, especially in
places, as in Queensland, where favourable climatic and social
conditions come to the assistance of the patient. The second
fact, which has been brought out by the researches of Robert
Koch, Cornet, Flugge, and others, is that pulmonary consumption
can be prevented by the adoption of precautionary measures.
Of course, it is absurd to expect that such a result can be achieved
without considerable sacrifices on the part of the community and
individual. But we must keep in mind that the sum total of
deaths occasioned by this disease is very much greater than all
the losses sustained in wars, and remember, that the
individuals affected by it represent frequently the brightest and
best intellects in the country. The campaign initiated against the
spread of tuberculosis, ever since Koch discovered the infectious
nature of the disease, will not be given up till we have succeeded
in stamping out the disease in man and beast. This is not
likely to happen within our generation, but we ought to put our
shoulder to the wheel in order that we may achieve our full share
in it. In dealing with this question, as far as it confronts us in
Queensland, we must beware of following too closely in the
