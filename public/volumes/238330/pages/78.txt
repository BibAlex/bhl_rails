CAUSE OF FEVER.
In the blood of malarial fever patients is always found an
organism, discovered by Laveran in 1810, and consequently
known as the phismodium vudaria'.
THREE STAGES.
This organism is found to exhibit three phases, one
adapted for life with man as its host, a second adapted for life
outside the human body, and probably a third or latent stage.
HUMAN CYCLE.
Every variety or species of the plasmodium inhabiting man
has its special and more or less definite life span of 24 hours,
of 48 hours, or of 72 hours. On examining malarial blood
towards the end of one of these cycles, before one of the
paroxysms of the characteristic periodic fever is induced, the
parasite may be recognised as a pale ill-defined disc of proto-
plasm, occupying a larger or a smaller area, within a proportion
of the red blood corpuscles. Scattered through this pale body
are a number of particles of intensely black, or reddish black
pigment â€” melanin.
On repeated examination at short serial intervals the
observer notes a systematic series of changes in the discs of
pigmented protoplasm.
1, The scattered pigment particles collect into little groups,
or into radiating lines ;
2. The pigment groups concentrate further into one or two
larger, more or less, central blocks ;
8. Around these central masses the protoplasm groups
itself as globular masses, i.e. spores ;
