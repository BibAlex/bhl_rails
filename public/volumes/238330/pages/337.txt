124 IMMUNITY, NATURAL AND ACQUIRED
a protective effect against subsequent attacks of the same disease,
either completely or partially, as regards that individual, e.g.j
an attack of small-pox which has been recovered from,
guarantees immunity from another attack throughout a life-time ;
e.g., also measles, scarlet fever, syphilis, yellow fever, whooping
cough — while attacks of typhoid fever, pneumonia, and diphtheria
only confer a temporary insusceptibility. This partial immunisa-
tion is also shewn in races as well as individuals, c.//., measles has
been endemic among European races probably for centuries,
and as a consequence an ordinary attack of measles in a child
is looked upon as a trivial and inevitable ailment, thanks to the
partial immunity handed down from long series of ancestors
who have passed through the illness, but let this comparatively
trivial disease be imported into a community where the disease
has been unknown, and the result is a virulent epidemic with
an appalling mortality, e.ij., the introduction of measles among
the Fijians some 35 years ago resulted in a mortality of nearly
40,000 of the native race. Similarly chicken-pox, a trivial
disease of children, becomes almost as deadly as small-pox
among coloured races when first introduced. Our experience in
Australia shews that typhoid fever has only a partial protecting
power, as most medical men can point to cases where two or
three or even more attacks have been sustained by the same
individual. In India, similarly, plague has been shewn to
affect an individual on two or more occasions.
(B) It is in an attempt to imitate this method of Nature
that man has devised various ways of giving a slight dose of the
disease to protect from severer attacks. This was recognised
long ago in the introduction into England of inoculation with
the scabs of small-pox, which set up a mild attack of small-pox.
A safer method, because more under control, is the —
(rt) Inoculation with attenuated virus, i.e., with living
oro-anisms of a low degree of virulence. It must be known to
all of you that bacteriologists have long since demonstrated the
possibility of raising or lowering the virulence of various organ-
isms by sslection of cultures, or by what is the same thing,
selection of animals through which to pass the micro-organistn-
Practically every organism when cultivated for some time
outside the body loses its virulence, and in the case of some
this is very marked indeed, c.//., pneumococcus. Pasteur found
ii the ease of chicken cholera that when cultures were kept
for a long time under ordinary conditions, they gradually lost their
