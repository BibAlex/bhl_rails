mass, thus 4, 5, 6, are free segments. Abdominal segments 1
to 6 each have posterior and anterior parallel rows of strong
spines across the dorsum ; 7, 8, 9, have a single row each ; 10
has three lateral spines on each side. The scar of the cloacal
aperture appears as a postero ventral median line, the sfxual
organs appear as a median linear depression on the ventral sur-
face of 8 — 9 segments. The pro-meso-thoracic sutural spiracle
opening is rather large, and abdominal spiracles '-i to 7 are in
normal position, 8 appears as a rudimentary scar. On dehis-
cence the head, antennae, and mouth parts (ventral appendages)
separate as one piece — corresponding to that of Hepialidae —
the legs and wing cases remain attached loosely (divided cen-
trally) to the general body of the pupa. The suture with 1st
abdominal opens dorsally to near the tips of wing cases ventrally
the wing cases becoming semi-detached throughout.
The J pupa differs from the $ in being less robust and in
having segments 4, 5, 6, 7, free.
The chisel-like apparatus of the head presents a marked
difference from Endoxyla.
