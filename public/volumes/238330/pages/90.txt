Pro-legs have a complete encircling row of hooks turned
outwards, at the extremity. Under a ^ inch objective the larval
skin is comparatively smooth, having the very slightest rough-
ness, and the hairs are smooth.
In conclusion, I would point out the scientific importance
of accurate descriptions of the Australian Hepialidte. From
the foregoing I draw special attention to the curious black
concavity on the scutellum which remains until the pupa stage.
Its significance is an interesting problem. The hair within is
evidently articulated, or at any rate is movable at will of the
larva. Probably all the hairs are so, but I specially noticed it
with this particular hair. The position of the spiracles, and
the arrangement of the tubercles on the abdominal segments are
matters of importance.
I append a note of the more important imaginal structures.
The genitalia of 3 figured for comparison with Australian
Hepialus, Antennae are simple base figured, palpi are terminated
by small lobes connected by a narrow neck with main joint.
These are covered densely with light and dark hair (scales ?)
Neuration of the wings, one of the most important imaginal
structural characters for the purpose of classification â€” note the
series of transverse nervures at base of wings and the jugum, a
small projection near base of fore wing on inner margin, this
only occurs in the Hepialidse and Micropterygidae among the
Lepidoptera, but also in the Trichoptera.
Can I enlist the assistance of Australian entomologists in
my researches into the structural characters of the Hepialidae '?
I am desirous of obtaining ova and newly hatched larvae
(accurately labled in spirits) for observation and comparison,
and should be most happy to publish results through the
Australian societies.
