58 NOTES ON A MALA.KIA-CARRYIN(i MOSQUITO
size of a man's head to the human body. I caught a male
Anopheles lately which looked sickly. He had good reason.
Three ticks were boring into his neck, another on his chest, a
fifth just below the insertion of the wing, and a sixth was
affixed to the last segment of the abdomen. Here is a photo, of
the last one. In colour they are of a warm orange approaching
to red ; possess six jointed legs, the body being oval, measuring
one hundredth of an inch in diameter and a little more in length.
Two more slides will complete our subject. The Anopheles
male and female. The gentleman comes first, Fig. 23, because
he is an innocent and good-hearted fellow. He never soils his
lancets with blood. By nature and practice he is a strict
vegetarian. The juices of fruit and the nectar of flowers are
his banquet. Now then for his missus, Fig. 24. Could he only
persuade his wife to follow his example we would not grumble-
But the missus has a strong will of her own, and prefers the
ruby wine of blood.
Professor Celli states that the Anopheles do not make the
humming sound so characteristic of the ordinary Culex, and
persons may be bitten unconscious that they are near. Perhaps,
like the little black bush mosquito, they go straight to business
without hovering around. Those that I have kept in captivity
make as much noise as the ordinary variety. The sound is
more shrill, and reminds me of nothing so much as the skirl of
the Scottish bagpipes at a distance.
During the day they are quiet, sometimes they will stand
in one place for hours together. At the approach of sunset they
become active, singing and Hying continuously, as if that was
their particular time for work and they were determined to make
the most of it.
