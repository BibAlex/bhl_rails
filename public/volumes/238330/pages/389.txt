11. REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.
As will be seen by reference to the Treasurer's Statement
(Appendix C), the funds of the Society are in a satisfactory con-
dition.
The additions to the lantern, mention of which was made
in last report, were received in February last, and thanks are
due to Mr. J. W. Sutton for his valuable assistance in
arranging their purchase during his visit to London.
The Council regret that owing to an accident to the con-
densers of the lantern, which could not be remedied in the
States, the series of popular lectures, which it was proposed to
arrange during the winter months, could not be held.
It is with regret that the Council have to record the death
of Mr. T. H. Owens, a member who, although not a contributor
of papers, was a regular attendant at the meetings of the Society.
WILTON LOVE, M.B.,
President.
J. F. BAILEY,
Hon. Secretary.
