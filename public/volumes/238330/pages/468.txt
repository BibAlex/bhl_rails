BY HON. A. NORTON, M.L.C. 93
ab'^ufc the people whose country the whites had taken from them.
In January, 1860, the first mail was run by horse from Walgett
down the river.
In March, 1860, I bid my western friends good-bye, and rode
in as far as Molong, where I delivered my horse to the Crown
Lands Commissioner, who was to send him to Dowling, when
an opportunity offered. I then took caach and got as far as
Bathurst without delay, but in those good old times the gold
from the mines was sent by coach to Sydney, and no others but
the escort were allowed to accompany it ; as there was only one
coach daily, I had to spend a night and day in Bathurst. On
the following afternoon we however made a fresh start. The
roads were rough, exceptionally so in those places which had
â€¢been "corduroyed" ; the coach was rough also, and the
language of some of the passengers was quite in keeping with
our surroundings. Still all things have an end, and we were
safely landed at Penrith in time for breakfast. Thence we had
a train to travel by to Sydney, to which good town I was not
sorry to return after an absence of six months in the western
-districts.
