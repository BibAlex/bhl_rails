SCORP^NID.E (1).
Among the various products of our bays and estuaries, which
are apt to make their presence known to the unwary in an
unequivocal manner, few are more widely and invidiously known
than the small fishes to which the names " Bullrout " and
" Fortescue " have been given, and which have been grouped
together under the common name Centropof/on by Dr. Giinther
and other authors. The genus belongs to the scorpaenoid division
of the sub-order Loricati, or " mail-cheeked fishes," the name
being derived from the exceptional development of the third bone
of the infraorbital ring, which is in most of the genera produced
backwards to the preopercular bone, and so forms an admirable
protective covering to the sides of the head.
The family Scorpmnidce, (Scorpion-Fishes) is abundantly
represented throughout all temperate and tropical seas. It is
provisionally divisible into three groups â€” Sehastiim, Ajdstince,
and Scorpcenina:.-^'
Among other peculiarities the second group is characterised
by a strong spinous prolongation of the preorbital bone ;
this is more or less erectile at will, and can be, and indeed is
*This is not to be considered a natural division, as the whole series,
outside of the obviously sebastiae and scorpeenine forms, requires careful
revision, some of those v^rhich would here be placed among the ApistincB
being, like Notesthes, closely related to the Sebastince, others, like Lion'anium
as closely to the Scorpcenince, while some may have trigloid affinities.
