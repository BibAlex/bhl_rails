small numbers. Stomach simple, its entire length interiorly
with coarse longitudinal ridges. Intestines folded. Posterior
processes of preraaxillaries extending to the frontal bone ;
frontal bone with a pair of conspicuous ridges, which are ap-
proximate mesially but divergent in front and behind and are
separated from the tympanic ridges by a wide interspace ; no
preoccipital groove ; coronal ridges vestigial, slightly convergent
forwards ; no supraoccipital nor nuchal crest ior the support of
the anterior dorsal spine, which is deeply grooved in front ;
suborbital stay with several smooth, branched carinae Vertebras

the complete lepidosis of the dorsal region).
Rivers and estuaries of Eastern Australia. Monotypic.
The genus Notesthes outwardly resembles Neosebastes, but
the latter differs from it in having the entire head covered with
scales, in the absence of an elongate defensive preorbital spine,
in the reduced number of dorsal spines, in the large twenty-two-
rayed pectoral^ etc. It is, however, probable that while Notesthes
has distinct sebastine affinities those of the Neosehastes incline to
the scorpjenine.

Depth of body greatest below the third dorsal spine, where
it is 2 f to 2| in the total length ; length of head 2^ to 2| in the
same. Snout as long as or a little longer than the diameter of
the eye, which is 3| to 4^ in the length of the head. Width of
interorbital region 5f to 6 in the head. Maxillary extending to
or not quite to the vertical from the posterior border of the pupil,
its length 24- to 2^ in the head, the width of its distal extremity
