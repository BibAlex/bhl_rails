The Tertiary rocks are mainly represented in Queensland
by volcanic beds, and are therefore not likely to yield many
specimens of fossil plants. There is therefore an immense gap
in the record, between Mr. Stokes' fossil plants, and the flora
now existing in Queensland, which may yet be bridged over by
future discoveries. The post- tertiary deposits are mainly river
and lake drifts, raised beaches and sand dunes ; and so far have
given no assistance whatever in tracing the descent of living
plants to their old-time ancestors. In New South Wales, how-
ever, tertiary plant fossils are common, and approach partly to
modern Australian species and partly to the l^uropean and North
American floras. In the gold-tields of Victoria, too, dicotyle-
donous fruits have been found, and determined by the late Baron
F. von Mueller.
