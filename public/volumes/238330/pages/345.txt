All these tank waters were examined in connection with
obscure cases of lead poisoning among children, and in no case
was lead found — in fact lead cannot remain in solution
in presence of metallic zinc, so that one would not expect to
find lead in solution in water stored in a galvanised iron tank.
Many other waters were examined qualitatively in con-
nection with the lead poisoning cases and all were found to
contain zinc in solution. On 27th February, 1902, samples
were tested as follows : —

From these and other results it seems that tank waters
contain on an average about one grain of zinc per gallon. Just
after rain this amount would probably be greater, but is not
likely to rise above two grains for any length of time. The metal-
lic taste of the zinc in the tank water is very noticeable to any-
one not accustomed to drinking it. But for the presence of this
zinc ordinary tank water would be a very good drinking water.
As it is, thorough boiling of the water throws all the zinc out of
solution, and if then filtered and allowed to stand for a day to
