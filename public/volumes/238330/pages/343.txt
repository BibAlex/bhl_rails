130 IMMUNITY, NATURAL AND ACQUIRED
(4.) Humoral theory — developed by Behring — so far as
active immunity is concerned it may be held as proved that the
production of immunity is accompanied by changes in the blood
serum, i.e., by the development of anti-microbic or anti-toxic
substances. No doubt, however, such substances are produced,
not simply by chemical changes in the body fluids, but are
products of cellular action brought about by the presence of the
bacteria or their toxins. What cells are these ? Metchnikoff
says leucocytes, but when a horse is immunised against diphtheria
its serum possesses a certain degree of anti-toxic power, so does
the serum derived from subsequent bleedings, although fresh
leucocytes have been generated after each bleeding. Hence, fresh
anti-toxin must have been produced after each bleeding withou
the introduction of fresh toxin. Anti-toxin, or the immunity
conferring substance, must therefore be a direct product of the
tissue cells by virtue of acquired secretory changes, and its
action must also be directly cellular.
I must apologize for this sketchy survey of an intricate subject
— a subject which is constantly presenting new phases with
increased research, but one which has a peculiar fascination for the
thoughtful student as well as for the practical man.
