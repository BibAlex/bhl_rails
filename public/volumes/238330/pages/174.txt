I HAVE the pleasure of presenting to you a few notes and
illustrations of the particular kind of mosquito which propagates
malarial disease. It is only within the last few years that it
has been suspected of fulfilling this function. But an elaborate
series of experiments have been conducted in various places,
and the suspicion has deepened now into a scientific fact. Pure
bred mosquitoes have been allowed to bite patients suffering
from malarial fever. Some of these insects have been dissected,
and the malarial germs seen in the stomach, salivary glands,
and proboscis. Some of the same batch of insects have bitten
healthy persons and inoculated them with the fever. The chain
of evidence is therefore so complete that the English experts do
not require any more experiments on human beings. The
evidence accumulated is considered amply suflficient to establish
the fact. As probably ten millions of people die annually from
this disease, and three or four times that number are disabled
from pursuing active occupations for considerable periods, this
discovery is fraught with deep interest to the inhabitants of the
tropical world. Various experiments made in India, Africa, and
Italy with the common mosquito, gave negative results, so that
the ordinary kind is not thought to convey the decease. But a
particular kind called the Anopheles is the one concerned. They
