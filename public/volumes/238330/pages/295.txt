64 NOTES ON SAVAGE LIFE, ETC.
Nothing in the way of special superstitions, other than
those recorded in these notes, was noticed. That they were
extremely fond of their dogs goes without saying ; so much so
that women were often observed suckling young puppies. They
rightly believed that it was the one and the same moon which
regularly put in an appearance each month.
Disease and death charms in the hands of doctors and
alleged enemies have already been drawn attention to. The
medicine men mixed up with other individuals like ordinary
mortals, but were dreaded; as a correlative, they were aware of
it, and consequently traded upon the credulity of their less-

and quietness. They were all brought up to supply their own
wants, manufacture their own weapons, were almost all equally
proficient in their general ideas, in the pursuit of game, in fight-
ing, etc. They recognised a head man, on whom a special term
was conferred, but the office was apparently not necessarily here-
ditary, and if a "strong" man, he might nominate his successor ;
he was not always the oldest man in the tribe, but general fitness
and ability were his characteristics ; he never put on any " side,"
and he exercised the prerogative upon the death of a tribes-
