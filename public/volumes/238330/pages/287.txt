harmless. It is, no donbfc, owing to this exaggerated idea of
infection that there have been such extreme proposals as the
New Zealand Act excluding tubercular iia migrants. It is
probably due to the same cause that there is some prejudice in
Queensland against the building of sanatoria for consumptives.
There is not a shadow of foundation for the theory that there
is danger to the inhabitants of a township if a sanatorium ia
erected in the neighbourhood. I trust there will be no opposi-
tion to erecting sanatoria for the poor and for paying patients.
Bright sunshine, invigorating air, and cheerful surroundings,
are conditions which compensate in some measure for separa-
tion from family and friends, alleviate the sufferings, and give
hope in many cases of permanent recovery.
CONCLUSION.
In the remarks I have made to-night, I have touched upon
many controversial points, and I have endeavoured to indicate
the lines upon which further research is required. I trust that
those engaged in scientific inquiries in Queensland will help to
throw light on these points. The report of the new Boyal Com-
mission now sitting in London will be awaited with interest, but
in the meantime there is no uncertainty as to the course to be
adopted by those responsible for the public health. Whatever
the result of that inquiry may be as regards the relation of
bovine to human tuberculosis, we know that there are many
factors in the production of the disease.
The removal of insanitary conditions by the co-operation
of the public with sanitary officials, will secure for Brisbane
the enviable position of being conspicuous among all the great
cities of the Commonwealth, on account of its low death rate
and practical immunity from all epidemic diseases.
