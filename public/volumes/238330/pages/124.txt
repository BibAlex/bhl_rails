I have another picture here, in fig. 12, in order to impress
upon your memories the distinction between the sex. In the
couple before you, the gentleman is on the left and the lady is
on the right. He is thin and slender, but she is quite a buxom
lady. His proboscis gently touches her shoulder, while the long
[iitliii curl above. Very modestly she droops her head while he
pops the momentous question, and if we follow the interview,
we should probably find that she had accepted him as her lover,
and had gone off for a waltz together. I have often seen them
flying in couples, especially near sunset. Their flight is slow,
and they are more easily caught when locked in each o*hers'
arms.
