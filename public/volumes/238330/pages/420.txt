(jrilbertella,'^ are alluded to in almost precisely the same words
as those in which I pointed them out ; as there can be no
question as to the identity of the two fishes, my description
having been taken from an immature, his from an adult example,
the name Gilbertella is fortunately unnecessary. Whether it is
Castelnau's Serranus annatus or not, it is impossible to decide,
unless the type be in existence ; if this be not the case, his
description is so bad that the name should be ignored.
* My friend Mr. Waite appears to have become inoculated with some
of the prevailing topsyturvydom of Australian nomenclature, since he
proposes the diminutive appellation for the larger fish.
