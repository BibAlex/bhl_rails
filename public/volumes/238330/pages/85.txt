88 DESCRIPTION OF SOME CAVES NEAR CAMOOWEAL.
thrown down a large ball of cotton soaked in kerosene, to test
the atmosphere and to light us on our way. On reaching the
second floor, we found several caves which we explored till our
progress was again stopped by a second hole. After dropping
fire-balls into this, we made fast another rope and decended,
reaching a third floor, or rather platform, of considerable size.
Looking over the edge of this platform, we could discern below
at the distance of about 40 feet a considerable body of water.
Determining to examine this, I had a rope fastened round my
waist and was let down by the others — I found the water
beautifully clear, cool, and pure ; but had no means of testing
its depth, or its exact temperature. Further progress being
impossible we retraced our steps, and having reached the surface
and the light of day, we found, by measurement of our ropes,
that the surface of this subterranean lake is about 300 feet below
the level of the plain. We also estimated that the distance
which we had penetrated horizontally into the bowels of the
earth could not have been far short of a quarter of a mile. The
floors of the caves were free from rubbish of any kind, and the
atmosphere was tolerably pure throughout.
In connection with this subject, it is, I think, worthy of
note that the Rocklands' Pastoral Company have put down
several bores in the neighbourhood of Camooweal which have
struck Avater — an inexhaustible supply of sub-artesian water —
at depths varying from 2.50 to 300 feet, proving conclusively (in
connection with the above) that below the surface of this arid
region there exists a vast reservoir of pure, fresh water of many
square miles in extent, and at a nearly uniform depth below the
surface.
