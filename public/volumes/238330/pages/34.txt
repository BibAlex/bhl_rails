Of all the inscrutable problems for the solution of which
man has vainly groped since his mental powers were so far
developed as to enable him to reason the most momentous has

manifold manifestations of life around us day by day in animal
and plant ; we associate with it the phenomena of spontaneous
movement, of nutrition, of growth, of reproduction ; we feel it
in ourselves through the medium of its highest manifestation,
our consciousness ; we are in contact with it everywhere, always ;
and we are so intimate with it and its correlative, death, that we
look upon both with the unquestioning eye of familiarity, and
strangely forget that here we are in the presence of the greatest
of all marvels, the most profound of all mysteries. We talk as
a matter of course in a hundred varied phrases of every day life,
of mind, of soul, of spirit ; we fill our literature with beautiful
conceptions concerning them, and our poetry especially clothes
them in lovely images and telling metaphors ; but in the silence
of our studies â€” in those critical phases of our thought when the
glamour of poetry is ;vithdrawn and the scientific method
dominates us we pause in awe and ask ourselves the old-time
questions "What?" and "Whither?" Then we well know
that if science cannot approximate to any answer to those
questions they must rest for ever " behind the veil." All the
vast speculations, all the grandeur of thought and subtlety of
diction of the greatest of the abstract philosophers have been
but so much vain beating of the air in all that concerns these
momentous problems. Not in the arena of speculative philosophy,
hot in the tenets of any theological system, but in the cautious
method of science lies the possibility of some adumbration of
