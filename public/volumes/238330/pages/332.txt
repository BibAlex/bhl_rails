and this will apply to all branches of social life ; but we are not
advanced so far yet. We cannot therefore advocate legislative
proceedings with regard to frost prevention, but we must try to
persuade the farmer not to leave all to an uncertain hope, but to
watch his own interest and that of his neighbour also.
With all the advantages of the already named system of
meteorological stations, and the Weather Bureau in Brisbane
which makes forecasting of frost so available, and by reason of
the geographical position of Queensland on the very edge of the
tropics, there is hardly any country in the world where the frost
phenomenon could be studied with such a success as here. Also
the presence in Queensland of such a distinguished meteorolo-
gist as Mr. C. L. Wragge is a reason for going into the study
of this question.
I do not know which Society in Queensland is the-
proper one for taking up the practical part of this question of
preventing damages by frost ; but I think in addressing this body
of scientific workers that I have placed the question in the
hands of the men who are the most suitable for giving the
matter a scientific attention, the result of which would be bene-
ficial not only to this country but to the whole humanity.
