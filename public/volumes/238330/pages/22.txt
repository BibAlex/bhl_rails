Synthetical Chemistry has made great strides since Berthelot's
discovery of the formation of acetyline with its elements, carbon
and hydrogen, in 1862, and it is to this branch of chemical
science, that we are indebted at the present time for about 180
compounds of the hydro-carbon series, which are capable of
being formed by direct union of their elements ; also by the great
variety of beautiful colours and shades, used in calico and other
printing, it is estimated that a saving of between two and three
million pounds annually has been eli'ected by the artificial
manufacture from tar waste products, to the calico printers and
dyers. This industry which was at one time almost entirely
in English manufacturing hands, has practically now become a
German industry, for the simple reason that the German manu-
facturer is either a trained chemist or has the good sense to
understand that the problems at the root of the industry are to
be trusted only to those with a sound scientific knowledge.
This is one of the many instances in which Germany, if not
actually outstripping, are running the English manufacturers very
closely, more especially in chemical industries, and the reason is
not far to seek, when we learn the amount of money, care and
attention that is bestowed on Technical Education in that
country â€” indeed some large employers make it compulsory that
all their apprentices shall attend Technical Classes, at least two
evenings per week, to learn the science of their own particular
industry. Thus are produced workmen who are ever on the
alert to improve and cheapen the cost of his own products,
instead of mere automatons. It is gratifying to learn that
after having discovered the primary cause of our neighbour's
prosperity, we have taken the hint, and by similar means are
widely establishing universities, technical schools, and national
physical laboratories, where sound theoretical, practical and
scientific education can be obtained by all seeking it. The
deficiency of such knowledge or theory by a large majority of
inventors, and the enormous waste of time, energy and money,
bestowed upon useless and impossible contrivances, must be
glaringly apparent to anyone who studies the patents record of
various nations, which might have been saved, had the
inventor understood the fundamental principle of Thermo
Dynamics, Jules' Law, that the unit of heat can only do 772
foot pounds of work, and inventors proposing to violate that
law must either be deficient in theory, or lending themselves
