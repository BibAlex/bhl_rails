tracheal tube passes into each, giving off smaller branches,
which further subdivide and ramify throughout the whole of the
egg mass.
The number of eggs varies, ranging from one to two
hundred. The largest number I have found has been two
hundred and ten. They measure the one hundred and fiftieth
of an inch in length, by half that in breadth. They are oval,
yellow, and transparent, looking very like minute gelatine
capsules. In the photo given they are laid attached side by side
in a long ribbon ; but I do not regard this as the normal shape of
the egg mass. In captivity insects often do things which thay
would not in a state of nature, and a judgment formed under
these circumstances may prove to be inaccurate, and I have
others wherein the shape is much more like the egg-boat of the
common mosquito.
The male and female forms are easily recognized by the
antennae. In the former these are of a beautiful plumose shape,
the hairs from the basal joints extending nearly to the tips of
the organs, but in the female they form a circlet around the base
of each joint. Her body also is much stouter, and not so long
as the male. He measures nine while she is about seven-hun-
dredths of an inch in length, excluding the antennae.
