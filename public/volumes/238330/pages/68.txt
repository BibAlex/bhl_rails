A KEPLY TO ••SOME CRITICAL NOTES ON THE
QUEENSLAND VOLUME OF THE INTER-
NATIONAL CATALOGUE OF
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE."
BY JOHN SHIRLEY, B.Sc.
Bead before tlie Roj/al Society of (Jueenxlmtd, Autjust lOtli, 1899.
Each member of this Society has received a copy of the Queens-
land Volume of the International Science Catalogue, compiled
by the Koyal Society of Queensland at the request of the late
Hon. T. J. Byrnes, and of his successor, the Hon. J. R. Dickson.
Copies were also sent to the chief scientific societies of Austra-
lasia. On receipt of a copy by the Queensland Branch of the
Royal Geographical Society of Australasia, the Hon. Secretary,
Mr. J. P. Thomson, read a criticism on the Catalogue, since
printed without date or signature, to which your Council has re-
quested me to reply.
This is not Mr. Thomson's first attack on matters pertain-
ing to our Society ; in Volume XII, pp. 59 to 71 of our Pro-
ceedings may be found Mr. (now Dr.) R. L. Jack's crushing
reply to Mr. Thomson's remarks on the Government Geologist's
paper entitled " Artesian Water in the Western Interior of
Queensland."
