TRISSONCA PROLEUCA.
Heteroi/mpJds proleucd, Low., Tr. R.S.S.A., 1903, p. 58.
N.Q., Townsville, in November; one bred specimen from
Mr. F. P. Dodd in Coll. Lyell, corresponding exactly with Mr.
Lower's type. This species very probably occurs in Mackay,
but the type was certainly not taken there. This observation
applies viutatis mutandis to many of Mr. Lower's localities which
I have not thought worthy of notice.
