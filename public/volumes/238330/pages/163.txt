34 EXPLORATION IN WESTERN AUSTR.U.IA.
day, when 1 was entirel}' successful, getting through wonderfully
well. A really good dray road could be made over this pass. It
is about eleven miles from one side to the other, and if so in-
clined a person could travel only a mile a day and get permanent
water at every camp. Standing on a range four miles from the
gorge after getting through, it was difticult to make out the
exit, as it looked like a perfect steep blufli', with no break in it.
As soon as we left the range we found the country changed
rapidly for the worse. I have not seen the Barker, but I think
this must be the same river, judging by the course and the strong
running. Next day I ran the creek down, and camped to the
right of some granite hills in a gorge. It was the worst camp I
had yet had on the trip, as far as the horses were concerned.
The cretk here does not run, and the water is bad. Running
the creek down for four miles, we at last got out of the gorges.
Then came twenty miles of very sandy country. I never saw
such immense granite hills ; some of them were hundreds of
feet high, and all solid rock. That night we had to dig holes in
the sand to water our horses. What a change from the country
we had just passed through ! We were camped on one of the
strangest formations in the world, I shoidd think. There is a
line of very hard, sharp limestone, only 100 yards wide in places,
and here and there from 200 to 800 feet high. It rises out of
the level, sandy country, and runs generally north-north-west
and south-south-east for, I believe, about 150 miles. I should
like to hear Mr. Maitland's opinion of it when he sees it some
day.
At last I arrived at Mr. Blythe's place, on the Lennard,
and my troubles were over.
