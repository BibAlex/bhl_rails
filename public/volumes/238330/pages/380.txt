Local names — whiting, trumpeter whiting. There has
been some confusion as to this species. Cuvier and Valenciennes
give the fin formula as D. 11 — ^1/18, A. 1/12, and immediately
thereafter, " II y a deux epines a son anale."
Count Castelnau — loc. cit. — describes as .S'. Terrae-Reijinae,
a whiting caught in great numbers in Moreton Bay with this
formula, D. 10—1/18, A. 2/15, L. lat. 64, but in the next
volume of the same publication he goes back to V. Bassensis.
Dr. Gunther under the name S. ciliata gives a description
that fits the common Moreton Bay whiting, but Cuvier and
Valenciennes, who established the species, say distinctly it has
no silvery streak along the side. This streak Gunther adds,
and as it stands his description of S. ciliata, fits S. Bassensis
better than any I have seen of the latter species.
