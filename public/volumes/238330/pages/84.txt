About twelve miles to the eastward of the township of Camooweal
the monotonous level of the country is interrupted by the presence
of a number of irre,2:ular chasms, varying in depth from 50 to 120
feet, and in width from 30 to 100 feet. Leading into most of
these chasms are water-courses, which in flood-time pour in an

Fastening our rope to a large boulder, we clambered, or rather
slid, to the bottom at a depth of 105 feet. At this level we
found a cave opening into the rock, the entrance being about
30 feet high, but increasing to a height of nearly 50 feet
as we advanced. After walking some distance our progress was
