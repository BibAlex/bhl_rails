A PRELIMINARY REVISION DF THE AUSTRAEIAN
TBYRIDJDAE AND PYRALIDAE.
Part I.

The present attempt is based on Sir Geo. Hampson's Revision
of the Thyrididae and Pyralidae (excepting the Phycitinae and
OaUerianae) of the World. Where I have differed from this I
have in most cases drawn attention to the fact, and have usually
indicated my reasons ; but in the main I have followed it rather
closely. It was indeed indispensable, and perhaps I may be
excused, if I express my admiration for the immense amount of
minutely accurate work which it contains. I have also
endeavoured to make full use of the valuable papers of Mr.
Edw. Meyrick, who laid the foundations of the present classi-
fication of the Pyralidae both of Australia and Europe. Un-
fortunately, except in the case of the Crambinae, Mr. Meyrick 's
material appears to have been rather scanty.
For the purposes of this revision I have examined the
British Museum collection. For many species I have to thank
kind and esteemed correspondents. Many named species are,
however, unknown to me ; these are indicated by the sign ft.
The sign f prefixed to a species indicates that I have seen
examples, bat have not been able to examine their structure.
I have not thought it necessary to transcribe much of the
synonymy, which may be found in Sir Geo. Hampson's papers,
but have endeavoured to give references to the original
descriptions, and to the best available descriptions of each
Species. I am unable to give references for some of the names
obtained from the British Museum.
