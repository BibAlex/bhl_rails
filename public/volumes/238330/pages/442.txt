Dr. Wm. Scott, in his Dictionary of the Bible, 1860, in a
considerable article on Colours says : — " Among the Jews, who
fell even below their contemporaries in the cultivation of the
fine arts and to whom painting was unknown until a later
period, the knowledge of artificial colours was very restricted.
The highest development of colour in the mind of
the Hebrew was light and hence the preponderance given to
white. . . . Next to white, black, or rather dark, holds
the most prominent place. . . . Red was a colour of which
the Jews had a vivid conception. . . . Yellow is very seldom
noticed ; it was apparently regarded as a shade of green. . . .
Green is frequently noticed, but an examination of the passages
in which it occurs will show that the reference is seldom to
colour but applies to what is vifjorotis, fiouruhing, out-spreading,
sproutimj, freslt, young, moist, sappy and unripe. Thus it may
be said that green is never used in the Bible to convey the im-
pression of a proper colour."
Besides white and black, I find on reference to Cruden's
Concordance that the following colours are mentioned in the
Old Testament so many times : —
Red 21
Yellow

Green

Magnus has sought in ancient descriptions of the rainbow
a support for his theory and naturally makes out a good case.
Homer (? 1000 e.g.), he thinks, dealt with it as one-coloured,
red or purple ; the ancient Arabs described it as red ; Ezekiel
(588 B.C.), Chap. I., v. 28, says it has an appearance of brightness ;
Xenophanes (? 550 b.c.) sees three colours in the bow — red, blue,
and yellow-green ; Aristotle (384 b.c.) is for a tricolour ; Ovid
(43 B.C.) is vague ; Seneca (b.c.-a.d.), ditto ; Suedas and Galen
(36 A.D.) support the triad of colours and so do the Eastern and
later Arabian literatures.
