86 METHOD BY WHICH A PURE WATER SUPPLY, ETC.
Board of Water-works temporarily increase the water-supply
from other sources than Enoggera so as to be independent of
the latter and then proceed to reconstruct.
The method suggested is to cut gradually a trench into the
by- wash to drain off all the water ; to make a wall of rough
stone and concrete, at least six feet high, round the water's edge
and back this with earth dug from the shallow parts of the lake
so as to make a gradual ascending slope from the top of the wall
to the hill sides ; otherwise, water would lodge between the wall
and the hill ; plant the bank with Buffalo-grass ; clean out logs,
stumps, vegetation, and fish ; finally, strengthen and raise the
dam and build up the by- wash. The lake would then hold
sufficient water for the requirements of Brisbane for some time
to come ; the water would be pure and every drop available if at
any time pumping had to be restored to. The other reservoirs
could then be abandoned until the growth of the city necessitated
a further increase of water. There should be a space cleared at
least fifty yards wide, all round the lake, fenced in and planted
Avith Buffalo-grass ; the grass should never be cut nor grazed by
cattle ; it would serve to prevent leaves from the adjacent land
being washed by rain or blown in the reservoir.
