Nov., 1909. A PECULIAR BEAR FROM ALASKA OSGOOD. 3
respect with those of black bears from the same region. That it has
been thought to be smaller than the black bear is explainable by the
probability that a majority of the skins thus far received are those of
females or young. Therefore, the only peculiarity of Ursus emmonsi
is its gray color, which it now appears is subject to marked variation.
As a specific character, this peculiarity might sooner have been
questioned if the animal were not a large game animal of much popu-
lar interest and one of which it is impossible to obtain large series of
specimens from single localities. Probably five hundred black bears
are killed on the coast of Alaska to one of the gray color representing
Ursus emmonsi.
If occasional specimens showing divergence in color are found
among large series of a given species of small mammal, it is not un-
usual to regard them merely as examples of dichromatism. Especi-
ally is this the case if the species be one in which dichromatism is al-
ready known to occur. It is very significant in this connection that
the cinnamon phase so well known in other parts of the black bear's
range is unknown on the coast of Alaska. That a gray phase may
represent it there certainly is not impossible. Another interesting
factor in the case is the white bear of the coast of British Columbia,
called Ursus kermodei, which some regard as an albinotic phase of
Ursus americanus. Evidently there is an unusual instability in the
color of the small bears of the American northwest coast. Doubtless
extremely interesting results would be obtained if some of our zoologi-
cal parks should be so fortunate as to obtain living examples of these
bears and to successfully breed them in captivity.
