John said. "There's no point in
putting It on it we can't do it right."
The Granite State Garden &. Flow-
er Show is a non-profit corporation
that was formed when three organi-
zations — the New Hampshire
Landscape Association, the New
Hampshire Federation of Garden
Clubs, and the New Hampshire
Plant Growers' Association — each
committed $1000 seed money
seven years ago.
The loans were paid back from the
profits of the first show, but the
corporation still exists. Board
members will meet in March to
"try to see where the flower show
should be going."
The New Hampshire Farm &. For-
est Exposition is the first of next
spring's shows, taking place
February 6-8 at the Center of New
Hampshire Holiday Inn and
Conference Center m Manchester.
The theme hasn't been decided,
but "seems to be going in the
direction ot stewardship" — what
does caring tor the land really
mean?
The program will come later as well
(there are matching grants avail-
able to outside organizations spon-
soring speakers), hut some of the
displays are sure: the maple people
will be serving maple milk and you
can win an apple at the fruit grow-
ers' booth. Six calves (one from
each breed) will be there, as well as
a draft horse and a llama. From 5 to
9 on Friday night the 4-H kids will
do hands-on demonstrations; on
Saturday morning (before the auc-
tion), the Extension will sponsor a
program entitled "Playing It Safe"
— about using different safety gear.
So there already seems to be plenty
to do. It's free. It sounds like fun.

England Landscape Exposition.
Sponsored by the NH Landscape
Association, it will be held March
11-13, also at the Center of New
Hampshire.
From the Griffin Guru
CHECK IT OUT!
Many times during your business career, you will be faced with a
decision on which piece of equipment to purchase or which structure to
build. Unlike an auto or a truck, you can't take the equipment for a test
drive. You can, however, ask the salesperson to provide the name and
location of someone who has a similar item and whether or not that
person would mind showing it off. You could at least take the time to
check it out by giving the person a call. Better than that, make a date
and go to see it in operation. If you're going to spend your hard-earned
money, you should take every opportunity to make sure it's the right
thing for you.
The program is pending, but the
general plan — layout, talks, trade
show — "will be basically the
same," Guy Hodgdon, NHLA
spokesperson, says. TTiere will be
recertification credits available for
people from all six New England
states.
One change is that "we've stayed
away from a keynote speaker. There
will be a keynote panel instead,
with each member showing slides ot
a rarely seen (usually because
there's no public access) New
Hampshire landscape.
And the Pearson Annual Awards
Banquet has been combined with
the Exposition this year. This will
be held Thursday night. The price
is separate from that o\ the
exposition, but the public is invited
to attend. For information, contact
Guy at (207) 439-5189.

The Seacoast Area Flower & Gar-
den Show's annual "Celebration of
Spring" will definitely be "bigger
than ever" this year. To be held on
March 13-15, the show will be at
the old recreation building at Pease
Air Force Base. Brenda Schure is
excited about the move: the show
had begun to outgrow the Armory;
this year, there will be plenty of
space (2500 square feet, compared
with last year's 14000); the new
location's easier to get to ("the base
entrance is right oft the Spaulding
Turnpike; take your first left after
the chapel; it's a quarter mile down
the street"); and there's plenty of
parking.
A mailing has been sent "to ev-
eryone we can think of — land-
scapers, retailers, florists — looking
for participation. TTie facilities are
more elaborate — there are several
rooms (carpeted) off the main
display area that will he used for
smaller scale talks and displays.
Floral arrangements, tor example,
will be in one of these.
Brenda says, "This year we're going
to be classv." So-^for information,

Otho Wells, the chairperson of this
year's University of New Hamp-
shire Greenhouse Open House
Committee, says "there's nothing
definite other than it will be Friday
and Saturday, April 3 and 4. But
we're working on it." For
