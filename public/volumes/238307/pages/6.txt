APPRECIATED
There may be changes at the Plant
Diagnostic Lab at Nesmith Hall
(UNH, Durham) next year. The
student currently running it,
Cheryl Smith, will be graduating
soon. This is good news of
course, but it also means that
there will be no one there to run
the lab.
Costs of running it full-time
(equipment, technician's salary,
etc.) are high — around $50,000 —
and that amount of money is
difficult to find. Cooperative
Extension is looking into a variety
of options, among them an
arrangement with another New
England college.
No decisions have been made. If
you use the lab or would use it if
it offered expanded services or
simply want to make your
viewpoint known, contact Bruce
Marriott, Program Leader,
Agricultural Resources, UNH
Cooperative Extension. He's at
Taylor Hall, UNH, Durham, NH
03824, and can be reached at
(603)862-1928.
(Budgetary pressures are not only
in New Hampshire. Because of
cuts in its state funding, Cornell
Cooperative Extension laid off
employees last January for the
first time in many years and in
October announced the following
fees:
1. $25 for each insect, weed, and
disease identification.
2. A fee of $40 for each virus
diagnosis requiring laboratory
testing procedures.
3. A fee of $40 for nematode
identification.
"Much thought and discussion has
preceded the decision to make
these adjustments in fee policies.
The current fiscal situation has
left no alternative if Cornell is to
continue to provide this service.")

EPA ISSUES NOTICE
OF INTENT TO REMOVE
358 PESTICIDE ACTIVE
INGREDIENTS FROM
THE REREGISTRATION
LISTS
EPA intends to remove 358 pes-
ticide active ingredients from
any further consideration for
reregistration (renewed license
to distribute or sell in the
United States) and to cancel
the registration of 1,053 pesti-
cide products containing these
active ingredients. The Agency
is taking these actions because
the registrants of these active
ingredients tailed to support or
have withdrawn support for the
reregistration of their
product(s). Because of the pos-
sible ettects ot cancellation,
particularly on minor users, the
Agency is allowing 90 days for
existing registrants, users or oth-
ers ati'ected by the loss of these
products tt) commit to support
the regulatory, scientific and tec
requirements to maintain con-
tinued registration and use of
the product (s). Today's notice
includes 164 active active ingre-

dients from list C, nine from list
B and 185 from list D. The im-
pact of removing one-third of
the 173 active ingredients in list
B and list C is not expected to
be significant because there iire
not registered products contain-
ing these ingredients. Of the
remaining two-thirds, most had
annual production of less than
100,000 pounds, a few had pro-
duction between 100,000 and
one million and one had pro-
duction of over one million. Of
the 185 active ingredients in list
D, 116 no longer are contained
in any currently registered prod-
uct and of the remaining 69,
most had reported annual pro-
duction of less than 100,000
pounds. Fi\-e reponed produc-
tion greater than one million
pounds. To cushion the impact
ot cancellation actions on users
and to provide time to seek al-
ternative pesticides, products
being cancelled generally will be
permitted to be sold by the reg-
istrant for six months after the
cancellation becomes effective.
Existing stocks- in the hands of
dealers and users generally can
be sold and used until the
stocks are exhausted. Today's
actions appeared in the Federal
Register Oct. 4. To report com-
mitments to support reregi-
stration oi an active ingredient,
