TIMING IS EVERYTHING
Sound Borrowing Principles for the Seasonal Business
Ken Buzzell
The same pruidelines tor healthy
borrowing that apply to any
business hold as well tor seasonal
enterprises. As a lender, 1 always
look at what I call the "5 C's of
credit: character (credit history,
m;inagement ability), capital
(tin;Tncial position compared to
industry, liquidity), capacity
(earnings, repayment ability),
conditions (special risk tactors),
collateral (security tor long-term
loans). Some standard ratios also
help m evaluating any business.
Net worth should be at least 50
percent, preterably closer to 65
percent. The ratio of current assets
(including inventory) to liabilities
(like outstanding bills) should be at
least 1 .5 to 1 , or better yet, 2 to 1 .
For a seasonal business, financial
liquidity and inventory manage-
ment are probably the two most
important factors in sound borrow-
ing. And for overall financial
health, discipline is crucial.
Inventory Management
Inventory management is a big part
of every seasonal business. Are you
moving inventory effectively, or do
you have to discount large blocks?
Most people tend to be too opti-
mistic when ordering, or they order
too soon. You should avoid carrying
debt for inventory year to year. Old
formulas ("5 percent over last year's
order") don't work in today's vola-
tile consumer market. You have to
track the history ot your inventory
year to year and analyze it against
current market conditions. If your
business does not operate on a 12-
month cycle, then you should be
purchasing some ot your inventory
with earnings because you don't
know what the market will be in
two or three years. For very long-
term investments like Christmas
trees, we bankers have a special
technical term called "feeding the
beast," referring to the years of
plugging capital in before you get
anything out. But that's another
article in itself.
Liquidity
Liquidity, or available cash, is an
important measure of the health
of your business. Do you have
enough to carr>' you through the
off-season? What about interrup-
tions to your business, like weath-
er catastrophes? Adequate re-
serves are crucial to high risk sea-
sonal enterprises. There are ways
to assess liquidity other than
counting the cash in your pocket.
For example, a mature business
should not have to finance ac-
counts receivable, even if the
vendors you sell to are less than
prompt in paying you. You should
have enough cash on hand to
carry you through delays. New
businesses operate under different
guidelines. You may need financ-
ing for "growth receivables" until
your profits catch up with vendor
lag times.
Discipline
Discipline is the most vital ingre-
dient oi the successful seasonal
business. You're likely to make up
to 90 percent oi your income in
three months. It's important to
pay oft your operating line of
credit immediately, both to save
on interest and to resist tempta-
tion. This takes discipline when
that "slug of income" hits. Capi-
tal spending should be based on a
list of needs you have carefully
drawn up before the money is in
your checkbook. Remember that
probably at least 50 percent of
your expenses are fixed and pay-
able every month. One person in
your operation should be respon-
sible tor keeping an accurate, up-
to-date, monthly cash flow
worksheet.
Keeping track ot your financial
situation month to month helps
you plan your financing year to
year. An annual line of credit
should be set up tor your potential
needs (based on historical data)
and your unique business cycle:
when you plant and when you sell.
You need to have enough cash
available to meet your off-peak
operating expenses, but you don't
want to borrow more than you
need. With careful planning, a line
of credit is there when you need it -
and you'll only need it tor seasonal
production. You should plan to pay
off bills before you pay oft debt.
Most important, segment your
credit line year by year: pay off last
year's debt with last year's crop.
Meticulous record-keeping is the
only way to track where your bor-
rowed dollars are actually going.
It can also take discipline to turn
on and off your seasonal expenses.
Labor is a prime example. Don't
hire seasonal help tcx) soon. Plan
for overtime during your peak
season, then cut off extra labor as
soon as your season is over. TTiis
can be diftfcult, but with today's
nartow profit margins and high
labor costs it's absolutely essential.
Keeping track c:)f your financial
situation month to month helps
you plan your financing year to
year. An annual line oi credit
