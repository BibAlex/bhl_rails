plants — ^fuchsia. New Guinea
impatieni, shade impatient,
porrulaca, begonias, i\'>' geraniums —
are also grown each year. In spring,
hangers are overhead everN-where.
And one of the back houses is filled
just with A-trame racks that allow
hangers to be grown in large numbers
at eve level.
"Four years ago, we decided we
needed to increase our retail
business," Rob said; "we needed to
find ways to become more accessible
to the public. We were there; we
were growmg — bur no one could see
us — we needed to be more visible,
"^^hat we had was a florist shop
coruiected to an empt\- rwo-story
house, built in the fifties. Behind the
house were three connected glass
houses, gable ends facmg the road.
"I wanted to tear down the whole
place and put up a new garden
center, but I worked with Dick
Buckley, a consultant, who told me
to keep what I had — just use it
better." The key was "rustic."
The quarter-acre front lawn was
made into a sales yard for nursery
stock and pereruiials. .An 8x10 shed
was built as a place for an outdoor
cashier. The area bevond the shed
became addinonal parking.
In front oi the sales vard is a split-rail
fence. This is built in sections with
Its posts set into wooden bases filled
with cement that are set on the
ground — so the fence is adjustable. It
can be taken down in winter or
moved to change the si:e oi the
parking lot. Between this fence and
the sidewalk is a 3 1/2x100' dispby
bed. "When Dick first came," Rob
said, "he asked me what busmess I
was in. Tlants, flowers," I said-
"How would I know?' he asked;
"There's not a plant in sight."'
Now. along the sidewalk. 3000 tulips
bloom m spnng; when thev've gone
bv, 300 6' geraniums are planted; in
hill, there are 240 hardy mums.
"People dnve bv to see the color,"
Rob savs, "and then decide to stop m.
It's a great promonon device."
Behind the sales vard are two oi the
glass houses. Double swing doors
were installed and the Coroplast, a
double-walled plastic sheeting that
was used as insulation m the 70s, was
taken oH and replaced with glass.
From Mav through August, these are
predominantlv retail areas. The glass
walls and open doors invite pec^le to
wander mside and fill little red
wagons with produce. (The third
glass house is a vear-round retail area
and is directly behind the shop.)
The shop is a full-service flower shop
with two wire ser\ices and ernxigh
work to emplov the manager, Gerr\
Finle>-, and three designers. More
gift items are sold now. Balloons do
well — as do stuffed animals.
The si-e is unchanged, but the space
is HKDre open. The ser\ice counter,
for example, was pushed back three
feet to help create a direct traffic Ime
to the greenhouse bevond the shop.

greenhouse has become a retail area

In the greenhouse itself, the floor's

Advertismg is bv direct mail, using
their own lO-OC-person list and other,
bought lists. This year, Rob targeted
Newmarket homeowners.
This year's spring i>pen house — the
twent\'-sixtli — "was the best."
There used to be tents arxl barbecues,
entertainment and crafts, but nou- all
they do IS sell plants, with a 25%
discount offered on selected items.
4.500 people came to the one-dav
event.
There was no special program, but
they did have a clown. "She was
excellent," Rob said; "she pamted
faces and made animab out oi
balloons, but what was best was that
the kids watched her while their
parents shopped."
Rose and John are semi-renred.
The%- live year-round at their camp m
Eliot, but are there when needed.
Good help has staved. Gerrv has
worked in the shop twerux- vears;
Paul BaldelU, the head geranium
grower, has been there fourteen, and
Mart\ Couture, assistant ornamentals
grower, has been there eight. This
consisteiKy has steadied the turmoil
of growth.
Were there other plans tor Olde
English?
There were. Rob didn't see more
greenhouses, but he saw crops m the
back fields — "mavbe pick-your-own
blueberries. .And take-out ice cream
from June through Labor Da\- near
the parkmg lot."
