Carpenter's Olde English
The vear after Rose Carpenter
opened a small flower shop on
South Mam Street in Newmarket in
195C. John built a small glass green-
house^lOxlS — beside it. His first
crop was geraniums.
Tnese were hobbie- — hobbies m
New Hampshire tend to somehow
earn monev — but five vears later,
John and Rose lett their jobs and
entered the rlorist,'sreenhouse
business fiill-time.
Bv 1975. there were six houses and
an expanded flower shop. More
greenhouse expansion beean around
1975. That was the vear of an
unusually hezw snowstorm "when all
the gutter-connected houses went
down." 5a to prevent possible stww
build-up and "to give us peace oi
mmd," the newer houses — seven
27x96 gothic-st\le "New Eriglanders"
and — latet — ^four 17x96 "inflation
busters" — have all been free-
standing poly.
Today at Olde English, 17 houses
sive 6C,00C square feet of growing
area. Geraniums are still the main
crop; seven houses are specifically for
:hem. .And the letail side, with the
f.cwer shop as a major component, is
flourishing.
"\i'e"re several businesses here," Rob
Carperiter, the son of "J. B.
Carpenter &. Son, Itk.," says.
">X'holesale geraruums is just one."
Thirteen :onal tvpes arvi fourteen
.\nes are grown. Rob has "alwa>"s
staved awav from the ro\-alties
hassle." but this vear, he's offering
Oglevee's "Kim" and "Pix\k
Expectations" xsruls and "Simone,"
"Nichole," and "Monique" ivies.
The royalt>- fee adds to the price,
but customers ask for them."
2 1/4's (Jiff\- 7'5) are produced year-
round (a half-million were produced
last year), but spring is the busiest
time. Major crops then iiKzlude both

finished and pre-fmished -^
geraniums. The pre-rmished are "one
step beyond the 2 1/4's and are for
growers who want to stav closed a
linle longer." This is the tourth year
that Olde English has ottered them
and Rob savs they're selling well.
Thev now also sell off 90% of their
stock plants in March after the plants
have been stripped oi their final
cuttings. ('The>- make spectacular
patio plants," Rob says.)
During the wmter in one of the shut-
down "inflation busters" (two shut
down m wmter), people fill pots
whene\-er there's time. 36C Hea\A
Weight Metro-mix is used. (The
mixture is bagged — not haled. Rob
says "it costs more, but it doesn't
freeze; it's never wet; it's not too
hea\-\ — one person can handle it. It's
worth a little more expense.") The
pots are stored on pallets ( 1 500 per
pallet) and covered with plastic
and wTapped in shrink wTap. Bv
spring, 70.000 4" pots have been
prefilled.
As the 2 1/4's and stock are sold, the
4' pots are brought in with a forklift.
Cuttings are direct stuck. Most of
them can be put on berKhes with
Biotherm bottom heat and there is
verv' little loss.
W'holesale holiday crops is another
busmess. Olde English wholesales
6000 hnished poinsettias. Rob buys
unrooted cuttmgs rather than keep
stixik plants because his summer
retail business goes into August and
It's more profitable to use his houses
tor that.
He finds Hegg most reliable. He
liked Lilo, but found it "too finicla ."
.A.nd he liked Marble — it was his
tavonte — but customers like red, so
he's cutting back on other t\pes and
colors.
Easter crops irKlude flowering bulbs
and 2500 Easter lilies.
In tall, thete are 3500 mums m 8 1/2"
fiber pots. The plants — two of them
per pot — are direct stuck around July
first and pinched once. Normally,
mums are begun m May, but by using
two plants, he saves t*o months of
labor and creates a selling point:
"You get two tor one," customets are
told and they like dns, splitnng the
pot and plantmg each half with its
flat side against the house.
One house is used only for cool-
temperature crops. VtHien the house
is empn- oi cyclamen after Chrisrmas,
Rob pots up 1200 Martha
Washingtons. using one single-
shooter pre-ciX)led cutting in a 5' pot
or three single-shooters m a 6 1/2.
To stop white tlv problems,
evenT:hing else is kept out of the
house. The roots "don't like
svstemics, but with the use of
pvtethrums and Safer Soap, "there's
no white tlies." With 14-hour days
Vmcandescent bulbs on a timer) and
constant feed, the Januan- cutnngs
begin to blossom m Apnl. They're
sold berween Eastei and Mother's
Day. "The\'re a nice crop." Rob says,
"because thev sell whenever they're
readv."
