WINTER MEETING
The 1992 Winter Meeting of the New Hampshire Plant Growers'
Association will be held from 8:30-3:30 on Thursday, January 15,
at the Sheraton Tara Wayfarer Inn in Bedford, NH.
The Board felt that the most useful program would be a day focusing on
"How to Manage in Soft Economic Times."
As Paul Godbout noted in "From the Board," Manchester florists are
going out of business. Many greenhouses are cutting back. Some ot us are
doing fine, but less fine than a few years ago.
Analysts say what is really needed is confidence. This may be true,
but one way to achieve confidence is to know you're managing well.
The Board has arranged for several specialists to speak on aspects of
marketing and management that would be useful to people in the
grecnhouse/nursery/florist industries. Speakers include Bob Ebberson ot
the Manchester Small Business Development Center, Tina Sawtelle ot
Sawtelle Marketing Associates, and a representative from Primerica, a
financial services firm. TTiere will be an entomology update and
opportunities for questions.
The day will begin at 8:30 with the annual business meeting. A year-end
financial report and committee reports will be given. These will be
followed by the election of officers. The possibility of changing our logo
will be discussed, as well as any new business from the floor.
Pre-registration includes lunch, at which the two NHPGA scholarships
will be presented. Watch for our flier giving the complete program and
menu, registration fee, and directions on how to get there. Now's the
time to get your business in shape.
There will be no recertification credits offered. But the Board plans to
have an all-day meeting in the fall simply to give members a chance to
earn credits. At least four — probably si.x— will be offered then. A couple
credits will be offered at the summer meeting and, hopefully, there will
be opportunities to pick up a credit or two at upcoming twilight meetings
as well.
