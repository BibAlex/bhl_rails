THE
ISO[
(ees-o-lite) ADVANTAGE
Upward to 50% water savings.
Remarkable water holding capacity permanently solves drought problem areas.
Relieves compaction permanently — hard porous granules will not compress.
Environmentally safe— will not affect soil chemistry.
Hard ceramic granules— will not break down, shrink or swell in the soil.
70% porosity— holds water against gravitational and evaporative loss, but releases it to the root.
Extremely low C. B.C. (1.2-1.9 meg/1 OOg)— will not tie up nutrients.
Low bulk density (.5-.6 g/cc)— improves both water and air permeability.
Low E.G. (.1-.4 mmhos/cm) helps to eliminate salts.
