FOUR REGIONAL NE
GREEN INDUSTRY
ASSOCIATIONS TO
CONSOLIDATE SHOWS
Bosum — September 12 . Four
regional NE green industry
associations have taken steps to
consolidate trade shows in 1993 in
a move that may be trend-setting as
the need for improved industry
education meets the budget
concerns of the associations' boards
ot directors.
A regional show, NEW
ENGLAND GROWS "93, is
scheduled for February 3-4, 1993, at
Hynes Convention Center, Boston,
and is expected to draw visitors
from all six NE states.
The Associated Landscape
Contractors oi Massachusetts
(ALCM), the Massachusetts
Arborists Association (MAA), the
Massachusetts Nurserymen's
Association (MNA) and the New
England Nurserymen's Association
(NENA) will forego their 1993
trade shows in a gesture of suppon
for what will be the largest green
industry trade show in New
England.
"We expect to attract over 3000
visitors and to offer a wide variety
of educational programs each day,"
said Virginia Wood, show manager
and Executive Director of ALC^4,
MAA, and NENA. "There will be
between 400 and 500 exhibitors
who will benefit from the increased
traffic created by a consolidated
show," she said.
As Tom Vanicek of the NENA
said, "this gives all four associations
the opportunity to proceed equally
and as one to create the most
successful regional event in our
industry's history."

reservations, or queries about
program offerings, contact Virginia
