WINNERS—
THE AMERICA'S CUP
At the District Meeting ot the
State of New Hampshire FTD
Florists held in Keene on Novem-
ber fifth, Debra Defreze cif Jasmine's
Flower Shop (Seabrook) won the
New Hampshire FTD America's
Cup Design Competition tor the
second year in a row.
This year's design categories were
"A Bridal Bouquet," "Autumn in
New Hampshire," and "At Peace
with the Earth." Debra's inter-
pretation of "At Peace with the
E:4rth" started with a quotation
she'd remembered: "The best time
to plant a tree was 20 years ago; the
second best time is now." Using a
copper dry sink as a container, her
interpretation included cypripe-
dium orchids, gloriosa lilies, and a
small tree. There were mushrooms
and mosses and a brook — with
goldfish— running through it.
Debra will represent New
Hampshire at the FTD Regional
Competition in Newton, Mass-
achusetts, next March.
Second place winner was Ray
Savage of Flowers by Ray Savage
(Keene); third place went to Meg
Ranta of Anderson the Florist, also
from Keene. Congratulatieins to all
ot you.
Other business at the meeting
included showing the Mercury
3000 IBM 386 Computer. By 1996,
tlonsts must have this type of
machine in order to be on the FTD
network. Machines can be rented
from FTD for $110 a month, but
this may be an expensive
proposition for some of the smaller
shops. This meeting gave people
an .opportunity to begin thinking
about the future.
