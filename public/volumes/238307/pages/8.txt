CHANGES
Pleasant View Gardens (Pittsfield)
has decided to no longer handle
bench foliage plants — from 2 l/2s
up to large floor items. The market
is miiving in new directions and the
Huntingtons are moving with it.
They are still growing hangers —
"the Swedish ivy, bridal veil, grape
ivies — they're all the same;" and
they plan to expand their seasonal
lines and increase production ot
perennials, holiday and potted
flowering items, and plug and cell
pack material.

NEW TAGS FOR NEW
HAMPSHIRE PRODUCTS
UNH Cooperative Extension has
developed hanging tags and
stickers for use in promoting New
Hampshire-grown-and-produced
commodities.
The idea began as part of a Coop-
erative Extension forest product
marketing effort, but it was decided
to design a logo that could be used
with a wide range of fanii and forest
products — from lumber to honey;
from crafts to holiday plants.
The tags and stickers were designed
by Bob Johnson of B.j . Graphics,
Westmoreland, and produced by
Bannerman Sign and Promo,
Lebanon, and Delta Graphics of
Winchester. The design is an
outline oi the Old Man of the
Mountain with "Naturally, from
the fields and forests of New Hamp-
shire" printed msidc it. The re-
movable stickers come in two sizes,
1 X 1 1/2" and 2 3/8 x 3 1/2". The
folding tags are 2 x 3" and open up
to 4x3".
Project coordinator was Marshal
Patmos, Extension EduciUor,
