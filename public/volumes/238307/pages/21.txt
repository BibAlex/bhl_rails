should be set up tor your potential needs (based on
historical data) and your unique business cycle: when
you plant and when you sell. You need to have enough
cash available to meet your off-peak operating
expenses, but you don't want to borrow more than you
need. With careful planning, a line oi credit is there
when you need it - and you'll only need it tor seasonal
production. You should plan to pay oft bills before you
pay off debt. Most important, segment your credit line
year by year: pay off last year's debt with last year'>>
crop. Meticulous record-keeping is the only way to
track where your borrowed dollars are actually goint^.
It can also take discipline to turn on and ott your
seasonal expenses. Labor is a prime example. Hon't
hire seasonal help too soon. Plan tor o\ertime during
your peak seascm, then cut ott extra labor as soon as
your season is over. This can be ditticult, but with
today's narrow profit margins and high labor costs, it's
absolutely essential.

MARKETING TIPS
Tiivi Sawtelle
Now's the time to draw up your marketing plan for
the season. Marketing is one of the essential tools
for success, but one of the easiest to put on the back
burner. Therefore, if you have a plan to follow,
you'll be better prepared. Plan for:
Special events
Signage (roadside and retail)
Display techniques and layout
New product lines
A speciality you can call vour own
Merchandising
Customer service techniques
(employee preparation and promotional materials)
Set your marketing goals for 1992 and make a com-
mitment to following through with a marketing plan.
