Fig. 7. Approximate distribution of the genus Ophrydesmus. Spot on Pala-
wan Island represents the type locality for 0. exilis.
nearly to level of stricture, sharply dividing sternal region into paramedian halves;
surface of sterna smooth, set with long setae, not produced subcoxally.
Legs relatively long and slender (fig. 4), distal half of tarsi visible beyond para-
nota when seen in dorsal aspect. Coxa virtually glabrous, other podomeres becom-
ing increasingly setose; prefemora slightly enlarged and projecting ventrally; tarsal
claw small, slender, slightly curved. Lengths of podomeres: 6>3>2>5=4 = 1.
Sides of segments granular, without other modification aside a fine vertical
submarginal posterior ridge. Stigmata small, suboval, the anterior stigma with
elevated rims, located in the stricture in front of dorsal coxal condyle; posterior
stigma small, without distinct rims, set in the triangular space between upper ends
of coxae; dorsal coxal condyles prominent and projecting outwards.
Sternum of 2nd pair of legs (fig. 5) transversely subquadrate, loosely attached
to pleural areas of 3rd segment, with prominent median crest on the anterior side
extending up between median bases of coxae; stigmata visible at outer basal corners
of sternum. Sympleuron of 3rd segment produced into a thin semicircular flange
behind bases of 2nd legs.
Holotype. Adult female (Field Mus.), from the south slope of
Mount Balabag, 4,200 ft., Mantalingajan Range, Palawan Island;
F. G. Werner leg., May 10-17, 1947.
