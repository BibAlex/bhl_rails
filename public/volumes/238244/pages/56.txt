science in the realms of pliysical inquiry, but he soon sees that
they are but as a vanishing point before the infinite unknown,
a grain to the mountain, a drop from the ocean. The meta-
physical philosopher dreams that he has solved the problem of
the universe in terms of mere logic, but this is a problem
which, if solved at all, could only be solved by an infinite In-
telligence. The theological philosopher claims to have pene-
trated by means of revelation even to the secret counsels of
the Creator Himself, but that very torch of revelation only
shows him mysteries still unrevealed and unrevealable, and so
our gnostic friend at last lands us in absolute ignorance and
admits that the ever knowable is still the ever unknowable.
Is it not evident that both parties, both schools, need more
of the caution of true science and of the humility of true
philosophj^ ? The simple fact is that the Agnostic and the
Gnostic are better friends than they know, and cannot do with-
out each other ; they are only at work upon opposite segments
of the same arch, which now seem fragmentary and hostile,
but may be destined to meet as in the keystone of perfectible
science upheld by reasonable faith.
Mr. President, I must not forget that I represent an institu-
tion which like this one is devoted to the advancement of
science. Princeton College aims and claims to be a contribu-
tor to the existing stock of human knowledge as well as a dis-
tributor of knowledge through the channels of education, and
to-da}^ it may well congratulate a kindred organization with
which in former times it has had at least one magnetic link of
communication. Its ever-honored professor, Joseph Henry,
as you know, followed in the steps of your illustrious Frank-
lin, pursuing and completing the same physical researches. If
I mistake not, his splendid discoveries were first announced to
this Society, and put on record in the beautiful hand-writing of
