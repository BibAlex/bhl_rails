sion of communication amongst men, it is perhaps to be
doubted wlictlier we yet see the full significance of this fact
or appreciate its profound importance in the history of man-
kind. Yet how naturally, and by how simple anorder of logi-
cal succession in the history of science itself, the "Letter of
Benjamin Franklin, Esq., to Mr. Peter Collinson, F.R.S., con-
cerning an electrical kite," published in Vol. xlvii of the
Philosophical Transactions, is connected with the possibility of
the message from Sir George Stokes, instructing me to be here
to-night, which was darted westward a few days ago beneath
the ocean's depth, with a speed that anticipated by hours the
laggard turning eastward of the earth upon its axis.
As we think of the gradually expanding insight into the mys-
teries of nature which has come of scientific study in the pass-
ing years of the last century, of what was concealed from the
workers in science in 1789, and is seen of all men to-day, we nat-
urally wish that those who then saw dimly could share the
larger measure of light which is given to us, and as naturally
we think, and with some sadness, of the yet brighter light
which those who are to come after us will undoubtedly enjoy.
The words of Seneca suit our mouths as well as they did his :
" Quidem multa venientis aevi populus iynota nobis sciet.
Multa seculis tunc futuris^ quum memoria nostri exoleverit,
reservantur. * * * Rerum natura sacra sua non simul
tradit. Initiatos nos credimus : in vestibulo haeremus.^^
Such thoughts bring with them the seemingly opposite yet
both together best results of the pursuit of science, a profound
and exulting, appreciation of the advance already made in
knowledge of the universe spread out before us, and at the
same time a yet more profound humility in face of the far
D-reater ignorance which hides from us the more wondrous
things beyond.
