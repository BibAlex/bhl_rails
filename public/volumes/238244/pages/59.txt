in closing mj brief remarks, to join together two of these
great names as alike worthy of immortal memory : Benja-
min Franklin and Joseph Henry — if the one, as it has been
boldly said, seized the lightning in its course from heaven, the
other has sent it forth as a vehicle of intelligence throughout
the earth.
Mr. Vaux : Gentlemen : — While you have been de-
lighted, charmed and Instructed by what you have heard
from the oldest, and the uninterruptedly continued insti-
tutions of learning by their representatives at our fes-
tive board this evening, I think our feast of reason can-
not well be concluded until you have had an opportunity
to hear an equally learned address from the last-born
of the learned institutions of the continent on which
we live. Within the last few days, since this moon
began to wane, there has been born in the Federal
metropolis an institution of learning which, from all
that we can know of its parentage and its purposes, is
destined to be one of the most marvelous creations of
this age, and in order that you may not go away to-
night believing it is the old institutions which have the
monopoly of science and philosophy, let me ask you
to drink to the last toast : " The labors and achieve-
ments OF great teachers in Science and Philosophy
LIVE after them ; these are their monuments." To
so appropriate a toast gathered from all the learning
that has come down to us through the Latin race,
marvelous in its character, splendid in its condition,
wonderful in its elements, eternal in its truth, let me ask
you to listen in reply to the Rt. Rev. John J. Keane,
LL.D., President of the Catholic University of America.
