the imperishable worth of hiunan science? Empires have
risen and fallen in the Old World; the thirteen colonies have
become the United States; the United States, surviving the
shock of a civil war, have expanded over the continent ; but
this Society meanwhile has pursued its peaceful mission of ac-
cumulating and diffusing knowledge, unchanged amid surround-
ing changes.
What wonderful stores of knowledge it has gathered into
its garners daring these past hundred years ! The heavens,
the very heaven of heavens, have been unveiled and the birth
and growth of worlds exposed to our view. The earth in all
its past history has been retraced, and its extinct dynasties of
life recalled as in a marvelous resurrection. Man has been
placed at the summit of living nature with his evolving races,
languages and arts. The foul itself, turning its powers in scru-
tiny upon itself, has been tracing the logical laws and pro-
cesses by which it has accumulated this immense store of
knowledge. Society, in the ranks of its humblest toilers, as
well as in these higher circles of the learned, has begun to
offer problems of which our wisest statecraft has not dreamed,
and for the moral and religious solution of which the Protest-
ant members of this philosophical association will welcome
the aid of their Roman Catholic fellow- members, of whom I
am glad to find we have a distinguished representative here to-
night. Even theology is becoming the study of scientists as
well as divines. And philosophy is collecting from all the
sciences the materials for a complete system of knowledge.
What illustrious names have been enrolled in the transac-
tions of this Society during the century passed ! The choicest
and brightest intellects of all lands have been- gathered from
all the sciences and crowned with your laurel as kings in the
realm of knowledge and benefactors of mankind. Permit me,
