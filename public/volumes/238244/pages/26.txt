It may be appropriate in the progress of this
address to make a brief reference to the history of
the Society itself. When Benjamin FrankHn came to
the city of Philadelphia about the year 1727, he formed
that celebrated Junto which he has so admirably de-
scribed in his autobiography, an association of his
friends pledged to each other for mutual improvement,
for the study of the philosophy and science of that
day, and for disseminating their ideas by discussions
and essays that might appear in the public prints.
It appears that for the forty years this Junto was in
existence, it was always in the thoughts of that eminent
and patriotic man, so urgent in the performance of his
duties, so apt to every exigency, that even after it had
existed for forty years he wrote to his friends in Phila-
delphia, calling their attention to the fact that the Junto
still existed, and urging upon them the propriety of
keeping up its meetings and further developing its
usefulness and prosperity. In 1743, on the 25th of
May — new style — Benjamin Franklin published a pros-
pectus for the establishment of an American Philo-
sophical Society. In that prospectus he described
with minute precision the objects that such a society
should have, the methods to prosecute them, the
means by which it might obtain success, and the
organization which seemed to him to be necessary to
bring about perfection to such an institution. With
keen foresight he saw that the chief labor of such a
society and such an organization would devolve upon
the active mind which had originated it, and with the
simplicity and adaptation of his great character he
proposed himself for the humble office of secretary in
the society, and for many years acted in that capacity ;
