Mr. Vaux : The next toast is, " Our kindred Soci-
eties IN EVERY CLIME," and we would suppose that
to that sentiment it was very easy to make a reply,
but the difficulty was where to look for the replier.
It seemed reasonable to think that the proper place
to look for it was where arts and sciences were
in a highly flourishing condition, so they sent to
Boston, and Prof. Joseph Lovering, LL.D., President
of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
was requested to be present this evening and make
a reply to this toast. He is not here. He wrote a
letter which indicated, as I understood, that he would
be here, but something has prevented his coming.
I have, on behalf of the Committee, been requested
to interpret this absence, but it is a very difficult
thing to put the interpretation which I hope will be
agreeable and acceptable to everybody here and at
the same time acceptable to my distinguished friend,
Dr. Lovering. The arts and sciences of New England
are not to be present, and I have no reason to'give why
not. So the art and science of it is to leave me the ex-
cuse, and I make the excuse for him. Yet the art and the
science belong to that part of the globe of which he is
an inhabitant. Therefore, we will have the Art and Sci-
ence omitted, and ask you gentlemen to drink to the
third toast : "All research into the Book of Nature
HAS NOT discovered AN ERRATUM." It seems to be a
generally accepted idea by those who are philosophers
and scientists that the best possible reply which could
be made to that sentiment will be given to you by Sir
Daniel Wilson, LL.D., F.R.S.E., President of the Uni-
versity of Toronto, and if he has found any one of
those errata he will have the opportunity now to tell
you which one it is.
