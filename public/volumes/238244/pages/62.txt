human voice that, perhaps centuries before, gave it utter-
ance?
The good Father again has left to the intelhgence and the
free-will of His creatures, under the guidance of His Provi-
dence, the working out of the social problems which harmonize
and organize the living of men together in human society. He
is therefore an agent of our Father's care, as well as a bene-
factor to his fellow-men, who makes clear any great social
principle that guides men in their social organization. Our
Declaration of Independence is not only our country's Magna
Charta, earning for its framers and signers our country's ever-
lasting love, but it is an enunciation of social principles, stand-
ing like a great beacon light on the pathway of man's social
advance, calling for the gratitude of mankind forever.
Human action depends for its wisdom and its utility upon
its agreement with the great principles of truth and of duty
which are the bases of philosophy. Any brilliant genius who
Avould lead astray from those great principles is an ignis
fatuus^ who must lead men into the mire, whether it be social
or domestic, or political organization that is in question. They,
on the contrary, deserve all honor from God and from men
who have power to declare those great principles with a voice
that all must hear and heed, and who hold them up like a
torch to guide the advance of mankind in those paths of
morality and of religion in which alone, as our immortal
Washington has warned us, can our country's prosperity be
hoped for.
All honor therefore to the men who, in any realm of scien-
tific, of philosophical, of ethical research, are doing something
to increase the store of human knowledge, and all honor to
this Association which gives to such men so efficient assist-
ance.
