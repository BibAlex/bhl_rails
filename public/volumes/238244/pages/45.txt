us the first page in the book of nature. Your tlieme invites
our attention to it under the apt metaphor of a book ; no
chance medlej of the materialist, or mere evolution of time
out of chaos ; but a volume of well-ordered method and sequence,
revealing on every page the purposed design of its Author.
Turning then to the pages of this ample volume, astronomy
is the science which, dealing with the visible present, appeals
even to the uncultured mind — to the Syrian shepherd, as to
the Indian hunter on the prairies, — in proof of an all-mighty,
an all- wise Creator. With upturned eyes, savage and
sage alike peer into the immeasurable depths of space lighted
up with its galaxy of worlds and suns, marshaled in such
harmonious symmetry that they unmistakably reveal the evi-
dence of design, order and law ; the governance of a supreme
Intelligence. Nor is the royal psalmist alone in learning from
them the lesson of devout humility, as he considered the
heavens, the work of God's hand ; the moon and the stars
which He has ordained ; and realized the marvelous compass
of that overruling Providence that can still be mindful of the
meanest of His creatures.
The old Greek, perplexed though he was by the misleading
complexities of a stellar universe, revolving, as it seemed to
him, around our own little planet, nevertheless realized such a
rhythmical harmony and beauty in the motions of the
heavenly bodies, cycle on epicycle, orb on orb, that he listened
if perchance he might catch some echo of the music of the
spheres which seemed inseparable from that stately measure of
their nightly round. The same fascinating idea is revived by
our own Shakespeare, in lighter mood, when his Venetian
lovers meet in the moonlit gardens of Belmont. I say, in its
amplest sense, " our Shakespeare," for in this reunion with so
choice a gathering of American friends it is ^^leasant to recall
