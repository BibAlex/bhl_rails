ure it gave the people.
But those times have }>assed forever. Science took up

system going, and that " every gratification of sense and of

But it is the second characteristic of science that we are

holds the destiny of the future. The fact is, the great future
which lies ahead of us is one grand unity of results ; and, in
words not original with me, this age is to go on growing better,
purer and faster, building schools, doubling its power of
machinery, trebling its exports of cotton and woolen goods,
and " sending forth its freights as missionaries of truth to all

consummation of science is to be witnessed in the unification
of all things, in the destruction of theologies of narrow, bigoted
creeds, blood stained through the centuries, and in the knitting
