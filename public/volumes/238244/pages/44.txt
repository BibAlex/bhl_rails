Mr. President and Fellow-Members of the American
Philosophical Society : — In the part which you have
assigned to me in this Centennial Commemoration, I find my-
self called upon to deal with a subject the compass of which
is wholly beyond my powers ; as it is all too ample for the
limited time available. In the eloquent address in which
you, Mr, President, retraced the history of this, the oldest
among the scientific societies of America, you found an hour
too brief for a review of the events of the cen+ury which
to-day completes itscj^cle; and now I find myself called upon,
in the briefer limits at my disposal, to verify the entire Book
of Nature, and demonstrate the faultless perfection of the

in the most superficial efibrt at such a review.
Amid the brightness of this festive commemoration, the
temptation is rather to leave the past unheeded, and to take
the wings of fancy — or, better still, the intuitions of science, —
and anticipate the marvels of the coming time ; those fairy tales
of science that surpass all the wonders of romance. But your
behest must be obeyed ; and it will perhaps most aptly meet
present requirements if I select from the manifold phases
which challenge our consideration two suggestive aspects of

fitly constitute the motto of this, the oldest among the philo-
sophical fellowships of the New World: "Let there be light!"
the abyss flashed into cosmic brightness and beauty ; and the
illimitable depths of space, illumined with the splendor that
enkindled suns, and awoke the myriad worlds to life, traced for
