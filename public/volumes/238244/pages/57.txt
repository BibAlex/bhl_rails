its Secretary, Judge Kane, who welcomed tlie new knowledge
with all his intelligent enthusiasm. It was from the lecture-
room of Professor Henry that the first telegraphic wire was
carried across the college campus at Princeton, That wire
has since been carried by other hands around the globe. It
was reserved for him to enjoy only the fame of those researches
from which the whole civilized world has received so many
material benefits. Like Agassiz, he was so strict a votary of
science that he could not merge the discoverer in the mere in-
ventor. He ever sought knowledge for its own sake and with

scientific brethren, he ever exemplified that full accord of ex-

in them, and still includes, its munificent patrons as not less
worthy a place in the same goodly fellowship. We recognize
one of them sitting at this feast of reason whose praises I must
speak wherever my tongue is loosed ; a valued friend who has

on any good work would be completeâ€” Mr. George W. Childs.
What a noble monument does the American Philosophical
Society present to us to-day ! As we sat this afternoon, spell-
bound listeners to the story of its origin and growth, so elo-
quently and touchingly told, who among us could fail to perceive
