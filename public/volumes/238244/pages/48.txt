faint degree the cosmos, but to apprehend its lesson of hu-
miUty : we read the brightest of all the illumined pages of
the book of nature, and find no flaw. The very fact that
" this brave overhanging firmament ; this majestical roof fret-
ted with golden fire," expanded before our nightly vision,
seem's to us infinite in its compass, is in itself the index of
an apprehension that enthrones reason apart from the high-
est attributes of irrational life. The physicist and the meta-
physician have diverse conceptions of space ; but practically,
for us, the impossible is to conceive of limits to the uni-
verse. Imagination speeds from star to star through all the
fields of space, guided by the strictest mathematical induction,
and finds everywhere the same majestic harmony. No chaos
lies behind the heavens, nightly revealed anew in all their
mystery as evening draws her azure curtain athwart the sun.
It is indeed the garish day, with its mundane round of petty
cares, that curbs the wings of fancy, blinds the eye of faith,
and shuts out heaven from our view. But who can set bounds
to that mighty vision ? If we sphere space, what lies beyond
it? Still law, order, harmony; one overruling all-pervading
influence, one Divine purpose. What can be behind it but
God:
"One God, one law, one element,
And one faroflf divine event,
To which the whole creation moves."
Mr. Vaux : Dr. Wilson has given you a most able
effort to discover errata, and I think all of you will
agree that, after such a brilliant speech, full of so much
science, philosophy, learning and culture, we will have
to give up the idea that there is an erratum anywhere
In the science of philosophy. But in order that you
may have a counterpart In some degree to this
