Mr. President and Gentlemen : â€” In the name of the
Catholic University of America, I offer respectful homages
and affectionate greetings to the American Philosophical
Society, the youngest to the oldest of American institutions
for the advancement of learning. In its name, I return heart-
felt thanks for the broad-hearted liberality manifested by this
invitation to j^our centennial celebration, and for the over-kind
words with which my unworthy self has been introduced to
you to-night. Such a spirit we honor as worthy of this City
of Brotherly Love, and worthy of your great founder, Franklin,
who was noted among all his contemporaries for the univer-
sality of his human sympathies, and who numbered among his
friends and among his colaborers for our country's liberties our
great patriot bishop, John Carroll,
In the name also of our University, I heartily endorse the
sentiment embodied in the toast to which I have been so
kindly asked to reply. We welcome and hail every advance
in philosophical research and in scientific discovery, and we
pay homage to the great men whom God makes use of for
their achievement.
In the establishment of our own University, our purpose in
opening our work with the faculty of Divinity has been to
place the great God, the all-creating Father, in the very, centre,
in order that around him all philosophical and scientific studies
may be harmoniously grouped and may move in order like
the planets around their central sun; and we are firmly con-
vinced that he not only deserves well of his fellow-men, but
deserves well of Almighty God, who in any way adds to the
store of human knowledge, since of God it is said that " He is
light and there is no darkness in Him."
The inspired wise man has said that " man has been made a
little lower than the angels and has been crowned with glory
