tlie community which we realize in the matchless literature of
our mother tongue. With au altogether pecviliar bond of kin-
ship, akin to -that recognized among the remotest wanderers
from the Hellenic fatherland ; on the Euxine, at Cyrene, Mas-
silia; or in furtherest colonial outposts on the Iberian shores;
we, " who speak the tongue that Shakespeare spake ; the faith
and morals hold that Milton held," may surely claim to be
one. And so, as such, with Shakespeare for our guide, we
renew the fond imaginings of the old Greek ; as Lorenzo, in
that moonlight meeting with his bride, in " The Merchant of
Yenice," points her to the floor of heaven, all thick inlaid with
patines of bright gold, and exclaims :
"There's not the smallest orb in all the heaven
But in its motion like an angel sings,
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubim,
Such harmony is in immortal souls ;
But while this muddy vesture of decay
Does grossly close us in we cannot hear it."
Thus, as it would seem, not alone the gaze of the wonder-

the verdict which your thesis affirms. We, too, in the spirit
of the old Greek, may assuredly recognize the perfect harmony
and order which everywhere reveals a Creator's hand. Alike
in the splendor of that universe which greets our eyes, as with
optic glass we strive to fathom its mysteries and to interpret
its chronicling as a page of Nature's volume ; and in the min-
utest atom, that the microscope reveals, we recognize -the con-
sistent harmony of a Divine law-giver. For the same law that
moulds a tear, and shapes the dew-drop, holds the planets in
their course, and regulates the form and motions of suns and
worlds. The astronomer, with ever-increasing aids of science,
penetrates into remoter depths of space only to bring back
