ish us of the fact that the time was rapidly approaching
when we must dispose of our property here.
In the year 1870 the Legislature created a Building
Commission for the purpose of erecting a City Hall
on Penn Square, and they connected with that enact-
ment a provision that when those buildings were com-
pleted the Building Commission should remove from
this beloved square all the buildings standing upon it
except the venerable State House, Independence Hall,
supposing that would be a sufficient monument to per-
petuate all the patriotic thoughts clustering about the
city of Philadelphia.
I feel embarrassed when I have to talk of our part-
ing with our ancient home. It is associated in my mind
with so much pleasure, with so much instruction, that
perhaps I ought to hope that I may not live to see the
Society part with it. But there are considerations
connected with this subject which I think ought to
weigh with the members of the Society, when they
consider the vast amount of precious treasures that
we have accumulated here in the shape of our library,
our collections, our manuscripts, our portraits, and so
many things of which all feel pride in the possession.
We have a building fund slowly accumulating, which,
in time, independently of the sale of this property,
might provide for the erection of a fire-proof build-
ing, and we ought, perhaps, to look a little beyond
our own immediate wants and ascertain, when the time
of removal comes, whether there are not kindred asso-
ciations in the city of Philadelphia with which we could
unite in erecting a temple to useful knowledge, to the
fine arts, to the mechanic arts, and to all those arts which
contribute to the happiness and welfare of mankind.
