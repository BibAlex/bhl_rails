who in 1787 was elected a member of tlic American Philo-
sophical Society, and at a meeting of the latter, on April 18,
1788 (Franklin presiding), returned thanks for his election and
communicated " A very curious account of pure iron in a met-
alic {sic) state lately found in South America."
Not in membership alone, but also in scientific activity, does
there remain evidence of early relations between the two so-
cieties. In the Philosophical Transactions for 1769 we find
the " Account of the Transit of Venus over the Sun's Disc, as
observed at Norriton in the County of Philadelphia and Pro-
vince of Pennsylvania, June o, 1769. By William Smith,
D.D., Provost of the College of Philadelphia, John Lukens,
Esq., Surveyor-General of Pennsylvania, David Kittenhouse,
A.M., of Norriton, and John Sellers, Esq., one of the Eepre-
sentatives in Assembly from Chester county, the Committee
appointed for that observation by the American Philosophical
Society, held at Philadelphia, for promoting useful knowledge.
Communicated to the said society by Dr. Smith, and to the
Royal Society of London by Nevil Maskelyne, B.D., Astrono-
mer Eoyal." And in the folloAving year was published an
"Account of the Transit of Mercury, November 9, 1769, ob-
served at Norriton, Pennsylvania. By a Committee of the
American Philosophical Society. Communicated by Benja-
min Franklin, LL.D."
I am sure that now, a century later than the day on which
your Society held its first regular meeting in its newly com-
pleted Hall, the feelings of good will between the two socie-
ties, and cordial desire for the continued scientific vitality and
prosperity of both, are increased rather than abated. The
Royal Society congratulates you on your entering upon the
second century of corporate life in your accustomed meeting
place.
