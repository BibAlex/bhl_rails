State of Pennsylvania ; was the fast and firm friend of tliat
good old man, James Buclianan, and wlio did better tlian that
in taking a wife from among tlie Pennsy Iranians ; therefore, I
can claim to have a kinship with the Philadelphians, and admit

am glad I stand here on this occasion, and say to you, as an
humble representative of AVilliam and Mary College, that that
ancient institution, which gave to the American Philosophical
Society a President, which gave to science the precious gift of
her Jefferson, and to the country at large her Monroe and her
Marshal, is full of fraternal greetings on this centennial occa-

Veterans in a grand common cause, it is but right that they
should meet around a common table and pledge each other's
health now and forever.
Although, Mr. President, the antecedents of William and
Mary College go back to the year 1619, when the first project
of a university was started in America, its charter was not
obtained until the year 1693, just fifty years, a semi-centennial,
ahead of the foundation of this association ; and in this age of
centennials and semi-centennials (and I understand that the
American Philosophical Society has had a full share of them
already in the past), it may be worth while to know that old
Benjamin Franklin, the founder of this Society, on the occasion
of a personal visit to Williamsburg, received, in the semi-cen-
