fresh evidence of an all-pervading harmony amid its countless
members. In coniident reliance on the orderly movements of
the planets, Leverrier and Adams independently wrought out
results by means of which the telescope of the observer was
pointed to the unheeded speck, invisible to the naked eye ; and
the planet Neptune was added as a new member of our solar
system. The science of Chemistry, too, unexpectedly directing
its operations to a sphere which had hitherto seemed to lie
wholly beyond its province, by means of spectrum analysis
brings back to us the reassuring disclosure that, amid endless
diversities in their combinations, the remotest of those suns
that light up the firmament are fashioned of the same elements
as this little planet-home of man. Such are some of the teach-
ings of science. But even the untutored eye sees enough in that
mysterious vault that nightly spans for him life's fleeting hour,
lit up with the splendor of its myriad suns, and the star-strewn
milky- way, to realize that no errata need be appended to the
volume of nature. It may be that every star is the centre of
a system of worlds, the abode of intelligences more gifted
than we are to interpret the wondrous volume ; but this at
least we do know that they shine for us, lighted up from the
same source which enkindles the central luminary of our own
little group of planets ; stirs our earth in its winter's sleep ;
quickens the buried seed, and the dormant animal life ; and
is but another aspect of that force which moves the worlds.
Thus we recognize the indices of an all-pervading harmony,
disclosing to every eye evidence of rule, of law, and so of the
Divine law-giver, alike in the orderly movements of suns and
planets, and in the mysterious wanderings of the comet that
blazes in the splendor of its perihelion and then returns in
darkness to unknown depths of space. This is for us a living
present. But, so also, in another chapter of the volume of
