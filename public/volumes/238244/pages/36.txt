thought that Henry, Morse and other scientists would
develop the grand idea, the spark of which was thus
struck out by Franklin, into the electric telegraph, into
electric lighting, into electric motion over a railway?
Well, I cannot venture to enumerate what are to be the
exhibits of electrical phenomena. And, when we find
that the human voice can penetrate space to immense
distances; that speech in such a room as this can be
transmitted to a cylinder, recording every word and the
tone of every word that is spoken, and that then — how
long a time afterwards has not yet, I believe, been de-
termined — that same cylinder can be unrolled and the
words can be again uttered, and the speech, whether it
be one of wisdom or of folly, be repeated to the world
for good or for evil, as the case may be, v/hat is the
unfolding of the ancient papyri to such a wonderful
discovery as this ?
How, my associates, can we bring ourselves to realize
what has been accomplished during our own lifetime
in these respects? And yet the men of science are fear-
lessly looking forward, making, day by day, new dis-
coveries in archaeology, geology, palaeontology, in chem-
istry, mechanics, and physics, with their great variety
of applications.
And we, who are approaching the evening of life,
and realize what we have enjoyed in so many discov-
eries and so much usefulness, cannot hope that we shall
be permitted to see all the glorious developments that
yet remain to be produced by the operation of the hu-
man mind, by the application of the principles which
lie at the foundation of applied science. But when the
time comes for our departure hence, I trust that we
may all realize that we have been permitted to live in
