Ivy {Hedera Helix L.). The berries of the Ivy are said to be largely
eaten by certain birds {e.g. blackbirds, thrushes, wood-pigeons), but
have poisoned children. The plant has long been said to be poisonous,
but no definite case of poisoning of live stock has been discovered;
possibly farm live stock would need to eat a considerable quantity for
serious effects to be induced. Indeed, when keep is short, it is quite
common in some districts to see Ivy strewed on the fields for cattle
and sheep to eat, and it is very frequently given to sick animals by
country people (Garnett).
Toxic Principle. This has not been closely studied, but ivy contains
a bitter principle which is strongly cathartic, emetic and purgative.
Ivy contains a poisonous glucoside Hederin (C64H104O19) and a resin
{Gummi hederce).
Symptoms. As suggested above, it is doubtful whether animals
have been poisoned by Ivy. Symptoms given appear to refer to
children, and consist in sickness, diarrhoea, nervous symptoms, excite-
ment at first, then convulsions and paralysis (Miiller). Sickness and
purgation (Esser).
Cornevin states that the symptoms are complex, emeto-purgative
effects being present, with nervous symptoms resembhng those of
intoxication, viz. excitement, then coma, convulsions, uncertain gait,
and stertorous respiration.

Common Elder {Sambucus nigra L.) and Dwarf Elder {S. Ehulus
L.). These two plants are usually avoided by stock, no doubt in view
of their odour, more particularly in the case of the latter species. The
bark, leaves and berries of both species were noticed by Cornevin as
having pronounced purgative properties, and the berries of S. Ehulus
as having poisoned turkeys. Esser remarks that the use of S. Ehulus by
