CHAPTER III
CELASTRACEffi.
Spindle Tree {Euonymus europceus L.). According to Cornevin
the spindle tree is poisonous in all its parts, especially the fruits, which
are emetic and strongly purgative. Sheep and goats have been injured
from eating the leaves, and children have suffered from eating the fruits.
Toxic Principle. This plant does not appear to have been closely
studied from the toxicological point of view; contrary to the state-
ments generally made in the literature Van Kijn remarks that this species
does not contain the doubtfully classed Euonymin.
Symptoms. Ingestion of the plant induces symptoms and lesions
such as are due to violent vegetable purgatives.

RHAMNACEiE.
Buckthorn {Rhamnus Catharticus L.) and {R. Frangula L.). The
berries of both species are toxic and purgative, but both are uncommon
and rarely eaten by stock.
Toxic Principle. The berries and bark contain the glucosides
Frangulin (C21H20O9) and Rhamnetin (CigHigOy).
Symptoms. The berries are purgative, and there is some danger
from large quantities, which may induce super-purgation. The leaves
are astringent and may arrest milk secretion (Cornevin). Miiller states
that the inflammation of the stomach and intestines may terminate
fatally.
