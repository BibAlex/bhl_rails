14 Ranunculaceae [ch.
The poisoning of two cows by H. viridis came under the notice of
Cornevin. There was observed loss of appetite, diarrhoea, tenesmus,
violent attempts to evacuate, which after 5 or 6 days resulted only in
the expulsion of glareous blackish matter; to the end the pulse was
slow and intermittent. The heart beats were weak, and after 5 or 6
beats there was a stop equal in duration to at least a beat and a half.
A remarkable fact was the very gradual loss of condition, while the milk
secretion was maintained until the last day. In one case death occurred
after 12 days and in the other after 28 days.

Larkspur {Delphinium Ajacis Reich.). In the United States of
America certain species of Larkspur are exceedingly harmful to live
stock, and it has been said that " with the exception of the Loco weeds
there is probably no poisonous plant on the cattle ranges of the West
that has caused such heavy losses to stockmen as has larkspur" {Far.
Bui. 53, U. S. Dept. Agric). D. Ajacis is the only British species,
occurring in cornfields in Cambridgeshire, Sussex and elsewhere, and,
like the Continental species D. Consolida, must be regarded as poisonous
and fatal to cattle, while horses and sheep may also suffer. Sheep and
goats, however, appear to resist the poison unless taken in considerable
quantity. Wilcox fatally poisoned a yearling lamb within an hour of
administering per os the extract from less than 1 oz. of the dried leaves
of an American species. The seeds are the most dangerous part of the
Larkspur, and should never be ground up with wheat should the two
plants grow together. The seeds of D. Staphisagria are used in
medicine.
Toxic Principle. The species D. Ajacis has been little studied, but
D. Consolida and D. Staphisagria contain the alkaloids Delphinine
(C31H49O7N), very poisonous and having a bitter taste; Delphisine
(C31H49O7N), which is extremely poisonous; Delphinoidine (C42Hg8N207),
which is poisonous ; and Staphisagrine.
Symptoms. The seeds are stated to be emetic and purgative, and
D. Consolida is stated by Pott to be an acute narcotic poison to horses
and cattle. In general the symptoms appear to resemble those produced
by Aconitum (p. 15). There is salivation, vomiting, colic, convulsions,
and general paralysis (Miiller).
