If the fig has consumed only a small quantity it soon gets rid of
the poison by vomiting; but if the quantity is considerable there is
no vomiting and death is as rapid as with cyanide poisoning (Cornevin).

Fool's Parsley {Aethusa Cynapium, L.). Much has been written
about the toxic properties of this weed of cultivated fields, principally
because, owing to the fact that the foliage has often been mistaken or
misused for parsley and the roots for radishes ( ! ), it has been the cause
of human poisoning, though it seems to be one of the least active of the
poisonous Umbellifers. Its poisonous character is undoubted, but it
is unlikely to cause the poisoning of stock, which seem to refuse it.
Some authors regard it as strongly poisonous, but others as more or
less harmless. Johnson and Sowerby cite a case in which a child of
five years old died within an hour after eating the root, and a second
death (in Germany) within twenty-four hours from the use of the leaves
in soup.
The most complete account of this plant is that by Power and Tutin,
issued from the Wellcome Chemical Research Laboratories in 1905.
Many authors since 1807 are cited as writing of its poisonous properties,
and of cases of poisoning, two of which terminated fatally. Miller
(1807) says that " most cattle eat it, but it is said to be noxious to geese."
Bentley and Trimen write that "in all recorded experiments with it on
animals, it has had poisonous efiects." Dr. John Harley (1876 and
1880), after experiments on a child and adults, concluded that the plant
was absolutely free from the noxious properties attributed to it. In
1904, however, a case of severe poisoning by it was recorded {Brit.
Med. Jour., July 16, 1904, p. 124).
Toxic Principle. This has for many years been stated to be the
alkaloid Cynapine. For their investigation Messrs. Power and Tutin
collected the plant round London in July and August, with the fruits
still green, and after thorough chemical examination found 0-015 per
cent, of an essential oil of rather unpleasant odour; 0-8 per cent, of
resinous substances; and an exceedingly small amount of a volatile
alkaloid having the peculiar characteristic odour of Coniine. The amount
of hydrochloride of the alkaloid obtained showed that if the base were
Coniine it would correspond to only 0-00023 per cent, of Coniine in the
plant. In a degree this confirms the statement by Walz (1859) that
the fruit "contains a volatile base, very similar in odour and chemical
