CHAPTER II
RANUNCULACE^.
Traveller's Joy {Clematis Vitalba L.). The extent to which
this species is poisonous is not clear, though all parts are stated to be
poisonous, acrid and narcotic, while the juice tends to bhster the skin.
It is remarked by Cornevin that it is less poisonous in spring, when the
ass and goat browse on it to a considerable extent without serious
trouble, than later, when it cannot be eaten without danger.
Toxic Principle. Traveller's Joy appears to contain strongly
poisonous substances which have not been closely investigated.
GreshofE found a Saponin in the leaves^. The poison is dissipated
by heat.
Symptoms. When eaten in quantity the young shoots are diuretic,
violently purgative, causing dysentery, and in rare cases death.
Applied to the exterior it is irritating and even vesicatory. (Cornevin.)

Anemone (Anemone sp.). Both our native species of Anemone
appear to be more or less poisonous in character : the Wood Anemone
or Wind Flower {A. nemorosa L.), and also the Pasque Flower {A.
Pulsatilla L.). These plants, the former of which grows in woods and
damp shady spots in fields, and the latter on chalk downs and lime-
stone pastures, may on occasion be taken by stock in early spring, when
green herbage is not too plentiful, but deaths appear to be rare, even if
they have occurred. All parts of the plants contain a toxic principle,
which is volatile and destroyed by drying.
Toxic Principle. The toxic substance is stated to be Anemone-
camphor (oil of Anemone) which imparts a bitter taste to the plants,
^ Kobert states that various species of Clematis, Ranunculus, Anemone, and also
Caltha palustris and TroUius europaeus, contain Anemonal or Pul sat ilia-camphor,
which causes strong local irritation, burning and swelling in the mouth, vomiting,
intestinal inflammation, etc.
