98 Plants suspected of being Poisonous [ch. vn
Molinia caerulea, Moench. A short account by Pott shows that
when forming the principal part of moorland pasture grasses, and hence
extensively eaten, this grass causes brittleness of the bones of stock,
and in sheep chlorosis and wool eating. It also induces hfematuria,
but if free from parasitic fungi {e.g. Claviceps microcephala) and not
covered with microscopic, sharp crystals, is quite harmless if only eaten
as a secondary or incidental fodder. This grass seems to be very poor
in lime (Immendorf, 1898), and Schulze and Castoro found the internodes
of the stem to contain a considerable quantity of a pentosan (Xylan).
It is poor in nutritive constituents. The harm done is due perhaps in
part to this fact, and in part to more or less accidental or occasional
constituents (as 0-046 per cent, of lead oxide in a case of the var. altissima
near some lead works). Plants said to be occasionally similarly harmful
are J uncus sp., Nepeta Glechoma, and Hieracium Pilosella.
