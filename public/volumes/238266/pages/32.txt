GERANIACEiE.
Wood Sorrel (Oxalis Acetosella L.). Though rarely like/y to be
eaten by stock this plant must be mentioned here, as it is considered
dangerous on account of its high content of oxalates, which may cause
serious illness and diarrhoea, and in the case of sheep even be fatal. Pott
says that the milk of cows eating it is with difficulty converted into
butter.
