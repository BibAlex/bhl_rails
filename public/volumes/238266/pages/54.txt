iy] Primulaceae, Oleaceae, Convolvulaceas 49
Toxic Principle. The plant contains the glucoside Cyclamin
(C20H34OH)), and a saponin-hke substance (Pammel). Van Rijn says
it contains two glucosides.
Symptoms. The plant has an irritating effect on the intestines and
a stupefying effect on the nervous system. Cornevin states that it is
never taken by the larger domestic animals in quantity sufficient to
cause poisoning.

OLEAGE.^.
Privet (Ligustrum vulgare L.). The facts as to the poisonous
character of Privet are by no means clear, but Taylor records a case
in which three children who ate the berries were attacked by violent
purging, and a boy and girl died. Turner observed a case in which
horses died after eating Privet.
Toxic Principle. The Privet is stated to contain the poisonous
glucosides Ligustrin and Ligustron, not mentioned by Van Rijn, who
says it contains Syringin ( 017112409), while Pammel (1911) adds the
bitter glucosidal principle Syringopicrin (C26H24O17).
Symptoms. In horses Turner observed loss of power in the hind
limbs, with a pulse of 50, temperature 102Â° F., slightly injected mucous
membranes, and dilated pupils, with death in 36 to 48 hours. The
berries are stated by Miiller to cause sickness and diarrhoea.

CONVOLVULACEiE.
Bindweeds {Convolvulus sepium L. and C. arvensis L.). The
creeping rootstocks and foliage, as well as the seeds, are held to be more
or less poisonous if eaten in quantity, and as long ago as 1872 Olver
recorded {Veteritiarian, 1872) that pigs which ate freely of Convolvulus
died. These species, when eaten in considerable quantity, appear to
be cathartic and purgative, causing symptoms resembling those due to
jalap.
