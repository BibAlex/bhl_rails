131. Regulus satrapa olivaceus Baird. Western Golden-crowned Kinglet.
Knierson. — One was seen on Sept. 14, 1884, at the summit above the
Soquel can\-on among some willows.
132. Regulus calendula (/./■««.}. Ruby crowned Kinglet.
Emerson. — Common at the summit after a hard frost in October, 1884.
Kaeding.— Quite a number seen all through May: reproductive organs of
those examined were large.
133. Hylocichla ustulata oedica Oboh.
Fiske says this bird comes to Santa Cruz about April 20 and com-
mences to nest about May 25. The young in first plumage was described
by Oberholser from a specimen (No. 153944 !-'• S. Nat. Mus.) taken by me
at Santa Cruz, July 27, 1891.^ Kaeding found it common everywhere and
eggs which he took on June i were three-fourths incubated. Emerson. —
Seen several times at the summit between Sept. 12 and 20, 1884. On May
18, 1889, while going up to Bear Creek from Boulder a thrush was heard,
in notes entirely diiferent from iishdatus, and I have yet to hear anything
like its song from any thrush in California. Just at dusk on the still even-
ing air came a deep, whistling note. This may have been the Dwarf Her-
mit Thrush that W. A. Cooper has mentioned as breeding in the redwoods
of Santa Cruz county .^ Skirm. — Commenced nesting about May 15, 1884;
three or four eggs, the latter the most I have found in any one of about
one hundred and fifty nests.3 Ray.— June 11, 1895, five fresh eggs. Nest
made almost entirely of redwood bark and placed among the out-growth
of a redwood stump. Boulder Creek, Santa Cruz Co., Cal.*
134. Hylocichla aonalaschkae (G^;«<?/.). Dwarf Hermit Thrush.
Emerson. — One was seen on October 28, 1884. Kaeding.— A few seen
during the first week of May.
135. Merula migratoria propinqua 7'?/V/i,'7i'. Western Robin.
The robin is a rare winter visitant at Santa Cruz. Kaeding saw a few
early in May. Of this bird Emerson says: "vSeen in the pines at the sum-
mit fourteen miles from Santa Cruz May 18. 1889. when it was heard in
full song. I believe that it will be found nesting in these mountains."
136. Hesperocichla naevia ( 6^w<V. j. Varied Thrush.
The Oregon Robin is found at Santa Cruz some winters, there being
no regularity in its appearance. Emerson .saw one in the redwoods at the
summit on October 28, 1884. IngersoU reports it as first seen October 30,
1885.5 Cooper.— Arrives in October, leaves April i.^ Bailey found it
common at Boulder Creek in October.^
137. Sialia mexicana occidentalis (77774 7/.J.J Western Bluebird.
Emerson.— Not common on the mountains in the fall, but in May,
1889, it was seen about the oak trees, busy building and hunting for nest-
