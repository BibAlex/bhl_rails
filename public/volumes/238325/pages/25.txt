In a letter to Coues, Wm. A. Cooper writing from Santa Cruz, says of
this species: "My first specimen, taken November 3, 1878, was feeding in
company with Parns r^iifescens, Virco huttoni, Psalti ipaius minimus, and
Regulus, in willows, alders, and sycamores on the bank of a river. No\'em-
ber 14 I shot eight specimens, and could readily have obtained thrice the
number, as I saw fully a hundred feeding in a similar location. * * *
January i, 1879, I shot my last specimen, not having been out since. "s
109. Dendroica occidentalis (7<?a';/.y.). Hermit Warbler.
Fiske records taking the eggs of this warbler from a nest in black-

feeding as they moved along.
