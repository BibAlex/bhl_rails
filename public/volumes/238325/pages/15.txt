4 PACIFIC COAST AVIFAUNA [No. 2.
Study the effects of slope exposure, of prevalent fog currents, of soil, and of
relative dryness and humidity, for these are all to be observed within a
comparatively small area. It would be beyond the purpose of this outline
to enter into these problems.
As stated above, the Humid Transition is a region of luxuriant vege-
tation though the number of species of plants is not large. Within the
Santa Cruz Mountains there is one of the finest small bodies of redwood
{Sequoia sempervircns) now extant. This forest is in the Big Basin, a
region drained l)y numerous creeks. From this center the forest, else-
where more or less broken, extends through many can>ons and frequently
up some distance on the ridges, where sooner or later it is replaced by the
Douglas spruce {PseiidofsuQa mucronata).
The redwoods are thus typically found in the canyons. In this
dark still forest bird life is scarce. The boreal nature of the.se tracts is ex-
hibited by the presence of such plants as Achlys triphylla, Ahms oregana,
Azalea ocddciitalis, Cory/us rostrata califorin'ca, Goultheria shallon, Myrica
californica, Oxalis orcffaua. Rhododendron californicnm, Rubiis parviflorus,
Vaccinium parvifolimn, \ 'acriniiini oratnni, and WHiipplca niodesta. The
tan-bark oak {Qncrciis den.\i//ora ) is also found in this forest, but thrives
better upon the drier ridges with the Douglas spruce. Those forms char-
acteristic of the drier ridges, yet undoubtedly Transition, are the Douglas
spruce, tan-bark oak, madrone (Arhu/ns n/e/zz/es/ ), narrow-cone pine ( Piniis
atteniiata), mi{\v/.^x\\ii\i^ (Aretostap/ylfs i/iiinniii/aiia, A. andersoni ffa/ia),
mountain lilac (Ceaind/ii/s t/iyrsifiorns), mountain mahogany (Cercoiarpus
bctii/(rfo/ius), and on debatable land Oiincns wislizrni and Castanopsis c/iry-
sop/iy//a. Mention should also l)e made of the (lOwen cypress iCi/pressi/s
ooirniana) which is found on Ben L()mond and in other localities.
Among those forms characteristic of the Upper Sonoran zone may be
mentioned the buckeye (.7iscn/iis ca/ifornica), liigeon-berry or wild cf ffee
{ R/ianniiis ia/ifo))i/ca), chamiso ( Ado/ostonia fascinilaliivi), sage ( .ir/oi/isia
californica), and blue oak i Oiierciis dong/asi).
The Santa Cruz Mountain region appears to be the home of a num-
ber of characteristic birds which, however, range to the southward, and
perhaps somewhat the northward. These are Jiouo /ivcinalis pinosns,
C/ianura faselata i>iterniedia, Pants riifescens barloici. Typical Thryoniancs
bcivicki spilioHs is found here and in the valleys around, and such birds as
Cyanocitta stcUcri carbonacea, Zonotrichia leiicophrys iinttalli, Anorfhnra
hiemalis pacijica, Sitta pygmcea and Dryobates villosiis harrisi, though of
wider distribution give a distinct tone to the region.
