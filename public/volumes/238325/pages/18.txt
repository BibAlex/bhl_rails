tvveen the woodpeckers and a pair or two of California and Blue-fronted
Jays. The woodpeckers would go away for acorns; then in would slip a
bluejay to steal an acorn, one being left on guard. The guard would
screech when he saw the woodpecker coming and oflT the jays would fly
until another chance came for them to slip in. vSometimes a jay was
caught in the act and in the fight which followed it would lose a great
many feathers. Kaeding found it common and undoubtedly breeding.
V'lske records taking A/e/a?/erpcs caro//?ii(s at i^antii Cruz, but I consider
the record very doubtful.
37. Colaptes auratus (A/ ;/;/.). h'licker.
One taken in April, 1885, by Fiske.
38. Colaptes cafer collaris ( [7;'.). Red-shafted Flicker.
lunerson. — Common all over the ranges. vSeveral of the yellow form
were seen. Kaeding. — Very abundant. Fresh eggs were taken June i.
Skirni. — Common; after breeding it fre(iuents orchards and feeds on fruit.
A clutch of eggs is five or six, rarely seven. ^
3 ;. Phalaenoptilus nuttalli californicus /\fdou\ Dusky Poor-will.
limerson. — The lonely note of this sprite was heard in the openings
in the spring months. Kaeding. — Not common, onh^ one noted. Skirm. —
\"ery rare in this vicinity. I have seen but five individuals since I came
here. IngersoU found the eggs in 1883; they were on the bare ground;
color, pure white. ^
40. Chordeiles 5/? Xighthawk.
Kaeding. — Xighthawks were seen often but none secured. I am not
prepared to name the form upon authentic grounds; very probably it will
prove to be C. a. fexciisis.
41. Chaetura vauxi ( 7c>z<;'«.y.). Vaux vSwift.
August 30, 1891, I saw a number of swifts flying over the river near
town, which I suppo.sed to be of this variety. 3 Emerson. — Was noticed
in large numbers in September and October, always at dusk, through the
Soquel canyon. I believe they breed there. Kaeding. — For the first two
weeks in May hardly a day passed without one or two flocks of these
swifts being seen. On May 14, for about three hours, the air was full of
feeding swifts, passing due north. Ovaries and testes were undeveloped
as late as May 18. Cooper. — Arrives May 4; leaves October 5.^
42. Aeronautes melanoleucus (Baird). White-throated Swift.
Fmcrson saw this swift with C. vanxi, but in less numbers, and Kaed-
ing noted a breeding colony.
43. Calypte anna (Less.). Anna Hummer.
This species is abundant about the town of Santa Cru/.. V,ui\\ limer-
son and Kaeding record it as common.
