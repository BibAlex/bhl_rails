115. Anthus pensilvanicus (Z,a//;.). American Pipit.
This s|)ecies is connnon about Santa Cruz in fall and spring. limer-
son. --Common on the summit flats May 16, 1889.
116. Cinclus mexicanus ^e^a/y/.f. American Dipper.
Emerson. — Common all down the Soquel canyon and on Boulder and
Bear creeks. This bird is an interesting study. While under water its
body looks as if covered with silver drops, like dew on a fuzzy mullein
leaf. The bird seems to be able to cling to the rocks and to feed while
under water and I noticed that they use their wings in moving beneath
the water, as well as their feet. Their song notes are rather low, silvery
and clear and very plaintive. Kaeding. — Common along streams. May
28, on a stream a mile and a quarter long, I found two nests just com-
pleted, one nest with eggs half incubated, one nest of very small young
and one nest of young ready to fly. McGregor and Fiske. — The dip])er is
a common resident along the streams near Santa Cruz.
117. Harporhynchus redivivus ((7<:?w/?.). California Thrasher.
Emerson. — Common all through the higher ranges, more about Lonia
Prieta summit. Half fledged young were seen May 13, 1889. Kaeding. —
The most abundant (sic) bird of the region; evidently breeds late in April,
as all nests examined contained young. McGregor and Fiske. — The
thrasher is a common resident about Santa Cruz.
118. Salpinctes obsoletus (5aj/). Rock Wr^n.
Emerson. — Seen only on a bare, rocky ridge-side above Bear Creek
grade. Kaeding. — Two noted May 7.
