25. Megascops asio bendirei (/i';r7^'^/'.). California Screech Owl.
This and the following owls breed at Santa Cruz or very near there.

breeding.
26. Bubo virginianus pacificus Cassin. Pacific Horned Owl.
Emcrsrn. — Could be heard at early dusk saluting one another as they
c.ime cut of t'leir hidinj places, Too-hoo, too-hoo sounding loud and solemn
am n i^ tlie t;ill redwoods. Kaeding. — A very common breeder. Every
ni.;ht their calls cculd be heard and often at twilight as many as five or
six individuals congregated in a grove to swell the concert. Pending fur-
ther investigation and the collection of more material, I feel safe in saying
that the coast region, from Sonoma county south to San Benito County, is
inhabited by forms intermediate between sahirahis and pacificus. The
birds from Sonoma county show a decided leaning toward the dark race,
with slight increase in size, while these from the southern limit lean
toward the other extreme. I hope to have at my disposal before long ma-
terial enough to map definitely the distribution of these races in Califor-
nia. McGregor and P'iske. — Common resident in the redwoods where it
b reeds.
