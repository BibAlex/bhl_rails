have also been collected by Ingersoll.4 Emerson noticed it along the high
banks of Soquel Creek.
99. Ampelis cedrorum ( VicilL). Cedar Waxwing.
Emerson. — Has been seen around Santa Cruz. I believe that it may
breed in the mountains, as young have been taken in .Sonoma county. It
is common about Haywards every spring, feeding on the pepper berries
and in time there is no question but that it will nest near habitation as the
covmtry becomes more settled. McGregor and Fiske. — The waxwing is
an irregular fall and winter visitant about Santa Cruz. Skirm. — Large
flocks sometimes come here, but staj^ only a short time. 5
