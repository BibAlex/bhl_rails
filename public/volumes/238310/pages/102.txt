Tn.E CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 13?
every year, ten pounds of grapes are quite as much as
each vine will perfect, on an average of years.
Before making the fires, the border must be attended
to ; if it was covered in the autumn with coarse litter or
leaves, as directed, it should now have a quantity of fresh
strawy stable manure added, and well mixed with the
litter ; cover the whole border to the depth of eighteen
inches, and protect this from the cold rain and snow with
boards ; this will effectually prevent the frost from pene-
trating to the roots. The management of the vine will
be the same as directed for the cold house ; the pruning,
thinning, and training must all be done in the same man-
ner. Forcing, earlier than the first of March, is attend-
ed with much more risk of failure ; the expense and
trouble are more, and these are all increased in propor-
tion as you begin before this time^ and the amount of
fruit which a vine is able to mature is diminished iu a
similar ratio.
DIKECTIONS FOE MANAGING THE FORCING-HOUSE.
Commence forcing your house with a temperature of
40째 at night, 60째 by day ; admit air freely when the sun
shines ; upon the furnace and the flues, place pans of
water ; the vines should be kept in a horizontal position
until they are pushing strong; syringe or wet them re-
peatedly during the day, and keep the. air of the house
moist by watering the floor. After ten days, raise the
temperature to 45째 by night, 65째 by sunshine ; continue
to keep the house moist until the vines have all broken
