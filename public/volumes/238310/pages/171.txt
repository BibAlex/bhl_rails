238 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
succeed in open culture, and I have cultivated many va-
rieties which cannot be raised in England on account of
their great delicacy. The true Malaga — on account of its
exceedingly thin skin, the most difficult — I have culti-
vated to great perfection, and it was pronounced by all
who tried them, as far superior to the imported Portugal
or Malaga, as a ripe peach to a green one. Among the
foreign varieties, I rank first the Muscat of Alexandria ;
no grape can equal it in j^oint of flavor, and I have raised
them weighing 8J pounds to the bunch, and without an
imperfect grape. E"ext is the Black Hamburgh, and
then the Malaga. These three I place at the head of the
list of foreign grapes.
" Among the native varieties, the most valuable I con-
sider the Scuppernong, which cannot be cultivated at the
north. It is claimed to be a native of North Carolina.
This is a mistake. It is a Grecian grape, known there as
the Alaric^ and from which the finest wines of Greece
are made. All things considered, it is unsurpassed as a
table fruit, except by the three foreign varieties I have
named. As a wine grape, it has not its equal. It will
yield five gallons of juice to the bushel of grapes. The
fruit in Carolina is far inferior to that raised in this cli-
mate. In point of flavor, one would hardly recognize it
as the same grape. This is to be attributed mainly to
our long seasons, the fruit blooming in May, and ripening
in August and September. The bunches are small, vary-
ing from three to ten berries each, and when properly
cultivated, the grapes will average from 2^ to 3 inches
in circumference. If manured with vegetable matter,
they have but little, if any, pulp. If with bones, or
