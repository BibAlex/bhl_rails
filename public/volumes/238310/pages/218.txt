THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 317
T" Muscat Fleur d^ Orange. — This grape came from
the French gardeners, who spoke of it as the best of all
Muscats. So far as the first year's trial is any evidence,
it is hardly worth cultivation. The berries are oval,
with a little musky flavor ; skin less thick than the Mas-
cat of Alexandria, color the same. It cracks a good
deal, and seems to partake of the character of the
Musque Chasselas. This fruited in 1852, in the collec-
tion of Mr. Porter, who furnished me with the above
descriptions.
Bronze Grajpe. — This name is given to a fruit seen and
eaten in Syria by J. Y. C. Smith, M.D., of Boston, who
saved the seed and brought them to this country^, pre-
senting them to the Massachusetts Horticultural Society
for distribution. I raised several vines from the seed
coming to me. Having compared the foliage with the
Syrian, Muscat of Alexandria, and Queen of Nice, kinds
which I thought it most probable to be, find it quite un-
like either of them, and the chances are in favor of ob-
taining a new and valuable variety.
^Musqui Verdel. — ^This is a seedling of my own, a
cross, naturally, of Verdelho and Grizzly Frontignan, and
partakes of the marked peculiarities of these grapes,
being musque-flavored, and having the thin, rich pulp of
the Yerdelho. Thus far, the berry has been rather
small, under size, but as it yearly improves, hope it may
prove valuable.
Seedlings.— 1 have maay seedlings not named, that
have fruited the past years of 1850, to 1852, inclusive.
They resemble the White Chasselas and Black Ham-
burgh, generally; one, from seed of Wilmot's Black
