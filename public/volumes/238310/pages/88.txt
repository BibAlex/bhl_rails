THE CULTUKE OF THE GRAPE. 121
kept at as low a temperature, night and day, as tlie safe-
ty of the plants will admit ; the treatment should be the
same for the season, except the covering of them with
mats, which would be unnecessary.
Third Tear.
The third season, air the house, as directed the last
year ; uncover the vines from the first to the middle of
April, as the spring m.ay be mild or cool ; keep them in
their horizontal position, until the eyes have all pushed ;
have a moist atmosphere, by sprinkling the vines and
the floor several times every day. About the tw^entieth
of April, or the first of May, they will have pushed their
buds so as to be all ready to be put to the rods, or trellis.
During the season, give air freely when the sun shines ;
shut up the windows towards night, as the sun recedes
from the house. The mercury should not rise above
seventy-five, until the blossom is over ; after that has
passed, eight}^ or ninety, at midday, will do no harm ;
occasionally, wet the fioor of the house -in the afternoon;
the inside border must be watered as often as the roots
of the vine require ; continue this treatment for the- sea-
son. As the grapes begin to color, be cautious in
watering, and, after they are fully colored, do not give
water at all until the grapes are all cut, leaving open
in the autumn, the insects, (if any,) when the leaves drop, are, by these
means, conveyed to the plants again. In the treatment of the vine thus
situated, the rules for pruning, thinning, &c., must be followed. As re-
gards temperature, etc., they must be subject to the treatment given to the
plants, so long as the plants are in the house. It will be the better plan to
keep the vines from pushing, as long as possible, in spring, by having as
low a temperature as the plants will thrive in.
