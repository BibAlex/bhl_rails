THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 205
but the main vine stems and supporting posts." He
adds : " but I now consider twenty feet too near, for tlie
Scuppernongs, thirty or forty being better, unless it is in-
tended to remove every other one, before they become
too large." He saves all the leaves of the vines, and
digs them into the vineyard, for manure. Mr. Weller
considers this as the true American system of training
the vine. The principle of allowing the vine to spread
and range freely, during summer, is, undoubtedly, cor-
rect, as applied to the American species, and it is what I
have recommended for many years. But the system of
training up the vine by posts, and then spreading them
on flat frame-work, six or eight feet high from the earth,
is as much a European plan as the training them to
sticks, &c. I have seen many vineyards thus trained, in
Italy, and other countries."^
In speaking of the great size of the vine, he says : '' I
measured to-day, a Scuppernong, fourteen years old from
planting, and it covers an area whose diameter is fifty
feet. Another runs thirty feet on scaffolding, and then
ascends an aspen tree, spreading over its branches to the
height of about forty feet ; the tree full of grapes. A
vine in the lower part of this state, near the Scupper-
nong Island, in the Koanoke, whence this grape and its
name originated, joroduces its annual yield of five bar-
rels of wine, I am most credibly informed.
* " The vineyards are much more beautiful than the Grerraan fields of
stakes. The vines grow over a frame, higher tlian the head, supported,
through the whole field, on stone pillars. They interlace and form a com-
plete leafy screen, while the clusters hang below." â€” Page 237. This was
