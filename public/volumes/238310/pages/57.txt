which I have used, in my grape borders, and recommend
as a substitute for the carcasses of animals, or bones,)
consists mainly of the intestines, with the manures which
were in the animals at the time they were killed, all the
heads, horns, and feet of sheep, and a good share of
bones, and other refuse of other animals. The half of
the bulk and weight of the manures has been the heads,
the lower half of the legs, and other bones, with some

"Now all these articles are very powerful manures, and
very lasting in their nature, and should not be placed in
the border until decomposed in some measure, or, which
is better, put at the bottom of the border, where the
roots of the vine will find them the second or third year.
A large part of the fleshy matter, in its decomposition,
turns to a liquid, and the soil near by imbibes this, and
is enriched thereby. These substances, when in this
state of decomposition, if they come in contact with the
roots of the vine, will instantly destroy the part touched,
and this is why I place it at the bottom of the border, to
be there for the future use of the vine, and out of the
way of doing mischief. If this material is to be used as
a top dressing, it should remain in the compost heap till
it is entirely decomposed. I consider it, wdien placed as
directed, at the bottom of the border, a most valuable
material for the nourishm.ent of the grape vine ; but, if

more valuable, but because the slaughter-house manure
