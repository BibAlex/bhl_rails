THE CULTUEE OF THE GRAPE. 519
Catawba, — ^This grape is said, by Mr. Adlum, to be
a native of Maryland. It is one of the hardiest and most
productive of the American varieties. The berries are
red, or purple, inclining to black. These two varieties
are now so extensively cultivated, and their good qualities
as table fruit and for wine are so well established, that it
is unnecessary to say more of them. It also has the foxy
flavor, and requires a longer season than the Isabella.
Bland. — This is one of the best native grapes. It has
less of the foxy flavor than the Isabella and Catawba ; it
is not a great bearer, and will not ripen \xs. Massachusetts.
Dia'iia. — A seedling raised in Massachusetts from the
Catawba. It resembles its parent, and is ten days earlier,
and will ripen in seasons when the Isabella and Catawba,
similarly situated, will not; a strong recommendation in
its favor.
JElsingburgJi. — A good flavored, very small grape.
This is valued by many for the table ; it is free from the
foxy flavor.
Lenoir. — A very excellent table grape ; perhaps supe-
rior to any of those described. It is believed to be a
seedling of the Burgundy grape. It has very much the
habit of a foreign vine. The bunches are very handsome,
large, compact, and not much shouldered." — Downing' s
Fruits and Fruit Trees of America. This grape is not
known much in Massachusetts.
Nortonh Virginia. — Yitis Wortoni.^ Prince^ (small.
A native of Richmond, Virginia ; said to be a cross be-
tween the Bland and Miller's Burgundy ; it was raised
by Dr. IST. Norton. Mr. Downing says it is very produc-
tive in the garden, or vineyard, es23ecially at the south.
