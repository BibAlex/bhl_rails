292 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
covered with gravel. To notice the difference in the fruit-
ing and growing of the vines, when situated in this un-
prepared soil, as compared with the compost above, I
planted four vines, so situated that three of them w^ould
send their roots into the street in search of food. The
difference has been surprising. The vines planted in the
border have ripened three good crops of fruit ; those in
the natural soil have not ripened a bunch, and, until this
year, have not even set a berry. One vine, a Hamburgh,
has, at present, a very small bunch upon it. The vines
have been pruned and well cared for, and I have no rea-
son to suppose that they will not eventually yield a crop
of fair fruit ; that they will be able to bear comparison
with the other grapes, in the same house, I do not expect.
In 1844, having occasion to make more border, and
having a large quantity of stable manure and old leaves,
which had been used for covering the roots of the vines
in winter, I thought this, if added to the soil in large
quantities, which was also a good loam, with some small
quantity of cow manure and bones, would insure me a
sufficiently good compost. But it was a mistake; the
vines grew slowly, and not more than half of them fruited
the last season. This spring, I have enlarged the border
very much, and added strong manure, with many whole
bones and twenty bushels of ground ones, with one
hundred bushels of charcoal screenings, and as much
more old mortar and brickbats, with some consider-
able wood-ashes mixed with them. The vines are now
growing very well, and many, but not all of them, have
good crops of fruit upon them. The fruit in this house
was small and well colored. In the autumn, watering
