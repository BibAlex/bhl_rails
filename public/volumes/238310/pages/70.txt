THE CULTURE OP THE GRAPE. 97
make due allowance for clifFerence of climate, if it is in-
tended to follow out his plan entirely. For instance, he
states that it has formerly been the practice to put out
the fires in June in the grapery, even if the grapes were
not ripe, and attributes to this cause some of the evils to
which this fruit is subject under glass, and disapproves
of this management, and goes on to say that the fires
must be kept up until the fruit is ripe. It would be ab-
surd, in this climate, to follow, literally, this advice ;
sometimes in May, and frequently in June, we have very
warm weather, the mercury rising to 80°, and sometimes
to 90° in the open air ; at these times, the heat of the
grapery cannot be kept -under 100° while the sun is
shining upon the house, and any heat in the flue, or
boiler and pipes, v/ould increase the difficulty. The fact
is, such advice will not do ; you must regulate the heat
by the thermometer, and, in warm weather, at this sea-
son of the year, make, or omit to make, the fires, as the
temperature of the external air may be.
Mr. Roberts says, " tliat shanking and shrivelling have
been discarded by his plan of keeping the roots of the
vine in a somewhat corresponding temperature with that
to which the top is exposed." It has occurred to me,
that the great excitement given to the roots of the vine,
by the manure heaped upon them, and consequent vigor
of tlie vine, may have been the cause of the fruit not
shanking or shrivelling.
Mr. Roberts's idea may be the correct one, and yet
shanking and shrivelling be avoided without using this
method. If it is true, as Mr. R. states, that this diffi-
culty is caused by too low a temperature at the roots of
