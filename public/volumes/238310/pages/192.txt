manures acquire the high value wliicli belongs to them, â€”
a just remark, not only in relation to the manure above
named, but to all the substances usually classed under
this head, such as the ofFal of all animals and birds, the
decayed matter from flesh or flsh, whether of the soft
material which dissolves, or of the bony substances which
are a long time in crumbling away, guano, poudrette,
&c.
Dr. Lindley refers to the plants in a greenhouse, that
were almost destroyed by the gases arising from the pu-
trefying body of a hedgehog, and thinks that is proof
that the vines were injured at the ends of their shoots
by the gas from the carrion. It may have been caused
by the confined air inside of this house, w^hich prevented
the escape of this gas. I must confess, that I think there
may have been some other cause, that affected the plants,
and produced the disease. In the newly settled parts of
our country, it is customary to leave the dead bodies of
animals unburied. I have never noticed any effect pro-
duced upon the foliage of tree or herb from the odor or
gas arising therefrom. In the valley of the Connecticut,
where reside some of our best agriculturists, they ma-
nure the land with fresh white fish, that are caught in
great quantities, (I believe in the spring season of the
year.) The}^ spread them broadcast over the fields, and
any one who has ridden through this district, about tliis
time of application, can most assuredly say that the cus-
tom "is not inviting," and can bear ample testimony
that the air is charged with gas from putrefying matter,
yet we hear of no bad effect from this ; and, if a single
hedgehog in a greenhouse would kill plants, it would aj)-
