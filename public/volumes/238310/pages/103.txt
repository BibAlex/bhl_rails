138 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
well, and have been put up to the trellis, Vv^hen you can
lessen gradually the watering ; let the pans of water, on
the furnace and flue, be constantly filled while the grapes
are growing ; after they begin to color, lessen the num-
ber of pans of water gradually, ajid the moisture of the
house, and ripen off the fruit in a dry atmosphere.
Vines do not appear to be seriously injured by bleed-
ing, however severe this may be. The only effect from
it, which I have been able to discover, is a tendency to
retard the pushing of the buds, and, on long canes or
spurs, the causing of the last eye to be blind. It cannot
be of any advantage to the vine, that is certain, and it
should be guarded against by early pruning.
In the Gardeners' Chronicle for 1846, page Y71, there
IS an account of vines which had been winter-forced, and
which had ripened g. crop of fruit ; as it was intended to
remove the vines, the causing them to bear a second

ly pruned the first of May ; the}^ bled excessively ; not-
withstanding this, the buds broke well, and ripened the
fruit in October. The wood, also, was well ripened,
round, and firm, with full eyes, and, so well did it ap-
pear, that the idea of throwing away the vines was
abandoned. They had previously been troublesome from
over-luxuriance.
In ten days more, raise the temperature to 50° or 55°
at night, and by day, when cloudy, to 65°, or, when the
sun shines, to 75°. This temperature should be gradual-
ly raised at night until the grapes are in bloom, when
the heat should be as equal as possible, 70° at night, 75'^'
or 80° by day, when the sun shines. Do not let the
