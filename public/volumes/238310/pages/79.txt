108 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.

and we never had a shi'i veiled grape during tlie three
years I was there ; and these grapes have never failed
taking the first prize for the best flavored bunch at the
Jedburgh Horticultural Society, for many years pa^t ;
and there are vineries in this neighborhood that have
borders not above three feet deep, upon a gravelly bot-
tom, which have not been renewed this fifty years, that
have had abundance of shrivelled grapes in tbeni every
year lately. I think the foregoing remarks prove that it

damp, stagnant air is very much if not altogether, the

culation of air in the house, they will, shrivel, and, if the
weather be wet or cloudy, they will not do vv^ith high
forcing. I am certain, from experience, that W. H. is
j)erfectly correct as to the air, and keeping a dry atmo-

says, will prevent all shanking.
Yol. 17, pages 47 and 48, J. W. B. says, want of food
is the sole cause, and " this deficiency of nutriment
might arise from various causes, but, undoubtedly, the
principal one is a bad border ; under which head, I in-
clude not only poor hungry soils, that are incapable of
supporting a plant in vigor, but those deep and narrow
pits of rich earth in which vines are generally planted,
