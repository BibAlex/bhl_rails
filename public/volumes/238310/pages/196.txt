THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 289
with the exception of carrion, and this only, as such, and
not to the use of it, as I have recommended, in the for-
mation of the border. In the hist article written bj him,
on the subject, he sajs, " we readily admit, that, after a
time, the dead horses in the vine borders at Eshton,
ceasing to be dangerous, will become a potent and harm-
less manure." By the authorities quoted, and the ap-
proval of other systems of border compost, which con-

Europe, do not diiTer widely from me, in the opinion I
have formed, and in the practice which I have carried
out and recommended to the public.
It must be apparent to a thoughtful reader, that, when
I propose a substitute, to take the place of a soil so un-
suitable as to require removal from the place where the
border is to be situated, that the compost named for the
purpose must be, in my opinion, in every respect, suited
for the welfare of the vines. Mr. Hovey, in his sweep-
ing remarks, relative to rich borders, refers to myself,
as recommending the use of " the carcasses of animals,
to such an extent as to cover the bottom of the border,
if tbey could be obtained." His statement is correct ;

the decomposed flesh, etc., and their cheapness. In the
fall of the year, near large cities, it is frequently easy to
procure the bodies of horses, either dead or living, for a
