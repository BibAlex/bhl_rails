and be growing in the under part of the manure ; if so,
these must not be injured, for, if they should, the benefit
expected from the operation would be lost ; when it is
found that this is the case, that part of the manure must
remain on. After removing the manure, the border
should have a top dressing of three or four inches of
well decomposed cow or hog-pen manure.
PLANTING THE VINES.
In planting, which is the next operation, open a hole
sufficiently wide to admit the roots being spread out to
their entire length ; care must be taken to spread out all
the roots separately, without injury to the small ones,
and do not let them overlay or interfere with each other ;
make the soil fine, and cover them with an inch or two
of it ; with a rose watering-pot, settle the soil and roots,
by giving them a thorough watering ; finish covering,
and do not water them again.* They should be planted
^ I recommend the planting of vines for the crop of fruit on the back

the peach ; the fig does well thus situated. When the house is strongly
and early forced, peaches and cherries do not succeed; the fruit of the
latter, if it was sure, would be desirable, but it requires more air in setting
than is good for the grapes.

I am wilhng to admit, that vines do as well, thus planted, when as it is
said, they are " well managed," but they requhe more care in watering,
etc. I am not willing to allow that they do better, and never would advise
the rafter vuies to be thus placed, unless they can roam at pleasure in the
