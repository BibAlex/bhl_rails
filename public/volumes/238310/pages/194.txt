THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 287
ably so ; they were all represented as having been beau-
tiful. Mr. Gower's, though his Hamburgh bunches were
large, were rather deficient in color, â€” a want that, in my
estimation, would make them unworthy to compete with
the first-named. To have a correct idea of this matter,
there should be some standard of quality to refer to. I
do not remember ever to have met with any such. My
opinion of the characteristics requisite to form a fine
bunch of grapes, is, that the bunch be of medium bigness,
"vith the berries large, of an equal size, well colored^ and
covered with a fine bloom. Yery large bunches are not
always so equally well flavored as lesser ones, and those
weighing from eight ounces to one pound each, are almost
always the best. When exhibited at horticultural shows
however, large sized, if at the same time these be well
colored, will invariably be considered the best.
The border that produced the grapes, which Dr. Lind-
ley considers superior to those raised by Mr. Roberts, is
a very fine one, and not very unlike the compost recom-
mended by me, to be used in a situation where it is ne-
cessary to remove all the original soil ; but, in this border,
they use liquid manure ; and this is universally the case,
when the border is composed of turf, without a large ad-
dition of bones or other manures. This application of
an offensive liquid upon the surface of the soil is, in my
estimation, more disagreeable than in burying it ; and
when the rich border is properly made, rainwater is the
only application requisite for the roots on the outside of
the house. On the other hand, the border composed of
loam and rotten sods, although excellent, requires this
