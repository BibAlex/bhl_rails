822 THE^ CULTUKE OF THE GRAPE.
Shurtleff'^s Seedling. â€” ^Tlie description of this grape is
in the words of Dr. Shurtleff, who furnished the account,
at my request, for^ this purpose. A gentleman who
fruited this last year, represented it as being very good.
" It came up in my garden in Brookline, in 183T. The
plant was of a delicate and slow growth ; it fruited on the
fourth year, and,. on the fifth, it bore about fonr quarts of
grapes of sujDcrior flavor ; and the berry was of a good
size, perfectly round, about the size of a Muscadine; the
bunches of moderate bigness, and well set {unlike the wild
fox grape) ; the stem pressed out like the Isabella ; the
color black, with a peculiar ray, like the spokes of a wheel,
running from the stem to the eye of a lighter shade, the
whole grape covered with a bloom ; it puts out two or
three weeks later than the Isabella, and ripens two or
three weeks earlier. The vine is a small grower, and
lives with me without protection ; it is situated on a
southeast angle of my house. The third year of bearing,
it was, unfortunately, split near the ground, and the pros-
pect of a good crop blasted. I have several young vines
which will probably bear this year. The fruit is free from
any foxy taste or ' pulp. I think it far superior to any
native grape that I have seen. I do not know from what
seed it originated, whether from native or imported ; it
tion where the sun would strike it fair; the south side of a building would
be'preferable, and, if the soil is rich, I think it will do as well without ma-
nure as with it. I beheve the dryer the soil, the sweeter will be the fruit.
" A vine which was cultivated from a plant from my garden, four years
ago, bore profusely last season, and flourishes beyond calculation ; it is
placed on the south side of a house, and forms an arbor to the entrance of
two tenements.
"In great haste, dear sir, I beheve I have answered your mquiries,
