THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 105
medium tlian the branches, the supply of sap is consum-
ed quicker than the roots can furnish it, and. this brings
on the disease. Dr. Lindley, every one must allow, is
very high authority ; still I doubt this being the cause ot
the blacking of the footstalks, which is the disease that I
particularly wish to refer to. I have the management of
three houses in which grapes are grown. One, I begin
forcing the first of January, one, the first of February,
and one, the first of March. The first house ripens its
fruit in May, the second in June, and the third in July.
In the first and second, there shall be no shrivelled ber-
ries, in the third, if the weather is cloudy, there shall be
a great many. The covering is taken ofiT the borders
about the beginning of April, and, if the coldness of the
borders was the cause, I should suppose that those which
ripened in May and June would be more subject to the
disease than the July one, for the earth undoubtedly
gets warmer as the summer advances. I have been a
grape-grower for more than twenty years, and, during
that time, the disease has particularly engaged my at-
tention, as I have always been more or less subject to it,
and I am fully convinced that it is caused by the borders
being made too rich and stimulating, and by a deficiency
of light. My borders are all prepared in the same way,
and of the richest materials, and the one that I com-
mence forcing in March produces foliage of the most
luxuriant description ; those large leaves require more
light to elaborate the sap than smaller ones, and, if light
is deficient, the sap is not properly prepared for the
healthy nourishment of the fruit, and this brings on the
disease. I have known vineries where borders have
