262 THE CULTURE OF THE GEAPE.
last week, he states liis conviction that this sort of ma-
nnre is of the lirst degree of importance. After men-
tioning that, in his new vine borders, not one horse car-
cass, nor a portion of one, is buried, he expresses his
regret that, at the time he made them, it was not in his
power to avail himself of that ' j^abnlum to produce the
nectar of Bacchus.' ' But,' he adds, ' if I was not able
to add carrion, except in a very limited degree, at the
time my borders were made, I may mention that I fell
in with a goodly lot last winter, part of which has been
added as a top-dressing this autumn, and I intend in
future to apply it to that purpose. I am so cautious
that the least particle should not be wasted, that I hoard
it up as a miser would his gold.'
" This is perfectly consistent with the directions which
Mr. Roberts has given in his treatise."
[For these, see Mr. Eoberts's border ; it is unnecessary
to repeat them here.]
" It cannot be denied that this is a process which must
not be called inviting. Has it any disadvantages ? Has
it any advantages ? These are both very important
branches of inquiry. It may be alleged that it can have
no disadvantages, because the magnificent grapes, above
referred to, were obtained by it. But we are ignorant of
the history of those vines since 1841, and this point it
would be desirable to have elucidated. In tlie next
p>lace, it appears to us that the introduction, into vine
borders, of pasty masses of matter, such as result from
the use of carrion, is at variance with the first principles
of vine cultivation, the truth of which was known even
to the Komans.
