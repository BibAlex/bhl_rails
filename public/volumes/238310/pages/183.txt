262 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
being at the bottom is the very reason why I place them
there. He thinks it will draw the roots from the in-
fluence of the sun and air. I think it will prevent them
from going so deep as to be out of this influence ; and at
a medium depth, they will be less exposed to the changes
of the weather, and enjoy a more equal temperature, as
well as be less liable to suffer from drought.
Mr. Hovey covers his border, after planting, with a
little coarse manure, and, if the weather prove dry, he
waters the border.
In April, before the manure, which was put on to pro-
tect the roots, was dug in, ten or fifteen pounds of guano
was spread over it.
In June, the border was mulched with coarse manure
and watered. The 30th of June, after refreshing rains,
which had washed this manure, and soaked its juices
down amongst the roots of the vine, the " grapes swelled
their berries very fast," showing conclusively the benefit
of the manure. All Mr. Hovey 's statements go to prove
the value of a rich border. His border, it is true, has no
beast, in its original form, therein, but it is composed of
the top soil (the cream) of an old pasture, stable manure,
and ground bones, (this last material, I think, should
come under the head of quackery^ particularly as, in the
ground matter, much of it comes immediately into ac-

The soil was new, and was well manured with substances
in which it is well known the grape will flourish, and the
vines were not planted near together ; they were in a fine
house and undoubtedly judiciously treated ; and, if the
