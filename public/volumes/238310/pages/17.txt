xii HISTORY OF THE GRAPE VIFE.
high estimation. The generally-received opinion of the
manner of its introduction into Europe is, that it made
gradual approaches by the way of the Mediterranean
Sea, the Phoenicians first carrying it into the . islands
there, from whence it spread into Italy, Spain, France,
and Portugal, and thence north through France, Switzer-
land, England, &c., &c. ; from all these countries we
have received, in the United States, our varieties of this
species. It lives to a great age, and forms wood capa-
ble of being serviceable in the arts. The cultivation of
the grape, in its northern extent, is not confined to a
certain parallel of latitude. It has been observed in
Europe, that, as you go east, the cultivation of this plant
extends to the north. Arthur Young says, that, in
France, the difference is 2Â° of heat in the same parallel.
In the United States of America, the difference of cli-
mate is also found, but operating in a reversed manner.
In the same latitude, as we go west, is found a milder
climate, particularly after passing the Alleghanies, and,
on the Pacific, it is yet more mild. At Fort Yancouver,
which, is five degrees north of Kew York, the tempera-
ture is so mild that, in winter, the mercury falls but a
few times below freezing.
