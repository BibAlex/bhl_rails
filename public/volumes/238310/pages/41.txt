42 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
POLMAISE SYSTEM ATTACHED TO A FUKNACS ALKEAD-S
CONSTRUCTED.
1 have had attached to a farnace ah-eady constructed,
(and that has been some time in use,) of dimensions
similar to the one described, a system of circulation of
the air which has proved very successful. It is very sim-
ple. The furnace has been enclosed, on the three sides
within the house, with brick work, leaving two or three
inches of space only for the hot-air chamber on all sides,
and this brick enclosure is continued along the sides of
the flue, (where the heat is great,) for about ten feet.
The whole of this brick work is then covered with stones,
placed tv70 inches above the furnace, and the heat is led
into any part of the house by a brick flue, covered on
the top with stones and closed at the ends, with two
openings near the extremity for the hot air to flow out
on each side. An opening is left, about three inches
square, on the level of the floor on each side in the brick
work that surrounds the furnace, close to the back wall
of the house, to admit the cold air, which commences to
rush in as soon as the furnace and flue become warmed ;
and this circulation continues for hours after the fire has
burnt out, the brick work retaining the heat a great
length of time. The cost of this apparatus was about
twenty-five dollars additional.
