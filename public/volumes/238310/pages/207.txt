302 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
to eacli other; and it frequently happens, as with our
orchard fruits, that the same kind is known under differ-
ent names in different districts." — Horticultural Tour^
Edinourgli.
The following list^'" contains the new varieties, with the
valuable older ones recently brought to notice, part of
which have not yet been j)roved in this country : —
T Black HamhurgJi. — The bunches are large and
shouldered, the berries black and roundish ; it is un-
necessary to say more, as it is universally known to be
the best variety for general cultivation under glass.
^ JEschouata Micscat. — This is a seedling of the Mus-
cat of Alexandria. This variety, which Mr. Thompson
makes a synonyme of the Muscat of Alexandria, was
shown at the exhibition of the London Horticultural So-
ciety, September, 1817. Although distinct, it is said to
resemble that variety ; the berries have a pink tinge.
The Esperione is supposed to have been one of its parents.
This grape was brought into notice by Mr. Money. It
keeps well.
^ CJiasselas MusquS. ■ White. — Cracks badly ; but,
when grown in a part of the grapery where there is a
free circulation of air, it does well in usual seasons. At
Enghien, seat of the Due d'Aremberg, " we found the
Chasselas Musque trained along the front of the house
possessed by the chamberlain, and we were told that, be-
fore the end of October, the grapes seldom fail to ripen
fully, and to acquire their musky flavor." — Hort. Tour^
Edinburgh, 1823.
* The grapes marked with a % have been proved in this country to be
true to the description.
