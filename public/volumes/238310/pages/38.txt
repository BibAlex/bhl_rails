THE CULTUEE OF THE GRAPE. 87
which should be set in the masonry in building. The
grate endures the heat from the anthracite coal better if
cast in separate pieces, half an inch thick, and two and
a-half inches deep, with two spaces of about an inch in
length, at proper distances from the ends, vv^here the
thickness is three-fourths of an inch, the ends, also, being
of this size. The sides of the fire-place must be built of
fire brick ; the top must be covered, also, w^ith tile, or
brick of this material, if coal is to be used. The tile on
the top should be covered with one or more courses of
brick. My furnaces have five or six, to retain and pre-
vent too great escape of the heat. In the cut, the top of
the fih'nace is represented as arched ; this is not neces-
sary, but it may slope from the front to the back, where
it enters the flue, three or four inches, with benefit to the
draft.. At the further end of the furnace, the liue shoidd
commence, and should have a risino; of certainlv tvv^o or
three feet from the grate, to insure a good draft ; the flue
should run to the front of the house, and thence along
this, at the distance of twelve inches from the wall. This
flue should be of brick, carefully made, to prevent the
escape of smoke or gas ; it may be eight to ten inches
square on the outside, or it may be fourteen inches wide,
and eight inches deep, and covered Avith tiles ; either
answers perfectly well. If the house is a very small
one, — less than twenty feet, — the flue may return on the
back of the house, and the smoke be carried off by the
chimney near the furnace. If the house is over twenty
feet in length, the better w^ay will be to continue it around
the end to the back wall, and up by a chimney out of
the roof, as represented in the cut of the lean-to house.
