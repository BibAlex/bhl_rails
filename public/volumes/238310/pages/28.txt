THE CULTURE OF THE GRiiPE. 25
The account of the cost of two houses, built by other
gentlemen, that are so very unlike mine in their dimen-
sions, has been added, as they may be the means of af
fording the information wanted, in some instances.
The following is a description of the plan and the
manner of building of the span-roofed grapery, which is
represented in the drawing as in full fruit, in September.*
This is not heated by artificial means, and is what is usu-
ally called a cold house.
After the border was prepared, the stone posts were
placed upright, the bottojns of tliem being three to four
feet deep in the soil, and eight feet apart. Holes are
drilled about one and a half inches in the sides of these
stones, to whicli the sills are secured by pieces of iron,
with the head flattened so as to be nailed to the timber,
and the end bent to hook into the hole ; the posts should
not be less than six inches square. (Wooden posts, or
brick piers, may be substituted for the stone ; the former
will soon decay, and, if the latter are used, they should
be eight by twelve inches ; the stones are best.) The di-
mensions of this house are as follows : twenty-two feet
wide ; fourteen and one half feet high, on the inside, at
the ridge-pole ; and a little short of eighty feet in length.
On the posts are placed the sills, (as above described,)
which are six or eight inches above the top of the
* See frontispiece. Tlie view v/as taken from the northAvest door, and
just within the graperj-, as the object was simply to give an idea of tho
house, and the arrangement of the vines. No attention was paid to the
proportions. Tliis house is now used as a retarding one, and has a furnace
and boiler, with pipes for circulating hot water, which are used in October,
November, and December, to ripen and preserve the grapes.
