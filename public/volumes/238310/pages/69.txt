96 THE CULTURE OF THE GEAPE.
fill juices of the manure, wliicli, after a heavy rain,
soaked down to them. A second and third set were
planted and killed also, and it was only by removing the
manure that I was able to make vines grow there.
The plan has been abandoned by me as unsuitable for,
and unnecessary in, this country. In some situations,
where the ground is very cold and wet, and it is particu-
larly desired to grow grapes without regard to the ex-
pense, then it may be found advantageous.
The disbudding of the cane is not advisable ; in En-
gland, it may be serviceable on account of admitting
light into the grapery ; by Mr. Eoberts's plan, a vine is
never to have but twenty-one or twenty-three spurs. I
])refer to have forty spurs, and, if the fruit is cut away
from half of them, so much the better, for they can then
be fruited alternately.
It will be noticed, that it is recommended never to give
air in the middle stages of forcing until the thermometer
attains eighty degrees ; this is not my practice. In our
climate, I would much prefer to give air gradually by
opening the lights, or ventilators, a little, as soon as the
mercury begins to rise from the influence of the sun's
rays, and give more air as the day advances, having the
greatest heat from 10 o'clock, A.M., to 2 o'clock, P.M. ;
the same rule to regulate the closing of the wdndpws in
the after part of the day.
llie general remarks, as regards the heat from artificial
means and the temperature of the house by night and
day, are perfectly correct, and the advice given as to
forcing, and the care requisite to prevent a check, are
well worthy careful attention. It will be necessary to
