THE CULTURE OF THE GKAPE. 21
ern one will enable the cultivator to produce the most de-
licious grapes." I have houses fronting northeast and
southwest, (of course, with such as^^ect, the houses are
glass on all sides,) east and west, southeast and northwest,
and the other intervening points of the compass. I have
carefully noted the effect of the different positions, and
can, in the strongest language, recommend the aspect of
south, inclining a little to east, as the best. Southeast is
the next best ; and east-southeast is preferable to south-
west. The front of a house exposed to the west winds
(which are our coldest in winter and spring,) is liable to a
very low temperature till the sun suddenly shines upon
it, and then comes a sudden and rapid accumulation of
heat, very prejudicial to the welfare of the vines. I do
not wish to be understood as saying that grapes cannot be
grown in any but just such a position ; I know that they
can be ; but the care requisite, and the chances of failure,
are greater in ratio as the house in its aspect deviates
from the best position. These remarks apply particularly
to the northern states ; in the middle and southern, it may
be advantageous to avoid the great heat of the sun, if it
is intended to grow grapes under glass, and that in such
a position the best aspect for the front of the grapery may
be west-northwest.
THE HOUSE.
The common lean-to house is the best for forcing ; from
thirteen to fifteen feet high on the back, fom' feet on the
front, and twelve feet wide on the inside, are suitable pro-
