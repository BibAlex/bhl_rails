98 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
tlie vine, as compared with that in which the tops are
situated, may not this be avoided by having a lower tem-
perature in the grapery, particuharly in the night? I
have, for many years, thought that this evil w^as often
caused by too great heat, followed by too low a temper-
ature. I can, at any time, cause these troubles in the
forcing-house to appear, but am not always able to avoid
them. A grapery without artificial heat is more subject
to shanking than the forcing-house, notwithstanding the
temperature of the earth, at the season of the year when
such a house is liable to the attacks of this disease, is
much higher, and the roots of the vine are enjoying a
temperature relatively to the tops almost correspondent
with vines in open culture.
I have observed that, in a house where there was no
means of warming it by fires, the crop of fruit has suf-
fered most when, after a continuance of hot, bright, and
dry weather, in August, or early in September, we have
had a succession of cold, dark, and rainy days. In this
case, the cause is, apparently, too low a temperature at
the top of the plant, causing stagnation of the sap. A
brisk heat from a fine, or any other artificial means that
will give a free circulation to the air throughout the
house, and raise it to a temperature near which it has
been during the hot weather, will prevent its spread.
The cold rain will have reduced the temperature at the
roots of the vine, but in a much less degree than that to
which the tops have been exposed, so that now the tops
are relatively to the roots in a proportionately cooler at-
mosphere than during the hot weather. It does Hot ap-
