is planting without a particle of soil. I have never at-
tempted to grow vines after this plan, and most surely
shall not ; still, it is to be presumed, occasionally, a plant
may succeed. Where the soil is very wet, the plan,
wit/i the addition of one half of good loam to the com-
post, doubtless would do well. In the damp climate of
England, this compost would probably retain sufficient
moisture, and never become dry, as Mr. Hoare says ;
but, in the severe droughts of the United States, in most
situations, the plants would die.
In prejDaring a suitable soil for fruit trees in general,
De la Quintiney says : " The best earth for this use is a
sort of rich sandy loam, which may be taken from near
the surface of some rich pasture ground, where cattle
have been fed or fothered, or of some rich' sheep-walk,
where there is a depth of earth, and if it is mixed with
a little old mellow earth, or the like, it may do well ; or
cow or horse dung may likewise do well, if it is quite
rotten, so as to be like earth ; but of this a small quanti-
ty, as one part in four or five, and thoroughly rotted."

New earths he also recommends as suitable for trees,
&c. ; these he defines as being " such as have never
served for the nourishment of any plant, or else have
been a long time built upon, &c. ; likewise, earth frum
some rich pasture-ground, of a sandy, loamy nature,
where cattle have been a long time fed, is of excellent
use for most sorts of plants ; especially if it has been
thrown up in heaps to meliorate, and has taken the win-
ter frosts, it will be so much the better." p. 17.
