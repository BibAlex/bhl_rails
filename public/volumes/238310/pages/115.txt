154 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
under part of the leaf next to tlie one last eaten ; it is
usually of the same color as the leaf, and, unless you
observe carefully, it will escape you.
The thrips, small white insects that infest the under
side of the leaves, are not so injurious as would seem by
the spotted appearance of the leaf. Sjnoking, or syring-
ing with tobacco- water, will destroy them; they injure
the looks of the vine, giving the foliage a/liseased ap-
pearance. "Wide-mouthed bottles Imng amongst the
branches, (one every two square feet,) and filled with
sweetened w^ater, will collect and destroy large quantities
of moths, and other insects. These will require to be
emptied every few days, or the dead insects on the sur-
face removed.
In the grapery, the two years past, the common red
caterpillar has been exceedingly annoying. The white
moth lays its eggs on the under part of the leaf, and the
first notice you have of the young is when you discover
small spots eaten in the leaf; on examination, ^'^ou will
now find the young caterpillar, one fourth of an inch in
length, spread over the leaves*, you must destroy all you
can find at once, and, every day, examine the vine anew;
notwithstanding all this care, some of them will pro-
bably escape yon, and grow to a good size. If these are
very numerous, and are on more than one or two vines,
it W'ill be best to fumigate the grapery with tobacco
leaves, or stems. This will be necessary, if thrips, or the
aphis, or green fly appear in the house. In smoking, care
must be had that the foliage is not injured by the heat
from the tobacco ; this should be moist, so that it cannot
burn with a blaze ; embers and ashes should be placed
