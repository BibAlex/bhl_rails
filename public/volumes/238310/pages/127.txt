166 THE CULTURE OF THE GEAPE.
"If the earth wliere you propose to plant a vineyard
is cultivated already, tlK3 best preparation for so doing is
to plant, for two or three years, the soil with vegetables,
giving the preference to such as require the most work-
ing of the land in the cultivation. The labor necessary
in this operation, and the manures by which the^^are
made to thrive, prepares, lightens, and enriches it. The
dung, in general so adverse to the vine, so prejudicial to
the quality of the fruit, incorporated into the soil in ad-
vance, can^ have only good effects ; it has become freed
of the carbonic acid in excess, and the vegetable sub-
stances become united with the under surface of the
earth ; the soil, thus prepared, is suitable for the vine in
every age, but more particularly in its infancy." Page

Kemarks quoted by Dr. Lindley in the controversy re-
lating to manures for vines : â€”
"The same reasons may be used against the sj^stem of
the vine-growers of the north, who think it advantageous
to manure their vines. By this means, indeed, they ob-
tain larger crops, and more wine, but it is of bad quality,
it will not keep ; and its smell often reminds me^ wlien
drcnik^ of the disgusting suhstances loMch produced it.
Manure communicates to the vine too much nourishment.
The nutritious juice, reduced to gas, and recei^^ed br the
mouths of the capillary roots, and by the air-vessels
of the leaves, penetrates and circulates in the sap-vessels,
forms the wood of the plant, and furnishes the substance
out of which the shouts, leaves, flo'wers, and fruit ai-e de-
veloped ; the more abundant the nutritive matter, the
more the diameter of the vessels distends, the more rapid
