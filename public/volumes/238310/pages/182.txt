THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 251
Hovey wishes to keep the roots at tlie surface, and this
he will do bj the top-dressing.
In the directions for the winter treatment of the vine,
it was recommended to cover the border with coarse ma-
nure and leaves, so that all the advantage the vine would
derive from this application would be reaped by follow-
ing my plan ; and, when fire-heat was used in the spring,
it is urged, as proper, to add to the litter, etc., already on,
enough of new manure to cover the border twelve or
eighteen inches thick, which would ferment and heat,
and certainly encourage the roots to keep to the surface.
But does any one suppose that all the roots of the vine, —
a plant that will live for centuries, — are to be kept within
such a limit ? This bugbear of the carcasses, (I am not
so particular about the flesh being on them, it is the
bones and hoois I depend upon chiefly,) which trouble
Mr, Hovey so much, and which are to draw the roots of
the vine down to them, (it is admitted then that there is
such nourishment,) I place there, at the bottom of the
border, the lower part of them three feet and the upper
part, perhaps, not more than two under the surface, to
give durability to the border, presuming that the vino
will not reach them before the second, third, or fourth
year, and that, when it does, by the superior richness of
this strata, the roots are eflectuaily prevented from going
deeper in search of food ; it is well known that the roots
of the grape will form spongioles innumerable over the
surface of bones partially decomposed, and that they
turn and return, on the inside and outside of them, hav-
ing no disposition to part company.
The cause of Mr. Hovey's objecting to these materials
