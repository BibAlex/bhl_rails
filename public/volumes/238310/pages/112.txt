FLOWER OF THE GRAPE.*
To do this properly, the bunch to be acted on should
be thinned of three quarters of the buds ; the lower part
should be cut away entirely (immediately before inflor-
escence) ; the strongest buds alvrays to be left.
Observe them closely, and, as soon as the flowers open,
with sharp scissors clip the antliers^ being careful not to
injure the pistil ; with a soft brush, apply the pollen
from the kind to be used in impregnation, or, the whole
bunch which is to furnish the pollen may be cut from
the vine, and gently rubbed or applied to the bunch, by
•'■• The left hand figure is a magnified representation of the bud of the
grape; the middle one is the blossom. The change from the bud to the
blossom is usually rapid, and takes place about 30 to 40 days after the
shoot appears in the spring which bears the fruit. This bud which forms
the blossom consists of a covering, or cap, and the embryo berry with five
anthers, which, when 'the time for inflorescence has come, is raised, or
lifted, by the anthers, and. the wind blows this cap free.
The third is the blossom, or embryo grape, with the anthers clipped and
deprived of their farina ; on the top of the embryo is the pistil ; upon this
is to be placed the farina, or pollen, of the male plant ; when this is done,
impregnation takes place, and the embryo rapidly swells off. If the oper-
ation has not been effectual, the 'berry will remain as it is. When the
grape has attained one third or one half of its size, it remains stationary
two or throe weeks, and, at this time, it is perfecting the seed. When this
is done, the fruit begins growing again ; thus it appears the seed will vege-
tate, even if the fruit does not ripen sufficiently to be eatable.
