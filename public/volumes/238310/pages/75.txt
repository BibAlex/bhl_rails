Yol. 13, page 261. Mr. J. Eobertson, I^Turserymanj

eral articles have appeared, at diiferent times, in the
Gardeners' Magazine, on the shrivelling of grapes. I
have tried every one of them, as they made their appear-

Theory of Horticulture, article Bottom Heat, it is there
stated that the cause is, that, the roots being in a colder
