52 THE CULTUEE OF THE GRAPE.
serve, that I have always applied this powerful manure,
(if I may so call it,) with great caution. I have found
the beginning of winter the most proper time for using
this kind of manure ; and then I only venture to give
two or three plentiful waterings, fearing that, if this were
to be applied either in the spring or the summer, or even
in too great quantities, it might tend, from its great
power, to cause the leaves of the vine to change from a
green to a yellow hue. The drainage of the dunghill is
the very strength and power of the dung ; for w^ater,
constantly filtering through stable yard dung, certainly
robs it of the mucilage and saline particles with which it
greatly abounds, when newly made ; and especially such
duns: as has lain a considerable time in the stable, and
imbibed a large portion of the urine of the horses. The
saline particles are increased by the fermentation, there-
fore the first extract obtained from the dung, after it has
undergone its fermentation, may be justly considered as
the essence of the manure.
" Although soils of difi'erent qualities admit of im-
provement by various modes of practice, yet, without the
aid of manure, the farmer would find his utmost exertions
of but little value. And though some have endeavored
to prove that the earth, when duly pulverized by the ac-

his ^ew Husbandry, tells us that, where the ground is
properly managed, manure is an useless article ; but his
opinion is now generally and justly exploded ;) yet ex-
perience tells us that it is the very life and soul of hus-
