102 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
ject, lias j)ractised my plan, every year since, with the
most complete success.*'
Yol. 11, p. 493, the same author remarks : " In the
paper sent you and printed in vol. 10, page 137, you
omitted to insert what I think the most important mat-
ter. In the paper alluded to, I considered it was from
the footstalk of the berry not being grown sufficiently
firm and hard, which I believe is the only cause. If the
grape is grown in a humid atmosphere, it elongates the
footstalk, and causes it to be of a slender, thin, delicate
texture, and, in case of a sudden change, even for a short
time, the footstalk is easily affected. When this injury
takes place, as I believe, from the delicacy of the foot-
stalk, the sap ceases to circulate in the manner required.
I think this disease may be remedied by keej^ing the
early -forced grapes with less humidity in the house than
some use when the croj) is young, which helps to elon-
gate the footstalk. In later grapes, if there were more
air admitted, or artificial heat kept up in cold damp
weather, either would remedy the disease ; but, as I sta-
ted in my former paper, give air and artificial heat at
the same time. As I am making this second attempt jto
impress on the mind of the reader that the cause is real-
ly in the footstalk, I can and will advance a few things
to make it more evident.
" I was asked this season, by a gardener, what I would
say to a vinery being left a little open all night at top ;
my reply was, I had not tried it, but I w^ould not hesi-
tate in saying it was more likely to do good than harm.
He said that there wqyq the finest grapes in a house so
treated that he had seen all the season. I was askino; a
