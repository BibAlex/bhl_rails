THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 227
never been over-cropped, and the temperature of the
house, with the thinning of the berries, and summer
pruning of the shoots, have been properly attended to,
crops of fine grapes can be had from vines pruned in
any of the methods described. The plan recommended
and adopted by myself, is considered the most simiDle,
and the one taxing the vine the least of any to ripen ad-
ditional wood; it is easily kept within narrow limits,
giving ample room for the light to be admitted.
In the best vineyards, where the richest wines are
made, the}^ limit the crop a plant may bear to a small
number of bunches, usually from eight to twenty-five in
number, and in weight to from ten to twenty pounds ; in
some parts of France, where they plant the vines very
close, to a much smaller quantity.
At Xeres in Spain, the sherry wine district, two or
three mother branches are trained up with one spur on
each to fruit, and the vines are planted five feet apart
each v^ray. The crop is limited to eight or nine bunches,
weighing about fourteen or sixteen pounds.
At other vineyards in Spain, where poor wines are
made, the vine is allowed to bear twenty-five or thirty
pounds.
In the vicinity of Malaga, where the Muscat of Alex-
andria grape is grown for the purpose of making raisins,
they prune close to the old wood every autumn, and the
plant is kept close to the surface of the soil, which is a
rotten slate ; the shoots are not tied up, but hang, or lie
upon the earth. The fruit also lies on the ground, and if
it were not so gravelly, it would rot ; the average yield,
per vine, here, is from seven to fifteen pounds ; this grape
