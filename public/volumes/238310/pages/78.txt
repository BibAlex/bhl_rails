THE CULTUJIE OF THE GRAPE. 107
By this simj^le mode of management, I have so far con-
quered the disease, that, instead of losing half the bunches,
I now only lose a few berries here and there in some
of the bunches, and a few at the points of some of them,
but not any of any consequence. I never expect to get
entirely rid of it, as the great fault lies in the forma-
tion of the border. We consider the vine to be a gross
feeder, and therefore think that it is impossible to make
the border too rich, but this is certainly a great error."

^' There has been so much discussion on the shrivelling
of grapes, that I make bold to give my humble opinion
also, more especially as I consider our friend W. H. (vol.
for 1840, page 598,) not altogether correct in thinking
that the shrivelling proceeds from the border being too
rich and stimulating. Crowded foliage will be injurious,
as far as preventing free access to light and air. l^or do
I acquiesce with bur learned friend Dr. Lindley, in sup-
posing that it proceeds from the roots being too cold for
the internal atmosphere. I had vines under my care at
Edgerston, in Roxburgshire, in the spring of 1837, when
the thermometer stood at 13° out of doors, and the inter-
nal atmosphere was 72°. The vines v/ere planted on the
outside of the house, with their stems wrapped up with
moss, and the border mulched. They were j)lanted in ;>
compost of strong hazelly loam, formed from the swarc
of a pasture thoroughly decomposed, and one fourth ve-
getable mould of decayed tree leaves, one sixth of goof'
rotten horse and butcher's grub dung, and a little shee]
dung, with a moderate quantity of powdered bones an',
lime rubbish. The borders were frequently watered witL
