THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 23T
to the intense lieat of onr sun ; besides, on account of tlie
Leat and duration of our summers, a vine here, under
proper culture, Tvill, in twelve "months, grow as much as
a vine in England will in four years. And to adopt the
rigid system recommended by Mr. Hoare, would ensure
a loss of the fruit every year, and, in the end, the vine
itself. After a vine has become established, say after
the first fruit year, (if healthy,) it should never be pruned
back exceeding one half, and oftentimes not more than
one third, of that year's growth, unless it be the smaller
lateral shoots. This will secure a sufficient foliage to
protect the fruit from the rays of the sun, loliich is the
main cause of the rot. Unlike other fruit, it is all-im-
portant that the grape be entirely shaded at every stage
of its growth and maturity, otherwise, if it escape the
rot, it will be small, hard, and insipid. I have Imov.-n
canvass, and other artificial means, adopted to shade the
vines in this climate. This will not answer ; for al-
though it will secure the fruit from the rot, yet the ricli
flavor of the grape is impaired, if not entirely destroyed.
The natural shade and protection of the fruit is the
foliage, and the more luxuriant this is, the greater cer-
tainty of fruit of large size, and rich flavor. After seve-
ral years' experience with some five hundred vines, I
have never known an instance in which these sugges-
tions did not prove true, both in regard to the native and
foreign varieties, especially the latter, on account of their
thin skin and great delicacy.
" In training the vine, I much prefer the trellis to the
arbor. As to the kind of grape suited to this climate,
I would state, I know of no foreign variety which will not
