.68 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. ■'
that I have recommended during the night, when the 1
grapes are in flower ; but all the kinds cultivated here, |
including the Tukay, Black Hamburgh, White Sweetwa- |
ter, &c., uniformlj set well with the heat above mention- j
•ed. Indeed, when the nights have been frosty, duriug |
the time my vines were in flower, I have seen the ther- J
mometer as low as 52° in the morning, and I never ob- \
served that they sustained the least injury by this low j
temperature. Too much dependence has hitherto been j
placed on the influence of fire heat in the forcing of hut- -
houses. The great art is to do with as little fire heat as i
possible, and to take the utmost advantage of the heat
derivable from the sun's rays, consistent with giving a '
sufficient quantity of air. The legitimate use of fire i
heat is to pj*event the bad effects of frosts, snows, and •
inclement weather. i
"I may now say a few words on giving air. In clear j
weather it should always be given early in the morning, i
and taken away early in the afternoon. For exampiC, j
let a small portion of air be given between eight and ]
nine o'clock in the morning, and, if the day continue |
clear, give more between ten and eleven, and take it all '
away at three o'clock. I seldom let air into my vine- \
houses after three o'clock in the afternoon. If air be ad- \
mitted until the house is completely cooled, a large fire '
may be necessary to support the requisite temperature ; i
and it is evident that sun heat is better and cheaper than ;
fire heciV'—Sejyt., 1S3S. i
Ey the foregoing, it would appear that the plan of j
covering the border with heating substances, for the pur- j
pose of raising the temperature of the border, was sug- j
