Vme borders. — By James Duncan, Basing Park, Al-
ton. " I am now forming a border for the growth of this
plant. I employ a two-horse cartload ot dead lime rub-
bish, with which some brickbats are mixed, and a sack
of half inch bones, (for each vine,) well incorporated with
a loam of very thin turf, taken from an old common;
the whole is covered over with six inches of road scrap-
ings, with which some charcoal w^ill be mixed when thcj
vines are planted. The border, when finished, will bn
about two and a half feet in depth, and sixteen feet i\\
width, resting on a substratum of flint stones, slopiuij
from the house, and two feet in thickness, so as to atfori 1
efiectual drainage ; and this I consider a most essential
point in the formation of vine borders." 1847, p. 205.
Yi7ie Borders. — By Robert Greenfield, gardener,
Tynemouth House, JSTorthumberland. "The bottom of
the border is chalk ; on this is laid one foot of rubble
stones, and, upon this, the compost of rotten turf from a
common which has lain undisturbed for fifty years."
18i7, p. 358.
'• All vine borders, whether early or late, should be in-
stantly covered a foot deep, if j^ossible, with rotting ma-
nures ; this will intercept the departure of the remaining
ground heat, and will contribute much to the fertility of
the vines in the ensuino* vear. Yines for earlv forciiiir,
with outside roots, will soon be benefited by a slight
aiiiount of fermentation in the border covering." Oct.
