the day, if clnll v/eatlier. In clear weatlier, from the
commencement of forcing, I open the npper door of the
furnace, merely keeping the fire in during the day, and
allow the temperature to rise in the hothouse to T0°, Y5°,
or even 80°. Were there a continuance of clear weather
at this stage of forcing, 80° would be too- high; but, for
a day or two, it does not matter, although the thermome-
ter should rise to 80° in the middle of the day. This
tempjerature should be continued during the day, should
the weather be clear, until the first leaves of the vine are
fully expanded, when the temperature may be kept be-
tween 85° and 90° in the daytime in clear weather.
When the vines are in flower, I keep the temperature be-
tween 55° and 60° in the morning, and between 65° and
T0° during the day, if dull w^eather, and about 85° if sun-
shine. After the grapes are set, the thermometer may
be allowed to rise to 90° or 95° during the day in clear
weather. In dull or wet weather, in summer, instead of
kindling fires at night in the ordinary way, I cause the
flues to be heated in the morning in order to raise the
mercury in the thermometer to about Y0° during the day,
and allow the fire to burn out towards night. The tem-
perature in the daytime, from the commencement of forc-
ing, should be regulated, in some nieasure, by the heat
of the vinehouse during the night. For example, if the
house has been colder during the night than I could wish,
I keep up a greater heat than usual during the following
day; and, if it has been warmer during the night than I
consider requisite, I give less fire during the day than
usual ; or more air, according to the state of the weather.
