228 THE CULTUKE OF THE GRAPE.
makes the best, or Muscadel raisin. The grape from
which the Bloom raisin is made, is an inferior kind, and
the grape of commerce a still more ordinary one ; these
are grown in the interior, and the vines are allowed to
ripen from ten to twenty-five pounds.
I^ear Perpignan, in France, the vine is trimmed at
about six inches from the ground ; from the spurs, at this
height, the bearing shoots proceed, and are not support-
ed at all ; the close spur-pruning is followed ; from three
to eight spurs are allowed on a vine, according to its age
and strength.
ISTear Marseilles, they sometimes prune to three eyes
on a spur, and each vine is allowed to bear from eight
to twelve bunches, or from twelve to twenty pounds.
At the vineyards that produce the fine wine called
Hermitage, the plants are only two and a half feet apart,
and are two feet high, supported with stakes five feet
long ; only one branch is allowed to fruit, and this is
pruned back to from three to eight eyes, and from eight
to ten bunches is the average crop.
At the vineyards which produce the Burgundy wine,
the plants are grown yet closer together. The rows of
vines are only two and a half feet apart, and the plants
in the rows are only twelve or fifteen inches. After the
vines have been three years planted, the space between
the rows is filled up with vines, making the distance be-
tween the plants only fifteen inches.
At the vineyards of Epernay and Ay, where the
Champaigne wine is made, the vines are, in the rows,
planted as near together as six or seven inches, and the
distance between the rows is only eight or nine. Of
