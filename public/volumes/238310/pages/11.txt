iV INTRODUCTION.

others, without giving the reasons therefor. It was well
known, in the vicinity of the city where my residence

rimenting upon the different plans recommended, (and
which l^ad caused me so much perplexity in the selecting
of the most suitable for this climate,) in order that I
could fix upon one worthy of general adoption. To spare
other cultivators this perplexity, very little was said of
soils and manures ; a compost was recommended as suit-
able, and a substitute named, in case the materials in the
former could not readily be obtained. Of the systems of
training and pruning, all that could be of use was given,

suited to grape culture. My own opinions are fully ex-
pressed, and, as the views of others have been added,
