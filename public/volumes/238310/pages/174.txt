THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 241
in tlie vicinity of every city between New York and
New Orleans.
" Yoii state you are about publishing a third edition of
your work on the Grape, and that it occurred to you that
I might wish to say somewhat in reference to my success
in the cultivation of the grape at Croton Point.
" First I will state I have read your work on the culti-
vation of the (/rape binder glass ^ and so far as I am capa-

subject. It is a general law of the vegetable economy,
that gross, rank manures, have a tendency to prevent

flavor, and secure the development of a large proportion
of nutritive qualities in fruits and vegetables.
" You state you were in New York during the grape
season and that you saw ' anj^ quantity of very fine Isa-
bellas from my vineyards.' You say further you ' never
saw finer,' and 'that they were well ripened, rich, and
sweet.' I can not help feeling I have accom.plished
much, when, however complimentary I may view your
letter, my fruit has secured the approbation of one of
the most successful cultivators of grapes under glass in
