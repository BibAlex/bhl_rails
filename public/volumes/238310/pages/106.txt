THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 143
mant eves at their base, from two to six shoots, and most
of the shoots had fruit bunches.'-''
February 15th. — First blossoms oi3ened to-day on three
of the vines ; shortened back, and tied out to the rods,
the side shoots on several vines.
February 21st. — Blossoms have opened on the eight
vines nearest the furnace, and, on the two first, the berries
are swelling off; continued to stop, and to tie up, and to
thin out, any of the shoots that are not wanted.
March 1st. — The temperature, at night, was kept at
60° to Y0° ; by day, when cloudy, 70° to Y5° ; by sun-
shine, 80° to 90° ; as much air admitted as could be,
W'ith safety, allow^ed ; began to thin some» bunches on
three vines ; ten vines w^ere in blossom on the front, and
four on the back of the house.
March 10th. — More than half the vines were in blos-
som, and the grapes thinned on eight vines; the laterals
on the spurs were cut back to one eye, and this check was
repeated as they required it. I advise the cutting out of
the laterals, situated between the fruit and the main stem,
allowing those only to grow that are beyond the bunch,
and these should be stopped at one eye every ten or four-
teen days, as they may grow with more or less vigor
during the season.
March 15th. — Temperature the same as from the first
of the month ; have been thinning the grapes the past
fortnight ; they are now finished, for the first time, and
the earliest vines have been thinned two or three times. f
* The tendrils should be cut smoothly out when they first appear.
\ The shoulders of very large bunches (the Syrian) always require to be
spread out and supported by strings, to permit a free circulation of air.
