able for pasture or grain." Page 29.
" The earth, the most suitable for vegetation in general,
is that composed of a mixture of flint, of clay, (alumine,)
and of lime, in such proportions as readily to imbibe
moisture, and so to retain it that it may be constantly
and insensibly evaporated by the warmth, giving enough
nourishment to the plants until a renewed rain has again
filled the reservoirs. Y/hen there is too uiuch aridity,
the plants become weakened and soon die. To constitute
a good vegetative soil, it is not sufHcient that barely the
top laj'er of earth shall be thus composed ; it must be of
good depth." Page 197.
" In time, the good soil will wear out, become ex-
hausted, and one cannot hope to reap a continued advan-
tage, unless by depositing, from time to time, new prin-
ciples of nourishment, â€” of oxygen, of hydrogen, and of
carbon. These can be found in proper cpiantities in the
manures of animals, and. decomposed vegetable matter.
One may also usefully employ certain, minerals, not as
manure, but as a rectifier : for instance, fossils and marl,
Vvdiich, from the effect of moisture and heat, ferment and
cause the small lumps of earth to separate, and render
the whole mass more permeable to the substances which
form the sap." Page 198.
"The nutritive principles required from the soil, for
the cultivation of the grape, are the same as those named
as requisite for general cultivation; but when there is
not a suliicieiiL supply of moisture, the vine will not pros- ^
per." Page 219.
