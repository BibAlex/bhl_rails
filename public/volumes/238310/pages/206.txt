THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 301
there will be any thing better produced, for cultivation
under glass, than the best of the old kinds named above.
For large collections, almost any number of kinds may
be added. The Garden of the Luxembourg, at Paris,
numbers about five hundred varieties, many of them
worthless, and a great number only differing very little
in foliage, or in the time of ripening.
LuxeinbouTg Gardens^ Paris. — " Grape vines occupy
a prominent part in this horticultural school, the kinds
being very numerous, and the plants taking up a consid-
erable proportion of the ground. Here are now assem-
bled all the varieties of vine known to be cultivated in
France, or, I may say, in Europe. To the best of my
recollection, nearly three hundred varieties are named,
and as many more without names, which are regarded
by M. Bosc as possessing characters sufficiently marked
to entitle them to rank as distinct.^" In general, there is
only one plant of each variety ; but the Chasselas de
Fontainebleau is an exception, there being a long row of
this on one side of the garden. It is the favorite variety,
and has been justly styled the ' raisin de table par excel-
lence,' of the French. At Fontainebleau, the vines grow
on a light sandy soil, and the grapes are sweeter than
those produced on a heavy soil.
The varieties of table grapes are few in number, per-
haps scarcely exceeding twenty ; the great mass of kinds
consisting of sorts cultivated in the vignobles, in the
various departments of France, in Italy, Spain, and Ger-
many. Many of these approach in character very near
* Under Napoleon, Chaptal collected in this garden fourteen hundred
varieties.
