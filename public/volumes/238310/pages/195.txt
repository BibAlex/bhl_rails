288 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
application of liquid manure, to cause the grapes to swell
off large and full.
This discussion of the subject of manures is well worthy
the attention of cultivators. Instead of supporting Mr.
Hovej's assertion, that experienced cultivators held the
same opinions as he did, respecting the " quackery, so
often recommended,'' as the use of oyster shells, or boiled
bones, dead cattle, etc., I am rather inclined to believe,
that the judicious use of them is advocated ; certainly,
it is admitted, that they are promoters of vegetation.
Chaptal even allows, that the effect of manure is to in-
crease the growth of wood and fruit ; but, he adds, the
effects are deceptive ; for, after a time, the manure will
cease to act, and the vine will languish. But is not this
failure caused by neglecting to renew the manure?
Plant a vine in a new soil, a good loam for instance, it
will grow well, and bear fruit for some years, but soon
(as Chaptal says of the manured vine,) it will cease to
bear fruit, or only in a diminished degree. Renew this
soil by adding to it more loam or manure, either as a
solid or liquid, and it will regain its former vigor. The
soil must be strengthened by yearly application of suit-
able matter. That harm is done by improper manuring,
I have no doubt. If vines, when young, are too highly
manured, and this stimulant is not constantly kept up,
they will fail to do well ; and this is what I should most
fear from Mr. Roberts's system ; not from the bodies of
animals deposited in the border, but from the manure
placed on the surface to produce heat.
Dr. Lindley, if I understand his language, does not
discourage the use of the articles named by Mr. Hovey,
