THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 249
the vines. This is an important matter, and should not
be neglected, for, in addition to the benefit derived from
this protection, from the severity of the weather, the ad-
vantages from the juices of this covering being washed
down amongst the soil and roots, by the rains and melt-
ing snows of winter, (particularly where the border is
not of the very richest kind,) must be very great. The
vines were planted, on an av^erage, four and a half feet
apart, the length of the house being eighty-six feet, and
nineteen vines being the number planted. I should have
planted, in the same space, twenty-nine vines, or fifty
per cent, greater. And this difference in the number of
the vines has a very important bearing upon the subject,
as the roots of the vine in his border have this per cent-
age more space to roam for nourishment. Allowing that
the vine, thus situated, does perfect a good crop of fine
fruit, still, by the plan of close planting, with a very rich
border, the difference in the product must be very much
in favor of the latter system.
Mr. Hovey remarks, "All that is necessary, in our
opinion, to produce the very best grapes, is a good, rich,
loamy soil, well top-dressed^ every year, with old stable
manure and guano." I agree with him perfectly, so far
as the soil is concerned, and go even further than he
does, for if this good^ rioh^ loamy soil is had, you have
already everything that is wanted, so far as nourishing
matter is concerned, and there can be no necessity for
this yearly application of stable manure and guano, â€”
this latter article the most concentrated and powerful
manure known. (I cannot see the propriety of recom-
mending the use of this, when the application of decom-
