32 TKS CULTUEE OF THE GEAPE.
baciv roof, which is -to decline at a proper pitch, should
be boarded, shingled, and plastered. Under the ridge-
pole must be the studs to support this, and these should
be twelve feet in the clear between the ridge-pole and
the sill, and here should be a double partition of plaster
to separate the front of the house from the back. The
rafters and the ridge-pole must be finished with a cap-
ping board. There are to be two doors, one at each end,
two feet eight inches wide, of glass ; the ends are also
best of glass,* and the sashes should be permanently se-
cured. Gutters may be placed under the roof to lead
the rainwater where desired. Solid brick work may be
substituted for the support of the sills, leaving spaces six
inches square for the stems of the vines to be brought
through. The back wall may also be built of brick or
stone, but they would be more costly constructed in this
way. .
A house built, as above described, on stone posts, in
the plainest manner, but of good materials and work-
manship, and well painted, would cost about eight dol-
lars per running foot. The heating apparatus would be
in addition ; also, the expense of preparing the border,
purchasing the vines, and the planting of them out. The
cost of the border, and of the heating apparatus, must
vary according to the natural soil, and the purposes to
which the house is to be put. â–  Making a border twenty-
iive or thirty feet wide, and three feet deep, is an expen-
sive work, and will vary from one to two dollars per foot.
The same remark will hold true with the heating of the

is for forcinrc.
