114 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.

In grafting vines, I Iiave cut them off at the surface
of the ground, and with a knife have split the stump in
the middle and inserted the grafts, cut in a wedge shape ;
they have always grown. (See grafting, as practised by
Mr. Cleveland and Dr. Sidney Weller.)
TBEATMENT OF THE VINES.
First Year.
The first year, they should not be forced, but allowed
to push naturally as the season advances.
In the vicinity of Boston, they will push their buds
early in April ; let the shoots from the three eyes grow
until they are two or three feet long ;* train up the lead-
ing one to the roof, and stop the other two, by pinching
off the end of each ; the leading cane must be stopped,
when it reaches the toj3 of the rafters ; the vine will be
strengthened, by allowing it to make a free growth ;
after September, stop all shoots as they push, that the
vine may the better ripen the wood.f
Early in the spring throw open the house and give air
* Perhaps it is best to allow all the lateral shoots to grow, the first three
months of the first season after planting, to guard against accident to the
leading shoots, as any check to the growth of the top is felt, in a corre-
sponding degree, by the roots. For instance, if only one shoot is behig
■ trained up, and this should be broken out, and the vine should make a
second, it would be but a weak one, and a loss of one year in the fruiting
would be tiie result.
f Vines Avill grow as rapidly in a moist temperature of 80" or 90" as
under any circumstances.
