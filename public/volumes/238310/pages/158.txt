THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 223
the main one must be pruned back to the middle of the
roof, and the lower one to the third eye.
The third year^ one leading shoot is to be trained in
from each cane, and, from the main cane, fruit-bearing
side shoots will be produced ; one bunch only on a shoot
should be retained, and the shoot stopped at .one or two
eyes beyond it. No side shoots should be allowed to
grow from the spur or cane which was cut back, the
leading shoot from which is to become a fruit-bearing
cane the next year.
In November, the shoot from the end of the fruit-bear-
ing cane must be cut at the top of the rafters, or within
a foot of the top, and the shoot from the spur must be
pruned back to the middle of the rafter, and all the spurs
that bore the fruit must be pruned out.
The fourth yeai\ a crop will be produced, both in the
upper and lower part of the house, the long cane-bearing
on the upper part, and the shorter on its whole length ;
a leading shoot must be trained from the short cane, and
another, a new cane, from a spur below.
In pruning, at the fall of the leaf, the long cane must
be taken entirely away, and replaced by the cane that
bore the fruit on the lower part ; the spurs on this must
be cut out, as on the cane last year, and the new cane
brought up this year, must be cut back to the middle of
the rafters ; a spur must be left below, to lead up a new
cane from, the next year.
By this system, you have the whole length of rafters
fruited by two canes, and a third one is to be growling for
the next year, to supply the place of the one which is to
be cut out at the fall pruning.
