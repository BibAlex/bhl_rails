posed animal substances is forbidden.) If sucb a soil
can be found, tlie only preparation requisite before i:)lant-
/fng the vine, will be, if the situation requires it, some
kind of application, such as shells or charcoal screenings,
which would have a tendency to loosen and give per-
meability thereto, so as to allow the rain to pass freely
through the soil, and, at the same time, make it easy for
the roots to spread. This is just the soil we are attempt-
ing to form when we prepare the border, as directed
under the proper head. In Massachusetts, I suppose
such a soil will rarely be met with, and a prepared border
must be resorted to.
A benefit to be derived from the top-dressing of stable
manure and guano, according to Mr. Hovey, is, that the
roots are thus brought to the surface, " rather than that
they should go to the bottom after the dead carcasses."
These dead carcasses appear to be a great bugbear in our
friend's path, and one would suppose, by the dread in
which he stands of them, tliat the bunches of fruit, in-
stead of having their usual bloom, would be ornamented
with hogs' bristles, horses' hair, dogs' teeth, and other
curiosities. How long does he suppose this carcass re-
tains any appearance of what it was when placed in the
border? In Massachusetts, and south of this, if placed
there during any time but the winter months, in sixty
days every vestige of the body will have disappeared,
excepting the bones, horns, hoofs, and hair, and will have
become incorporated with the soil and enriched it to a
great degree. The bones, being at the bottom, will re-
main according to their size and age, from one to fifty
years, continually and very slowly decon-Â» posing. Mr.
