THE CULTUKE OF THE GRAPE. 95
very well, but in no way better than the plan alluded to
above.
On this border and under this glass covering I tried
this system of hot manure in 1843. The only advantage
I derived from it was the ripening of the fruit a few
days earlier than usual. But the steam from the manure,
when freshly made up, forced itself through the front of
the house, by the sides of the sashes, &c., and destroyed
the foliage of the vines, where it came immediately in
contact with them. It is true that this would not have
happened had the border not been covered. But the
cost was more than the value of the crop, and the
system has not been tried since for the purpose of
forcing.
In the summer of 1843, I built a grapery. The border
was made according to the plan given by me in the first
part of this work. It was not begun till August, and
the vines were planted the last of that month, and a few
of them in September. They were of different ages,
some only two and three months from the eye, and others
one and two years old ; they all came into fruit at the
same time, and I never have been able to notice any dif-
ference in their growth, or in their produce, since the
first year. As these vines were planted at so late a pe-
riod, I was fearful that they might not become sufficiently
established in their new situation to survive the winter.
To induce a rapid and promote a late growth, this me-
thod of heat upon the border was resorted to, and with
the desired efiect generally. Owing to the situation of
the grapery, which is on a gentle slope, a few of the
vines at the bottom of this were killed by the too power-
