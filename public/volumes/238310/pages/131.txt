192 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAi'E.
A "vine slioiild be six or eiglit years old before it be al-
lowed to cover so much wall as represented in the cut.
The first year of bearing, these upright shoots may be
pruned to about six feet, pennitting them to extend
themselves two feet every year, until the wall is covered.
If the spurs are too close together, some of them must
be pruned out, so that every spur and shoot shall have
ample room. The shoot on the top spur, when the wall
is full, may be led along the top of the trellis till it has
growm five or six feet, when it can be pruned back to
about three feet, leaving the lateral to grow, which can
be stopped, if it grows too strong, in two or three w^eeks ;
if not, let it grow till the shoots are stopped in Septem-
ber. In the winter pruning, this must be cut back, as
are the other shoots, to the one or two eyes.
This trellis is made with three horizontal pieces of
boards, two inches wide by one and a quarter thick.
The first one is fifteen inches from the ground, the second
in the middle, and the third near the roof; these are se-
cured firmly, fourteen inches from the house, by board
cleats, quite stout, which are nailed to the trellis and
house. On these horizontal pieces are nailed the up-
right ones ; they should be one inch thick by two inches
wide, eight of them to a vine ; the distance between
them should be three feet from centre to centre. The
lower, or horizontal limbs of the vine, must be trained
to the lower horizontal strip, and the upright branches
trained one to each upright piece, and well secured by
tying. (See cut.)
