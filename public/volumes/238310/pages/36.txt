THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 85
are five rafters, with a corresponding number of posts on
tbo back of the house, framed into a plate at the top.
The inclined sashes are jDermanent ; the angle of inclina-

side are nine feet in length. The ventilation is from the
back, the ends and the front.
" The border is eight feet wide, well-elevated, fifteen

grapes can be safely calculated upon from such a house
as the above, as a permanent annual crop ; say five front
vines at fifteen pounds each, seven back and end vines at
seven pounds each. With a wider border, the front vines
