THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 159
ropean Idnds Lave not succeeded with him. The fcllow-
iiig are his remarks : "The grape requires a good soil,
and is benefited by well-rotted manure. For aspect, I
prefer the sides of hills, but our native grapes would not

It has been considered of sufficient importance to giv^e
tlje views of European cultivators and others, at length,
upon the vineyard systems of culture pursued there.
The American kinds of the grape, requiring a different
plan of pruning, will render many of the practices, par-
ticularly the close pruning (in summer,) and planting of
the vines,~ impracticable here ; still, the remarks on ma-
nures and soil, and details of some of the plans of train-
ing, will be worthy of notice by American grape grow-
ers.
First comes the exposition. It is the established opin-
ion, in vineyard culture, that the best fruit is produced
where the vine receives the most sun, not upon the fruit,
but upon the foliage. Prince says, " Theibaut de Ber-
neaud remarks, that an eastern aspect would be prefera-
ble to all others, if it did not expose the plants, during
