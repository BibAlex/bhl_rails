242 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
the United States. ' In relation to the snccess of my
vineyards at Croton Point, I may say, they have more
than realized my most sanguine expectations. The fla-
vor and general character of the fruit have improved
very much during the last ten years ; and will I believe
continue to improve by close attention and good manage-
ment. When a vineyard of Isabella grapes is properly
formed and cultivated, the crop of fruit, in this vicinity
(below the Highlands of the Hudson River), is about as
certain as a crop of Indian corn. "When their proper
culture is not understood, a crop of fruit would be near-
ly as uncertain in the Southern States, as in this latitude.
" The demand for the fruit is greatly on the increase.
There are ten or twelve vineyards, of moderate size, in
the vicinity of 'New York beside those at Croton Point,
many of which have come into bearing, and yet the
market has shown less appearance of being over-stocked
with grapes of the first quality, than it was many years
ago, when the quantity furnished was comparatively
email. The fact is, quite a number of" our citizens are
beginning to eat grapes for pleasure and health. "When
the greater part of the community who can afford it,
j^artake freely of this delightful fruit, which they will in
ten years, or less, if they can obtain it, it is my belief, from
a close scrutiny into the rise and progress of the grape
culture on the Atlantic seaboard, a hundred vineyards
will not supply the demand for this fruit in New York,
Philadelphia, and Boston, at remunerating prices.
" Yours truly,
" R. T. Underhill, M.D."
