ground ; to the sill is nailed, covering abont two inches
of it and going down two inches into the earth, thick
plank, finished v/ith a bevel, like a water table. This,
from the top of the sill to the earth, makes a solid work
of at least twelve inches, which is necessary, as glass so
near the earth wonld be very liable to be broken, and
would also be covered with the soil spattered up by the
rain. In winter, it will be prudent to tack or otherwise
secure above this, boards, one foot in width, to prevent
the breakage of the glass from the ice and snow falling
from the roof.
The sills are of timber six inches square. All the
measurements are after the work is finished. j
The timber which forms the support for the raftere, ^
and is immediately over the sill, and called the plate, is ,
five inches thick by six inches wide. The studs or up- •,
right pieces, which support this plate, are of plank two •
inches thick by six inches wide, and are mortised into '
the sill and plate, and secured by wooden pins. The sill
and plate are carried round the four sides of the house j
on a level, and are secured together; this makes the ■
frame, thus far, very firm, and prevents the two ends
fi'om i3ressing in or out from any cause. Before the roof j
was put on, the plate was strengthened and braced, and
kept in place by iron rods one inch thick and about
fifteen feet apart, which are run through it and fastened
by nuts, and crossing the house.
A cleat, five eighths of an inch in thickness and one ,
inch wide, was nailed on the sill, and plate, and studs,
to form a rabbet for the sashes ; these are placed in, from
the outer side, so that the sashes, when closed, are on the
