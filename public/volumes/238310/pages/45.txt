46 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
decomposed and amalgamated, "when tliey should be
placed in the border, and thrown loosely together. My
borders, having the most slaughter-house manure, or
whole bones of animals in their composition, still con-
tinue, as they ever have done, to produce the best fruit
and the largest crops.
It is unnecessary to attempt to give rules for every
kind of soil. One must use his own judgment, and make
his border to consist, as near as can be, of the above in-
gredients. He must bear in mind that, if his soil is a
stiii', clayey loam, he must add freely of such materials
as will lighten and give permeability to it. If the soil
is light, sandy, or gravelly, with the manure should be
added a proportion of clay or of clayey loam. The rich
alluvion soil, abounding in our western and south-west-
ern States, will not require any of these strong ma-
nures. If anything is requisite to improve them, it must
be shells, charcoal, leaves, small stones, or gravel, â€” such
materials as will loosen the soil.
If a compost is to be prepared, as is usuallj^ recom-
mended by European writers on the cultivation of the
grape, by taking the top soil of an old pasture, &c., and
throwing them into a heap until decomposed, two or
three years are required before the border is in readiness
for the vines ; whereas, by the plan which I have adopted,
the vines may be planted immediately, making due al-
lowance in the placing of the vine for its settling, v/hicli
will be in proportion to the freshness of the manures, or
the carcasses of animals that enter its compost, which,
in dissolving, diminish greatly, and this in ratio to the
flesh upon them ; the large bones will change but little
