THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 201
In a subsequent letter, Mr. Cleveland writes: "We
are daily lighting rose-bugs, which made their appear-
ance on the twenty fifth May, but in that part of tlie
vineyard the ground of which I covered, very few are
yet to be found, though they have heretofore always been
most numerous there.'^
The fruit in the above vineyard is grown for the dessert.
The amount of twenty pounds per vine, where the plants
are so wide asunderj appears to me to be a small crop for
vines seven or eight years old, of the Isabella or Catawba
varieties. It is unquestionably, a good plan to limit the
plant to this quantity when young, and no one can
judge so well, what a vine is capable of producing, with-
out injury, as the one having it in charge.
Culture oftlie Grape in North Carolina. — ^The follow-
ing is a condensed account of the grape culture in North
Carolina, originally written for the November number
of De Bow's Commercial Keview, by Dr. Sidney Weller,
of North Carolina : —
" North Carolina is ahead of all her sister states, in the
wine product, by some thousands of gallons, according
to the agricultural census of 1840 ; and, as far as I know,
my vineyard is the largest in this state, and, I suppose,
in the south, and perhaps the most productive ; since, be-
sides entertaining hundreds of visitors, and disposing of
quantities of grapes carried away, I made, last vintage,
forty barrels of wine. My increase of product has been,
annually, for a few years past, about ten barrels.
" Of our native Scuppernong, the grape for the south,
I make wines that readily bring me, in different markets,
$1 to $4 per gallon, according to quality.
