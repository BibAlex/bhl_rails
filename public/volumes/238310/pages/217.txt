816 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
grape, with an oval and rather small berry. I do not
consider it any better than the Pitraaston.
^ Portuguese Muscat. — A variety of the Muscat of
Alexandria ; it is more musque-flavored, and sets its
fruit better.
Tf De RMnelander, — This is a white grape, and said
to be hardy ; under glass, it has proved not unlike White
Chasselas.
T Cambridge Botanic Garden Grajpe. — This fruit is
black, and esteemed by many as quite equal to the Black
Hamburgh ; it has been fruited in this country by R.
L. Colt, Esq., of Paterson, IST.J.
Barharossa. — This is a new black grape, advertised
for sale in England. It is represented as having berries
as large as the Hamburgh.
T Gross Bleu. — A new grape, very like the Black
Hamburgh. Messrs. Hovey, who have fruited it, state
the foliage to be quite different, however.
T Gross Gromier du Cantal. — Parsons & Co.^ of
Flushing, near New York, have fruited this variety.
They represent it as of second quality, but a great
bearer ; color, foxy purple ; berries a little larger than
the Red Chasselas. From the first description of this
new grape in Europe, I have been of opinion, that it
would prove a synonyme of De Candolle, or Flame
Colored Tokay.
Tf Chasselas de Florence. — This new grape was proved
in Hartford, Conn., last season, (1852,) in the grapery of
Charles L. Porter, Esq. This gentleman says, " It is a
fine Chasselas, equal, perhaps, to the Bar Sur Aube, and
of the same character."
