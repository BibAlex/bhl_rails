HISTORY OF THE GRAPE VINE. XVll
It is supposed to have been introduced into Britain at
the commencement of the Christian era, and history
amply proves that, for a long series of ages, vineyards
were very common in the southern parts of the island,
and that the quantity of wine produced from them was
so great as to be considered one of the staple products of
the land." — Clement Roare. London^ 1837.
Konisburgh, in north latitude, nearly 65°, is considered
the limit at which the grape will ripen in Europe.
Humboldt has observed, that the best wines are pro-
duced from vineyards situated in the interior, away from
the sea-board, and remarks, that the cause does not alone
reside in the lower summer temperature of the coasts,
but attributes the difference to the light, from a clearer
state of the heavens. He also says, " to have palatable
wine, not only must the mean annual temperature ex-
ceed 49° 65', but that the mean winter cold must not
fall quite to the freezing point, 33° 4', and this must be
followed by a mean summer heat of at least 64° 4'."
