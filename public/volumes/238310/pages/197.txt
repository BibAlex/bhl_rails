290 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.

to your place, and then killed, and the thanks of the
owners to you in addition, for providing a phice of de-
posit, near at hand, for them, which otherwise might
occasion them some expense in their removal to a dis-

so much saved. On the contrary, the land that has been
skimmed of its turf, and three or four inches of its best
soil, (in this part of our country at least,) is almost ruined.
It is true, you may rob your own land, but, should your
garden be in the city, (as mine is situated,) you would
search many an hour before the proper pasture soil could
be obtained. Knowing these difficulties in providing
suitable soil from a pasture, I, in the first place, gave the
directions for the compost, with the animal carcasses ;
and then, in giving the substitute, presumed that it
would be understood, that I did not consider that it was
imperatively necessary that these materials, flesh and

in December, and has never failed to produce a crop of
fruit. This season of 1848, the fruit was as fine as it
ever has been ; the bunches, many of them, weighing
