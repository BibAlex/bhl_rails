132 THE CULITJRE OF THE GRAPE.
At the entrance to Spae's Garden, Ghent, " is situated
an uncommonly large vine, the stem, a little above the
ground, measuring one foot nine inches in circumference.
We were assured that it is more than a hundred years
old, and, from its appearance, we could easily believe
that it may have seen even two centuries." — IIoH. Tour.j
Edinliirg\ 1823.
At Antwerp, "our attention was attracted by a very
large and ancient vine, apparently of the variety called
the Frankendale, planted in the centre of a front wall of
a large house, which it now covers. The pavement of
the street reaches close up to the stem, which is secured
from being injured by carts, c%c. by means of a wooden
box.
" At the height of between two and three feet from
the ground, a branch had originally been trained, hori-
zontally to each side, the whole extent of the house, or
about thirty feet in each direction. From these horizon-
tal branches, which are now very thick and resemble
trunks, many upright branches arise, which are trained
vertically even to the eaves of the roof, or between thirty
and forty feet high. Yery few bunches of fruit were to
be discovered, and it was evident that the vine was not
judiciously pruned." — Hort. Touv.^ (&g.
Botanic Garden^ Amsterdam. — " In front of the green-
house grows a large vine, about eighty years old, and
which spreads over the roof. It is of the Frank enthal
kind, and by much the largest tree of this variety which
we have seen, the stem being two feet two inches in cir-
cumference at three feet from the ground." — Ilort. Toiir.^
