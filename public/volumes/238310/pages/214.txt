THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 811
T" Blach July. — Yery mucli like the Black Cluster.
An early variety.
T Miller's Biorgimdy. — The fruit is like the two pre-
ceding, but it is distinguishable from the above by the
white down on its leaves, from the mealy appearance of
which it has derived its name. Of the three preceding
varieties, Mr. Thom.pson gives eighty-four sj^nonymes,
and adds two varieties as distinct : the Scarlet-leaved.
Black Cluster, a wine grape of poor quality, and the
Black Cluster, nice, which he represents as loose grow-
ing. These three, the Black Cluster, the Black July,
and Miller's Burgundy, so far as the fruit is concerned,
may be considered the same ; they color early and ra-
pidly, and, when perfectly black, are as sour as any one
could wish ; by hanging four or five weeks, they become
very good ; but they are so small, and require so much
thinning, and usually having five large seeds, that they
can hardly be deemed worthy a place in the grapery.
T Blach Prince. — The bunches are long, and often
shouldered ; the berries are oval, of a good size, and
color well ; this is a good grape ; it sometimes cracks ;
the skin is thick, and, in this respect, is inferior to the
Black St. Peter's. It sometimes keeps well on the vine ;
at other seasons it rots badly.
^ Black St. Peter's. — The bunches are large, long, and
sometimes shouldered; the berries color well, and have
a thin skin ; this grape also sometimes cracks. It hangs
well after it is ripe, and is, on this account, one of the
most valuable grown in the grapery. I find the keeping
qualities of this grape uncertain ; it some years decays
suddenly after it is fully ripe.
