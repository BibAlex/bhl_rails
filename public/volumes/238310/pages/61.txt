66 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
Bemarlcs on tlie Cultivation of tlie Vi?ie. — By James
Hutchinson, Gardener at Cranston Hill, near Glasgow.
After some remarks relative to spur and other systems
of pruning the vine, this writer goes on to recommend
the long cane system as the best. As I have explained
this plan fully aiid stated the objections to it, I shall not
repeat here his remarks, but shall give what he says rel-
ative to the temperature of the house and border where
the vines are to be forced. In my opinion, they are well
worthy of careful attention.
" I commence forcing about the end of February, or
beginning of March ; previously to which, I cover the
vine border, to the depth of ten or twelve inches, with
horse dung of the best cpiality. Before this dung is laid
on the border, it should be thrown up in a heap for two
or three days, until it begins to heat properly. It should
then be laid on the border without delay, as its powers
will be greatly weakened by the process of fermentation.
The temperature of the surface of the border will be
raised, by means of this dung, to about 50° Fah., a point
of great importance. It is evidently contrary to nature
to be forcing the vines when the roots are exposed to
cold, or, at least, deriving no warmth to stimulate the
juices of the plants. I keep the temperature in the hot-
house at about 50° in the morning, at first ; and about
55° during tlie daj^, if dull weather. If the nights are
ver}^ cold or frosty at the commencement of forcing, if
the thermometer is 48° in the morning, I am satisfied.
This heat is continued until the buds are all broken ; af-
ter which, the thermometer may be allowed to range be-
tween 50° and 55° in the morning, and about 60° during
