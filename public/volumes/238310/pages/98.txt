THE CULTUKE OF THE GRAPE. 133
" In XortLallerton, in Yorkshire, tliere is a vine now
(1T89) growing, that once covered a space containing one
hundred and thirtj-seven square yards ; and it is judged
that, had it been permitted, when in its greatest vigor,

hundred and fifty pounds of unripe grapes." — Gard.

posed to be the largest cultivated vine in the world. " In
1813, it bore a crop of two thousand three hundred and
fifty bunches, averaging one pound each ; the vine, at
that time, was one hundred and thirty-eight feet long
and sixteen feet wide, and covered two thousand two
hundred and eight superficial feet of wall. It was then
forty years old." This account of the Cumberland Lodge
vine I found in some English publication, some years
since, but did not minute where, as the memorandum
was made for my use, without reference to publication.
Chaptal says : " I have found, in the notes I have re-
ceived upon the age and size of the plant, that the frost
which injured the vines in the department of Doubs, in
