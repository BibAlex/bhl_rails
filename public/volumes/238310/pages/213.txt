310 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
^ YerdclTio. — This is a small, oval, white grape, of the
finest quality. The vine is a very strong grower, and
bears great crops. It is a favorite variety for the table,
as well as for wine in Madeira and the Azores. It is a
later grape, than the Black Hamburgh.
Blanche. — Is an early sort, with greenish white, and
oval berries, thin skinned and sweet.
T White GasGoignc. — A fine white grape ; the bunches
are quite large and compact, with shoulders ; the berries
are inclining to oval, are subject to crack in moist wea-
ther, and do not keep well after fully ripe.
Bordelais or Boiirdelas. — A very delicate grape that
requires a high temperature, and a long season to bring
it to maturity ; the berries are oblong, and the bunches
are very large.
^ Muscat Blanc Ilatif. — A grape by this name, lately
received as a new kind from France, has proved the
Chasselas Musque.
Blach Tokay. — A wine ^rape.
Alexandrian Ciotat. — The bunches are large ; the ber-
ries are white, of an oval form, with a thin skin. This is
a sweet grape, but sets badly ; do not think it worthy a
place in a grapery, but it may prove valuable, for open
culture, in the southern States.
% Blach Cluster. — The bunches and berries are small ;
the latter vary in shape, — oval and round are usually
found in the same bunch ; they grow very close together,
(as is the case with all cluster grapes,) and often, by their
own pressure, burst the skin,' causing rot, which soon
spreads through the whole bunch.
