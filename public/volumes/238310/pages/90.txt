THE CULTURE OF THE GEAPE. 123
I do not syringe the vines after they are trained to the
trellis, and do not think it ever necessary, provided the
house is kept moist by watering.
The vines will begin to bloom early in June ; when the
berries are as large as peas, begin to thin them ; cut out
all the small ones first ; no rule can be laid down as to
the number to be taken out of each bunch, for the same
kinds set their fruit more or less thickly in difi'erent
years, and in different situations. Of Black Hamburgh,
I usually cut three out of five berries ; of Zinfindal, eight
out of ten ; of Chasselas, when they set well, five out of
ten : experience will soon teach one what is proper to be
done. If the shoots from the spurs have not been tied
to the rods, they should be as soon as the thinning is
over ; do this carefully, and let them be at equal distan-
ces ; a little attention to this will improve the appearance
of the vines very much.
Examine the bunch as the grapes swell ; if they are
pressing together, cut out still more, always taking the
smallest berries. In thinning, avoid touching the grapes
with the hand ; the moisture of the fiesh causes rust ; if
it is necessary to handle the bunch, gloves should be
worn. After they begin to change color, if it is necessary
to thin them more, the scissors must be used cautiously,
in order not to injure the bloom, and thereby destroy the
beauty of the bunch.
Early in July, spread the sulphur, as directed the last
year. The grapes will begin to change color in August,
and to ripen about the middle of September.
" If the fruit-bearing branch be not very vigorous, it
ought, in July, to be cut off close to the fruit. In the
