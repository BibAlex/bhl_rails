the very top and even out-top the highest poplars ; on
which account the grape-gatherers, in tfme of vintage,

" Ancient naturalists and modern travelers agree in
their accounts of the long life and immense size to which
the vine attains in its wild state. Statues have been
carved from its wood, pillars have been made from it,

a single plank. Pliny gives an account of a vine six
hundred years old." — Chaptal^ p. 142.

dred years, and that there are plants in existence which
