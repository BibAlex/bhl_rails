FLOEIDA CULTUKE.
The Hon. A. G. Semmes, of Florida, Las been experi-
menting with Grapes in open cnlture in that section of
the United States, and with marked success. The reader
of the following remarks, (extracted from letters to the
author of this book,)' will see, that, notwithstanding his
vineyard has been destroyed by a terrific gale, enough
has been proved, to show that the vine in its richest va-
rieties will repay the cultivator for his efforts.
Apalachicola, June 29, 1850.
" On receiving the cuttings of the Josling's St. Albans,
enclosed in your letter, I found two of them alive, which
I grafted on wild stocks ; they took at once, and are now
instance, the Black Hamburgh grape cannot well be surpassed in richness
of quality, when well groAyn, in this country. It is generally spoken of as
a very desirable kind to cultivate, on account of its hardiness ard good
bearing qualities, and not of its being anj^thing more than a good grape ;
" though not of the very first quality," is the term often used respecting it,
in England. The Esperione is there spo'ken of as but little inferior to the
Hamburgh. In Massachusetts, it is very inferior, and not worthy of a
place in the front border of the house, but on the back wall, where its
roots can be kept quite dry, the quality is better ; in a position where its
roots are situated in a soil, as regards moisture, more unlike that of Eng-
land, it approaches more nearly to the quality of the fruit there. If heat
caused the difference in the Hamburgh, why does it not in the Esperione ?
I presume that the soil gf a country has some effect, as well as the sun and
heat, in effecting these changes. It is not confined to any one fruit, but
the change is noticed iu apples, pears, grapes, peaches, cherries, and other
kinds.
