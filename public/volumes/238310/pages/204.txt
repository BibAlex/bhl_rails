THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 299
Syrian, white, lias very large bunches, sometimes
weighing twenty pounds.
The descriptive list of grapes annexed will enable any
one to select such sorts as his taste may dictate.
For a cold house, I would recommend the following,
and in proportion to the number named to each sort.
The most desirable are the first named : —
Black Hamburgh, ten vines.
Wilmot's new Black Hamburgh, ten vines.
Wilmot's No. 16, ten vines. This may prove no bet-
ter than the old variety.
Victoria Hamburgh, ten vines.
White Frontignan, two vines.
Grizzly Frontignan, two vines.
Pitmaston White Cluster, one vine,
Oolden Chasselas, two vines.
Chasselas de Bar Sur Aube, one vine,
Kose Chasselas, one fine.
Hed Chasselas, one vine.
White Gascoigne, one vine.
Eoyal Muscadine, one vine.
Ked Traminer, one vine.
White Rissling, one vine.
Macready's Early White.
The last seven are equally valuable, and there are
many others as much so, as may be seen by referring to
the varieties.
For a forcing-house : —
The Black Hamburghs, in variety.
The Red, and the Rose Chasselas.
Chasselas de Bar Sur Aube.
