THE CULTUKE OF THE GRAPE. 127
I'H^ever allow any of the leaves of the vine to be taken
off for the purpose of admitting the sun to the grapes.
If aphis, or the vine-fretter, appear on the vine, fumi-
gating the house with tobacco will destroy them. If red
spiders are troublesome, moisture and sulphur are the
only remedies ; syringing the vines at evening, and
dusting the leaves with flour of sulphur.
In September, all but the last lateral on the spurs
should be cut out.
When the leaves are oif, early in ISTovember, cut back
the leading cane, leaving four feet only of the new, or
this year's growth ; this will now make the entire length
of the cane twelve or thirteen feet ; cut back, close to
the old wood, the spurs that have fruited this year ; those
that have not, cut back to one eye, or bud, to bear fruit
the coming season ; clean and put over the vines the
soap and sulphur, as before ; and, the first of December,
lay them down and cover them, as last season. Washing
the back wall of the grapery withflonr of sulphur, added
to common lime \vhitewash, will destroy insects, and
have a tendency to prevent mildev/ in Summer.
If the spurs are too close together, you can cut out
those that are not wanted ; they should not be nearer
together than four inches ; this would make them eight
inches apart on each side the cane, and closer than they
are often grown ; if nearer, they would obstruct the
light.
Fourth Year.
The fourth year, follow the same directions for venti-
