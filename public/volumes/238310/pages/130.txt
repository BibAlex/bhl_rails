THE CULTURE OF THE GEAPE. 191
TJie system of .Pruning and Training the American
varieties of the Grajpe^ in gardens^ on houses^ and in
vineyards. â€” The American varieties of the grape require
verj different smnmer treatment from the European
kinds. The system of training tliem which I should re^
commend as the best, is the one Speechlj advises for
espaliers. It is having eight upright canes permanently
established, instead of one, as advised by myself, for the
grapery.
The vine is to be established in this form, by the same
process as Mr. Hoare gives for his, (see Hoare's plan,)
and is, in fact, restoring this to its original and most ju-
dicious system. After it has once become established,
the fall or winter pruning will only be to cut back the pre-
sent year's wood to the spur, leaving one or two eyes, as
you may think best.
This plan is illustrated by a view of some vines trained
as above described, and represented as in full growth in
summer. The only pruning recommended for the sum-
mer, is to stop the leading, or any other shoot that may
be growing too strong, and thereby w^eakening the growth
of the lower limbs. In August or September, stop the
shoots by cutting or pinching off their ends. The foliage
is liable to be injured by blight in some sections of the
country ; as a remedy for this evil, promote a good stock
as a reserve. After the fruit is set, and is as large as
peas, it will be time to tie the shoots into the trellis. In
the view, it will be observed that this has upright pieces
three feet apart ; the shoots from the spurs can be se-
cured to these, or lighter supports may be placed half-
way between them for this purpose.
