210 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
cutting off the side shoots, two joints above the fruit, — I
opened shallow trenches, say four or five inches deep, at
the roots of the vines to be pruned. As fast as the prun-
ing was finished, the leaves and young stems cut ofi*,
were laid in these trenches, sprinMed with sufficient gyp-
sum or plaster^ to whiten the foliage^ (from a pint to a
quart per plant,) and the whole trodden down and buried
in the trench.
" As soon as the leaves fell in the autumn, I repeated
the process, — raking up the leaves and burying them
around the roots of the vines, after dusting them over
with plaster, as before.
" In June, 184:8, the present season, I repeated the
same operation at the summer pruning.
" E'ow the result is as follows : —
"Although the season is remarkable for the prevalence
of the rot, not a berry on any of these six vines^ so
treated, is afiected ; the crop being, on the contrary, very
good, — the fruit large, and increasing in size. The vines,
too, are remarkably healthy and vigorous.
" On the other hand, the remaining vines, fourteen in
number, are every one affected by the rot — some of them
very badly ; and, even on those least affected, ten per
cent, of the berries are destroyed by this disease.
" I cannot, therefore, escape the conviction, that the
treatment you proposed has, so far, been effectual, in pre-
venting this disease.
"I ought to add, that the vines of my neighbors, ge-
nerally, are much affected by the rot, this season, and
that I have seen no Isabellas or Catawbas, this season, that
surpass, in appearance, those on the six vines alluded to.
