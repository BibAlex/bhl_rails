Of the Hampton Court vine, Speechly says : " "When I
saw this magniiicent vine in 1788, the crop of grapes was
moderate, and the bunches, in general, very small. But
since then, I have, from time to time, been informed oi
its having often produced most abundant crops, and o:'
large and well-perfected bunches."
" Mr. Eden planted a vine of the Black Hamburg!
sort, at Yalentine House, Essex, in the year 1758, whicl
is the parent of the vine at Hampton Court, and has ex
tended itself to upwards of two hundred feet in length
being so productive that it ripened tv/o thousand bunches
of grapes in 1819." — Phillip^ s^ etc.
" At Yalentine, near Ilford, in Essex, (England,) the
seat of the late Sir Charles Raymond, there is a vine,
now growing, whose branches extend and furnish th(
entire roof of a pine stove, which is seventy feet lon^
by eighteen feet broad. And, moreover, some of th;
branches are trained downwards, and also cover a grea
part of the back wall of the said building. The vine
which is the Black Hamburgh, w^as planted in the yea
1758, and growls entirely in the inside of the stove. Th
girth of the main stem, at two feet from the ground, i
about thirteen inches." — Speechly.
"This vine produced annually upwards of three hun
dred weight of fruit, and, in some seasons, upwards c
four hundred." — Penny Cyclopaedia.
