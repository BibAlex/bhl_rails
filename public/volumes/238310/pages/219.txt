318 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
Ilamburgli, is very handsome, but more sour than the
original Mr. Amos W. Stetson, of East Bramtree,
Mass, has many seedlings from the foreign varieties
coming into fruit. This gentleman exhibited a bunch
last season from seed of the Grizzly Frontignan, no
doubt crossed with the Black Hamburgh. It ripened
early ; was very black, medium sized, and of rich,
sprightly musque flavor. Several other persons have
seedling vines coming into bearing, and a few years will
Bhow if we have anything to hope from these efforts of
hybridizing. These same gentlemen have, many of them,
Hybrid Grapes in bearing, or coming into fruit this sum-
mer of 1853, of crosses between the Yitis Vinifera, or
European sorts, and the Yitis Labrusca, or American
species. Judging from the variety of wood and fohage of
these new grapes, it does seem, that the prospect is very
good, that we shall soon have native hardy grapes that
will ripen in open culture. Some of these will be de-
scribed in the list of American species.
Yitis Labrijsca.— There are several American species
of the grape, according to Prince; and the same author
gives over one hundred varieties of this species. For
general cultivation, the first two on the list are the most
valuable ones.
Isabella.— Tda^ is a native of South Carolina. Mr.
Prince, in his Treatise ■on the Yine, says that this grape
is named in honor of Mrs. Isabella Gibbs, who introduced
it into cultivation in New York. The berries are black
and oval ; the bunches are of a medium size ; it has a foxy
flavor.
