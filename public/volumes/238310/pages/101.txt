136 THE CULTUEE OF THE GRAPE. ,
i
raised or reduced, it is equally directed to an imitation i
of nature's course in some climate. The forcing-house, \
however, is frequently so assimilated in its construction
and econom}^ to the hothouse, on account of the culture
requisite for plants of a mixed nature, that the difference I
vanishes. But both the separation and the interchange j
may be accounted for by the nature of any given plant. ■
Thus the cherry will ripen its fruit perfectly in the open j
air; the forcing-house, for the cherry, is far removed '
from the hothouse. Few kinds of the grape, however ;
favored by aspect and shelter, come to maturity under ;
the influence of our natural summer (the climate of En- ■
gland) ; and most of the sorts which are forced would ;
never ripen under it ; the grape forcing-house and the ■■
hothouse are, therefore, convertible things." — Encyclo- \

If it be intended to winter-force, you must not com- |
mence.the process, the first year, before the first of I
March ; the second year, you may begin the middle of ;
February ; the third year, the first of February, and so
on, fifteen days earlier every year, until you reach the \
first of December ; bej^oud this you can hardly go, as i
this allows only time to prune and clean the vine after itM
has gone into rest. |
The first of March is recommended as the best time i
to commence fire-heat for the main crop of grapes ; this j
can hardly be considered as forcing ; it is a simple pro- '
tection and aid to the natural growth, and as heavy if
not larger crops can be matured as in a cold house.
In a house that is forced in December or January,
