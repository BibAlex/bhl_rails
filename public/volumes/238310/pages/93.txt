126 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
and prevent too great an accumulation of it ; the person
having charge will soon, by attention, ascertain how
much ventilation is required under such circumstances.
It ^vill be preferable to have a low temperature, and
changing betw^een sixty-five and eighty, than by having
the house closed, the heat raised, for even a very short
time, to one hundred, or one hundred and twenty, wdiich
would be the case in changeable weather, should the sun
shine forth suddenly, and the house be entirely closed.
This must never be allow-ed, but, as soon as there is a
prospect of the sun shining, open the lights a little, and
continue opening as the heat increases.
Avoid sudden changes of the temperature as much as
possible, and the air should, at all times, be admitted
gradually."
* In regulating the temperature of the grapery, care should be had to
prevent the too great accumulation of heat from the sun ; to avoid this, the
windows, or the ventilators, must be opened a little as soon as the heat
begins to increase, and thus, little bj little, as the mercury rises ; by this
method, jonv vines will not be exposed to the injurious effects of sudden
changes, as would be the case, if you allowed the windows and doors to
remain closed until the sun shone full and strong upon it; in such manage-
ment, upon admitting air, the temperature would be lowered in consequence,
which, with an increasing of the sun's rays, would be highly improper, and
should never be allowed. Some sudden change may render this rise of
temperature, in a degree, unavoidable; if this should occur, air must be
allowed to enter at once, in sufficient quantity to prevent any further
accumulation of it.
In a grapery without artificial heat, it is best to accustom the vines to a
plenty of air, and a temperature somewhat in consonance with that without.
Should you, in bright and fine weather, use them to a very high
temperature, the vine would be made to require this, and, at the time of
ripening of tlie fruit, when the climate is always cooler, should the v.^eather
be cloudy, or otherwise unpropitious, you would have no means at command
to raise the temperature, and the consequence vrould bo a loss of part of
the fiuit hy slirivel and shanhlng.
