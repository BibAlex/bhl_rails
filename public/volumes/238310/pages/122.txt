THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 161
a full porcion of the solar rays, may be deemed the best.
The best aspects in the southern parts of England are
those tliat range from the eastern to the southeastern, the
last of which may be considered the very best. The
next best are those which follow in succession from south-
east to south. An aspect due south is undoubtedly a
very good one, but its exposure to those strong winds
which frequently blow from the southwest forms a great
drawback. The remaining aspects are those which range
successively from due south to due west. These are all
good ones provided they are sheltered, or partially so,
from the destructive effects of the high winds above men-
tioned. E"orth of the w^estern point, the maturation of
the wood and fruit of the vine becomes uncertain. East
by north is a very good one. ISTorth of this point, the
solar rays are not sufiiciently powerful to mature either
the wood or fruit." â€” Treatise on the Grajje^ hj Clement

Chaptal says, " That the middle of a hill side pro-
duces the best wine, the upper part the second best, and
the bottom of the hill the most inferior ;" showing, appa-
rently, that the middle location contains the esseutial
nourishment required, that, in the upper part, there is a
lack of this, and at the foot of the hill there is either
too much of it, or too much moisture.
Monsieur de la Quintiney says of the Muscat grapes,
that they " require a temperate country and the exposi-
tions of the south and east, and always a light ground ;
we seldom see any good in pure earth, and, if it be in
hot climates, in gravelly and sandy grounds." Pago
