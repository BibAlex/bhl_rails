XVI HISTORY OF THE GRAPE VINE.
The kings of France have interested themselves in the
planting of vines in their domains. There is proof that
Charlemagne had attached to the palaces which he in-
habited, vineyards, and the necessary instruments for
making wine ; and there you might behold the sovereign
enter upon the details of the management with the over-
seer.
"The garden of the Louvre, as of the other royal
houses, has contained vines since the year 1160. Louis
the young allowed annually, from their produce, six
hogsheads of wine to the rector of St. Nicholas.
" Philippe Augustus, as shown by the aecount of the
revenues for the year 1200, reported by Bussel, possessed
vineyards in Bourges, Soisons, Com.peigne, Laon, Beau-
vais, Auxerne, Corbeil, Betise, Orleans, Moret, Poissi,
Gien, Anet, Charlevane, Yerberries, Fontainbleau, Bure-
cour, Mili, and several other parts of France." — Chaptal.
" The vine was introduced by the Phoenicians into
cultivation in Europe by the way of the Mediterranean
islands, Italy, and Marseilles." — Charted.
" From the remotest records of antiquity, the vine has
been celebrated as the type of plenty and the symbol of
happiness. The pages of Scripture abound with allu-
sions to the fertility of the vine, as emblematical of pros-
perity ; and it is declared, in describing the peaceful
and flourishing state of the kingdom of Israel, during
the reign of Solomon, that ' Judah and Israel dwelt
safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree.'
