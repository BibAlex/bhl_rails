106 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
been made inside of the house, and vines planted against
the back wall, and borders made outside, and vines
trained up the rafters. The grapes upon the back wall
have, eVery one of them, shrivelled until the vines upon
the rafters had been shortened so as to admit the light
upon the back wall, and then the grapes have done well,
plainly proving that want of light was the cause, and not
the want of heat in the border. In early forcing, I have
covered one half of the border with hot dung and leaves,
two feet thick, the other half, six inches, and I never
could discover the least difference in the growth of the
vines inside, or in the fruit. The larger the leaves are
the more Jight they require to assimilate and decompose
the sap ; and this, in my opinion, is the reason why early
forced vines do not shrivel, their leaves scarcely ever
being more than half the size of those begun in March,
and the light in May and June is commonly greater than
that of July, which is, in general, a dull and showery
month. After trying everything that I had seen recom-
mended as a remedy, and feeling fully convinced, in my
own mind, that want of light was one of the causes, I
thought I would try what effect proportioning the heat
to the light would do. This I have practised for several
years, and with a success beyond my expectation.
In dull weather, I keep the house cool, and, when the
grapes begin to color, if the weather is warm, I leave the
top and front lights a little open, so as to keep up a re-
gular circulation of air in the house night and day ; and,
if the weather is cold and wet, I shut the front lights,
and a little fire is made in the front flue so as to cause
the air to circulate, but nothing like forcing is attempted.
