sect has been troublesome, to destroy them, or their eggs, j
wash the vines carefully v/ith soap suds, moderately [
strong. The first of December, protect the vines for the i
winter, by a covering of strav^, or Russia mats ; the ;
border must also be covered with seaweed, or coarse lit- \

vines bursting their buds, shutting up again before night ; |
do not hasten the pushing of the vines, but rather keep j
the house cool until the tenth of April, when it will be j
best to uncover them ; promote a free circulation of air \
in bright weather ; give some ventilation on cloudy days ; ;
