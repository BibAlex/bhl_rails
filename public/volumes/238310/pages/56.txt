"In our opinion, it is doubtful whether any material
like slaughter-house manure is fit for vine borders. Its
eflect is to cause excessive growth, and, for a little while,
large quantities of grapes ; but the efi'cct is transient,
and plants suffer finally. It is much better to employ

Here the question naturally arises, What is slaughter-

presumed that this manure varies very much, in its com-
ponent parts, in different countries, being affected by lo-
