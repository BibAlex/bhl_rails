THE CULTUEE OF THE GRAPE. 93
Cost of manure for tlie border, . . . $700 00
Interest" on the forcing-lionse, at a cost of
$15 the running foot, 100 feet, cost
$1500, at six per cent., ... 90 00
Annual breakage of glass and other wear,
furnaces, &c., 4, 60 00
Cost of fuel, 70 00
Labor on fires, watering, manuring, trim-
ming, and thinning grapes, . . . 200 00
Whole cost of the crop of grapes, . . - $1120 00
The value of the crop of grapes, 1067 pounds, would
not net the producer more than the cost, and the proba-
bility is, that there would be a loss to him. A very few
pounds of grapes are sold in Boston, in April, at $2 the
pound, and in May, at $1.50 to $2 ; but the main part of
the crop would not sell at over $1 to $1.25. The cost of
sending the fruit to market, and the expense of selling,
is from twenty-five to thirty per cent. In England, the
prices are so much higher that this process can be re-
sorted to with reason. f
* The cost of a winter forcing-house is much greater, by necessity, in a
very cold cHmate than that of a house which only requires a slight artificial
heat in spring. The extra heating apparatus alone is a great additional
cost.
•{• To show the. relative prices of grapes and forced fruits in the two
countries, I here add a memorandum, from Loudon's Magazine, of prices at
Covent Garden Market, vol. for 18^4, April, page 191: hothouse grapes,
per pound, from £1 IO5. to £1 155-. Grapes are spoken of as being re-
markably early, 28th of March.
Vol. for 1835, April, page 270, grapes are quoted at from £1 to £1 4*.,
