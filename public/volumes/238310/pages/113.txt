152 THE CULTUKS OF THE GEAFS.
frequently striking tbem together on e\'er3^ side. This
should be repeated several days, until it is evident the
fruit is all impregnated ; a fresh bunch, with the pollen in
a suitable condition, must be had at each operation. The
pollen must be dry, and in a -falling condition, to be fit for
the purpose. If your vines are so situated that a branch to
be acted upon can be brought into contact with the
branch of another kind, and the bunches interlaced, this
will be a good method of proceeding, â€” cutting av^ray tlie
male part of the blossom from the kind that is to ripen
the seed for the new kinds.
To obtain hardy grapes, in new varieties, I should re-
commend the Catawba, or the Isabella, to be impregnated
with the Frontignan, the Black July, the Golden Chas-
selas, the Pitmaston White Cluster, the Black Ham-
burgh, and Esperione ; a hybrid from any of these would
probabl}^ be a grape ripening in less time than the first two.
To obtain varieties for the glass-house : the Muscat of
Alexandria to be impregnated with any of the kinds
that ripen their fruit in a shorter time. A hybrid from
any of these would probably have the musk flavor, in
some degree ; if the object be to avoid this, some two of
the kinds free from this flavor must be selected. The
Esperione and Black Hamburghs, being always good
setters, are the best for the male plants. The Golden
Chasselas, a very beautiful fruit, but often setting poorly,
would make a suitable kind to be acted upon. The
August Muscat, being very early, could be used as a
female also. This variety might be used with the
American sorts, with a j^rospect of producing a -plant
that would be both hardy and speedy in ripening the
