THE CULTURE OF THE GEAPE. 229
course, the vines are feeble, and produce but a small
quantity of fruit each ; the shoots are also very small
and weak, but the vines being so close together, the gen-
eral aggregate of fruit produced is large.
At the vineyards on the banks of the Rhine, the vines
are supported by stakes five or six feet long ; this is the
case, generall}^, in the vineyard culture of the grape in
France. The spur-pruning is usually adopted.
In Italy, also, the same system is generally employed.
In this, and other countries, I have seen the table, or fiat
trellis nsed. — (See note to North Carolina system.) By
the road sides, the long cane-pruning is practised in the
following manner : — A vine is trained up the trunk of a
tree, and, at the height of twelve or fifteeti feet, a long-
cane of the vine is led from this tree to another, and se-
cured ; these canes, hanging in festoons, present a beau-
tiful appearance when the fruit is in p'erfection."^
In the Azores, the vines are not supported by stakes ;
usually, a small pile of stones encircles the plant, and the
bearing shoots lie on these. Muscats, and other choice
kinds, which are grown expressly for the table, are gen-
erally trained on a trellis.
At Pico, where the w^ine exported from Fayal is made,
the vine is trained on the surface of the soil, (which is
mostly volcanic rock,) between walls composed of stone,
* " As we advanced, the houses became more ItaHan-like, — and the vines,
heavy with ripening grapes, hung from bough to bough, through the mul-
berry orchards." Page 239.
"The vines which hung from tree to tree, were ahnost breaking beneath
clusters as heavy and rich, as those which the children of Israel bore on
staves, from the Promised Land." — Page 276. Yiews A-Foot, by J. Bayard
Taylor. New York, 1846.
