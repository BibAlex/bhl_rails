THE CULTUEE OF THE GRAPE. 165
tliG cultivation of the vine varies with the cliinato in
which the culture of this pUxnt is introduced. We do
not speak here of the superior layers of soil, which
would make such an assertion hazardous. Experience
has demonstrated, that, in the southerly (meridionaux)
departments, the vine flourishes in volcanic earth, in the
(freestone) grit, and in the granitic gravel, mixed with
vegetable earth and with some clay, (alumine). Towards
the centre of France, they succeed in the schistes, (slaty)
and above all in the calcareous rock, which crumbles on
exposure to the air. At the north, they prefer the coarse
gravel combined with calcareous earth. But everywhere
you may make use of collections of earths and stones
(almost monstrous,) of all kinds, provided that the mass
be permeable to water, and retain but little moisture.
All agree that an essential quality for a good earth for
the vine, is, that it should possess a mixture of quartz,
of flint, and coarse gravel. The rays of the sun pene-
trate these stones and furnish warmth during the day,
and distribute it to the plants by night. This is not all :
in earths exceedingly porous, they yet serve, by the eitect
of their solidity and quantity, to diminish the too rapid
evaporation of the moisture. Besides, (Anally,) it is by
the vegetables that the soil produces that we can best
judge of its quality, and of the temperature of the cli-
mate. Wherever the cultivator shall see the peach tree
prosper naturally, he may conclude the situation is favor-
able for the culture of the vine." Page 246.''^

the United States, more particularly the European kinds, render this re-
