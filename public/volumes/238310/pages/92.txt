THE CULTUKE OF THE GRAPE. 125
after it has once taken hold of the bunch, there is no
remedy ; the part aflected must be lost. In September,
cut out all the laterals from the new cane, as directed
last year.
This treatment of the vine will give you delicious
fruit, well-colored, and, consequently, high-flavored ; in
black grapes, it may be laid down as a general rule, that
wlien fully ripe^ the blacker the grape, the more spirited
and richer the juice ; bunches w^eighing about one pound
are usually better ripened than larger ones. The berries
of the Black Hamburgh, grown by these rules, w^ill
measure tljree and four inches round. This grape is of-
ten grown of a slightly reddish tinge, and sometimes
wdth very large berries, very svv^eet, indeed, but deficient
in flavor.
This is a simple process, but the practical operation of
it involves much labor and unremitted attention: After
all is done that is required by pruning, thinning, watering,
&c., much depends upon the proper ventilation and heat
of the house ; this must be opened and shut as the
weather changes ; if clouds are constantly passing during
the day, and the sun alternately obscured or shining, it
will be difhcult to regulate the temperature ; a partial
opening of the top lights will allow the heat to escape,
footstalk, or stem of the bunch ; in either case, it causes the fruit beyond
the affected spot to shrivel, turn acid, and become worthless. "When only
the footstalk is injured, it is termed sln-ivel; when a shoulder, or part of the
main bunch, it is said to be shanked. When it first appears, it is of a
brown color, and is on one side of the stem only ; at this time, removing
the spot with a sharp knife will often stay its progress ;. when this is not
done, it will soon spread around and meet, thu8 girdling the part affected,
and as completely destroying the fruit beyond, as if it had been cut off.
