THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 153
fruit. The Scnppernong, bearing fruit only a few berries
in a bunch, is objected to as a parent for a new sort for
the greenhouse on that account.
If Mr. Yan Mons's system of producing new kinds by
seeds from wildlings be attempted, it would be best to
try seed from all kinds, the very small, as well as the
good-sized berries.
Insects. â€” In Massachusetts, there are but few insects
that feed upon the grape leaf. The rose bugs, the past
year or two, have been troublesome, and, in some sec-
tions of the United States, they are very much so ; being
sometimes so numerous as to eat, in a few days, every
cluster of fruit buds, or of blossoms, upon the vine.
The most effectual method of destroying them is by
hand ; covering them (when wet with dew in the morn-
ing,) with wood ashes, or lime is said to answer, repeat-
ing the application two ov three times. Spreading a
cloth over the vine, and filling the space around under
this with tobacco smoke, will cause them to fall,- when
they can be destroyed by pouring suds made from whale-
oil soap upon them. When the grape is grown on a
small scale, and the I'ose bugs destroy the blossom, cover-
ing the bunch with a gauze bag will be found effectual in^
staying their ravages.
The large green worm (commonly called the potato
w^orm,) is, in some localities, very injurious later in the
season ; when in large numbers, it is such a voracious
creature it will soon eat all the foliage of a vine. When
it is known to be at work, which will be by the leaves
being rapidly eaten, all but the stems, it must be sought
for and destroyed. It will be frand, commonly, on. the
