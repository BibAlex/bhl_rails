160 THD CFLTURE OF THE GRAPE.
the first warm days of spring, to be blasted by the burn-
ing rays of the siin operathig upon the small icicles, each
of which acts as a lens. A southern ex|)0sure (he con-
tinues,) is generally too hot in a warm climate, and a
western one is least to be desired, as the plant there re-
ceives a direct heat after the early hours of the day have
abstracted the moisture, and, therefore, dries and burns
it ; and he recommends, as a general rule, that, in south-
ern regions, an eastern aspect should have the preference,
and, in northern ones, that a southern exposure should be
selected." â€” Princess Treatise^ P^g^ ^^'
Yet there are exceptions to these rules. Yineyards
with northern exposures have become celebrated, proba-
bly owing to favorable circumstances of soil. In the
southern part of the United States, it will be best to try
every situation, as the retarding of vegetation a short
time might be the means of saving the fruit, either from
being destroyed by a late frost, or from excessive rains,
at the time of inflorescence, or from rot, caused by too
much wet, at a later period.
The plan pursued by American horticulturists in vine-
yard and garden culture, in some instances in their own
language, is described, and as it appears settled from
these accounts that our native grapes (different varieties
succeeding in various sections of the country,) answer
every purpose of vineyard culture, there does not appear
to be any occasion to try any others, excepting on a small
scale for the dessert.
Mr. Hoare says, "In the choice of a good aspect,
therefore, shelter from high winds, and those aspects
that are the least exposed to their effects, and that receive
