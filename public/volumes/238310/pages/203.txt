298 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
Bowker, one vine.
Bishop, one vine.
Black Portugal or Ferrar, one vine.
Prince Albert, three vines.
VARIETIES MOST VALUABLE FOR GENERAL PLANTING.
For planting, I would recommend the different varie-
ties of the Black Hamburgh grape as the best for the
greatest number of vines.
The Grizzly, the White and the Black Frontignan are
all admired by those persons who like the Muscat flavor ;
they are liable to shrivel, and are more delicate than
other grapes, and do not keep well when ripe ; the
Grizzly is the earliest of them.
The Muscat of Alexandria is a large oval grape ; it
does not set well under glass, anfl requires artificial im-
pregnation ;^' it is a firm-fleshed or breaking grape, and
when well ripened, cannot be exceeded in richness.
The Tottenham Park Muscat is very like the above,
but not so high flavored, it sets the berries better.
Portuguese Muscat is like the above, but is more
highly musk flavored.
Chasselas de Bar Sur Aube is a fine white grape, and
a good bearer.
Pitmaston White Cluster has rather small berries, but
is very early and good.
* Otis Johnson, Esq., of Lynn, a successful cultivator of tlie grape, tJie
past year, allowed the shoots of this variety to grow at random until the
fruit was swelling, and he thinks the result of the experiment was favora-
ble: the fruit set remarkably well.
