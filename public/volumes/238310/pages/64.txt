THE CULTUKE OF THE GEAPE. 91
the roots -have so extended themselves, tliat tliej will
suffer for the want of further protection.
Where grapes are grow^n under glass on an extensive
scale, it would be difficult to obtain fresh stable manure
in sufficient quantities (in most parts of our country it
would be impossible,) to make it practicable, and the
expense of so doing would be more than the value of the
crop would warrant. In the vicinity of large cities, and
occasionally in other localities, this manure may be ob-
tained cheaply, and in suffi'cient quantities for the pur-
pose ; where this is the case, the objection to it, on the
score of expense, is obviated.
A grapery one hundred feet long would require a
burder one hundred and ten feet in length and twenty-
four feet wide. As, by Mr. Eoberts^s plan, the border is
to be covered with this heating manure and leaves /bi^r
feet beyond where the roots of the vine extend, and two
and a half feet deep, in a few years, or as soon as tlie
^'ines have become established, it follows, that the enor-
mous quantity of 65j/^ cords of manure would be re-
quired, to cover in this manner, the border where the
roots are now presumed to have extended themselves ;
thus, one hundred and twenty feet long, twenty-eight feet
wide, and two and a half feet deep.
In our cold winter, I found it necessary to renew the
heat by adding one fourth part of the new manure, and
working it in with the old, every three or four weeks.
On a border to a house winter-forced, that is, where forc-
ing commences in December, this quantity of manure
vvould be doubled by the renewals. It is true that you
would have about half the original bulk of the manure
