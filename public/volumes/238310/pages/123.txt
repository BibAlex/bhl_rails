162 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
The Penny Cjclopssclia says of the aspect : *' On the
steep slopes of hills towards the south, and sheltered
from the northeast, the grapes attain the greatest matu-
rity, and the vintage is most certain. So great an influ-
ence has a favorable exposure, that in the same vineyard
the greatest difference exists between the wine made
from one part and that made from another, merely be-
cause there is a turn round the hill, and the aspect varies
a very few degrees. A change of soil produces a similar
effect. The f\\mous Ehine wine, called Johannisbergh,
when made from the grapes which grow near the castle,
is worth twice as much as that made a few hundred
yards farther off. Here both soil and aspect change.
The Glos de Voiigeau, which produces the finest Bur-
gundy, is confined to a few acres ; beyond a certain wall,
the wine is a common Burgundy, good, but without ex-
traordinary merit."
At Bourdeaux, a southeast exposure is preferred, and
in Germany, generally, a southwest ; in some places, a
northern exposure is thought best, as the danger from
late frosts is less.
Chaptal is considered as the best French authority on
the vine. His object, in his Treatise on the Grape, was
to promote the improvement of the quality of the wine,
and to discourage the use of manures, as one of the
main causes of this inferiority. The practical ideas of
this treatise are mostly attributed to the Abbe Hosier, of
whom it is said, "that, retiring to the home of his
fathers, he, for a long time, practised agriculture, not
only studying all previous systems of vine culture, but
comparing the old with his experience, the local practices
