kind of soil, its effects will seldom disappoint tlie expec-

By an experienced grape grower. — This person says
the border " should be from thirty to forty feet in width,
and should be formed of loamy soil, sharp sand, and at
least a fourth part of well rotted horse dung." — S. A. J/,
Loudon''s Magazine., vol. 10th, p. 266.
By xi. Forsyth. — " At the back wall of the grapery,
the soil is prepared to the depth of six feet ; and at the
further extremity of the border, (sixteen feet wide,) there
are three and a half feet of soil composed of equal parts
of the following soils : turfy loam, (the top spit of a very
old undisturbed piece of pasture, occupied as a rick
yard,) two parts ; rotten dung, one part ; lime rubbish,
one part ; gritty mud, (the same as road drift,) one part."

By Jasper Wallace, gardener to William Forsyth, Esq.,
of Cayton. — " The situation for the border, if not natu-
rally dry, must be made so by draining. The best bot-
tom, in my opinion, is one formed of large flat stones got
from the top of a lime rock, which is of a nature that
would assist the growth of the vines when they reached
it. The border ought not to be deeper than from two
feet to three feet ; as, if it is more, the roots of the vines
will get away from the action of the summer weather,
and the good of the manure that may be put on the sur-
face. I would have the border formed of decomposed
turf and good black earth, with a sufficient quantity of
decomposed cow dung, vegetable mould, and slaked lime,
well mixed by frequently turning it, and which shuuld
be allowed to lie for two years, if convenient.
