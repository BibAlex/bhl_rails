THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 55
light, ricli, loamy earth, enriched with rotten manure,
ground bones, and lime. It is better to extend the bor-
der in breadth than in depth." — Charles Mclntosli^ Lon-
don, 1839.
Clement Iloare, in an after-edition of his work on the
Grape Yine, recommends that, for winter-forcing, the
vines be planted on the inside of the grapery, and, to do
this properly, he says the soil should be removed from
the inside of the house, which is to be supported by a
wall of solid masonry on all sides to prevent the roots of
the vines penetrating it to the outside. After the soil is
removed, his plan is to pave the ground with brick, set
in cement, and this space is intersected with brick work,
witli openings occasionally, for the roots to penetrate and
ramble. This brick work is to be a support for the
bricks which are to cover the whole, after completion.
The substances, in which the vines are to grow, are bro-
ken bricks, lumps of mortar, charcoal., and bones, in
equal proportions, soaked in urine. His idea is, that these
materials, once moistened and then placed in the situa-
tion prepared as above, can never become dry; that the
moisture of the earth will keep the whole mass suffici'ent-
iy supplied with water, and that it never can have an ex-
cess. In planting the vines, the roots are to be carefully
spread out, freed from all soil. It is advised to have two
pieces of woolen blanket, which are to be first soaked in
soap suds, to plant the vines in, — one to be spread on
the bottom and the roots laid on this, and the other to
cover them ; when this is done, cover over with the com-
post above named, and, when, the whole is paved over on
the top, the work is complete. This, it will be observed,
