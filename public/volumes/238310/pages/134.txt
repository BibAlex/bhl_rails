THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 195
grapes, in the open air, in Massaclinsetts, Ihe fruit ripen-
ing on but very few vines. On vines exposed to the chie
south, where the soil was dry, or well drained, the fruit
ripened when the vines were judiciously pruned, and
curtailed of their over-abundance of fruit; in wet situa-
tions, it failed entirely.
The effect of a warm, dry soil, is to cause the sap to
rise, and the shoots to put forth early in the spring, and
generally influencing the early ripening of the fruit.
This fact, when acted upon, in situations where the cli-
n:iate is sufficiently mild, can be made of service in
lengthening the season for this fruit ; as, by planting
vines in wet situations also, you will have a succession of
fruit.
H. W. S. Cleveland, Esq., of Burlington, K J., has a
vineyard of the Isabella, and is increasing it largely.
The following is Mr. Cleveland's account of his vine-
yard, furnished me for publication, at my request : â€”
" My vineyard comprises between two and three acres,
and is situated on the south side of the Delaware River,
one mile above Burlington. The land is level, and is a
rich mellow loam. The vines were planted by the
former proprietors of the farm, in 1840, and I am told,
by a laborer, who assisted in planting them, that there
w^as no other preparation of the soil than deep plough-
ing. Some of the vines are now ten inches in circum-
ference at the surface of the ground. The rows of vines
are eight feet apart, and the vines sixteen feet apart in
the rows. They are trained on trellises six feet high, the
posts of which are eight feet apart, and the lowest slat
of the trellis two feet from the ground, the nest four, and
