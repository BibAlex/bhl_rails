when shut, that it can be kejDt open to allow the air to
enter the liouse as wanted, in greater or smaller quanti-

ends, the lower sashes are made like the side ones, hut
they are all stationary. (In this house, only every other
one of the sashes are made to open ; they can all be so,

the inclination of the roof.
The roof is formed by rafters made of plank ; they

two on each side of the upper sash ; they are of cast iron,

In the upper sash, the stiles are the same as in the un-
