THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 199
ceive any diiFerence in their growth. As soon as the
eyes had pushed enongh to be tied, I pulled out the
scion which had the weakest shoot, and trained the other
up under the rafters. They all grew that season to the
top of the roof, fourteen feet, and were there stopped. In
the fall, there were ten of them which I judged to be
stout enough for fruit, and I cut them down to five buds
each. They bore, and ripened their fruit well, and have
continued to bear, more and more, the two seasons since.
I allowed one, the past season, to bear twenty pounds,
which was too much, and it was not well colored. The
rest bore about twelve pounds each, and ripened it well.
Two of them made rather long-jointed wood the first
season, and were cut down to one bud in the fall, and
the next season one of the shoots from one of these buds
got broken oiF by accident, and I immediately cut off the
stem, under ground, and grafted a second scion into the
first. This was in June. It grew perfectly well, and
has fruited for two seasons past. The kinds I engrafted
were the Black Hamburgh, Yictoria, Black Prince, and
White Sweetwater. I have been unable to j^erceive any
difference between the size, color, and flavor of the fruit,
from that of the vines on their own stocks.
" The insects which breed in our light soil, are a great
trouble here. The rose-bugs attack them while in blos-
som, and, unless a direct attack is made upon them, they
soon destroy a large crop of bloom. I have boys with
tin cups, with a little spirits of turpentine in them, who
go through the vineyards every morning, during the
three weeks or thereabouts, that this bug exists, collect-
ing them into these cups, where they are instantly killed.
