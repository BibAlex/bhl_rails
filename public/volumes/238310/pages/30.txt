eiime line witli tlie oritside of the studs. The comer
posts are six inches square. The height of the studs,
between the sill and the plate, is six feet one inch.
(They must be made longer, to allow for the part used in
the mortise.) The upright sashes are three feet ten
inches wide, and six feet one inch long, and glazed, with
six by eight glass. The stiles, or side pieces of the
sashes, are two and one fourth inches wide^ and one and
three eighths inches thick, and the rails, or top and bot-
tom pieces, are two and three fourths wide ; the inside
pieces, of which there are four, are one and three eighths
inches wide, and seven eighths of an inch thick ; they
are rabbeted to take the glass ; they go from top to bot-
tom. There are no cross-pieces used for glazing, but this
is begun at the bottom of the sash, and. the next glass
lapped on the first about one fourth of an inch, (not any
more, as it is more likely to break.) and so on, one above
the other ; all the sashes are glazed in this manner ;
there are five rows of glass to a sash. The sashes are
strengthened in the middle by a ])iece of iron, one inch
wide and one fourth of an inch thick, which is cut in
even with the surface of the sash, on the inside, and se-
cured with a screw in each stile and inside piece which
supports the glass. These sashes are hung on hinges at
the top, and open out, and are fastened on the inside
with ])i8ces of iron one fourth of an incli thick and one
inch Vv'ide. This is about foua-teen inches Ion;:!;, and it is
secured to the rail of the sash by a staple ; and, to hold
the sash closed or open at any desired distance from two
to ten inches, another staple is driven into the sill ; the
