THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 2^5
No. 5, was the extract of meadow muck, whicli had
been under cover several years ; one pound of the soil,
to which was added a very little pot-ash, was steeped in
water several days, and strained off into a bottle, and ap-
plied as the roots consumed the liquid. This afforded a
suitable food, and the spongioles continued to grow and
increase raj^idly for three weeks, when they received a
check, and ceased growing, and were changing color;
the bottle was removed, and the roots placed carefully
into one filled with simple rainwater again ; this saved
tliem, and they again began growing. The liquid, which
had before proved too powerful, was now supplied them;
as they consumed the water in the bottle, they grew as
rapidly as before the check, and formed a fine, strong-
rooted vine, which is now in the border.
Ko. 6, was manured with the liquid drainings from the
hog-pen ; although very much diluted, the first application
destroyed the young roots. In renewing the trial, the
liquid which had caused this, was used as the same ma-
nure, still further diluted, and the effect was good ; the
bottle was filled with roots.
No. 7, was manured with the extract of the leaves and
young shoots, trimmings of the grape vine ; these were
steeped a few days, and kept warm ; when applied to the
water in the bottles, it was quite acid. This destroyed
life very soon, the acid being too powerful. On repeating
the experiment, and after applying the same liquid, when
the acidity had passed away, the roots made with vigor
and rapidity; this formed a plant, now flourishing in
the soil.
No. 8, was another trial with guano, in a more diluted
