212 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
with a similar request for a statement, when they are
ready to ' report progress.' — Editor of the Horticul-

I have never had the rot attack a grape in the open
air. In the grapery with too much dampness, or in very
wet weather, it sometimes appears, and is easily checked
by fires, drying the air of the house. It shows itself first on
the White Frontignan, in small brown dots, very minute;

communication above, it must be a diff'erent disease from

abroad, where the grape thrives best ;" but I have
always understood, that, if the weather was too wet, even
in those countries, they suffered from this evil, particu-
larly when the wet weather came when the fruit was
ripening or ripe.
