112 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
about three inches under the surface, and three to four
feet apart; if the border is only twelve feet wide, five
feet is near enough, or, if very large bunches and grapes
are desired, without regard to the quantity produced,
they should never be nearer together than four feet, be
the border narrow or wide. If the house has been built
on posts, as directed, let the head of the vine, after plant-
ing, be three inches from the front, on the inside, â€” the
roots being on the outside. If the vines are planted in
the fall, they should be cut back to three eyes imme-
diately ; but, if planted in the spring, they must be al-
lowed to grow until the shoots are one inch long, when
rub off all but the three lower shoots.*
VINES FOR PLANTING.
The vines for planting should be in pots, and one or
two years old ; before planting, they should be kept
quite dry a few days, as the roots are more easily sepa-
rated.
If the plants are growing, leave off watering them
until they begin to droop, when you can plant them out ;
the risk of injuring them will be lessened, and the free
open border; wlien the vines are planted on the inside, the roots will
grow with rapidity, and push as straight as possible for the border outside
of the house,' thus proving that they prefer to be under the influence of the
full effects of the sun, air, and rain upon the soil.
Do not shake the vine after planting, as sometimes advised ; it can do no
good, and will probably break some of the rootlets.
* If the border is in a suitable condition, the vines do equally well when
planted at any time after the fall of the leaf. If they are in pots, I know
of no reason why they may not be planted at any season of the year.
