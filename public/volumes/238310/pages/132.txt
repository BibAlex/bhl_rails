THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 193
titles of the Isabella and Catawba for the table, which
are sent to the New York market for sale.
January 17th, 1842.â€” This gentleman wrote an ac-
count of his vineyard, for the " Orchardist's Companion,"
in which he states, " that he has been, for more than ten
years, extensively engaged in the cultivation of some of
our native grapes." At this time he considered the Isa-
bella and Catawba the preferable kinds for cultivation.
Under date of February 22d, 1848, he writes me, that he
is still of this opinion, and " that he is experimenting
with some other varieties, but, at present, I am not pre-
pared to give any native vine I have ever tried, a prefer-
ence over them. I have twenty acres of these grapes
under successful cultivation, and am making preparation
for putting out four acres more, the coming spring. I
plant on the side of hills and level surfaces ; either an-
swer equally well in this climate.* The mildew, which
was, at a former period, troublesome, has, with the ge-
nerally improved character and quality of the fruit, dis-
appeared. They do not suffer from the rot, save in con-
fined situations, during very warm, rainy seasons. My
Isabella grapes, which have improved so much in qua-
lity by cultivation, during the past twelve years, mature
earlier, and are far less subject to injury from climate or
other causes, than formerly. Indeed, an Isabella grape
vineyard properly planted, with acclimated vines, and
cultivated as they should be, will, in this climate^ give a
Trior e certain annual croj^ than Indian cornP
