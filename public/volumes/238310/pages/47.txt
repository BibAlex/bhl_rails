48 THE CULTUllE OF THE GRAPE.

Such as in cheerful vales we view from high,
"Which dripping rocks with rolling streams supply,
And feed with ouzo ; where rising hillocks run
In length, and open to the southern sun ;
Where fern succeeds, ungrateful to the plough,
That gentle ground to generous grapes allow.'
" As tlie vegetable mould from decayed leaves cannot
always be obtained, by reason that the leaves require to
lie two years before they become sufficiently putrid and
reduced, it may be necessary to substitute some other in-

wood reduced to a fine mould : the scrapings of the

compost suitable for the vine with as much eiTect as the
former ; as blood, the ofi'al of animals or shambles, horn

can be introduced and incorporated with the other part
of the compost. The dust, or dirt, from roads consists
