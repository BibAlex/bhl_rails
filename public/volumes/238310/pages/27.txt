GLASS HOUSES HOW CONSTRUCTED.
Glass houses, for horticultural purposes, may be con-
structed in a great variety of forms, to suit the particular
circumstances of the place, or ground where it is to be
located.
It is important to have as little obstruction to the admis-
sion of light, and as little solid wood work, as is consistent
with a proper degree of strength in the frame and sashes
which are to support the glass, as possible. It is also im-.
portant, in frigid climates, to guard against the admission
of cold, or the escape of heat ; consequently, the ends
and the back, or the north side of the house, are usually
built of wood, stone, or brick. Oiled paper and cloth,
and other preparations on cloth, have been used for cover-
ing the roof, but with no good result ; glass is the only
article that can be used to advantage. To admit air,
which is essential to the flavor of the fruit, and the well-
being of the plant, the front lights, or windows, as also
the upper part of the roof-sashes, are made to open out,
or to run on rollers.
The curvilinear roof is approved by many. The fol-
lowing description of some houses of my own, which
answer the purpose for which they were constructed
perfectly well, and the manner of building them, toge-
ther with the cost, accompanied with a view of these, is
deemed sufficient for this treatise.
