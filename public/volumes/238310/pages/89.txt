122 THE CULTUHE OF THE GKAPE.
some of tlie lights at night, unless there is danger of
frost, or rain.
About the last of May, the shoots will be from one to
three feet long ; train up the leading one the same as last
rear, and cut back the others to one leaf beyond the
bunch of fruit to be retained for ripening ; the bunch
nearest the cane is the one usually left on for this
purpose f' cut off all the others ; nevcF leave more than
one bunch on a spur, and cut away all the fruit from
every alternate spur ; when this is done, and there are
still more than oight good-sized bunches remaining,
reduce them to this number ; these will be quite enough
for the vine to mature the first year of bearing ; if the
bunches are very large, you must cut off still more ; do
not allow over ten pounds of fruit to ripen ou each vine ;
they probably will average not less than one pound to
the bunch.
Occasionally, it will be necessary to go over the vines
and stop the laterals that push on the leading cane and
on the spurs, by cutting them back to one eye ; it will be
found a saving of labor, to perform this pruning at regu-
lar intervals of a fortnight during the season ; continue
this until they cease growing ; the leading cane should
be stopped as soon as it reaches the top of the house,
leaving one or two laterals at the top to grow a few daj^s,
w^ien you should cut back one of them, and leave the
other a few days longer, when that must be cut back also.
* It sometimes happens, that a spur will have four or five bunches on
the shoot, the nearest one to the cane being at the second leaf; when this
occurs, it is best to leave, for ripening:, the second bunch, cutting away the
others.
