146 THE CULTUEE OF THE GRAPE.
venient. These materials sLould be mixed together a
few weeks before using, and in these proportions : sods,
three parts ; leaf mould, two parts ; cow-dung, two
parts ; rubbish, or leached ashes and charcxDal, one part.
There should be one or two inches of broken pots, stones,
or shells, at the bottom, for drainage. A vine in a
twelve-inch pot may mature from five to ten bunches.
I prefer a wooden box, or the half of a large keg, as the
soil is less liable to dry and form into a lump ; when this
is the case, the water is very apt to run away by the
sides of the pot, between these and the soil, leaving the
middle of the soil perfectly dry. In the autumn, after a
vine has fruited, it should be taken out of the pot and
the soil shaken from the roots ; with a sha^p knife, prune
back the longest of these, and repot in fresh compost.
During the winter, they must be kept from the frost, and
tbe only care necessary will be to see that the soil has
just enough moisture to prevent the roots from drying
up. The next summer they must not be fruited, but
proper care must be bestowed upon them that they may
produce good bearing wood for the year after.
Yines grown by single eyes, or such as would be used
for the border, are suitable for planting in pots. You
may force these vines to advantage as early as K'oveni-
ber, if you have a proper temperature.
Liquid manure may be given when the grapes com-
mence swelling off. This may be made as detailed in
the experiments on the roots of the vine in bottles, and
any of those may be selected for use, as is most conve-
nient, or as may be thought best. If guano is used, four
pounds to thirty-three gallons of water is quite strong
