THE CULTURE OF THE GEAPE. 113
watering, after the roots are spread oat, will immediately
settle them in their position, and thej will grow rapidly.
If grown on the place, or to be obtained near, young
plants, in pots, just rooted, can be used. Turn them
out with the ball of earth entire, and plant, without dis-
turbing the roots, on the inside, near the front of the
house. ^ I have planted such vines, and they have come
into bearing as soon as older ones ; they are to be pre-
ferred to old vines, as the latter are very much injured in
transplanting, if they have been growing in the open
border ; if in pots, the roots are so matted together, that,
in separating them, many will be broken off.
GRAFTING- THE VINE.
T. A. Knight, Esq., in a paper read to the Horticul-
tural Society, in.September, 1821, says, "I selected three
cuttings of the Black Hamburgh grape, each having at
its base one joint of two years' wood ; these were in-
serted in, or rather fitted to, branches of nearly*the same
size, but of greater age, and all succeeded most per-
fectly. The clay which surrounded the base of the grafts
was kept constantly moist, and the moisture thus supplied
to the grafts operated very beneficially, at least, if it was
not essential to the success of the operation."
Mr. J. D. Parks says, " The best time for grafting is
when the stock is far advanced in growth as the setting
of the fruit. The stock should then be cut down, the
