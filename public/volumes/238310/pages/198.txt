THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 291
one and two pounds each ; the berries were large, and
well colored. The second border was made a few years
after the first ; the manures nsed were similar to the
above ; but, instead of stones, the bottom of the border
was paved with bones, and well covered with them ; the
vines have always done well, and ripened good crops of
fine fruit. The third border was paved, at the bottom,
with stones, as whole bones could not be obtained. The
manures, in this border, were entirely from the barn-
yard, from horses and oxen ; it was very coarse, having
much litter and old (Indian) cornstalks in it ; the soil
was the garden loam, which had been freely manured
with barn-yard material; the proportion of manure
added was one half, certainly, and perhaps rather more.
In this border, the vines have made the most rapid growth
of any that I have planted : but the fruit produced
therein, although very fair and well-colored, is not large,
the berries measuring two and a half to three and a half
inches round, for Hamburghs ; while, in the houses,
where bones and slaughter-house manures, or the car-
casses of animals are added to the compost, the berries
measure from three to four inches in circumference.
By far the largest part of my borders were made, since
the above, in 1843. Slaughter-house manures, bones, the
carcasses of animals, old mortar and bricks, oyster-shells,
horse and cow manure, old leather and loam, were added
in considerable quantities. I have not discovered any
reason for wishing to change the compost. At the end
of the house, in a space used for the furnace, no manure
was added on the outside, as the street of the city was
here. The soil was a good yellow loam, and, on the street,
