HISTORY OF THE GRAPE VINE. Xlll
ings of the promised land, ' a land of wheat, and barley,
and vines,' etc.
" At what exact period the vine was first cultivated in
England, is uncertain ; but we conclude it was as early
as about the tenth year, A. D., as, at that time, the Ro-
mans had possession of a great part of this island, and
had introduced the luxuries of Italy wherever they set-
tled. Many authors are of opinion that it was not intro-
duced into this country until about the year 280.
" That we are indebted to the Romans for the first in-
troduction of the vine is generally allowed, although it is
jjossible it might have been introduced at a much earlier
period than we have stated, as the Phoenicians are said
to have planted the vine in the isles of the Mediterranean
Sea, as well as in several parts of Europe and Africa ;
and as we have accounts of their trading to Britain, for
tin, they might have planted it on the English coast
also. But this must remain a matter of conjecture any
farther than as it confirms the vine to have been origi-
nally brought from Palestine. In the Book of jN^umbers
we find that the meÂ«n whom Moses had sent to spy
the land of Canaan, returned with a bunch of grapes
which they bare between two, upon a staff*.

found to weigh upwards of twenty-five pounds tlie
bunch. In the accounts from .zEsiidus Yan Eo-niont, en-
