THE CULTURE OF THE GKAPE. 189
tail]. If it is intended to form a vineyard on a gravelly
hill, or other spot with such soil, I would use, of these,
bones and charcoal, and as much loam from an old pas-
ture, which had been enriched for years by the droppings
of sheep and cattle, as could be obtained. If none of
the articles above named, for the purpose of keeping the
earth loose, can be had, other, the best substitute, must
be used ; vegetable mould, leaves, straw, shavings, and
chips of wood, &c., are suitable.
With regard to manures for enriching the land, I
would have a compost heap prepared, into which should
be incorporated, with reference to the ease of obtaining
them, any and every article of animal or vegetable mat-
ter capable of decomposition. In applying them to the
land, the condition of the soil must be taken into con-
sideration, giving more or less according to its richness,
or the reverse. The purpose for which the grapes are to
be grown must be considered ; if for dessert more nour-
ishment will be required ; if for wine, a less quantity
will answer.
After a vineyard has become established, (which will
be in five years, according to Chaptal,) if manures are
scarce, they may be more economically used by spread-
ing and digging them in, when new ; but it is necessary
to be cautious in applying neAV and raw manures to all
fruit-bearing plants ; inexperienced persons should never
apply any but manures from the compost heap, or that
have been meliorated by age. If guano is to be used, it
is safer to do so by forming a mixture with this and ve-
getable mould, or loam. As a liquid manure, it is ser-
viceable, using four pounds, at most, to a barrel of water.
