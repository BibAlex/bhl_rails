118 THE CULTUKE OF THE GRAPE.
or trellis ; stop all tlie laterals as they appear at one eye
or leaf; continue to clieck them, as they push again, in
the same way. The second shoot on last year's wood
may be cut entirely out in June, or, as soon as it is cer-
tain that no accident to the leading cane will require the
use of this as a substitute ; the shoots on the sj^urs of the
old wood must be stopped, as often as they push, by cut-
ting them back to one eye.
Stop the leading cane when it has grown about fifteen
feet, and before it reaches the top of the house ; allo\7
the upper lateral to grow ; this will prevent the eyes on
the upper part of the cane from bursting. Tiiis lateral
should be cut back to one eye, after it has grown three
or four feet ; if it still continue growing strong, check it
again.
Early in July, dust sulphur on the floor of the house,
to prevent mildew ; to be effectual, one pound should be
used for every twenty square feet of the house. If mil-
dew should make its appearance, and continue to in-
crease, syringe the vines at evening, and dust the foliage
also with it.'"'
Mildew is a fungus, which perfects its seed in a very
* Nathaniel Silsbee, Jr., Esq., informs me, that in his grapery, wliieh is
a cold house, ho covers the floor twice, every summer, with sulphur, and
recommends its application in the middle of the day, as, at that time, part
of it will rise and settle on the vine, but, iff such small particles, as to do
no injury. He has found this effectual in preventing mildew. If this fun-
gus makes its appearance before the sulphur is apiolied, it will be more dif-
ficult to suppress its growth. It has been very troublesome, in late houses,
this July, (1848,) and I had to dust the foliage and fruit before it was.check-
ed, and the quantity used was much greater than that named above. In
early houses, I never have it.
