286 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
pear probable that thousands, and tens of thousands, of
these white fish, spread over the surface of the land,
would affect the foliage in the fields wherein they were
undergoing this change.
Dr. Lindley then says, " The vine-dressers of France

all are endeavoring to obtain, when cultivating for the
table, and the plan of cultivation which will produce
this, without injury to the amount of the crop, flavor, or

Dr. Lindley is of the opinion, that the grapes shown
by Mr. Gower, have surpassed those grown by Mr. Ro-
berts. From the printed account of them, [ should have
preferred to have been the one who produced the six
kinds, named as having been shown by the latter. Three
of these varieties usually setting poorly, all of which
were sufficiently large, and the White Nice, (a kind that
makes a large bunch, but a light weighing fruit,) remark-
