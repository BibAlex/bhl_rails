fourth shoots, to the lowermost bud, each ; cut ont the
lateral shoots close to the bncls.
The fifth year, train the two canes in the manner re-
presented below ; and the two shoots, which will push
from the spurs H, H, train also in tlie same way.
The vine has now assumed the form which it is per-
manently to retain, and it may be considered as the com-
mencement of a system of alternately fruiting two shoots,
and of training two, at full length, for bearing wood to
fruit the following year ; which method can be continued,
without alteration, until the vine is able to mature more
fruit, when the arms may be extended, and as many
more upright or bearing canes added as are required.
This plan may do for the Isabella, or other native
kinds ; it might answer on the back trellis of a house,
but, for the roof, it would not succeed so well, as the
shoots would occupy too much space.
