196 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
the next six. Part of the trellis is made of lath, an inch
thick and two inches wide, and part with ISTo. 12 wire.
The latter is decidedly best. It costs, in the first place,
but half as much as the lath, will, no doubt, last much
longer, makes less shade, and saves much labor of tying
up the vines, as the tendrils seize upon the wires, and
save the necessity of strings. My plan of training is, to
lay in a shoot from each vine on each side, to meet the
corresponding one from the next vine, on the lower slat,
and, as the vine becomes stronger, two more in the same
way, on the next slat. These are never cut out, and the
fruiting shoots are grown on this old wood, raising new
ones every year, and cutting out those which have borne.
I begin pruning as soon as the leaves fall, and work at it
in all mild weather, through the winter. I have pruned,
in every week, from twentieth October till tenth of
March, and never have been able, with the most careful
observation, to perceive any difference in the time of
starting, or the vigor and health of the vine or fruit.
The late pruned ones are certainly more liable to bleed,
but, if the bleeding hurts them, the injury is not yet per-
ceptible on my vines. I leave from three to five buds on
my fruiting shoots, according to their strength. More
than half the vines in this vineyard are Isabella, the rest
are Catawba, Elsinboro, Black Madeira, Norton's Seed-
ling, and one or two other inferior kinds, which I do not
know. The Isabella is the most certain. The Catawba
I think the finest grape, but it is much more liable to rot
and mildew than the Isabella. Twenty pounds to a vine
is a fair crop for either of these. The Elsinboro is very
highly esteemed in this vicinity. Its size is that of a
