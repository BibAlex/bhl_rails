156 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
Muscat of Alexandria and otlier late sorts may be tried.
The August Muscat is the earliest of any grape, and can
be tried, as it may be worthy of cultivation v/hcn the
vine becomes strong.
In November, the vines must be laid down and well
covered with straw, or litter, to protect them from the
frost, when cultivated in the northern states.
In Hovey's Magazine of Horticulture, vol. 12th, is a
communication by Mr. J. W. Russel, gardener to Horace
Gray, Esq., on the cultivation of the grape, in which he
gives the following receipt to prevent mildew. Having
found the application of sulphur to the floor of the house
all that was necessary in cultivating the grape under
glass, I have never used this preparation, but, for their
cultivation in the open air, I would strongly advise its
trial ; it should be applied in July, or earlier, if there is
any appearance of mildew on the fruit, wood or foliage.
Receipt. â€” "To one peck of quick lime, add half a
pound of sulphur ; put them into a tight barrel, and
pour boiling hot v/ater over them sufficient to slake all
the lime, and it will be found that the sulphur is mixed
with it in the best possible manner ; then pour on to the
top of it three gallons of soft water, and stir it well to-
gether, leaving it to settle ; in about twenty-four liours,
the water on the top will be perfectly clear.
"This should be taken off as clear as possible, and put
into a stone jar^ there to rem.ain until wanted. Half a
pint of this mixture will be sufficient for three gallons of
water.
" This wash will not injure either the fruit or leaves,
and no person could tell that any thing but clean water
