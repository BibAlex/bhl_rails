236 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
were all growing finely, most of them liaving been grafted
on native stocks. Tiiisjear would have tested their
quality and adaptation to this climate ; hut, I regret to
say, I have lost them all, except one of the Josling's St.
Alban's.* So soon as I can make the necessary arrange-
ments I shall again commence. After the most tho-
rough trial, I am perfectly satisfied that the foreign grape
can be cultivated in this climate with success. The cli-
mate is in every respect adapted to its cultivation, and
the soil, which in this section is objectionable, (being a
heavy clay,) is very easily remedied. The ground once
properly prepared, all that is necessary to ensure suc-
cess, is a judicious system of pruning and training the
vines. The one, in this climate, is as important as the
other, and either neglected, must end in disappointment.
The rot, which is the great evil complained of by almost
every one who has undertaken the cultivation of the
vine in the Southern States, particularly in this latitude,
is to be attributed altogether to the fatal error they have
adopted in both pruning and training. The preparation
of the soil, of course, is essential to the healthy and vig-
orous growth of the vine, and without these we cannot
have good fruit ; but it is a great mistake made by many
writers on the subject, that certain manures, upon which
the vine feeds, and which the most of our soils are de-
ficient in, will prevent the rot. The close pruning for
out door culture, adopted in Europe, and the Eastern
States particularly, will not answer for this climate. The
reason is yqvj obvious. The vine is too much exposed
