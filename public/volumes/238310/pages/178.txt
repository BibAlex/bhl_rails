THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 247
Bei'vatory was set well up with a view to have a fine
gravelled trellis, the border was eighteen inches above
the level of the lawn. The border was formed by cart-
ing in sods and good loam from an old pasture, and mix-
ing with them about one quarter of well decomposed ma-
nure from the stable yard and from old hotbeds. Tins
was done in July and August at leisure time. In the
fall, the whole w^as trenched over in a rough manner,
and about thirty bushels of ground bones added. In
this way, the soil lay till the next spring, when it was
again trenched over and ready for planting. We are not
thus particular in order to show how a border should be
made, but merely that it may be seen that a fine crop
of grapes can be obtained without all tlie quadcery so
often recommended in their formation, such as a bed of
oyster shells or boiled -bones, dead horses, cattle, and
dogs, slaughter house manure, blood, soot, &c. All that
is necessary, in our opinion, to produce the very best
grapes, is a good rich, loamy soil, well top-dressed^ every
year, with old stable manure and guano, in order to
bring the roots to the surface, rather than that they
should go to the bottom after the dead carcasses."
After planting the vines, Mr. Hovey directs, " that,
should the weather prove dry, the roots be well watered,
and tlie surface mulched with a little coarse stable ma-
nure."
The third season, the vines were allowed to bear from
two to five bunches each. Yerj^ gentle cropping, certain-
ly. Mr. H. says they were of superior quality, the vines
were not forced, and ripened their fruit in September.
