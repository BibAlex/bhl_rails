214 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
in consequence of it. I have noticed, that, whenever
wheat is injured bj the rust, the grape is, to a propor-
tionate extent, affected by the rot. They, doubtless, ori-
ginate from a common cause. As to what that cause is,
great diversity of opinion exists. My observation does
not enable me to give, with confidence, any opinion on
the subject. The young shoots, in spring, are seldom
injured by frost, except in low grounds. This fact is
now beginning to be understood by our farmers, and the
higliest ground is selected, for both vineyards and or-
chards.
" I have never tried any of the foreign varieties, Mr.
Longvvorth's experience having satisfied me, that it would
be but a waste of time and money.
" There are a considerable number of vineyards in our
county, — I cannot, of course, speak with entire accura-
cy, — but I think I cannot be far wrong, in estimating the
quantity of land devoted, at present, to the culture of
the grape, in this county, at from one hundred to one
hundred and twenty acres. In this estimate, I do not
mean to include small portions grown merely for family
use, but vineyards intended for the manufacture of wine.
This quantity will, probably, be doubled in the course of
two years more. The vineyards on the hills seem to do
much better than those immediately on the river. In
the rich, alluvial bottoms, they do not succeed well, the
fruit almost invariably rotting.
" With regard to the profit, a careful cultivator may
safely calculate on two hundred gallons of wine per acre,
one year with another; he may, with as much certainty,
calculate on selling the juice at the press, at from sixty
