94 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE
I have found the phm of covering the border with
litter (as directed in my remarks on forcing,) to answer
every purpose, and at a much less expense.
I have a small stove or winter-forcing house, where the
border is covered with movable glass, which is taken off
as soon as the grapes are ripe, or the weather becomes
warm in spring ; the border, under this, is covered with
six or eight inches of coarse litter and leaves in autumn,
and, on the outside, with the same materials, so as, in all,
to cover about twentv feet. This answers the purpose
and forced cherries at £1 lO.s. per pound, and forced strawberries, per
ounce, Q>d. to Is. 'id.
Yol. for 1836, March, page 219, forced strawberries are quoted at from
2s. Gd. to 3s. 6d per ounce, and hothouse grapes at £1 IO5. per pound.
Tlie same year, in April, page 272, strawberries are quoted at from Is. to
25. per ounce, and grapes at from 10s. to £1 per pound.
In May, page 328, strawberries were the same price, and grapes at from
Gs. to 12s. per pound; nectarines and peaches at from £2 25. to £3 Ss. per
dozen; cherries, per pound, from £1 to £1 IO5.
In June, page 383, grapes were quoted at from 45. to 85. per pound ;
peaches and nectarines at from 155. to £1 45. per doz. ; and cherries at from
45. to 85. per pound.
In August, page 498, hothouse grapes are quoted as at 35. to 55. per
pound. The highest price for hotliouse grapes is in March, and by tliis
standard, and in our currency, this is $8.47 per pound, and the value is
constantly lessening till September. In August, they are at from 72 cents
to $1.21 per pound.
At Boston, in March, they sell at $2 the pound, and tliis price is gra-
dually falling until August and September, when they can be bought at
33 cents to 62 cents per pound. Forced peaches, nectarines, cherries, and
strawberries, are at the same relative prices as grapes ; and, indeed, neither
of these last-named fruits can be grown for market in this country, under
glass, to yield the cost 'of production, at the prices customarily paid for them.
The Gardeners' Chronicle for this year, 1848, quotes them at lower prices,
$3 per pound being the highest mentioned. In Boston, in July, this year,
they have been sold by the quantity as low as 50 cents, which is less than
the cost
