THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 213
would be valuable, as detailing the result of several
years' experience, in comparatively a new section of
grape-growing, in this country, I addressed, the past
spring, a letter (with such queries Jis I thought would
procure the desired statements,) to the proprietor of the
place. The letter was received by the owner of the vine-
yard, Mr. Amos Goodwin, who, in the best spirit, gave

have to contend with ; some seasons, twenty gallons of
wine per acre can hardly be realized from our vineyards,
