S12 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
^ White Bual. — The bnncli is compact ; the berries
obovate, white, and thick skinned ; late and good.
KnigMs Variegated Cliasselas. — This is said to re-
semble the Aleppo ; the bmiches are loose, and the ber-

size, and having large shoulders, the bunches often weigh-
ing four, five, and six pounds.

ripening, which may be ten days earlier. I have culti-
