THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 203
leaves in autumn, until late in spring, or even summer,
when the scion can be kept back from sprouting. But if
the graft be on stocks not dug up, or stands where it
is to remain, it must be done in the fall or early part of
winter, to ensure success. In this way, I readily changed
my foreign, and other rotting kinds, into unexceptionable
native varieties. 'No clay, or any other covering of the
grafted part, is necessary in grafting grape vines even
with the ground. All that is to be done, is to saw off
your stock and put in your scion, (with two or three buds
thereon,) wedge- fashion, as in cleft-grafting fruit trees,
and then draw earth around a few inches high, leaving
one or two buds above ground ; or, where the stock is
very large, and inconvenient to split, I have made a
gimlet hole, and inserted the scion, spoil-fashion, and
then drawn the earth around.
^' But, to avoid disappointment, the vintner should be
aware that more trouble and attention is required in the
grafting process, to pull off sprouts from the old stock, as
they sj)ring forth to rob the graft, than in the process
itself; and this is far more the case in grafting to stocks
standing in their original j^lace, than those procured from
the woods. To compensate for this, however, the growth
from the former is mueh greater than from the latter,
viz. : eight or ten feet a season, in the one case, but
thirty feet, not uncommonly, in the other. Grafts often
bear some fine clusters the first season of growth, and
pretty considerably the second." Mr. Weller is of the
opinion, " that, while American vineyards far exceed
European in yield, yet they fall far short in strength of
the juice yielded, and therefore corresponding keeping
