to be pursued to the greatest extent, whicli the future
weliare of the vines will admit of. The thinning of the
berries will be performed later than in any otlier house,
and care should be had that it is thoroughly done, and
more severely than in any other way of growing them.
Early in March, the sun must be excluded from the
house ; this can be done by spreading sails, or mats, over
the glass ; the doors and lights must be open day and
night, when the temperature is above freezing.
In May, when the vines push their buds, the covering
must be removed from the glass ; keep the temperature
as low as possible, night and da}^, during the summer;
the end of May, or early in June, the vines should be
put to the rods, or trellis.
Early in Jul}^, the grapes will be in blossom ; apply
the sulphur now to the floor of the house, and observe
the vines carefuHy during this and the next month ; if
the mildew appear on the wood, fruit, or foliage, shut the
house at night, and apply more sulphur. ISTever allow it
to remain on the fruit; if, by accident, any should get
on, brush it off immediately, â€” opening the house by day,
as in any grapery. Early in August, the grapes will re-
quire to be thinned.
In October, when thQ nights become cool, close the
doors and windows, {wTiere it has not heeiv done heforc
on account of mildew^ giving as much air, and keeping
as low a temperature, {when the sun shines,) by day, as
possible.
In I^ovember, small fires must be made and kept up
in the night-time, and in cloudy weather.
