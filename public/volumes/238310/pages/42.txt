THE CULTUKE OF THE GRAPE. 43'
PEEPAKATION OF THE BOEDEE.
The border should be twenty feet wide, for each set of
vines, — if thirty feet, the better, — and two and a half or
three feet deep ; If you have but little room, you can
manage to grow very fair grapes with twelve feet of bor-
der; but, in this case, you must not plant the vines so
close together/''* The following course is recommended
in preparing the border : —
If tlie soil is a good loam, begin at one end and trench
it ; mark off ten feet the entire width ; throw out the
soil two feet deep ; if bones, or the carcasses of animals
can be had, cover the bottom well with them ; if these
are not readily procured, slaughter-house manure may
be substituted ;•)' mark off ten feet more of the border,
and cover this manure with part of the soil from it ; upon
this, put an inch or two of oyster shells, or old lime rub-
bish, mixed with broken bricks ; over this, put some soil
from the border ; then a good covering of cow manure ;
upon this, a slight covering of loam again, followed with
a good portion of oyster shells, or the substitute ; and
over this, a thick covering of stable manure, well rotted ;
finish with a covering of the loam 4 The whole length

X Drain for the Border. — If drains are necessary, they should be made
after this plan : the main one to be of brick, extending the whole length
of, and on the outside of the border, the bottom of this being covered with
stones not less than one foot deep. On these, every six feet, should be
smaller drains of brick, tile or stone, leading to the main one, and this can
be carried to any convenient point. I have never found it necessary to
form these under any border, stones at the bottom answering every pur-
nose. Very few situations can require them in this country.
