THE CULTUEE OF THE GRAPE. 239
other aiiiinal manure, they are a richer table fruit, but
with more pulp, and consequently less valuable as a wine
grape. The vine is never j)runed. It prunes itself.
The knife is fatal to it. And, unlike all other grape vines,
it will not strike root from a cutting, it being propagated
cxclusivelv by layers. The next best grape in this cli-
mate, of the natives, is the Elsingburgh, and with this
the chapter is complete, for I know^ of no other w^orth the
trouble of raising. The Isabella is utterly worthless
with us ; so is Hyde's Eliza. The Catawba, and Warren
grapes, are each better ; but those who have eaten of
either the Alai'ic or Elsingburgh, and especially any of
the foreign varieties, would never undertake the culture
of the Isabella or Catawba.
" I have eaten of the best of this fruit raised by Dr.
Underbill at Croton Point, near New York, and have
come to the conclusion that it is impossible to rid the
Isabella of its pulp, and of that wild native flavor it ori-
ginally had."^"
"I have been compelled necessarily to condense my
remarks, but allow me to say in conclusion that I know
of no work in this country or Europe in which more
valuable suggestions upon the subject of Horticulture,
and particularly of the cultivation of the grape vine, are
to be found than in your publication. With my entire
library, it has gone to sea, in the gale of 1851. I hope
you will supply me with a copy of the new edition.
* [This gentleman is not partial to the fox flavor of the native American
grape. Many can be found who are, however, and I think this number is in-
creasing, as evidenced by the great sale of tliis fruit annually, and the im-
mense quantities now grown by amateurs for their own use. â€” Ed.]
