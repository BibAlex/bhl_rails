THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 28
twelve feet long ; this will make the height of the house,
at the ridge-pole, or centre, on the inside, fourteen feet.
The sills must be secured to stone, or locust posts, placed
eight feet apart, and sufficiently deep in the soil to be free
from danger of being thrown by the frost. Place the
house fronting south-southeast. You may plant three sets
of vines, â€” one in the centre, and one on each side. Upon
a house of this description, the sun's rays will rest from
morning until evening, and the crop will come rapidly to
maturity.
At the time of writing the above, I had a span grapery
twenty-two feet wide on the inside, (see view of this
house,) which had four sets of vines planted in it ; at that
time, it was a matter of doubt with me whether or not
the vines were too much crowded ; since then, they have
matured a fine crop of grapes, and the fruit on the two
inside sets of vines was fully equal in quality and quan-
tity to those where the roots were in the open border, and
had more room to ramble and extend themselves. The
present summer, these inside vines have upon them a
very heavy crop ; each vine having shown from fifty to
one hundred large and handsome bunches. They will not
be allowed to mature more than from six bunches for the
Syrian, up to twenty for the Hamburgh, being only in
the fourth season. When the vines are fully established,
the grapes will hang from the sill to the ridgepole, and
present a beautiful appearance. If there is ample room,
I would substitute this house for the one twenty feet wide,
and with only three sets of vines. This house at the pre-
sent time has now been four years longer in bearing, and
the vines continue to do well, the inside ones being allow-
