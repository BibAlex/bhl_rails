THE CUL-rUEE OF THE GRAPE. 145

were kept open night and day, and they should be con-

the sashes and doors at night, to exclude hard frosts.

GRAPES IN POTS.
Grapes may be grown successfully in pots, proper at-
tention being paid to watering them ; doing this judi-
ciously is the most difficult part of the process, as they
