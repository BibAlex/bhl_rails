206 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
"The berries of this grape are very large. I have fre-
quently measured selected ones, and found them to be
three and a half, and some few, four inches round.
They are more easily gathered than other kinds. A large
sheet, with poles fastened to two sides, is held under the
canopy, and a third person shakes the canopy above,
with a forked pole, and all the ripe grapes fall into the
sheet, and the green ones remain on. They are ripening
here about two months ; and that period ensures succes-
sive gatJtei'ings, and the 7nost delicious of grape fruit. It
is a peculiarly southern grape ; and for the south it is,
doubtless, the best grape in the world, considered in all
respects. I learn this grape does well everywhere south
of latitude 37Â° JN"., when properly managed, and this is,
to trim enougli, in the first stages of its growth, to pre-
vent its becoming bushy, and afterwards, (say fifty years,
or no telling how long a vine will flourish,) to keep, by
scaffolding, the canopies clear underneath of all strag-
gling or hanging down branches, six or eight feet high.
This being not done, the vines will surely fail to bear
well, and to have the fruit in j^erfection.
" My Halifax, I estimate next to the Scuppernong
grape. It runs or spreads to a great extent. From my
study, I see the top of an apple tree covered with fine
large clusters, and by measurement, with a ten-foot pole,
I find the tree forty feet distant from where the main
stem of the vine stands, to the ground, and the tree is
twenty feet high. The berry is as large as a common
bullet, and the clusters of uncommon size. It changes
its color to a bright purple, long before it ripens, and is
a good table grape. The Norton Virginia Seedling, next
