THE CULTURE OF THE GBAPE. SB
house ; a grapery forced in winter, (that is, in December,)
will, in a severely cold climate, require a very expensive
aj)paratus ; a furnace and flue, for forvv'arding and pro-
tecting the vines in the spring or autumn, is a simple and
cheap affair, and the cost w^iil vary, according to the
amount of .heat required, from one dollar to three dollars
per foot.
I think ten dollars tlie running foot is the lowest price
at which a plain grapery, with a simple furnace, can he
built, with vines planted, and all complete ; and this cost
can be increased, according to the material used in the
construction of the building, and tlie finish put upon it,
to twenty dollars the foot.
The f jUowiug is an account of the cost of a house con-
structed on the most economical principle, furnished me
by a friend residing in a city adjoining Boston : â€”
" I send you the account of the cost of my graperj^,
which is thirty-two feet in length, twelve feet in widtli,
and thirteen feet high on the back, and three feet on the
front ; and this front is wood work, supported by wood-
en posts.
