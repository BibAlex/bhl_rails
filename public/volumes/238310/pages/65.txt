92 THE CULTUKE OF THE GRAPE.

of it will have escaped by evaporation, or have been
washed into the earth ; and where labor is so high as it
is with us, the cost of working and making this heat,
and removing it after the fruit has ripened, will be very
nearly equal to its value.
The cost of this manure at Salem, Mass., is $4:.50 the
cord ; the expense of carting, from 50 cents to $1.00 per
cord, according to the distance it has to be carried ; mak-

round numbers, STOO.
On the rafters of a house of this length of border,
which is to be winter-forced, eight hundred pounds of
grapes would be a very large average
CROP. On the back wall of the house, but 800 pounds,
which would not be aifected by this heat 267
on the border, one third of this quantity •
would be as much as could be relied upon, 1067 j)ounds.
and this is more than is usually produced
in most graperies ; but my experience warrants me in
