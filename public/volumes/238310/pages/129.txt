190 THE CULTUEE OF THE GRAPE.
The grape vine requires from four to six .montlis, ac-
cording to the kinds, to perfect its fruit. (See August
Muscat.) Where the season is free from severe frosts
this length of time, and there are no other obstacles, as
mildew, blight, &c., the vine may be cultivated. In hot
climates, near the equator, there is too much rain ; and,
were it not for this trouble, it is not likely the vine would
succeed, as it requires a season of rest, and enough of
cold to cause the leaves to fall.
" The same latitude does not always allow the grape
to ripen its fruit in an equal degree of perfection. The
south of England has the same latitude with some of the
vineyards on and near the Ehine which give good wine ;
but the greater humidity and obscuration of the sun pre-
vent the ripening of the fruit, and the observations of
Dr. Daubeny have proved that the ripening of fruits
depends more on the illuminating rays than on the calor-
ific or chemical rays."
Planting the Yines. â€” If rooted vines are to be planted
in the vineyard, this operation may be performed at the
most convenient time after the fall of the leaf, and the
ground is in a good working condition. It should be
done with care, spreading the roots cautiously out. If
scions of the vine are to be planted, and where the
frosts are not very severe, they may be put, immediately
on cutting, into \hQ earth where they are to remain. If
it is considered necessary to guard them, during the
winter, from the frost, they should then be put into
boxes with sand or coarse earth, and kept in a cool place,
just above the freezing point, and then plant them out as
early in the spring as possible.
