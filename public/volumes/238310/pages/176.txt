THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 245
wliat surprised to find we were not a firm believer in the
great efiicacj of the very richest ingredients, such as
dead animals, for the formation of the border, and some
have been almost disposed to doubt whether our own
success was not effected by some such aid, contrary to
our statement. To the former, we need only remark,
that we are more and more convinced, that the employ-
ment of the carcasses of animals is of no benefit what-
ever, but rather an injury in the end ; and, to the latter,
we shall merely state that, whatever practice we recom-
mend, we invariably adopt, until experience assures us
that it is founded in error.
" The subject of the preparation of vine borders has
recently attracted considerable attention in England, and
various communications have appeared, in some of the
gardening periodicals, in relation to the practice of using
the carcasses of dead animals. This discussion has taken
place in consequence of the publication of a small, but
excellent little work, of only eighty or ninety pages, upon
the culture of the grape, by Mr. Roberts, a very success-
ful cultivator. Probably, few copies of the volume have
ever found their way here, in consequence of the high
price at which it was published. We, however, received
a copy when it first appeared, and read it with much
interest, and came to the same"" conclusion as Dr. Lindley,
whose article we are about to notice, that it was one of
the most thorough, practical, and common-sense treatises
which we had ever read, and, saving its recommendation
of the 'pabulum'^ of dead animals, to produce the
* A substance affording nourishment.
