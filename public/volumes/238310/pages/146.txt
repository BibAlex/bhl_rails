THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE. 211
" The ' rot ' is a disease that has only appeared within
five years, in this part of the countiy. At the south, I
am told, it has always existed. On the Ohio, as I gather
from Mr. Longworth's remarks, in j^oiir journal, it is
quite troublesome in the vineyards ; and it appears to be
on the increase, through the country generally. A re-
medy for this disease, must be considered a public
benefit, and I therefore send you the above remarks, for
publication, if you deem them worthy.

'' Bemarks. — We thank a ' Jersey man,' for his account
of the, apparently, quite successful experiment. Our
advice was based on two considerations ; in the first
place, we supposed that the rot might be owing to the
want of some inorganic substance in the soil, necessary
for the perfect maturation of the grape ; and, secondly,
perhaps to the use of crude animal manures. As sidjyJ^^ur
and lime are large constituents of those volcanic soils
abroad, where the grape thrives best, we recommended
the use of a common substance — gypsum — likely to sup-
ply them; and as the foliage and shoots of the vine are
well known to afford the most perfect food for the
growth of that plant, we recommended the use of the
prunings and ftillen leaves, buried in the soil, for
manure.
'' It is worth while, now, to repeat the experiment on a
larger scale, in vineyard culture, and we, accordingly,
recommend it again to the vine-dressers on the Ohio,
