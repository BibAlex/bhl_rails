258 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
the whole range, when he saw them, (if he ever did see
them,) there were nottliirtj vines stopped at the points of
the shoots, as he descriiies, and those so stopped are entire-
ly confined to the roof vines planted outside, which is my
favorite method of planting. As to the glass being in-
jurious, this is rather a grave question, which ought to
be guardedly advanced. But I, in a great measure,
believe in the purport of Mr. Spencer's letter to the
Clironicle some time ago, though it was stated that the
glass was not in fault. I warn my brethren and amateurs
to be guarded as to the too free nse of it.
" ' Upon inquiry,' continues Mr. E., ' of what the
borders consisted, I was told they had received a large
admixture of dead carc:isses, such as those of deer, horses,
&c." and, in the remarks appended to Mr. E.'s letter, the
editor says, ' We have always discountenanced the use
of carrion in this manner. The vines are probably poi-
soned.'
" It may, perhaps, be in your recollection, and I dare
say in that of many of your readers, that a collection of
grapes was submitted by me, in September, 1841, to the
Horticultural Society, which was the produce of young
vines. The borders in which they grew^ contained car-
rion, &c., as detailed in my treatise ; and until I find
the specimens then sent superseded, I will still carry out
and recommend the use of carrion wdien it can be ob-
tained. But how can your position be tenable, wdieu I
tell 3^ou that the vines mentioned by Mr. E. are not
planted in carrion, and that no carrion has been near
them, not one horse carcass, nor a portion of one, is buried
in the whole of mj new borders, which are extensive ?
