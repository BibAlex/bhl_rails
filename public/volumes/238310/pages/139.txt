202 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
"Encouraged by patronage, I have, for years past,
cultivated the choicest varieties, (selected from every
part of our country,) in the nursery to be well rooted,
and ready for market ; and more of the Scuppernong
than any other variety, not only as the best southern
grape, all things considered, but that it cannot be pro-
pagated, successfully, by cuttings, but by layers, or
grafting.
" I started with a pretty large number of Scuppernong,
snd other native cuttings â€” of the Scuppernong mostly.
The cuttings of this grape all put out in the spring, but,
as usual with them, they all died in the summer. It is
best for the American vintner to start his vineyard with
well-rooted vines, reared in the nursery, from cuttings,
or from layers. Even in grafting, it is better to begin in
the nursery, and transfer into the vineyard, after a year's
growth ; this is a common method with me ; though I have
a very pretty portion of vineyard acquired by searching
the woods, late in the spring, when vines are in the leaf,
and getting stocks of the Fox, and other common kinds,
an inch or upwards in diameter, grafting them, wedge-
fashion, and then transplanting, ten feet each w^ay. The
scions (having been kept back, in a cool place, from
sprouting,) were "Weller's Halifax and Norton's Virginia
Seedling. They are kinds I esteem next to the Scupper-
nong, as free from the propensity to rot, and in other re-
spects good.
" It is the uniform result of long experience, that, if
grafting is effected on stocks procured or dug up from
the woods, success, with due pains-taking, will surely
follow, if done at any time fi'om the complete fall of
