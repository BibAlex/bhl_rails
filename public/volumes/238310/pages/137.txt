200 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
I have been troubled with a worm, wbicli gets in the
grape when ripe, and often destroys a whole bunch, bor-
ing from one berry to another. It is a little grey maggot,
about one eighth of an inch in length. In the vineyard
formed last spring, I planted three thousand vines, all
Isabellas. Formerly, I used to be careful in my summer
pruning, but after experiment, I was convinced that the
vines are best let alone, as the leaves got so much injured
hj storms and insects, that all that are left are needed for
ripening the fruit. I therefore train up the growing
shoots to the trellis, and as the side-shoots and stragglers
push out, so as to be in the way, I simply trim them
off with a pair of hedge shears.
" I have been carrying out the plan I told you of last
fall, â€” the covering of the ground of my vineyard with
tan, shavings, and pine leaves, and the advantages ex-
pected to be derived from it are as follows : that it will
keep the weeds from growing, and save the necessity of
ploughing ; it will prevent the lower bunches of grapes
from getting spattered with the earth, v/hen it rains^
which has always been a serious trouble when the earth
was kept loose by ploughing ; it will keep the earth cool,
and prevent an early starting of the buds, which some-
times causes serious loss from late frosts ; and, lastly I
hope it may prove, in some degree, a guard against those
insects which breed in the ground, and are most formid-
able enenyes.

infested the bunches of grapes, that he has almost given up the cultivatioc,
