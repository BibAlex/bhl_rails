134 THE CULTURE OF THE GKAPE.
the autumn of 1739, while the grapes were jet on the
vines, was of such intensity as to kill a remarkable vine
of the V/hite Muscat variety. This vine was exposed to
the south, and protected from the cold winds ; it was in
the Rue Poiture, at Besan^on. The age of this vine was
unknown, but the stem was about six feet in thickness,
the branches extended to about forty-six feet high, and
spread over a wall more than one hundred and thirty-
three feet. The death of this remarkable vine caused a
painful sensation through the whole province." — Chajptal^

It is unusual to see a bunch of Black Hamburgh grapes
weiojhino; more than four pounds. At the exhibition of
tlie London Horticultural Society, at Chiswick, on the
9th of July, 1836, there was shown a very fine bunch of
this variety which weighed eight pounds and six ounces ;
it is mentioned in Loudon's Magazine as " hitherto un-
rivalled ;" see vol. 12th, page 444.*
A simple furnace and flue, to run along the front of
the house, even when it is not intended to force, is desi-
rable, as a small fire can then be made in wet w^eather,
and, after the fruit is ripe, by keeping the air dry, you
will be able to preserve the grapes sound a great length
of time.
The fall pruning of the fourth year will leave the vine
established at the proper length at which it may ever re-
main ; the fall trimming the fifth year, and ever after,
will be the same as that of the fourth, — cutting the lead-
ing cane back to the dormant eyes.
* I had the satisfaction of seeing this bunch of grapes; it probably is the
largest bunch of this kind ever grown.
