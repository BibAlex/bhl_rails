THE CULTUEE OF TPIE GRAPE. 259
I was sorrj at the time I made them, tliat it was not in
my power to avail myself of that pabulum to produce the
nectar of Bacchu.-^. All the carrion, of any description,
they contain, would not have made one load for a Shet-
land pony, and most of that was reduced, in order that it
might give out immediately nutritious food to the vines,
young as they were when planted, had it been placed
within their reach ; but it was not. In notices to corre-
spondents, it has been stated that my method of preparing
borders was good, but too much azotised.'^ The vine
borders at Bishop's Stortford, are stated to be gorged
with manure and flesliings of skinners and tanners, and
no caution is given regarding the too free use of azotised
manure, wdiich is the basis of good cultivation. An
immoderate use of such azotised manures, as a thorough
mixture through the soil, will be far more likely to prove
poisonous to vines in their infant state, and far more
injurious than anj-thing I have yet offered to the public
as essential to the good culture of the vine. But if I
was not able to add carrion, except in a very limited
degree, at the time ni}^ borders v,^ere made, I may men-
tion that I fell in with a goodly lot last winter, part of
whicli has been added as a top-dressing this autumn,
and I intend in future to apply it to that purpose. I
am so cautious that the least particle should not be
wasted, that I hoard it up as a miser would his gold. I
hope the matter is here set at rest as regards carrion
poisoning vines. ' On more recent inquiry,' says Mr.
* Azote or nitrogen ; â€” tliis gas exists in all animal substances, and iu
such plants as putrefy with an animal odor, such as cabbage and mushroom.
