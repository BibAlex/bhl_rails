88 THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE.
The flue, for the first twelve feet after leaving the fur-
nace, should be built on two or three courses of brick,
(or a stone foundation may be substituted,) from thence
to the chimney either on plank, (which is preferable on
account of dryness,) or on bricks laid one or two inches
apart ; one course of brick is sufficient for the floor of
the flue. I usually have the first few feet of the sides of
the fine built with the bricks laid flat, and, after this, on
their sides, as represented in the lean-to house.
HEATING APPARATUS FOE CIRCULATING WATER OX THE
LEVEL PRINCIPLE.
When the house is to be heated with hot water, (which
I 23refer when a great and steady heat is required through
the whole winter,) the furnace and flue should be built
and arranged in the same way as detailed in the preced-
ing article ; but, instead of covering the furnace with
tile and brick, the boiler will be used. This may be of
cast iron, or of sheet copper, and of proper size for the
furnace. It is necessary to have fifteen or eighteen
inches depth to this, that ample space may be allowed
for the pipes, one above the other, on the side. The
lower one should enter as near the bottom as possible,
and the upper one as near the top. The principle upon
which the water acts is this, that hot water is lighter
than cold ; consequently, when this becomes heated by
the fire, it rises to the top and thence to the pipe ; the
cold water in the lower pipe comes in to fill the space of
that heated, and the circulation commences, and is more
