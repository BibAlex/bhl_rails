194 THE CULTURE OF THE GPwAPE.
Dr. Underhill has more fully expressed liis opinion as to
the improvement in the quality of the Isabella and Ca*
tawba, which were growing in the wild state about forty
years since, (time of writing 1842.) He says, " the
quality of my fruit has changed very much within a few
years ; the clusters and berries are much larger and
sweeter, the skin thinner, and i}iQ pulp has ne(wly disap-
peared. But I do not wish to be understood as convey-
ing the idea that others, having a suitable situation, and
good vines, with properly directed efforts in planting,
pruning, &c., cannot succeed in raising as fine fruit as
grows upon Croton Point."
The native grapes of Massachusetts do not improve by
cultivation upon removal to the garden ; the bunch and
berry can be enlarged, but the strong foxy flavor still re-
mains, which renders them unsuited for the dessert.
The improvement in the quality of the Isabella and
Catawba, spoken of by Dr. Underhill, under his cultiva-
tion, is, no doubt, owing to suitable soil and judicious
cropping. In its wild state, this fruit would be taxed to
its utmost, in its efforts to mature the abundant crop
which it naturally produces ; consequentl}^, the fruit
would be small, and the flavor deficient.
Under cultivation, one quarter of the fruit which the
vine would set, is as much as it would be allowed to ma-
ture. This would enlarge the bunch and the berry, and
hasten the period of maturation, and improve the flavor.
I believe it is generally admitted to be the case, with all
fruit trees, that a small or limited crop is the highest
flavored.
