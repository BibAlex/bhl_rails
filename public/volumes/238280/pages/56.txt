Carabi.
The Calosomata no doubt frequented the forests; but two
species of Nebria, a small Brachinus, an elegant Cymindis,
several delicately formed species of Badister and Stenolophus,
and a minute Bembidium most probably lived near the shores
of the lake of (Eningen, and concealed themselves under stones
and dead plants. (Eningen has furnished seven species of
Amara and fourteen species of Harpalus, for the most part
nearly approaching European species, as is shown by the insects
represented in figs. 284 and 285. One species of this group,
