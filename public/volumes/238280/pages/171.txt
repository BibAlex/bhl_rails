DURNTEN SECTION. 151
1 . A layer of fine yellowish sand and loam (a) .
2. The lignite-deposit (b).
3. A layer of pebbles several feet thick (c), in the midst of
which was a nest of pure sand (c f ) .
4. A layer, about 6 inches thick, of light-coloured loam,
containing here and there nests of pebbles (d) .
5. A thin coal-band (about 6 inches thick), composed of
peat-plants with a few fragments of wood (e) .
6. Loam, a thin layer (/) .
7. Seven alternating layers of sand and pebbles (g) .
8. On the top a few erratic blocks, originating from th'e
Alps, and partly consisting of Alpine limestone and
sernifite (h).
The thickness of the masses of pebbles and sand covering the
lignites or paper coals varies at very short distances, and amounts
here and there to 30 feet. The composition of the lignites shows
clearly that they originated from peat, as has been already
noticed (vol. i. pp. 29, 30) ; and their thickness proves that this
formation of peat must have gone on for very many years.
From time to time, no doubt, it was interrupted by inundations
and the deposition of fine mud, which now forms loamy bands ;
but it afterwards recommenced, and continued until an end was
almost entirely put to it by the country being covered up with
pebbles and sand, merely containing here and there some traces
of peat formation, such as is seen in the thin band of lignite
among beds of gravel (fig. 328, e) .
The lignite, or paper coal, of Unterwetzikon presents the same
conditions of deposition as that of Diiruten. It lies at a depth
of from 13 to 30 feet, and is covered with masses of stratified
sand and gravel. Below the lignite there is a light-coloured
loam which contains small freshwater shells ; and beneath the
loam occurs a bed of gravel, in which striated fragments of lime-
stone, a block of granite from Pontaigles, and a boulder about
6 feet in diameter have been found.
