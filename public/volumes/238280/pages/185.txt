Europe. In the basin of the Rhine they are found in the Loess and in the
bone-caves. The remains of the Rhinoceros Merkii have been collected near
Mauer, in the valley of the Neckar, in a deposit of sand and gravel inferior to
the Loess ; and at Mosbach, near Wiesbaden, it seems to occur in deposits
lower than those which contain R. tichorhinus in the neighbouring valley of
the Lahn. According to Hermann de Meyer, R. Merkii therefore made its
appearance before R. tichorhinus ; it occupied the lower part of the Quaternary,
and the latter species the upper portion, although it is not proved that, in
some places, the two species did not live together. According to Lartet
(Ann. des Sci. Nat. 1867, vol. vii. p. 27), R. Merkii, De Meyer, is not the
species described by Jaeger and Kaup, but the same as R. etruscus, Falc. ;
Prof. Heer therefore gives it the latter name.
