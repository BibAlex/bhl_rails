Traces of Man in the Interglacial Deposit near Wetzikon, in
the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland.
By Professor L. RUTIMEYER, of Basle*.
Swiss pits have recently afforded abundant proofs of the pre-
historic presence of Man associated with a fauna indicating very
different conditions from those of the present time, and establish-
ing a far higher antiquity for the human race than has been shown
in the remains belonging to lake-dwellings in Switzerland.
France, Belgium, and England have contributed important
data to illustrate remote prehistoric epochs ; cosmopolitan cha-
racteristics have been noticed in the discoveries which have been
made ; and the larger proportion of extinct species of the fauna
contemporaneous with traces of Man in those countries, as well
as in Switzerland, gives a very distant period for the first appear-
ance of the human race.
A standard of time may possibly be arrived at from the facts
to be here narrated.
Prof. Arnold Escher de la Linth demonstrated that a vast
glacial deposit had overlain the lignites worked in some parts of
Eastern Switzerland, especially on the eastern shore of the Lake
of Zurich from Wetzikon to Utznach, as well as in the neigh-
bourhood of the Lake of Constance, between St. Gall and Arbon,
