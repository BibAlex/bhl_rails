flint and sandstone, and may have originated from the conglo-
merate of the surrounding mountains. .In one spot, where the
lignite was of great thickness, it was traversed in the middle by
a deposit of clay which thinned out in the form of a wedge. In
another place this clay -bed was divided into several bands, di-
stinguished by their light colour and greater thickness from the
dark-coloured loam-bands of the coal already mentioned (which
the workmen call ' ' silver ") . The deposit here, probably after
its formation, had been ruptured by a slip and separated into
very irregular and variously bent layers by the intercalations of
clays. In one place a portion of the lignite-deposit is placed
almost perpendicularly, and only covered by a thin layer of
arable soil, while elsewhere the deposit is 'generally in a hori-
zontal position and covered by a bed of stratified sand and
pebbles.
At the spot where the lignite-deposit was of great thickness
the following section (fig. 328) was to be seen. It contained in
