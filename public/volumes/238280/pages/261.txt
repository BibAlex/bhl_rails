without fracture, there will be a complete arch or saddle (fig.
361, A). But very often the upper beds are broken through at
one or more places in consequence of the violent pressure, and
an open arch is produced, forming a fissure- valley (fig. 361, D),
the side walls of which rise into ridges (fig. 361, C); but the cor-

shown. This fissure-valley is afterwards often enlarged by
erosion and by dislocations ; and the removal of the superior
beds by these means may bring to light the unbroken inferior
beds belonging to the same arch (fig. 362, 1.). When the arch
