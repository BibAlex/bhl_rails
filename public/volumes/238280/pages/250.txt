CHAPTER XIV.
RETROSPECT, WITH NOTICES OF EARLY PALAEOZOIC STRATA,
GRADUAL changes taking place in the crust of our earth are
admirably illustrated in the Swiss Alps. Whether the traveller
crosses the Alpine chain by the Julier and the Bernina, by the
Splugen or the St. Bernard, by the St. Gothard or by the
mountains of Berne or the Valais, he will everywhere find
enormous masses of fallen rocks and debris, which here and
there cover the slopes and bottoms of the valleys, and afford
evidence of the constant weathering of mountains and of the
impossibility of vegetation advancing so rapidly as to cover all
the rocky fragments with its green mantle.
Deep ravines have in various places been formed by the action
of running water ; and torrents forcing their way through these
gorges have carried down heaps of stones and earth into the
valleys, and have thus occasioned the formation of tall cones.
By the continual process of lowering heights and filling up
valleys, lofty peaks gradually diminish in elevation, and lake-
basins are filled up. Thus the northern part of the Lake of
Wallenstadt will in turn be converted into dry land. Already,
within the last fifty years, since the river Linth was conducted
into the lake, a considerable delta has been formed, which is
continually increasing, and now fills the north-western portion
of the lake, so that the mouth of the river Linth is constantly
advancing into the former lake-basin, and the bed of the river
has to be constantly elongated and deepened.
At present, as the Swiss mountains become disintegrated, all
the masses of rock remain in the vicinity where they fall ; but
in the drift-epoch the broken pieces were carried away to great
distances, covering the soil of the plain of Switzerland, and in
some parts raising it considerably. If we imagine all these
