CHAPTER XIII.
GLACIAL HISTORY.
THE section at Diirnten given in fig. 328 (p. 150) shows that
the lignites at that place are covered by a great deposit of stra-
tified gravel and sand, upon the surface of which isolated blocks
are found. At Utznach the lignites (fig. 329, p. 152) are also
covered by gravel and sand, and separate blocks occur on the
surface of the deposits. Beds of stratified pebbles and sand are
seen continually in the gravel-pits opened for mending the roads;
they prove that these deposits are spread over the low grounds
of Northern Switzerland, and that the formation exemplified at
Diirnten and Utznach is distributed over a great portion of the
lower district of the country. This formation has been described
as Stratified Diluvium [and also as Drift] . It consists of more
or less rolled fragments, which generally vary in size from that
of a walnut to that of a man's fist, lying in more or less hori-
zontal beds, sometimes alternating with bands of sand. The
pebbles mostly have belonged to rocks which are not found
in the Swiss plains, but which originally appertained to the
neighbouring Alps. In the Canton of Zurich the gravel-pits
contain a mass of red pebbles, composed of the sernifite of the
Glaris Alps; with these are fragments of limestone, representing
the various calcareous formations of the high Swiss mountains.
In the vicinity of the Lake of Constance and the Rhine, as near
Diessenhofen, Stein, &c., everywhere are found vast beds of
rolled pebbles, the materials of which are derived from the valley
of the Rhine. The plain between Thun and Thierachern and up
to the shore of the Lake of Thun is covered with masses of sand
and pebbles, the origin of which may be traced to the neigh-
bouring Alps ; and on the shores of the Lake of Geneva gravel
