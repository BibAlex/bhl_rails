CENTIGRADE THERMOMETER. 305
(from 3.2 to 212), and by the Centigrade into 100 (from to
100). Zero in Fahrenheit's thermometer is 32 below the
freezing-point of water, and in the Centigrade thermometer the
freezing-point of water is called zero.
A degree Centigrade is larger than a degree Fahrenheit
in the proportion of 180 to 100, or 9 to 5; and to con-
vert degrees of Fahrenheit into the Centigrade the rule is
5
to subtract 32 and multiply the remainder by ^ ; and the rule
y
to convert degrees of the Centigrade into Fahrenheit's is to
g
multiply the Centigrade by -, and add 32 to the product.

In scientific experiments the Centigrade thermometer is
almost invariably employed, and is generally quoted in scientific
books. New works on chemistry in the British Islands usually
adopt metric weights and measures, as more convenient, and as
better suited to the international communication of knowledge.
A commencement of improved international relations has
recently come into operation under British postal authority, in
the Ijfl?. foreign postal card. Parliamentary sanction is still
requisite in this country to render Mr. Ewarf s Act of 1864
thoroughly efficient by empowering a dealer to recover debts in
British commercial transactions where the goods have been
sold by metric weights or measures.
