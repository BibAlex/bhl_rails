FRESHWATER SHELLS.
these elegant little mollusks, which feed on the mosses clothing
the Swiss trees and rocks, and live chiefly in sunny dry locali-
ties, are now very abundant. Two species of Pupa (P. acumi-
nata, Kl., and P. Buchwalderi, Grep., fig. 200) occur at Vermes

and Tramelan; and a very large Clausilia (C. maxima, Grat.,
fig. 204) has been obtained at various places, as in the marl of
Baretschweil, between Ferrach and Riiti, and near Unterdevelier,
where a second large species (C. antiqua, Schiibl.) also occurs.
The latter resembles a Javan, and the Clausilia maxima is like
a Chinese species (C. shanginensis, Pfr.).
Freshwater mussels and pond-, mud-, and marsh-snails (Ano-
donta, Unto, Cyclas, Planorbis, Limnaus, Paludina, and Neri-
tina) were very generally distributed in the rivulets and lakes of
the Swiss Miocene country. Two of the species (Neritina fluvi-
