LAND ANIMALS. 107
jaws of a dolphin (Delphinus canaliculatus, Meyer) have been
discovered ; this animal at that time was very widely distributed.
A second species (D. acutidens, Meyer) has been discovered at
Moliere.
Side by side with the remains of these animals, which un-
doubtedly lived in the sea, shells and bones of land animals are
found in the marine Molasse, having been carried down by floods
into the sea, and thus accidentally associated with the true
marine fauna.
Land Mollusca have been already mentioned, some of which
(such as the Auriculas) very probably lived on the sea-shore,
whilst others (such as the freshwater species and many snails)
may have been swept down to the sea from a great distance.
Among the Mammalia the teeth of two mastodons (Mastodon
angustidens and tapiroides) are found in the Shell-sandstone ;
and the remains of the tapir, of two rhinoceroses (R. incisivus
and R. minutus), of a Hyotherium (H. Meissneri), of aHipparion
(H. gracile), and of two deer (Cervus Scheuchzeri, Meyer, sp.,
and C. minor) have been collected from the marine Molasse,
proving that at that time these animals inhabited Switzerland.
