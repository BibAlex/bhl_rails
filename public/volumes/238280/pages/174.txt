154 QUATERNARY PERIOD.
change was effected by an accumulation of masses of gravel
covering the lignites.
All the above-mentioned lignites belong to the basin of the
Limmat and the Lake of Zurich ; but the deposit of Morschweil
(564 metres, or nearly 617 yards, above the sea) between St.
Gall and Rohrschach belongs to the basin of the Lake of Con-
stance. Its average thickness is about 2 feet. It furnishes an-
nually about 50,000 hundredweight of coal. Above and below
it are beds of rolled erratic blocks. In the Hiittenweid, in the
commune of Morschweil, the following strata are distinguish-
able, in descending order, according to Prof. Deicke * :
1. 10 feet of loam. -
2. 16 feet of erratic stones, not striated or polished. Among
them are boulders weighing 10 hundredweight.
3. 8 feet of loam with lignite, in which the trunks of trees
are upright.
4. 13 feet of erratic stones with small boulders, not exceeding
1 foot in diameter.
5. 6 feet of ash-grey loam, with scattered fragments of lignite.
6. 17 feet of small erratic pebbles, among which there are
boulders about 1 foot in diameter.
Nearly the same succession of beds occurs in the Kropfel ; but
the lignite-bed, which is 3 feet thick, lies 70 feet below the sur-
face; and 15 feet lower down a second, thinner deposit makes
its appearance.
In the Brunnenweis, which lies to the eastward, the shaft shows
the following strata in descending order :
1. 21 feet of sand, with large boulders.
2. 16 feet of ash-grey loam, with lignite, in which there are
trunks of trees, 6 feet long and 3 feet broad, standing
upright.
3. 3 feet of gravel, with small rolled pebbles.
4. Fine sand.
