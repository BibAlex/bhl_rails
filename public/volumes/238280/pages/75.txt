REPTILES.

CEningen possessed one species of bull-head (Coitus brevis,
Ag.) , which possessed a still smaller and thinner body than the
species now common in the brooks and lakes of Europe.
The perch of CEningen (Perca lepidota, Ag.) differs essentially
from the common Swiss perch in having only nine instead of
twelve to fifteen spines in its dorsal fin. This species has been
found in the Miocene of the Gurnigel, which is the only example
of an CEningian species of fish being found in any other locality
in Switzerland.

The Reptilian fauna of the Swiss Miocene differs greatly from
that of the present day. It was certainly much richer in species ;
and the species were otherwise distributed in various families, as

* The species from CEningen have been studied by H. von Meyer in his
4 Fossile Saugethiere, Vb'gel und Reptilien von CEningen ' (Frankfort, 1845),
and by Winkler, < Tortues fossiles ' (Harlem, 1869). The tortoises of Swit-
zerland have been described by Pictet and Humbert in their ( Monographie
des Che"loniens de la Mollasse Suisse ' (Geneva, 1858), and those of "VVinter-
thur by Dr. Biedermann in his 'Petrefacten der Umgegend von Winterthur/
