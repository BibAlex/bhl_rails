CHAPTER XII.
QUATERNARY PERIOD.
IT is intended in the Plate opposite to sketch the district of
Durnten, on the southern frontier of the Canton of Zurich, at
the time of the paper-coal or lignite formation. The Speer, the
Schaniserberg, the peaked Miirtschenstock, and the chain of the
Waggithal mountains, with the snow-clad Glaris Alps, are in
the background. These mountains have remained unchanged
since the time of the formation of the paper-coals. But in the
foreground of the picture the present green covering of the
fields has been removed, and the world buried beneath the sur-
face has been brought again to life. The plants are riot different
from those of our time. It is the common Swiss reed which
fringes the pools, the Swiss pine that occupies the foreground,
the white birch that spreads over the marshy flat, an oak that
grows up into a vast tree on a dry spot, and the common red fir
which to the left raises its stately form.
But the elephant, the rhinoceros, and the urus (Bos primige-
nius) } which we see in the picture, are animals quite strange
to modern Switzerland ; they give the landscape an ancient
character. And where, it may be asked, are the proofs that such
strange animals lived in Switzerland contemporaneously with the
plants of its existing flora ? and what justified the assumption
that at that time the Alps in their present form already made
the background of the Swiss landscape ? These questions are
answered by the paper coals or lignites. These strata are
consequently of great geological significance, and must here be
described. In the commune of Diirnten (515 metres, or 563 yards,
above the sea) the paper coals, the mode of formation of which
has been already explained (see vol. i. pp. 30, 31), occur at a
distance of only a few minutes' walk from the village, on the
