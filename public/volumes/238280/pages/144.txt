CHAPTER XI.
.
CLIMATE OF THE MIOCENE DISTRICT.
PLANTS and animals were doubtless subjected to the- same laws
in former ages as in the present day. Every species now, as in
geological times, requires for its development a definite amount
of light and heat, of air and water, and its distribution over the
surface of the earth is dependent upon these conditions. So
much influence has particularly been exerted by heat and water,
that, owing to these agencies, each species of the animal as well
as the vegetable kingdom has been confined within definite
limits. Important information is thus afforded by fossil plants
and animals respecting the climate of bygone ages. When a
collection of plants is laid before a botanist who is familiar with
the geographical divisions of the vegetable world, he will be
able to decide on the climate of the country from which the
plants are derived. A climatal limitation of area applies also to
animals, and particularly insects, which differ greatly in accord-
ance with the conditions of climate. If correct inferences can
be drawn from existing plants and animals as to the climate of
the country to which they belong, accurate conclusions may
also be possible with respect to extinct or fossil species ; and our
deductions will attain more certainty in proportion to the abun-
dance of the materials at our command, and to the near alliance
of the animals and plants to those now living.
A great number of species have been found in the fauna and
flora of the Tertiary epoch which are nearly allied to existing
forms. Among the inhabitants of the sea the relationship in
many cases amounts to a perfect identity of species ; and the ap-
proximation between moderns and ancients in many species of
land plants and animals is so close that the Tertiary species
