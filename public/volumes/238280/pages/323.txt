Continental and British Measures, Weights, Degrees of
Temperature, and Postage.
IN 1864 an Act of Parliament under the care of Mr. William
Ewart, M.P., was passed for legalizing the use of the metric
system of weights and measures in Great Britain and Ireland.
On the continent, and especially in scientific continental
publications, the metric system is almost universally adopted.
Its complete decimal character and its extreme simplicity recom-
mend it to universal use ; and a series of metric tables has been
compiled by Mr. C. H. Dowling, Civil Engineer, in which the
British standard measures and weights are compared with those
of the metric system*, and a tabular comparison is given of
the scales of Fahrenheit's, the Centigrade, and Reaumur's
thermometers. Mr. Bowling's tables have been frequently
employed in converting Swiss measures and weights and degrees
of temperature to British equivalents with reference to practical
subjects alluded to in the present volumes.
Messrs. Macmillan and Co. have published a small treatise, by
the Rev. Barnard Smith, M.A., on the metric system of arith-
metic, containing the metric tables, with questions for students ;
and a comparison of continental and English measures by Mr.
Warren De la Rue, F.R.S., was published in Gutch's Alma-
nack for 1864.
