DURNTEN LIGNITES. 149
Oberberg and Binzberg. On the Oberberg (between 1854, in
which year the underground working was commenced, and June
1862) 8090 square fathoms of the carboniferous deposit were
dug out, and 736,800 hundredweight of fresh lignite, furnishing
about 48.2,000 hundredweight of dry coal, were obtained. This
quantity represents approximately in heating-effect 14,030 cords
of birch wood or 22,044 cords of fir wood (of 108 cubic feet to
the cord). In the first three years the workings produced yearly
more than 100,000 hundredweight; but in the year 1862 the
produce fell to 29,185 hundredweight; and it may be foreseen
that the supply will shortly be exhausted.
Mining was commenced in the deposits on the Binzberg in
1862 ; and 29,552 hundredweight of lignite were obtained in the
first year from 770 square rods. In a north-westerly direction
the deposit disappears for a short distance ; but it is again found
in the Schoneich near Unterwetzikon, about 1| Swiss mile
fro en Diirnten; and here it has also been worked since 1862.
In 1865, 251 square fathoms had been removed, with a yield of
16,536 hundredweight of saleable coal. The thickness of the
deposit containing marketable coal is here 2| feet; in some
spots it increases to 5 feet, but in others decreases to 2 feet or
even less. The carboniferous area here contains about 40,000
square feet. It was probably connected formerly with the coal-
deposit of Diirnten, and was produced in the same manner and
at the same time. At the Oberberg, however, its thickness was
much greater. Here and there it was as much as 12 feet thick,
whilst in other places it diminished to 5, 3, and 2J feet thick. The
mean thickness of saleable coal has been estimated at 3 '75 feet.
Between the lignites bands of loam occur, the number of which
is determined by the thickness of the whole deposit : where this
was 12 feet thick it was traversed by six bands ; but where it was
2 feet thick there were only two bands.
The lignite- deposit of Diirnten rests upon a fine yellowish-
brown clay. A shaft which was sunk through this to a depth
of 30 feet below the lignite showed that at the bottom there is
a mass of rolled stones imbedded in the clay ; but the Miocene
was not reached, as the influx of water prevented the shaft from
being dug deeper. In one place there are many rolled pebbles
in the clay immediately below the lignite-deposit ; they are of
