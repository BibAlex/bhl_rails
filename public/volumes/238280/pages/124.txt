CHAPTER X.
DESCRIPTION OF SOME Swiss MIOCENE LOCALITIES.
Lausanne; the Hohe-Uhonen ; St. Gall; Lode; the Molasse of
the Canton of Zurich ; (Eningen.
IF we wish to have a picture of nature, either as it once existed
or as it is now to be seen, we must confine our attention to par-
ticular localities. Let us therefore endeavour to sketch such a
picture of separate parts of Switzerland as may be suitable to
give a clear idea of the natural characters of the flora of the
country in Miocene times.
1. Lausanne in Miocene times.
It has been already shown (vol. i. p. 300) that at the time of
the lignite formation a lake stretched from the neighbourhood
of Vevey to the Paudeze, in the vicinity of Lausanne. The
marl of Monod near Chexbres and that of Rochette in the little
valley of the Paudeze enclose the remains of an abundant
flora which once clothed the shores of this lake. In the Plate
of " Lausanne in Miocene times " an attempt is made to repro-
duce this flora, and to show the character of the plants of that
locality and period. Let us therefore transport ourselves in
imagination to the shore of this lake, and cast a glance upon the
landscape, which, freed by the magic wand of science from the
durance of hard rocks, may rise from the bosom of the earth to
a new life.
In the foreground the magnificent fan-leaves of the sabal-
palms and of the great Flabellariae are seen, and near them the
long plumes of the Phoenicites are visible. To the left rises a
camphor-tree with its numerous branches, the shining foliage of
which converts the dense ramification into dark masses ; while the
