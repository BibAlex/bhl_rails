are still living, or 35 per cent. ; of the 360 species of the sub-
alpine Molasse, 125 (or a similar proportion, 35 per cent.}. The
Shell-sandstone and the subalpine Molasse together possess 421
species, of which 147 (or the same proportion of 35 per cent.)
occur in the existing fauna. The two faunas consequently possess
precisely the same relation to the existing fauna, not only in
the numerical proportions, but also in the manner in which the
living species are now distributed ; only the fact must be taken
into consideration, that Prof. Heer knows 152 species more from
the subalpine Molasse than from the Shell-sandstone. A resume
of numbers is given in the following Table :

This summary shows that most of the species now living, both
from the Shell-sandstone and the subalpine Molasse, belong to
the Mediterranean * ; but that a number of tropical forms are
mixed with them, among which African types are more nume-
rous than Asiatic. Thus the two faunas stand in the same
relation to the existing fauna, and they must consequently be
ranged in the same stage. The differences between them are
caused less by time than by local circumstances. The Shell-
* Almost all the species in the first column also live in the Mediterranean.
About one third of the species are now exclusively confined to the Mediter-
ranean. Nine species of the second column occur also in tropical Africa ; so
that the Swiss Molassic fauna altogether possesses twenty-one tropical
African forms, nine of which, however, still inhabit the southern coast of
Europe.
