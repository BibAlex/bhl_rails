Of the plants of GEuingen, 143 species have been also found
in the Swiss Miocene ; but the majority are only known from
CEningen itself. Most of them were no doubt at that time
distributed over Switzerland, only they have not been preserved.
It is obvious that the remains of delicately constructed insects
and spiders must have had favourable circumstances for their
preservation in this locality. A glimpse into the wonderful
world of the Miocene period is afforded in the rich carpet of
* In the ' Tertiary Flora of Switzerland,' 46o species have been described
from (Eniugen by Prof. Ileer, who has since received 10 new species, namely
Sinilax Taryionii, Gaud., Sparganium altenians, Myrica Studeri, Ileer, Cyp-
selites Parlutorii and pulchcllus, Biynonia Damans, Ileer, Myrsine gradUs,
Rhits hydropMla, Uug 1 ., sp., Mi/rtus ccninyensis, and Cratccyus Buchiana, of
which are also ue\v to the S\viss flora, so that the number of specks in the
