raneity of the remains with an elephant and rhinoceros hitherto
believed to be foreign to the glacial period.
To assign a place in Swiss history to these newly found relics,
we shall have to look back to the interglacial epochs as they
have recently been made known, especially by Geikie on the
authority of observations in Great Britain, and to refer to de-
posits containing similar fossil remains hitherto considered to be
of what is called the Pliocene age in Northern Italy.
If recent and varied observations should assign to the Pliocene
of Europe a position merely connected with the coast, the
nearest neighbourhood to a district powerful as the source of
glaciers would for the present be allowed, with respect to con-
tinental Pliocene times, as a dwelling-place for Man.
