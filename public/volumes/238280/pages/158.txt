MIOCENE CLIMATE.
Of these stations there is not any one which exactly repre-
sents the climate of the Swiss Miocene district ; but we approxi-
mate to it by ascertaining with what existing climatal conditions
it was probably most in accordance. The mixture of tropical
plants with plants of the temperate zones indicates that the
winters were mild and the summers not very hot ; the climate was
that of a coast or an island. The winter, however, was probably
rather colder and the summer a little warmer than is the case
at present in the Atlantic islands of Madeira &c.; so that the
best standard by which to judge of the conditions of temperature
for the Lower Miocene would be furnished by New Orleans,
and in the Old World by Tunis. For the Upper Miocene,
Savannah and Messina would furnish the most suitable points
of comparison to determine the temperature of that portion of
the Swiss Tertiary district.
At the present time the very great difference of elevation of
the land and the influence of the snow-clad chain of the Alps
form, as it were, a barrier against the Miocene climate of Swit-
zerland. The following summary explains these conditions :
