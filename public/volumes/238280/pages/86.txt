MIOCENE FAUNA.
d. Mammalia.
The remains of Mammalia which have been preserved, partly
in the lignites and partly in the sandstones and marls, are of
much greater importance. Where only single bones occur they
are difficult to determine; but, fortunately, the teeth of many
species have come down to the present time ; and these permit
of the exact determination of the animals, as the dentition fur-
nishes the most important characters for their identification.
The great abundance of species formerly existing in the Swiss
Miocene fauna may be seen from the following Table :

This summary shows that the Miocene mammalian fauna
must have had a very different appearance from that now ex-
isting. In the present Mammalia, bats, insectivorous shrews,
and rodents (through the house- and field-mice) constitute the

brate are derived from a Catalogue prepared by M. Victor Fatio of Geneva,
and kindly communicated to Prof. Heer by him. Schinz's previously pub-
