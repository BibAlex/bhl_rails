c. Birds.
Birds are the rarest of fossil vertebrates. But that this class
of animals lived in the Swiss forests in Miocene times is proved
by several undoubted remains of birds which have been disco-
vered at CEningen. According to H. von Meyer they belong to
six species ; but in only one case are they sufficiently well pre-
served to enable Prof. Heer to determine their genus. Of this
species the sternum, scapula, and bones of the wings have been
obtained. They indicate an aquatic bird of the family AnatidaB,
a little smaller than the wild goose (Anas segetum) ; H. von
Meyer has named it Anas ceningensis (fig. 323 B, b) . Prof. Heer
