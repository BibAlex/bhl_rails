CLIMATE OF MADEIRA. 135
Those Miocene plants which represent such as are now met
with in the temperate zone, and do not extend into the tropics,
demonstrate that Switzerland had not at that time a tropical
climate. We find a considerable number of species in the Mio-
cene district the nearest allies of which now live in the plains of
Central Europe or in North America. Most of these, however,
extend their range into the warm zone : thus the common
bracken (Pteris aquilina) is as abundant in Madeira as in Swit-
zerland, and it is also found in California and Japan ; the relatives
of the Swiss Miocene species of Equisetum extend to the south
of the United States ; the Isoetes and the little pondweed occur
even in Brazil ; the common reed (Phragmitis) lives in Italy, on
the Caucasus, in Japan, and in America ; the reed-mace (Typha
latifolid) grows in the Crimea and in South Carolina, the
branched burr-reed (Sparganium ramosum) in Persia and Caro-
lina, and rushes in Madeira and the Canary Islands ; while the
red maple extends down to the south of the United States :
and these are all species representing Miocene forms which we
have classed as belonging to the temperate zone.
With regard to other species, to which cultivation has given
an artificial area of distribution, it is manifest that they can
support higher temperatures : thus the planes and poplars and
walnut-trees thrive well in Madeira; and in the south of Spain
splendid elms and white poplars are seen side by side with
southern Melice and Phytolacca in the public gardens of the
towns. Hence the occurrence of the types of plants of the
temperate zone in the Miocene flora may be easily explained, if
we assume that at that period Switzerland had a climate similar
to that of Madeira. It must be remembered that the plants of
the temperate zone suffer much less from higher temperatures
than those of warm countries do from cold. Too great heat
does not so much limit the extension southwards of plants as
the great dryness of the hot season.
The combination of types of plants of the tropical and tempe-
rate zones in the Swiss Miocene flora is by no means surprising,
as we meet with the same conditions at the present day in
Madeira and the Canary Islands, where the zones of distribution
of many southern and European forms meet ; they indicate a
