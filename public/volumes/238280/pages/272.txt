GENERALIZATIONS.
The following Table exhibits the various periods of elevation
and depression of the ground in Switzerland :
UPHEAVAL OF THE GROUND.
DEPRESSION OF THE GROUND.
1. From the Trias to the Lower Lias.
2. From the White Jura to the close
of the Wealden (Lower Creta-
ceous formation).
3. From the Upper Cretaceous to
the Aquitanian stage of the
Miocene. A partial upheaval
along the Alps at the close of
the Eocene period.
4. From the Helvetian stage (Middle
Miocene) to the close of the
(Eningian stage (Upper Mio-
cene).
5. Upheaval of the Alps and Jura in
Pliocene times.
1. At the close of the Carboniferous
period.
2. From the Lias to the Brown Jura.
3. From the Valangian stage (Lower
Cretaceous) to the Middle Cre-
taceous).
At the Tongrian epoch (Lower Miocene)
in North-western Switzerland.
4. From the Grey Miocene to the
Helvetian stage (Middle Mio-
cene) .
These changes of level did not occur suddenly, but in all
probability very gradually. But when people assert that the
last Pliocene upheaval of the Alps also took place so gradually
and imperceptibly that, if the district had been inhabited by men,
they would not have suspected what was going on, it must be
borne in mind that the dislocations were colossal, that the
tilting-over piled rock-masses several thousand feet in height one
upon another, that deep fissures tore asunder whole mountains,
and that enormous masses of debris accumulated which were
thrown into valleys, and formed there complete mountains.
