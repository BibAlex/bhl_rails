GENERALIZATIONS.
tains, they have been designated orographic lakes, in contra-
distinction to those lakes which have been produced by erosion.
In order to explain the stratification of the Swiss moun-
tains, some sections may here be noticed
Fig. 366. which Prof. Heer has borrowed from
Studer's 'Geology of Switzerland'
(vol. ii. p. 324) :
I. A section through the Jura in the
direction from Soleure to Pfirt. The
examination of this section shows the
numerous undulations of the moun-
tains, the open and denuded arches,
and the basin- and combe-valleys which
environ them. Here and there (as,
especially, between Moutiers and Soy-
hiere) the mountain-chains are broken
through by clefts which have revealed
their internal structure. They show
that here the Keuper forms the nucleus
of the mountains, and that it is followed
by the Lias, and then by the Brown
and White Jura. In the broad valley
of Delsberg the beds of the White Jura
are covered by the Eocene deposit of
the pea-ore ; and over this is the Mio-
cene, which also cccupies the bottom
> of the valley of Moutiers.
II. A second very instructive ex-
ample is furnished by the section from
the Lake of Wallenstadt towards Ap-
penzell (Studer, Geol. der Schweiz. ii.
p. 193). Even in the Kurfirsten the
Jurassic and Cretaceous beds are un-
settled ; and in the Appenzell Alps they
are thrown together in so confused a
manner that it was only by untiring
investigations, continued for years, that
Prof. Escher de la Linth succeeded in
disentangling this Gordian knot. The
