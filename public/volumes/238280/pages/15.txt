MIOCENE FAUNA OF SWITZERLAND.
I. ANIMALS BELONGING TO LAND AND FRESH WATER.
FOSSIL remains of animals are found in most of the Swiss Mio-
cene localities which have furnished plants of that- period.
Hence the Swiss Miocene fauna occupied the same area with
the Miocene flora of Switzerland. No remains of either Anne-
lida or Infusoria have been found ; but vertebrated animals and
insects have supplied so many species that the leading character-
istics of animal life are well represented.
The principal animals of the Swiss Miocene fauna may be
thus described :
1. MOLLUSCA.
All the univalve Mollusca which inhabited the Swiss Miocene
forests, and the Bivalves which peopled the brooks and lakes,
belong to living genera, the species, however, are almost en-
tirely extinct ; and their nearest allies are no longer inhabitants
of Switzerland. Snails (Helix) formed, as at present, the most
numerous genus ; but none of the species attained the size of the
common Swiss vineyard-snail (Helix pomatia, Linn.). One of
the most abundant species of the Swiss Lower Miocene (Helix
Ramondi, Br., fig. 201) is nearly related to a species (H. Bow-
