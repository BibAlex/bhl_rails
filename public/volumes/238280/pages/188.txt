very beautifully preserved elytra of a weevil (Hylobius rugosus,
Heer, fig. 356), an extinct species*, but very nearly allied
* Elytra coal-black in this species, twice as long as broad, traversed by
rows of deep punctures, those in the sutural rows deeper and further apart
than in the middle rows ; interstices wrinkled. The punctures in the rows
are very deep ; the first and second rows were parallel to each other from the
base to the apex ; the third unites at the apex with the eighth, the fourth
with the fifth, and the sixth with the seventh. These last two pairs stop
within the space enclosed by the third and eighth rows. The interstices are
coarsely punctured and transversely wrinkled. The punctures are deeper at
the base than in the middle and at the apex of the elytra. The species differs
