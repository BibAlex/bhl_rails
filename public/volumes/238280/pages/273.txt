MOVEMENT OF ROCK-MASSES. 253
It is very improbable that the rocky wall of the Glarnisch,
6000 feet in height, could have quite imperceptibly slid over the
newer Nummulitic deposits which underlie it, or that the
tearing away of the Galanda from the chain of the Kurfirsten-
Alvier, with which it forms so remarkable a semicircle round
the Sernifite mountains of the Canton of Glaris, could have
silently taken place, or that the descent from the Glarnisch of
the hills which rise from the bottom of the valley of Glaris (the
Bergli and Biirgli) could have noiselessly occurred. Formerly
these great overturnings of hills were supposed to have taken
place too suddenly and too rapidly ; but now the opposite ex-
treme is in vogue, and periods of millions of years are required,
over which gigantic changes are continued, so as to adapt the
movements of nature to what man has experienced and wit-
nessed.
Let it be remembered how minute a portion of geological
annals is embraced in the historic period, and how little man
has seen of the prodigious revolutions which the earth has gone
through. The notion that these processes have always gone on
uniformly and without interruption can hardly be correct ; and
we rather find that after long periods of repose the grandest
changes take place. Thus, after the long time of quiet deve-
lopment which characterized the Carboniferous period, came the
stormy Permian epoch, which, in a comparatively short time,
brought about a complete transformation of the character of
nature ; so also we have seen that the grandest transformation
in the whole external features of Switzerland was effected in the
comparatively short Pliocene period.
During Miocene times, in consequence of continental depres-
sions and elevations, the Swiss low lands were overflowed some-
times by the sea and sometimes by fresh water; but these
changes were far more superficial than the movement of the
Pliocene period, when, by the elevation of the colossal rock-
masses, not only was produced the marvellous structure of the
Swiss Alps, but such a lateral pressure was exerted even upon
the neighbouring Miocene that along its whole margin from the
Lake of Constance to Geneva it was piled up, in a zone several
miles broad, into hills and mountains which attained an elevation
