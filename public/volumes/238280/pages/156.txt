MIOCENE CLIMATE.
European and North-American types become more prominent.
If the living species most like the Swiss Miocene plants are
distributed into three zones, we obtain the following numerical
proportions :

In the CEniugian stage (Upper
Miocene)
In the Upper Miocene (of CEningen) the tropical types con-
stitute only 7 per cent, of the total number of vascular plants;
whilst in the lower Miocene (Aquitanian) the tropical types are
15 per cent, of the whole, which shows that a decrease of tem-
perature must have taken place, although the frequent occur-
rence of the camphor- and cinnamon-trees, and the appearance
of feather- and fan-palms, demonstrate that CEningen still
enjoyed a warm climate.
If we sum up all the data furnished by the flora, we are led
to the conclusion that the Swiss Lower Miocene district pos-
sessed a climate similar to that now prevailing in Louisiana,
the Canaries, North Africa, and South China namely, a climate
with a mean annual temperature of 20-21 Cent, (or 68-69'8
Fahr.); and that the Swiss Upper Miocene district had a
climate resembling that of Madeira, Malaga, and the south of
Sicily, Southern Japan, and New Georgia, with an annual
temperature of 18-19 Cent, (or 64'4-66 *2 Fahr).
The following Table gives the mean temperatures of the
above-mentioned regions :
