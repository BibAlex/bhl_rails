NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. Gl
With the general habitus of Uria proper, but of much more delicate build,
different ])attern of coloration, and very small size. Bill small, slender, much
shorter than the head, not longer than the tarsus, greatly compressed, acutely
tipped ; culmen gently curved, its ridge sharj), rictus nearly straight, gonys
straight ; tomial edge of upper mandible greatly inflected towards the base,
notched near the tip. Is'asal lossffi small and shallow, nearly filled with
feathers, which mostly cover the extremely minute oval nostrils. Wings of
ordinary length, very narrow, pointed, falcate, the secondaries extremely short.
Tail of ordinary length, almost square, the feathers obtusely rounded. Feet
very small, short, slender, and weak ; tarsus scarcely compressed, variable in
length, never longer than the middle toe without its claw (except in brachyp-
terus f) Outer and middle toes equal in length ; the claw of the former much
smaller than that of the latter ; the inner very short, its claw not reaching
the base of the middle claw. Claws small, weak, moderately curved, very
acute.
The genus which comprises the Murrelets — to coin an English word, needed
for the Brachyrhainphi, — is a very natural and strongly marked one. It comes
nearest to Una proper, from which, however, it is sufficiently distinguished, as
will be seen by the above diagnosis. It contains four or five species, all inhab-
itants of the North Pacific, and more particularly of the west coast of North
America. These may readily be diagnosticated as follows : —
