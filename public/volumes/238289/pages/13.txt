b PROCEEDINGS OF TPIE ACADEMY OF
(1820.) Temminck, Man. Orn., ii. — Genus Phahris instituted, witli psillacula
Pall, as type ; containing this species and crktatella Pall.
(1821.) Naumann, Isis, p. 779, pi. 7. — The three known species of Fraiercula
("Mormon," 111.) are reviewed, with figures of the heads. A fourth species,
Mormon corniculatum, is added. (Species now twenty-two.)
(1823.) LiCHTENSTEiN, Verzeichniss, etc. — Alca camlsch&tica Lepechen is re-
named " Mormon superciliosum." A certain " Uria Mandtii " is established,
which is frequently quoted as a synonym of Uria coluiiiba, but appears to be
rather an imperfect state of plumage oi yrylle.
(1824-5.) Stephens. Continuation of Shaw's Gen. Zool., xii., xiii.— The species
of the sub-family Urinic are all included in the genus Uria ; the type of the
genus — grylle — is re-named " scapularis." Phaleris Temm. is adopted for the
Starikis, comprehending p.?//?(/f?</rt, tetracnla, cristatclla and " pygnifea," the
latter being the same as Gmelin's species of that name. Fratercula Briss. is
adopted for the Puffins, though SynthUborumphus antiquns is included in the
same genus. F. glacialis Leach appears.* Ray's specific name for Mergulus
alle — melanoleucus— is adopted. Utamania n. g.,-j- based upon A. torda, is in-
stituted ; Alca " pica " is also ranged under it as a valid species, — making its
last appearance upon the ornithological stage. (Species now twenty-three.)
(1827.) Bonaparte, Zoological Journal, iii. — Alca monoccrata Pall., redes-
cribed as " Phaleris cerorhynca.''
(1828.) Bonaparte, Syn. Birds U. S. in Ann. Lye. Nat. Hist. N. Y. ii. — Alca
monocerata Pall, redescribed as " Cerorhinca occidentalis.'' In a foot note,
under head of " Phaleris cristatclla Temm.," Bonaparte quotes : "Alca cristatella
et pygniaea, crested or flat-billed Auk, Lath. syn. iii. pi. 95, fig. 4. Phaleris
cristatella PL Color. No. 200.]; Alca cristatella Vieill. Gal. Ois. p. 297." (!)
(1828.) Vigors, Zooloyical Journal, iv. — " Uria brevirostris" named. This is
undoubtedly the young of a previously known species of Brachyrhamphus, but
has never been positively identified. It is usually regarded as the young B.
marmoraius.
(1829.) EscHSCHOLTZ, Zoological Atlas. — Genus Chimerina instituted upon
Alca monocerata, Pall., and the species called " Chimerina cornuta." Genus
Ombria instituted upon Alca, psittacula, Pall., upon which Temminck had pre-
viously based his Phaleris.
(1829.) Kaup. . — Genus Cyclorrhynchus instituted upon Alca /».s!7/«ci(?a
Pall. (Fide G. R. Gray.)
( ?) Temminck, Planches Coloriees. (No. 579). — "Uria" Wurmizusume des-
cribed and figured. (Species now twenty-four.)
(1837 ) Brandt, Bull. Sc. Acad. Tmper. St. Petersburg, ii. — During the time
between the close of Dr. Pallas' labors and the appearance of Prof. Brandt's
paper there was a great deal of subdividing and re-arranging of the Alcidx, and
much sawing of the air in a variety of ways ; but, beyond the addition of three
species, nothing new or specially noteworthy was put forth. Prof. Brandt
originates a new classification of the Auks, (the first one which lays claim to
any truly scientific character), institutes several new genera, and describes four
new species, besides re-naming some others.
The Auks are primarily divided into two " tribes," called " Pterorhiues " and
" Gymnorhines." Under the former are ranged the true Auks, the Guillemots,
and the Sea-dove ; the latter comprehends all the rest of the family. The cha-
racter is found in the feathering or nakedness of the nostrils. This scheme is
spoken of more at length further on, and therefore need not be here criticised.
* This species must have been previously named elsewhere, since Naumann has it in
the Isis in 1821; perhaps in the Trans. Linn. Soc. of 1818, or thereabouts,
t Named in 1816.
t PI. Color. No. 200 represents camtschatica Lepechin, not cristatella Pallas.
