Length about 6-50 ; height of bill at base -30. Up-
per mandible with a basal knob ; bill stout and
wide for its length. No decided white patch on
scapulars 7. microceros.
Length about 5-50 ; height of bill at base -20. Up-
per mandible without a knob ; bill slender and
narrow for its length. Conspicuous white patch
on scapulars 8. pusillus.
The first distinctive name of this genus is said, by Mr. Gray, to be Simorhjn-
chus of Merrem, with cristatdlus as type. This genus is not in general employ.
The present writer does not know where it is instituted, but adopts it upon
the authority just mentioned. Phaleris of Temminck is usually adopted. This
genus was framed, in 1820, to include both psitlaculvs andcristatellus : the char-
acters as laid down apply best to the latter ; the former is mentioned first. It
cannot be used for cristatcllus, however, being antedated by Merrera's name.
If psiUaculus is separated from the present genus, it must be called Phaleris,
Temm., which antedates Ombria Esch., though the latter is usually applied to
that bird. Tylorhamphus Brandt is simply a duplication of Merrem's genus ;
Cyclorrhjinchus Kaup merely repeats Temminck's. Ciceronia Reicli^nbach is
based upon the smallest species of the genus — section four in the preceding
analysis. Section three of the foregoing synopsis, comprehending tetraculus
and Cassini, is really the most distinct of any, and is the best entitled to
generic rank. The chance to run in a name is left open to any one who may
be ambitious in that line.

Bill moderately large, much compressed,
densely feathered for some distance at base
of upper mandible and sides of lower. Up-
per mandible almost perfectly oval in its
lateral aspect, its culmen gently curved,
and its tomial edges more decidedly con-
vex, the former descending, the latter rapid-
ly ascending to meet at an obtuse angle.
Lower mandible extremely slender, falci-
form in sha[)e, strongly curved upwards,
its tip very acute, its tomial edges concave,
corresponding to the convex tomia of the

overhung by a slightly projecting scale. Frontal feathers embracing culmen
