quent editions of the " System." Though so long known, it has few synonyms
beyond those resulting from its reference to divers genera. Alca " deleta "
Briinnich, is the young bird. So also, beyond a doubt, is the Alca " labra-
dorica " of Gmelin, which has been so differently interpreted by various
authors. Bonaparte even says it is certainly his Sagmatorrhina Lalhami, though
he does not adopt the name labradora, as it would imply a geographical error.
Mr. Cassin, however, uses it in connection with the Sagmatorrhina. It is based
upon the " Labrador Auk " of Pennant. The diagnosis of this author, and
that given by Gmelin and Latham, are reprinted above, for facility of reference.
If the reader will take the trouble to study these three descriptions, he will
not be likely to regard them as diagnoses of Sagmatorrhina Lathawi.
This species is the type of Moehring's genus Spheniscus ; and a person ad-
dicted to iconoclasm in the matter of nomenclature might cut a fine dash on
the strength of this fact.

These two authors rely for the locality upon Audubon's authority, very
questionable in this instance.

" Specimina aliquantulum majora ex insula Spitzbergen."
Coasts of the North Atlantic; but a more boreal species than F. arcticus;
Arctic Ocean. Spitzbergen. Near Port Foulke, Greenland, (Mus. Smiths. Inst.),
" Europe," Greenland, (Mus. Acad. Philada.) Not authenticated as occurring
on the coast of Maine.
(No. 24,302, Mus. Smiths., near Port Foulke, Greenland, Aug., 1861 ; adult ;
Dr. I. I. Hayes.) With the colors, and much the general aspect of F. arcticus.
Larger than that species. Protuberance on upper eyelid more decidedly aci-
cular; in fact intermediate in size and pointedness between that oi F. arctica
and F. corniculata. Bill much larger, comparatively and absolutely, than that
of arctica, and differently shaped ; its colors about the same. Bill very deep
at the base, the basal ridge rising high on the forehead; culmen much arched,
towards the end dropping nearly perpendicularly downwards, so great is its
convexity. Upper mandible with four decided grooves ; the lower with three,
being one more on each than is usual in arctica. Gonj's more convex in out-
line, yet not produced posteriorly into so acute a hamular process. Length
14-50: extent about 26-00; wing 7-25 ; tail 2-25; tarsus 1-20; middle toe
and claw 1-90, outer do. 1-90, inner do. 1-45; bill: chord of culmen 2-40, its
convexity 2-60, ordinate of the curve -45; depth of bill at base 1-70, length
along rictus 1-50, along gonys 1-60; greatest width of bill -65; length of nasal
aperture -40.
The developement of the bill, changes of plumage, and individual variations
of this species are doubtless identical with those of arctica. Young birds of
the two species might not be satisfactorily distinguishable.
Though this species is so very near arctica it is probable that the majority
of authors would accord to it specific rank. It is apparently larger in all its
parts ; the callosity on the upper eye-lid tends in shape towards that of corni-
culata ; the bill is not only much larger every way than that of arctica, but has
