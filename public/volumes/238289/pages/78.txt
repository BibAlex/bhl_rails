Leptognathus bdcephaltjs Cope, Dipsas Scbleg. Dipsadomorus indicus Dum.
Bibr. Dipsadomorus hucephalus Jan. Leptognathus indicus Gunther. Tab.
Seba, xliii, 4-5.
This species is no doubt the type of Laurenti's genus Dipsas, as I have
pointed out, (Proc. Acad. 1860) but by the rule of exclusion, as -Leptognathus
was first taken from it, the remaining species, to which Dum^ril and Bibron
applied the name Triglyphodon, should retain the original name.
Fine specimen ; Napo or Maranon.
As the species in the Academy are not embraced in the Erpetologie G6nerale
and other works, I give a synopsis of those known to me, six of them not
described in any general work. The species not embraced in the Equador col-
lections are described at the end of the catalogue. I have been aided in this
by Jan's Elenco serpentium.

series ; anterior genials very short ; two pairs of
