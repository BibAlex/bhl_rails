132 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF
RHADIN.EA Cope.
The genus Rhadintea is nearly coextensive with Henicognathiis Jan, and
Ablabes Giinther. Ablabes of Dum. Bibr. was, however, established on the
Coronella rufula of Schlegel. which has the prolonged series of gastric
hypapophjses, and is therefore quite different, while Henicognalhus is
characterized by a peculiar structure of the mandible, which so far as I am
aware occurs in only one American species, the H. a n n u I a t u s D. B. Conse-
quently the majority of species attached to this genus belong to Rhadinjiea,
as the E. melanocephala D. B. etc. In the description of this last
species, three are mingled, as I have ascertained both from a reading of the
same, and from an examination of the originals in Mus. Paris. One of these
is our R. obtusa, the other is the true R. m e 1 a n o c e p h a 1 a, which
should be described as follows, and the third is a species as yet undescribed,
which I call Lygophis n i c a g u s Cope. DumiSril and Bibron give both the
Island of Guadaloupe and Brazil as habitats of their species. I suspect,
however, that the specimen of R. obtusa was accidentally introduced into
the jar containing the other two, and that it is confined to South America,
where it is not uncommon. It is figured by Jan in his Iconographie, as the
second specimen ofR. melanocephala. His first specimen of the same
as figured, is our Lygophis n i c a g u s, a serpent with a diacranterian denti-
tion.
The true R. m e 1 a n o c e p h a 1 a is probably confined to Guadaloupe and
the neighboring islands. Its description has been so mingled with those of
the two oiher species as to require a rediscription. It is to be regretted that
this, the type of the species, should not have been figured in the beautiful
work of Jan and Sordelli.
