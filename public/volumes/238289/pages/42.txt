At present writing only one perfect specimpn of this species is known to
exist in any American Museum. The Boston Natural History Society possess
this one; No. 9209 of the Museum Regrister, No. 8135 of the Fresuaye collec-
tion, now ownf-d by the Society. The Smithsonian Institution has a mutilated
specimen, (ah ead only), from the north-west coast of America, presented by
Mr. John Gould. As far as can be judged, it belongs to a bird rather more
perfectly plumaged than the Boston Society's specimen.

Bill small, short, much com-
pressed, regularly conical from
a lateral view, simple, being
without decided sulci, ridges,
caruncles or other irregulari-
ties of surface of any sort; cul-
men narrow, regularly moder-
ately convex from base to tip ;
commissure and gonys perfect-
ly straight in their whole
fength ; the tip of the bill
turned neither up nor down,
but the points of both man-
dibles almost meeting on the
level of the commissure. Nasal
fossffi scarcely discernible as
such, the upper border of the
small, basal, linear nostrils
being flush with the rest of the
bill. Frontal feathers extend
Fig. O.â€”Simorhynchus tetmculus (Pa,\\.) Nat. size. forward with an obtusely
founded outline on the culmen, then rapidly recede backwards as they pass
downward in a straight line just past the posterior end of the nostrils to the
commissural edge of the upper mandible ; those on the side of the lower mandi-
ble extending not quite so far, but the interramal space fully feathered Wings
rather longer than usual in this group ; legs, feet, and tail as in other species
of the genus, the legs perhaps a little longer, comparatively, than in other
species. A crest of ten or more slender elongated feathers with loosened
fibrillge springs from the middle of the forehead, just before the eyes, and
curves forward in the greater part of a circle to near the tip of the bill. A
very few filamentous feathers on the sides of the head, the slender series be-
ginning at the posterior canthus, and thence extending downwards and back-
wards. A small white spot just below the eye. Everywhere dull blackish,
or dusky; deepest on the back, becoming more of a smoky or brownish-gray
