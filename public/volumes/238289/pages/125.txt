166 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF
lumbia River, and northward. Bulb oblong-ovoid. Flowers (when more than
one) racemed, as if by the splitting of the scape.
/?. mullijiorum (Torr.) Flowers 5—8 in the raceme. — Sierras.
y. mul'iscapidea (Kellogg). Scapes several, all radical, each 1-flowered. —
Sacramento Valley (Dr. Stillman. V. s. in herb. Torrey). A remarkable
plant ; but the scape is often one only, and then undistinguishable from
var. at.
E. GioAXTEi'M Lindl. Scapes 5 or 6-flowered ; segments acuminate ; stigmas
united and club-shaped, somewhat 3-lobed. — Oregon to Idaho (Mr.E. Walker),
and northward. My specimens are all l-flowered, and too small to justify
Liudley's name. Flowers straw-yellow.
LiLiuM CANADENSE, (3. puberulum [Torv.l) Tall, strict (3 — 4 f.) ; stem and
peduncles minutely puberulent ; leaves some opposite, some verticiliate, often
some scattered; flowers few (often but one); segments orange-yellow, with
brown dots, oblong, reflexed from below the middle ; anthers oblong ; stigma
entire, 3-lobed. — Yuba Co. to the Columbia. Flowers large, showy, 1 — 7.
June, July.
y. minus. — Glaberrimum ; foliis plerumque sparsis ; flora saepius unica /? di-
midio minore ; antheris ovalibus, basi affixis. — Meadows near Mt. Shasta,
and in Oregon. June. (Yar. parviftora Hook, is undescribed.)
J. Walkeri. Floribus multis (12 — 15) minimisque (policaribus) ; racemo
elongate ; foliis verticillatis — Idaho (Mr. Elkanor Walker).
L. Washingtoxianum (n. sp.) Glaberrimum ; foliis plerumque verticillatis,
oblanceolatis vel obovatis, breviter acuminatis ; floribus permagnis, infundi-
buliformibus, basi attenuatis, umbellatis vel sajpe solitariis, subnutantibus ;
segmentis sinxtulatis, apice cuspidatis, basi longe angustatis, supra recurvatis,
3-policaribus ; intus fusco-maculatis, odoratissimis ; anth. oblongis ; stig. in-
tegro. — In woods here and there, from Yosemite to the Columbia. 3 — 5 f.
Flowers purple, varying to white.
This splendid lily seems to have been overlooked by the botanists, or con-
founded with the preceding. It is well known to the miners, who recognize
its superior qualities, and call it the " Washington Lily."
FRITILLARIA, Tournef.
* Flowers tessellated, purple and yellow. Caps. 6-winged.
F. MUTiCA Lindl. Stems many (3 — 9)-flowered, naked below ; leaves verti-
ciliate, linear-lanceolate, obtusely pointed; flowers racemed, nodding, bell-
form, as long as the pedicles (K) ; segments oblong, acutish, tessellated with
dull purple and greenish-yellow ; style trifid ; capsule 6-winged. — California;
common in the interior. 2 — ?> f. Lvs. 2 — 3'. The one radical leaf is ample,
elliptical. Bulb of white, thick scales. April, May.
/?. foliosa. — Procera ; foliis majoribus (5 — 6^); floribus parvulis, segm.
linearibus, 9'^. — In deep shades. Redwood hills. 3 — 5 f.
F. LANCEOLATA Ph. Stem strict, 1 — 2-flowered ; leaves lanceolate and linear-
lanceolate, verticiliate or opposite ; flowers nodding, obconic, obtuse at base,
longer than their pedicels ; segments oblanceolate, rather obtuse, tessellated
with purple and yellow; caspule broadly 6-winged. — Monterey to Portland,
north and east. 1 — 2 f. Lvs, 2 — 3^. Stem naked below, as in F. imitica. The
capsule is broader than long. It is more than probable that F. mutica runs
into this.
F. PARViFLOUA Torr. (P. R. R. Rep. IV.) Leaves narrowly lance-linear,
whorled or scattered; flowers small, few or many, in a long raceme, on short
pedicels, nodding ; perianth narrow at base ; style trifid to near the middle;
capsule 6-winged. — Santa Cruz, Gavilan Mts. ! Murphy's (Calaveras Co.)
Radical leaf broad. Stem lvs. about 2' by 2^'. Flowers 1 — 20, greenish and
purple.
