tinctly wider than base of prothorax, intervals with confused fine punctures.
Long. 3-5 â€” 4-5 mm. Southern States, 4 specimens. (Rather stouter in form
than the preceding, and resembling almost exactly B. f a r e u s, but quite dif-
ferent by the antenna and beak.) 27. ibis.

rounded on the sides, more densely punctured with a faint dorsal carina ;
elytra at humeri distinctly wider than base of prothorax, intervals wtth con-
fused fine punctures. Long. 3-5 mm. Georgia and Illinois, 4 specimens.

The GYEINID.E of America, north of Mexico.
BY JOHN L. LE CONTE.
Species of this family are found in every part of the United States and con-
tiguous northern regions, usually in large colonies ; from their whirling mo-
tion of the surface of the water they are popularly known as whirligigs, and, on
account of the agreeable fragrant odor of some of the species, as apple-bugs.
There is a remarkable uniformity of appearance in the species of each genus,
which renders their definition and recognition somewhat difficult ; for this
reason, notwithstanding the very curious structural characters displayed in
their organization, which are detailed in all sj-stematic works, they are not
favorites with collectors, and many of our species have remained unnamed.
Three genera are represented in our fauna :
Last ventral segment depressed, rounded at tip :
Scutellnm distinct: labrura transverse Gj-rinus.
Scutellum invisible; labrum transverse D i n e u t u s.
Last ventral segment elongated, conical :
Scutellum invisible ; labrum prominent Gyretes.
