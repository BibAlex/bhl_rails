ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES.
On the evening of March 28th, 1868, a meeting of gentlemen
interested in the organization of a Microscopical Society was held
at the office of Dr. James Tyson, at which sixteen were present,
while written or verbal communications signifying sympathy with
the project were presented from at least as many more.
Dr. R. S. Kenderdine was called upon to preside and Dr. Tyson
to act as Secretary. A letter from Prof Jos. Leidy was read, urging
the advantages of working under the Biological Department of the
Academy of Natural Sciences. Such, or a similar plan of organi-
zation met with approval, and a committee, consisting of Drs. H. C.
AVood, Jos. Leidy, Wm. Pepper, J. H. McQuillen and James
Tyson, was appointed to take into consideration the propriety and
feasibility of forming a Microscopical Department of the Academy
of Natural Sciences, and to report at a meeting to be held Saturday
evening, April 4th, at the same place.
Ajyril 4th, 1868.
President, R. S. Kenderdine, M. D., in the Chair.
Seventeen gentlemen present.
The Committee appointed at the last meeting reported, "It hav-
ing been strongly urged by members of the Committee and in-
fluential members of the Academy of Natural Sciences, that we
should not organize a purely Microscopical Department, we con-
sider that the objects of the meeting will be most successfully at-
tained by forming a Department or Section to be known as The
Biological and Microscopical Department of the Academy of Nat-
ural Sciences of Philadelphia, which will combine the objects of the
existing Biological Department and a Microscopical Society, in a
manner to be determined in accordance with Chap. XIII of the By-
Laws of the Academy, On the Creation and Government of Depart-
ments."
This report was adopted and the Committee continued to carry
out its report.
