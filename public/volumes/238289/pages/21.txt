Description (from the specimen in the Philada. Acad.) — The white spot be-
tween the eye and bill is ovate in shape, its upper border a little straightened,
its small end towards, but not quite reaching, the bill, its large end extending
to, but not around, the eye ; the width of the black space between it and its
fellow is rather more than half an inch. The back is dusky-black ; other dark-
colored parts with a good deal of clear brown, especially on the head. The
under parts, including the tail coverts, are white, this color running far up on
the front of the neck in a narrowly acute angle. The under wing coverts are
ashy-gray. The secondaries are narrowly but distinctly tipped with white.
The bill is deep black, its sulci dull white. The feet are dark, their precise
color at present undefinable.
Dimcjisions. — "Length about 30 inches ;" wing 5-75 ; tail about 3-00; bill
along gape 4-25; chord of culmen 3-15; greatest width of bill -66; greatest
depth of upper mandible 1-00, of lower -66 ; tarsus 1-66 ; middle toe and claw
3-25 ; outer 3-00 ; inner 2-25.
The occurrence of this species on the coast of North America has not been
authenticated of late years. Perhaps the last instance on record is that given
by Audubon on page 316 of the fourth volume of " Ornithological Biography."
"The only authentic account of the occurrence of this bird on our coast that I
possess, was obtained from Mr. Henry Havell, brother of my engraver, who,
when on his passage from New York to England, hooked a Great Auk on the
banks of Newfoundland, in extremely boisterous weather." This specimen was
not preserved. " When I was in Labrador," continues Audubon, " many of
the fishermen assured me that the ' Penguin,' as they name this bird, breeds on
a low rocky island to the south-east of Newfoundland." The present writer
received similar assurances when in Labrador in 1860 — the place designated
being the " Funks." Audubon also states that " an old gunner residing on
Chelsea Beach, near Boston, told me that he well remembered the time when
the penguins were plentiful about Nahant and some other islands in tlie Bay."
Two specimens only are known to exist in any American museum. One is
in the Philadelphia Academy ; its history is uncertain. The other, in the
Vassar College, at Poughkeepsie, N. Y., is the original of Audubon's plate and
description, as stated in the following note from Pi-of. Sanborn Tenny, favored
in reply to questions regarding it: "The Great Auk, presented to Vassar Col-
lege by J. P. Giraud, Jr., Esq., is in a perfect state of preservation. This spe-
cimen is the one from which Audubon made his drawing, and it was presented
