Base of upper mandible with a large upright horny protuberance. Under
mandible with an accessory corneous piece interposed between its rami, near
their symphysis. Bill shorter than the head, stout, very deep at the base,
tapering rapidly to the tip, much compressed, the sides erect, smooth, the cul-
raen very convex, the rictus gently curved, the gonys nearly straight, except at
symphysis, where it is bulging. Nostrils short, linear, subbasal, marginal,
impervious. Eye small ; no palpebral appendages. No crest ; no furrow be-
hind the eyes ; slender elongated feathers on each side of the head. Inner
lateral claw of usual size, shape and position. Other details of form almost
exactly as in Fraterciila, Size large ; general form robust.
This curious genus may readily be distinguished from all others of the family
by the characters indicated in the two first sentences of the above diagnosis.
The intercalation of an accessory corneous element at the mandibular sym-
physis is an entirely unique feature in this family. It seems very much like
the " interramicorn," as the writer has elsewhere called it, which is found in
the albatrosses, as one of the characters which distinguish those birds from
other Frocellariidse. In the present instance, it is a feature of especial import-
ance and value, as it helpsgreatly to distinguish this genus from Sagmntorrhina ,
or, to be more explicit, to separate S. Suckleyi from C. monocerata in every stage
of growth.
The affinities of this genus are decidedly with Fratercula, after Saffmaforrhina,
of course. Aside from the peculiarities of the bill, it agrees with the former in
most points of structure, excej)t the eyes and inner lateral claw. It does not
require comparison with any other genus. It is represented by only a single
species, according to the writer's way of thinking, â€” Suckleyi falling most
naturally, as well as can be judged at present, in Sagmalorrhina.

* This word is spelled in a great variety of ways, both by Bonaparte himself, and other
authors. We find Cerorhina, Cerorrhina, Ceratorhina, Ceratorrhina, Cerorhinca, Cero-
rhynca, Cerorhyneha, Ceratorhyncha, Ceratorrhyncha, etc. The orthography above cited
is that apparently first given by Bonaparte, but is obviously erroneous.
