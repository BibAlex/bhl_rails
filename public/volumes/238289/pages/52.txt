E: ropean and American coasts of the North Atlantic. On the United States
coast, in winter, south to New Jersey. Numerous specimens in Mus. Acad.
Philada., Smiths. Inst., Bost. Soc. Nat. Hist., Essex Inst., Gab. G. N.Lawrence,
author's Cab., etc.
Adult, summer plumage. — Head and neck all around, and entire upper parts
glossy black, with a beautiful metallic lustre of a shade of blue, when in high-
est piumage ; scapulars edged with white ; shafts and inner webs of primaries
brown, lighter at base; secondaries tipped with white; under surfaces of the
wings brownish-gray; under parts from the breast pure white, with a few
elongated feathers of the sides' and flanks varied with black on the outer webs ;
bill black ; legs and feet posteriorly blackish, anteriorly flesh-colored (dull
j'ellowish in the dried state).
Adult in winter. — As before ; the white of the under parts extending on the
neck and throat to the bill, on the sides of the head to the level of the rictus,
on the sides of the nape over the auriculars (where it is somewhat marbled
with black), or even to the middle of the nape, more or less confluent with
that of the other side
Young, first winter. — Recognizable by its smaller and weaker bill, by the
duller and more brownish black of the upper parts, almost wanting in gloss,
and by the greater extension of the white upon the sides of the hind head and
neck. The scapulars and coverts are conspicuously marked with white, as in
the adult, The feet are mostly dusky.
Length 8*50 ; wing 4-75 ; tail 1-50 ; tarsus -80 ; middle toe and claw 1-20,
outer do. 1-15, inner do. -85; bill along culmen -50, rictus TOO, gonys -20; its
depth at base -35, its width at same point about the same.
When in mature plumage, this is a very beautiful species. No other Alci-
dine has such lustre of the dorsal plumage, traces of which are even found in
adult winter specimens. In the latter the extent of the black upon the throat
is indicated by a dusky clouding of the bases of the feathers of the parts. The
species is ordinarily subject to only moderate variation in size or colors. The
condition of albinism has been described.
The first chronicles of this species are of great antiquity. It appears to have
shared for a time with Uria giylle the soubriquet of " Columba groenlandica."
Since its description as Alca alle by Linnieus, it has been the basis of very few
synonyms. Alca Candida of Briinnich is this species in the albino state. Mer-
gulus niclanoleucus, Ray, is adopted by many authors. Mr. G. R. Gray adopts
Moehring's generic appellation.
