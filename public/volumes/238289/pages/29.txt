Bill very large and heavy, much longer than the head or middle toe and
claw, its depth at base three-fourths its length ; excessively compressed, the
sides nearly perpendicular, except at base of upper mandible, where they bulge
a little. Upper mandible divided into two portions ; the basal part with its
sides perfectly smooth, bounded along the base by a slight oblique ridge of
subcorneous tissue, which is scarcely, however, elevated above the common
plane, and is minutely studded with points ; bounded above by a prominent
wide ridge formed of an accessory corneous piece which surmounts this por-
tion of the culmen ; bounded below by the nasal slit ; bounded anteriorly by
a deep groove whose convexity looks backwards ; these four boundaries en-
closing a subtrapezoidal space. The terminal part smooth, except in the
presence of three widely separated, oblique, curved, deep grooves, whose con-
vexity looks backwards. Lower mandible with the sides perfectly smooth, the
base convex, the convexity looking backwards, with slight indication of a
ridge of punctulated subcorneous tissue. General outline of culmen convex ;
this convexity, however, interrupted near the middle by a notch, forming a re-
entrant angle between the two parts of the culmen, each of which, taken
separately, is convex in outline — the anterior part the most so. Rictus exceed-
ingly sinuate, the tip of the upper mandible being almost perpendicularly hung
over that of the lower; the angle of the mouth occupied by a large fibrous
or membranous excrescence, nearly circular in outline, turgid in life; in the dry
state shrunken and minutely punctulated. This peculiar warty excrescence
seems of nearly the same structure as the base of the bill itself, with which it
is directly continuous. Nasal slit short, linear, subbasal, placed close to the
commissural edge of the upper mandible. Palate and floor of mouth both
deeply excavated ; the cutting edge of both mandibles exceedingly sharp.
The eyelids are naked along the edge, but present no thickening or unusual
