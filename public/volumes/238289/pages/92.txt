A fusiform species, the body rather stout and flattened, the outlines tapering
gradually to end of muzzle and tail. Head flattened, with strong canthus ros-
tralis, and concave loreal region. Postnasal and postloreal longer than high :
preloreal higher than long. Five supraorbitals ; scales behind postparietals
not larger than those of the nape. Dorsolateral angle strong on scapular
region. The eighth upper labial is the first one angulated above ; rostral plate
broad and low. The limbs, when pressed to the sides, fail to meet by the
length of the hand. Keels of the scales strong. Tail slightly compressed.
Above light gray; sides from orbit to groin dark brown, with regular ver-
tical brown bars, which are margined behind by a close series of light spots.
Two series of small brown spots on each side the dorsal region, the median

and was placed by him in the Museum Comparative Zoology, Cambridge,

Celestus weinlandii Cope, sp. nov.
This species is near the last, but is less regularly fusiform ; the body, and
especially the head, are less depressed; the canthus rostralis is depressed and
the loreal region plane. Both loreals higher than long, and the seventh
upper labial is the first angulated above. Rostral deeper, rounded above.
Five supraorbitals, separated from parietals by but one plate besides fronto-
parietals. Auricular opening small. Limbs when pressed to sides meet.
Larger median carina of scales wanting on those of anterior nape and tail.
Vent with three cross rows, rather larger scales in front.
Below the dorsolateral brown band is another formed of spots in line ; they
continue with a vertical series of brown spots on the sides, Ground above
dark brown ; sides of neck and gular region brown-lined. Limbs with brown
reticulations.
