NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 91
60. Heliconius Guarica, nov. sp.
Upper surface dark brown, glossed with bluish black ; anterior wings crossed
by a broad central transverse scarlet band, abruptly terminating after the
first median veinlet, and not touching the outer margin ; posterior, immacu-
late.
Underneath, the band becomes pale rosy white, edged only with dark pink ;
the costa of forewings, presents a short basal scarlet bar, that of the hind
wings a longer yellow one ; upon these are also five basal spots, one yellow,
surrounded by four scarlet ones.
Body black, with some yellow stripes on thorax below and a yellow ventral
stripe ; some yellow spots on the collar ; first and second joints of palpi
yellow ; third black. Antennae black.
Expanse 2*65 inches.
Hab. â€” Insagasuga, New Granada. (Coll. Tryon Reakirt.)
Closely allied to HI. Hydara, Hewits, but constantly diifers in the absence
of a scarlet spot on the upper side of the secondaries.
In the same number (63) of his " Exotic Butterflies," he has redescribed
Cal/idryas Thauruma, Reakirt, as Call. Fiaduna ; his name must therefore be
regarded as a synonym.
