Size moderate or rather small ; general form stout, compact; head with or
without a crest ; bill somewhat as in Brar/iyr/xunphi/s, but much stouter, and
shorter for its depth ; much compressed throughout, depth at base about half
the length of cnlmen, ciilmen and gonys moderately curved, gonys straight,
ascending; nasal fossiie small and shallow; nostrils subbasal, broadly oval or
nearly circular, as in Merffulus, feathered ; feathers extending to about the same
distance on culmen and keel ; on both mandibles retreating rapidly backwards
from the point of their furthest extension ; those on the upper passing just by
the nostrils, but not covering the latter. Wings of usual size and shape in this
group ; secondaries very short, as in Brachyrhamphvs, the tip of the longest not
reaching much more than half-way from the carpal joint to the end of the first
primary in the closed wing. Tail of usual length, short, broad, nearly square,
or very slightly rounded, the feathers very broadly rounded at tip. Tarsi much
compressed, anteriorly and laterally transversely scutellate, posteriorly reticu-
late ; about as long as the middle toe without its claw. Outer toe as long as
or rather longer than the middle ; its claw smaller than that of the middle ;
tip of inner claw reaching base of middle. Claws small, short, compressed,
moderately curved and acute, the inner edge of the middle one somewhat di-
lated.
With the general appearance oi Brachyrhamphiis, this genus differs from the
latter in the bill and feet. The bill is deeper at the base, and more compressed
throughout ; the feet are still more different, having very broad transverse scu-
tellation on the anterior face of the tarsus, instead of polygonal reticulation ;
and are larger, both relatively and absolutely, with longer, much more com-
pressed tarsi than in Brachyrhamphus. The type of the genus is the old Alca
antiqua Gm. A second species occurs, which differs from the type, as far as
form is concerned, in a slenderer bill, and in the presence of a conspicuous
crest.
