MIGRATIONS OF PLANTS
ted the tropics as their home; and only under
the greatest stress of circumstance can they be
induced to go elsewhere.
Tropical heat and moisture make for luxur-
iance of vegetation. There is a much greater
variety there than in the North. Woody Vines
climb the tallest trunks, where they intermingle
their leaves and blossoms with those of their
host. Gorgeous Air Plants beautify and per-
fume the forest. Stately Palms wave magni-
ficent bouquets of pendulous fronds.
As we travel away from the equator, the vege-
tation takes on a simpler aspect. There are
more annuals and more herbs. The number of
Ferns, Grasses, and catkin-bearing Trees, like
the Alder and the Birch, increase. The lim-
ited growing seasons make for a more restric-
ted accumulation of tissue. Such tropic plants
as have braved the rigours of the colder climates
have dwindled much in size. The Castor Oil
Tree becomes a humble annual (Ricinus Com-
munis) only three to eight feet in height. Other
tropical trees become so small that temperate
zone folk tread them under foot.
