ORIGIN OF PLANTS
The air was still very moist, covering the en-
tire earth with a permanent fog and a uniform
temperature. It is said that certain present-day
islands in the Pacific Ocean approximate these
ancient conditions.
All the plants of that time were flowerless,
and belonged to neither the monocotyledonous
nor the dicotyledonous classes, which include
the greater number of families today. Thanks
to many excellent speciments found in coal
mines, it is possible for scientists to classify as
many as five hundred families. It is believed
that coal itself was mostly formed from small
plants, but often entire trunks of the tree-like
forms are found in bituminous strata. Bits of
bark, cones and petrified leaves have afto been
unearthed at different times.
In the course of evolution, the Conifer trees
were the next to develop extensively. They
gained a great ascendency, but were succeeded
by Palms, Alders, Cypress and Elms. By the
Miocene period, all the forms known in tropic
Africa today had come into existence, but were
restricted by no such regional limitations as they
labour under now. Oaks and Palms, Birches
