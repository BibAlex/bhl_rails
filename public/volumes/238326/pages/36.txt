LIFE OF A PLANT
the same flowers. The Hop, Nettle, and Date
Palm are one-sex plants. Maize has flowers
of different sexes on the same stem.
Flowers are the reproductive organs. In
the blossom of the Bean, the stamens are the
male organs and the pistil is the female organ.
The stamens produce dust-like pollen which
is conveyed by the wind to the pistil of some
other flower. Pollen grains deposited on the
stigma of the pistil are held there by a sticky
secretion until they can grow a long tube which
travels down the style, eventually reaching and
fertilizing the tiny ovules or eggs.
The ovules then develop into seeds and the
pistil grows into a pod, on both of which the
parent plant bends all its energies to give a good
start in the world.
The cycle is now complete. We have another
Bean and are back to where we started, ready
for some other fellow to plant the new Bean
and perform the experiment all over again.
This is the story in brief, but there are many
other details. The different plants have in-
vented and perfected all kinds of devices to
secure the effective propagation of the race.
