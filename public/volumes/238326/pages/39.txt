PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
for next year's growth by putting forth minia-
ture shoots and leaves folded up in warm brown
overcoats. At spring's urgent call, the buds
have merely to cast aside their coverings and
step out into the warm sunlight. These buds
really make a tree a community of individuals,
because each one is capable of reproducing
everything that has occured on the plant up to
that point. This is the principle on which
grafting is carried on.
The most wonderful thing in all plant struc-
ture is the plant cell. There are anywhere
from six thousand to twelve thousand of these
living units to the square inch. In their rest-
less, moving protoplasm lies the mystery of life
â€” the directing energy which controls the
plant's activities and makes it a conscious, in-
telligent organism.
