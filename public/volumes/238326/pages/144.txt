PLANT INTELLIGENCE
must believe that in plants exists a faint copy of
what we know as consciousness in ourselves."
Many scientists believe that life and conscious-
ness always precede and are superior to organi-
zation. It is urged that possibly many plants
possess consciousness without self-consciousness
or introspection.
After a thoughtful consideration of such facts
as these, only the blindest prejudice can con-
tinue to laugh at plant intelligence. Why then
has the world of human thought been so long
and reluctant to acknowledge it? Simply be-
cause it always reasons along authentic and
established lines. For many years it has been
taught to associate animal movement with
special groups of cells called muscles and in-
telligence with special groups of cells called
nerve tissue. Failing to find any trace of nerve
tissue in plants, it ignores a hundred convincing
facts to the contrary, and declares that plant
intelligence is a myth. Failing to detect a
mechanism of sensibility, it denies the existence
of sensibility, even though in the little Mimosa
the sense of touch travels from leaf to leaf be-
fore our eyes.
