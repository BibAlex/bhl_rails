CHAPTER XIII
Plant Intelligence
"The Marigold goes to bed with the sun,
And with him rises weeping'* â€” Shakespeare
IT is no new thing to believe in the ex-
istence of intelligence among plants. As
far back as Aristotle, various great minds in
the earth's history have ascribed definite, think-
ing acts to our floral and vegetable friends.
Not a few have seen unmistakable evidences of
soul in plantdom. Even the most skeptical have
become aware of many things they cannot ex-
plain in purely mechanistic terms.
We are still living in an age which has
deified human wisdom. Man has built up vast
systems of knowledge and law, all based on his
own deep-rooted convictions. He approaches
every subject with apriori beliefs and presump-
tions. He is slow to acknowledge thinking
powers to his companion creatures of a ter-
restrial universe.
