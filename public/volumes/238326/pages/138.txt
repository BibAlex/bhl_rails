stock, inbreeding either between flowers of the
same plant or even between the organs of a
single bi-sexual flower is often practiced. In
the love-making of the Grass of Parnassus and
the Love in the Mist (Nigella), we have a
very pretty and intelligent act. The flowers are
unisexual and, as the females usually grow on
much longer stalks than the males, the latter
would not have much chance of showering
their pollen on their consorts, if it were not for
the fact that, at the proper season, without out-
side stimulation, the "tall females bend down
to their dwarf husbands. " This surely is as in-
telligent and conscious as the mating of
animals.
The carnivorous plants act with uncanny
wisdom. The insect-devouring Sundews pay no
attention to pebbles, bits of metal, or other for-
eign substances placed on their leaves, but are
quick enough to sense the nourishment to be
derived from a piece of meat. Laboratory spe-
cimens have been observed to actually reach out
toward Flies pinned on cards near them. So
