PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
mortality is a fulfilling, a conserving con-
tinuance of the present earthly existence, then
the plants deserve and have a right to expect
a chance for infinite development.
The plants serve to make this earth a floral
paradise. Why should they not be equally
necessary in a world of spirit? It is to man's
credit that he has always pictured heaven as a
place made beautiful by great hosts of trees
and flowers.
