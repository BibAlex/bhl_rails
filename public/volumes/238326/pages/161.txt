PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
faculties which enable him to attain really
striking results.
On his experimental farms near Santa Rosa,
California, Luther Burbank has made many
thousand distinct experiments involving a wide
range of plant species. It is said that at times
he has had as many as three thousand tests, call-
ing for observations on a million plants and
flowers, under way at once. Probably no similar
area of the earth's surface has grown such a
variety of vegetable products or had such in-
finite care lavished upon it.
These are the practical aspects of the rela-
tions of plants to men. On the esthetic and
pleasurable side they are equally important.
The love of plants and flowers is a universal
sentiment slumbering in the most prosaic breast.
Plants are a perpetual source of joy. They are
friends which never change. In youth, they give
zest to our outdoor pleasures. In age, they be-
speak the happiness of days gone by. In death,
they strew our last resting place with fragrance.
At all times, they stand for purity, beauty and
peace.
