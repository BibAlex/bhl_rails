PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
plants manufacture the greater part of their
solid material out of the carbon dioxide of the
air. Of what the plants do obtain from the
soil, water makes up the largest bulk. The
bread and meat of the plant world is carbon
dioxide; the drink is soil water in which is dis-
solved certain essential salts and condiments.
A chemical analysis of a Green Pea will
show approximately 46.5% of carbon, 4.2% of
nitrogen and 3.1% of all other elements, exclu-
sive of the hydrogen and oxygen which make
up the water permeating all tissue.
This is truly a startling fact. Instead of be-
longing to the earth, the plants then belong
primarily to the air. The air is their natural
habitat; the earth serves to give them a fixed
place in the world and provide them with
flavoured water to drink.
Plants are born from seeds, the joint pro-
duct of two previous individuals; they live by
eating and drinking; they marry and in turn
rear families of their own. It is our purpose
in this chapter to show, in a very definite way,
that this is not mere figurative language but a
common-sense statement of fact.
