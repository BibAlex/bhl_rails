PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
When we get into the polar regions, all the
plants take on a stunted and dwarfed appear-
ance and, in some cases, retire almost entirely
under ground. The number of genera and
species is much reduced. The Oak, Walnut,
Chesnut and Elm are replaced by the hardy
conifers. At the point where vegetation be-
comes almost extinct are dwarf Birches, Wil-
lows and polar Blackberries (Rubus Arcticus).
The simple Mosses and Lichens mark the last
lingering evidences of life.
A curious feature of plant life in the polar
regions is the rapid growth which it often ex-
hibits. The summer of the Far North is short
but it is one day of intense and blinding light.
The sun shines continually throughout each
twenty-four hours. By virtue of its stimulat-
ing power, plants are able to perform in a few
weeks processes of development which take
months under ordinary conditions.
It is illuminating to take a single country in
a more favoured climate and, as far as possible,
trace its plant history. The British Isles, be-
cause of their limited area, are a convenient
field of study. An investigation of their set-
