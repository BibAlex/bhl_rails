PLANT INTELLIGENCE
is no distinction between the protoplasm of
animals and plants, and that if we get down to
the very simplest forms in which life manifests
itself we can call them animals or plants indif-
ferently."
When one considers the rooted, plant-like
life of Mollusks and Hermit Crabs, and then
the active, animal-like life of the free-swimming
Moss spores and the wind-borne Fungi, he is
tempted to wonder if, after all, this talk of
plants and animals, is not just another of man's
arbitrary classifications, which may be super-
ceded in time by some other system of nomen-
clature.
Of only one thing are we sure, and that is
that all life is one â€” an expression of the in-
telligence and power which pervades the uni-
verse.
Many readers may vaguely feel and believe
these facts and yet not be certain that plants
are individually and personally intelligent; long
training makes them still feel that the many
admittedly clever and ingenious acts recorded
every day in plantdom are but the indications
of some external mind or force working through
