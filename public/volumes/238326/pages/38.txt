LIFE OF A PLANT
those of the Primrose and Xanthium Spinosum,
which open at the top so that only a high and
efficient wind can dislodge the seeds.
The problem of food storage is an important
one in plantdom. Annuals die when they
have flowered and produced seed. Peren-
nials wither but persist for a number of sea-
sons and sometimes many years. Those whose
stems or trunks are permanent withdraw their
starch and chlorophyll into their cambium
layer where it is safe from freezing. Those
which die down to the ground each fall store
up food material in underground stems and
roots in sufficient amount to get a good start
the following season. The Potato is an en-
largement of the underground stem, but Car-
rots, Beets, and Turnips are bulbous roots. Hy-
acinths, Tulips, Daffodils, Snowdrops, Cro-
cuses, and Buttercups all store food material
in bulbs. Practically all wild flowers which
come up early in the spring, feed upon the
nutriment manufactured during the previous
season.
Buds represent the foliage of the coming
season. Each fall, trees and bushes prepare
