PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
man's body. The plants always maintain an ad-
mirable balance between the two. There are
degenerates and unscrupulous individuals
among them, but they never forget that their
first duty is to themselves. Self-culture is with
them a passion. Whoever heard of a plant over-
eating or over-drinking or giving away to any
of those indulgent vices which are the bane of
the human world? They have their faults, but
they are sources of strength rather than weak-
ness.
In relation to its companions of the vegetable
realm, the Murderer Liana is a double-dyed
villian, yet it is only practicing in an open and
frank way, the food-getting methods, which all
life, by its very nature, is forced to adopt. To
live by the destruction of others is the sad lot
of both the smallest plant and the most highly
developed animal.
Aside from the peculiarly human susceptibil-
ity to self-indulgence, it is hard to find a single
spiritual trait not exhibited by some member
of the plant kingdom.
Love? There is no higher devotion than that
shown by the water plant called Vallisneria.
