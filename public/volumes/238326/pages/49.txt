PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
and nearly as many have established themselves
in the eastern United States.
Some plants seem to be able to adapt them-
selves to any climate and therefore are born
explorers, but the greater number are too fas-
tidious regarding conditions of soil, heat, light
and moisture to thrive well everywhere. It
is a noticeable fact that the most successful
plant invaders usually come in the wake of hu-
man colonizers and stick to the sphere of man's
influence. For example, the Butter-and-Eggs
(Linaria Linaria) has followed the railroad
tracks almost entirely over the tropical and
semi-tropical world. Sometimes, however,
hardy plants advance into the primeval jungle,
there to give battle to its lusty inhabitants.
On the whole, annuals have a better chance
than perennials to gain a foothold in a new
country. Every spring the weeds, grasses, and
common flowering plants have to start all over
again from a seed beginning. The spores of
newcomers, therefore, have almost an equal
chance with the established inhabitants. On
the other hand, the bodies of perennials occupy
the land in close-packed ranks all the year,
