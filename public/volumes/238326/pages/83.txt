PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
Ampelopsis and Wistaria vines are the only
plants at all common. Our short summer sea-
son and the fact that so many people do not oc-
cupy their city homes in warm weather are a
little discouraging, but need not shake the en-
thusiasm of any one really interested in plants.
For a few dollars a season florists will assume
all care of exterior plants and vines.
The man who has a little plot of ground be-
fore his door is indeed fortunate. Even a well-
clipped grass lawn is a refreshing asset. Sweet
Peas train well against a wall. Pansies flour-
ish in shady spots and Nasturtiums wax beauti-
ful where other plants fail.
A brown stone front, flushed to the side-
walk in the middle of a block, need not go with-
out floral decoration. Even a terra cotta box
on either side of the entrance is capable of hold-
ing much growing joy. Evergreen shrubs fit
well into such surroundings. A window box
has great possibilities. In early spring, Cro-
cus, Narcissus and Hyacinth flourish in it to
advantage. Ivy-Geraniums of smooth waxy
leaves and graceful loose sprays will grow all
summer. Vines of various kinds can be trained
