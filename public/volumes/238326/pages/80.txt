ART IN THE PLANT WORLD
varied. The Snowberry, Privet, Laurel and
Barberry have distinct characteristics of form
and shape.
There are chances for worlds of artistic ex-
pression in various seed pods and fruit vessels.
An open Pea Pod occurs in certain Renaissance
ornament. Why not (and this is not intended to
be humorous) a String Bean?
Even a lowly thing like the scarred stalk of an
old Cabbage has a pattern worthy of imitation.
The shields or remains of leaves of former
seasons form an artistic detail of the growing
Palm Tree. The Romans occasionally repro-
duced them on their columns. Leaf shields are
also met with in Greek border ornament
Why must our sculptors represent the various
fruits as bursting with mature mellowness? In
many cases, the unripe fruit is artistically more
attractive than when in the later stages of devel-
opment.
We rarely think of disease or decay as being
pleasing, yet some plants are artistic even in
their dissolution. Certain galls and cankers
draw beautiful designs on the bodies of their
victims.
