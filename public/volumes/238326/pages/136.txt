PLANT INTELLIGENCE
tinually has to meet new and trying conditions,
and while its reactions, just like those of man,
are frequently in the terms of racial and in-
dividual experience, it is constantly called upon
to make new and novel decisions.
Consider the intelligence of a wild Service
Tree described by Carpenter. As a seed, it
sprouted in the crotch of an Oak, and at once
sent a lusty root down toward the earth. As it
descended the Oak trunk and neared the
ground, its further progress was barred by a
large stone slab. It is authentically recorded,
that, when still one and one-half feet away, the
tip of the root, by direct perception or occult
means, discovered the presence of the obstruc-
tion, and, at once splitting into two equal bran-
ches, passed on either side of the stone.
A more remarkable case is that of a tropical
Monstera, which, coming into life on top of a
greenhouse, sent canny and vigorous roots di-

ground.
Isolated instances of plant intelligence might
be mere coincidences if it were not for the fact
that they multiply greatly the further one in-
