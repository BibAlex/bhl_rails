MARRIAGE CUSTOMS OF PLANTS
Most insects act as if they were unaware of
the important place they occupy in plant hy-
meneals. So intent are they on their honey-
gathering that they become covered from head
to foot with pollen without appearing to notice
it. Yet in a few instances, the Bees not only
recognize that they have been pressed into the
plant's messenger service, but by underhand
methods seek the rewards of labour without
giving adequate return. They have learned
how to cut a hole in the calyx tube pf the Bean
and the Scarlet Runner, and get at the precious
honey by short cut. If all Bees and other
fertilizing insects should master this trick, the
flowers would have to wear defensive armour
or perish.
Pollen to be effective must remain dry. The
plants have perfected many devices to shield
it from moisture. Frequently, the flowers hang
so that their petals act as tiny umbrellas for it.
Others wear rainy day hoods, and practically

The necessity for dry pollen obtains even
among the water plants. If they are surface-
floaters like the Pond Lily or the Victoria Regia,
