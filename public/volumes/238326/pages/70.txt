MARRIAGE CUSTOMS OF PLANTS
healthy offspring, though the marriage of still
more divergent individuals is preferable. Plants
like the Begonia, which bear single-sex flowers,
often grow in somewhat isolated positions and
so must intermarry a great deal among them-
selves. Staminate flowers at the top of a stalk
can shower pollen over many female flowers
growing below them.
The exception always proves the rule, which
explains why we find a few flowers which de-
liberately choose to fertilize themselves. In
the Fuchsia, the flower droops, throwing the
long pistil below the stamens, which can read-
ily drop pollen onto it. Minute hooks hold the
petals of the Indigo and Lucerne partly closed
until the flower is completely developed. When
they give way, the petals fly back, so shaking the
whole flower that the anthers shower pollen on
the pistil. The single-sex flowers of the Aloe
bend near each other at mating time.
The Violets and Polygalas are also largely
self -fertilizing. They are, therefore, borne
under the leaves or close to the ground, where
they attract little attention.
