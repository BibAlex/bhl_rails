PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
Another substance which is always present in
excess of plant needs is water. It is essential as
a tissue builder and also as a carrier of nourish-
ment. Its continual evaporation from the leaf
surfaces furnishes one of the sources of motive
power for the circulatory system. The rate of
evaporation is controlled by the stomata, little
pores or mouths which have contractible lips.
In the Lilac there are as many as one hundred
and twenty thousand stomata to the square inch.
They are nearly always located on the under sur-
face of the leaves.
Certain plants like the Cacti seem to be able
to get along without leaves, but thick, fleshy
sections of stem perform all their functions. The
Fungi and other parasites differ from most
plants in that they have no chlorophyll for
starch-making but live on the already elabor-

When our seedling grows old enough, it mar-

plants, the sexes are quite distinct. There are
such things as male plants and such things as
female plants, but more often both sexes oc-
cur in the same individual and frequently in
