PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
of Keeling, after thousands of years of existence,
contained only twenty kinds of flowering
plants.
Although plants have no legs they are not de-

pulsive power of steam to travel by, he shows
no greater ingenuity than do plants in their

Species like the Tumble Weed (Amarantus
Albus) pull up stakes, and, consigning them-
selves to the swift autumn winds, race across
country at great speed, scattering seeds as they
go. The Utriculariae or Bladderworts arc
true sailors and float about on inland streams
like little ships. The Duckweeds and Wolffias
also have aquatic habits.
However, most plants prefer to travel in
embryo. In the form of small and microscopic
seeds the force of gravity has little influence
on them, and they can journey for long and
incredible distances.
To this end practically every seed in exist-
