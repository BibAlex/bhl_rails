PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
and Bamboos, Elms and Laurels grew side by
side. The Palms reached as far north as
Bohemia, Switzerland and Belgium. Maples,
Lindens, Planes, Spruces, Magnolias, Persim-
mons and Pines flourished in Greenland. The
Silver Fir and the Southern Cypress advanced
to within two hundred leagues of the North
Pole. The California Redwoods and Sequoias
are survivors of a race which flourished in this
age.
Man came very late in the earth's evolution,
but he has had a profound effect upon the plant
world. His most noteworthy feat has been to
take comparatively weak plants like the grains
and, for his own purposes, give them large areas
in which to grow. Wheat, Maize, Yams and
Tobacco became widely diffused as cultivated
plants before the historic era. It is probable that
Rice and the Legumes were first domesticated
in Asia; Barley and Wheat in Egypt; and
Maize, Potatoes, Yams and Manico in America.
The origin and development of plants is a
fascinating study. So authentic are the records
which they have left in the eternal rocks that we
have little difficulty in reconstructing their
entire race history.
