CHAPTER XI
Plant Mythology
"I'll seek a four-leaved clover
In all the fairy dells,
And if I find the charmed leaf,
Oh, how I'll weave my spells,"
EVERY Plant is surrounded by a halo of
human thought. If one is able to discern
that halo, he finds a new and fascinating in-
terest attaching itself to each herb and flower.
The most humble of them become fortune-tel-
lers, luck-bringers, and talismen against evil,
as well as dwelling-places of fairies, elves, imps,
and other ethereal mischief-makers.
In the childhood of humanity, the earth was
a very romantic place. In addition to the fam-
iliar human inhabitants, there were whole races
of supernatural and invisible beings which
wielded great influence over the every-day
world of affairs. Every plant was considered
good or evil, according to the character of the
spirits which it was believed to harbour.
