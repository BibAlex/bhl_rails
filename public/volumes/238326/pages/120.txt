RELIGION IN THE PLANT WORLD
wood tells of remarkable instances of modern
flower worship he saw in Bombay. In describ-
ing the Victoria Gardens, he says: "Presently,
a true Persian, in flowing robes of blue, and on
his head his sheep-skin hat, 'black, glossy, curl'd,
the fleece of Kar-kaP, would saunter in, and
stand and meditate over every flower he saw,
and always, as if half in vision. And when the
vision was fulfilled, and the flower he was seek-
ing found, he would spread his mat and sit be-
fore it until the setting of the sun, then fold
up his mat again and night after night, until
that particular flower faded away, he would re-
turn to it, and bring his friends in ever-increas-
ing troupes to it, and sit and play the guitar or
lute before it, and they would altogether pray
there, and after praying still sit before it, sip-
ping sherbet, and talking the most hilarious and
shocking scandal late into the moonlight; and
so again and again every evening until the
flower died. Sometimes, by way of grand finale
the whole company would suddenly rise before
the flower and serenade it together, with an
ode from Hafiz, and then depart."
