PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
act, the first root came into being, and lol there
were terrestrial plants.
It is to be noted that all development in the
plant world is born of necessity. To the plants,
dependence upon water, food and the impulse
to reproduction may be ascribed the start of
many a new form among them. In the more
complex groups we seem to see a conscious
striving for higher and better things, but the
lowlier species often need the goad of circum-
stance to force them to attainment.
When the plants first emerged upon the land,
a number of structural changes became neces-
sary. Whereas in the marine world, water is
absorbed directly by all parts of the plant, in
land life special organs of absorption and
conductivity must be developed. At first, the
roots were mere rhizoids or hairs, aided by
water-drinking leaves and tubers, as in the
Mosses and Liverworts today; but it was not
long before true root and vascular systems were
evolved. Other changes which came with
terrestrial life were greater rigidity of tissue and
devices to guard against evaporation. Leaves
were developed for the purposes of manufac-
