RELIGION IN THE PLANT WORLD
shire, England, the good St. Leonhard once
battled with a dragon for three whole days. Be-
fore he was able to slay the monster, the doughty
warrior was wounded with consequent loss of
blood. God could not bear to see the life fluid
of this holy man spilled heedlessly, so trans-
formed each drop, as it fell, into a Narcissus.
"Consider the Lilies of the field, how they
grow; they toil not, neither do they spin; and
yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his
glory was not arrayed like one of these." This
is a great tribute to the Lily and it has been
similarly praised throughout all literature.
About this lovely flower hang myriads of sacred
legends and such titles as the "symbol of pur-
ity," the "soul of beauty" and "the symbol of
peace." In the lore of the Greeks and the
Orientals, this matchless flower was hailed with
the Rose as the "Queen of Heaven." The Vener-
able Bede called it the most worthy symbol of
the Virgin. He said that its pure white petals
represent her undefiled body and the golden
stamens her radiant soul shining with god-like
light. Many old paintings of the Virgin show
her with a vase of Lilies by her side.
