PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
It must be realized that the animal brain
merely acts as the electrical motor for the life-
power which drives the universe. This motor
and all of its auxiliaries are absent in Protoza
and other one-celled animals, but the power is
not. In the same way, they are absent through-
out all plantdom, but the eternal life principle
manifests itself in many mighty acts.
What is a nervous system, anyhow? It is a
groug of cells, the specialized function of which
is to transmit impulses from one to the other
by certain obscure chemical reactions. Why
cannot ordinary tissue cells do the same thing,
possibly in a feebler, less efficient way? Plant
cells are all joined together by fine connecting
strands, forming a "continuity of protoplasm"
through which such impulses could readily
travel. Whether investigators agree to this
or not, it is an indisputable fact that it
is true.
Though science is now beginning to verify
the fact of plant intelligence most conclusively
great and independent thinkers of all times
have long felt its truth. Certain minds are al-
ways in advance of their age. While science
