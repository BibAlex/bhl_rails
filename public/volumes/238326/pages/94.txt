MUSIC IN THE PLANT WORLD
little Butterfly on occasion is a drummer. With
hooks on its wings, it makes a sharp crackle,
not unlike one of the weird noises sometimes
used by human "traps." Beetles play the bones.
The Bamboo Tree is sometimes the possessor
of a whole corps of intelligent and efficient
drummers. They attach themselves to the
under side of the leaves, from which vantage-
point they strike them with their heads when-
ever their services are required. An Ant of the
Sumatratran species keeps wonderful time.
Though spread out over a number of square
yards of leaf space, a group of these tiny cre-
atures will start and stop tapping at the same
instant
Perhaps in some far-distant age, mankind
will begin remotely to understand the signifi-
cance of the music of the plant world and its
allies. We have no right to say that the plants
are not true musicians. While we may only
understand their system of harmony in part,
we can realize it contains hidden beauties
just as the presence of microscopic organisms
in the world is indicated by their effects rather
than by actual perception.
