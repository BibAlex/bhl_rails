this disturbance of the natural order of things

up with the welfare of the plants.
About a hundred years ago, a certain section
of forest in France was levelled. It contained
Oak, Beech, and Ash. The new trees to spring

they too were felled and young shoots of the

When it comes to plants grown in nurseries
and conservatories, gardeners are often able to
