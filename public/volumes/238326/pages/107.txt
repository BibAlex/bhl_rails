PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
because their acids change into sugar under the
influence of sunlight.
Man seems to have outstripped the plants
in the use of light, heat, electricity, and other
physical forces, but the plants have more engi-
neers among them than we imagine. In the
fact that man has just learned to extract nitrogen
from the air by the agency of electrical dis-
charges, lies the probable explanation of how
the plants have been doing the same thing for
years. It is believed that the minute electrical
discharges continually going on between the dif-
ferent air strata make small quantities of nitro-
gen assimilable for the plants. The micro-
organisms which also furnish nitrogenous
material to the plants may get nitrogen from the
air in the same way. It is quite certain that the
plants are affected by the chemical state of the
atmosphere.
Everyone knows what an important part
light plays in plant physiology, but the fact that
certain plants produce their own lights, while
generally known, is not universally understood.
The Austrian naturalist, Heller, was the first
to demonstrate that the glowing of decayed
