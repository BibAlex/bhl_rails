ART IN THE PLANT WORLD
leaves" is to speak in the most general of terms.
What is more exquisite than the silver gray to
be seen on the backs of many tree-leaves, nota-
bly the Alders, Willows, and Poplars? Many
leaves join the Wild Lettuce in having purple
backs. The reverse sides of Magnolias and
Rhododendrons are red-brown. In the autumn,
nearly all leaves show brilliant patches of
colour.
In borrowing Nature's colours to set forth
our ideas, we have become possessors of a
mighty vehicle of expression. With yellow, we
can speak of life, light, cheer and vitality.
Red tells of fire, heat, blood, excitement and
passion. Blue indicates coolness, quiet and
restraint. In choosing green for its most univer-
sal colour, Nature harmonizes life and restraint,
warmth and coolness, as represented by the
component blue and yellow. In the same way,
when she wants to concentrate the maximum
colour power in a single fruit or flower, she uses
orange, a combination of light and heat,
vitality and excitement. Purple represents a
neutralized idea. Red vitality is tempered with
blue restraint, which results in mysticism.
