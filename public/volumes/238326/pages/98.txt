some pollen on the little intruder with the hope
that he may carry its vital principle to some
neighbour of the same species.
In the Parnassia Palustris, fortunate observ-
ers have sometimes seen the five stamens bend
forward and beat on the head of the pistil in
rotation as if on an anvil. Perhaps outside
pollen-carrying agencies have passed this par-
ticular flower by and, in desperation, it is re-
sorting to self-fertilization.
The lunger Mania, a plant allied to the
Mosses, shows knowledge of the laws of me-
chanics when it uses a natural spring coiled
in a small tube to project its seeds out into the
world. Seeds of fresh-water Algae swim about
for a few hours after leaving their mother-plant,
vibrating their cilia with great rapidity. It
is the ability of certain one-celled plants to
move about freely which causes considerable
discussion as to whether they are really not
animals. The Diatoms are examples. They
propel themselves through the water by oscil-
