long delicate tubes through which it some-
times sucks food and water.
One of the most interesting facts in plantdom
is the alliance maintained by Clovers, Beans,
Vetches and other leguminous plants, with
Bacteria belonging to the class Pseudomonas,
No soil can be fertile unless it contains organic
compounds of nitrogen. The earth Bacteria
have discovered methods of producing these
important substances, possibly extracting nit-
rogen distributed through the ground. These
minute parasites attach themselves to the roots
