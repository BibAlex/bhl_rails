PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
heat and power. In a desert region, animals
soon perish, because even carnivorous species
live on herbivorous fellows which in turn are
eaters of plants. This is why the distribution of
men and animals is so greatly influenced by
that of plants.
For clothing man depends partly upon such
plant-products as Cotton and Flax and partly
on plant-fed animals which yield him silk, wool
and leather. The great plant structures of the
forest give him the chief materials which go
into the construction of his ships and houses,
with all their appurtenances. The bodies of
plants, recently alive or the bodies of plants
long since dead furnish fuel for cooking, heat-
ing and power. Drugs are very largely of
vegetable origin. In brief, the plants feed,
clothe, shelter, and warm mankind.
Man has made many plants his servants. His
first attention was naturally given to such
species as he could use for food. Two thousand
years ago, the ancients were growing practically
all the food plants that are known today. Maize,
Potatoes, Rice, Beans, Dates and Bananas have
been cultivated for an even longer period.
