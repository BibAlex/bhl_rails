ORIGIN OF PLANTS
belonging to the family Archegoniatae early
established an alternation of generation in
which the spores give rise to a small plant which
looks like a Liverwort and bears the reproduc-
tive organs. The fertilized ovum of this plant
grows into a leafy, sexless individual which
produces spores non-sexually. We therefore
have a generation endowed with sex organs
making for development and progress, alter-
nating with a sexless generation calculated to
continue the tendencies of the race.
It is undoubtedly the sex element which
accounts for those "sports" or mutations in
plantdom which occasionally overstep the limits
of species to form new species.
In the luxurious atmosphere of the early globe,
vegetation waxed strong and vigorous and at-
tained remarkable proportions. The primeval
woods served to draw the superabundant carbon
from the air and in millions of decayed bodies
store it up as graphite, coal, petroleum and il-
luminating gas. The present day graphite beds
alone represent vast quantities of ancient vege-
tation. It is a unique experience to be able to
write or draw pictures of these prehistoric plants
