PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
Nature clothes the Poppy in red to suggest
power and strength. The royal purple of the
Aster and the Violet is purposely calculated to
arouse a feeling of mystery and awe.
Our man-made cloth designs often show
various plant forms intact in the weave. The
same is true of lace, while one has only to look
at the miniature flower gardens which women
wear on their heads to realize the potent influ-
ence of plants in the domains of millinery. An
important plant element seems to run through
many fields of applied art.
In some ways, the beauties of form and struc-
ture are more appealing than chromatic charms.
Lines are more refined and fundamental than
colours. A feathery mass of tree-twigs seen
against a distant horizon is exquisitely beau-
tiful. A symmetrically shaped tree comes very
close to presenting an idea of pure form. One
may argue that it is impossible to dissociate
all idea of colour from a natural object. This
is theoretically true, but practically, while we
are impressed by the colour of the Rose, it is the
structural beauty of the Palm and Weeping
Willow which attracts our eye.
