PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
middle age, but for our young prince we want
flowers of the spring that may become his
time of day."
Sometimes, through sentimental attachment,
whole peoples elect certain flowers to represent
them before the world. Thus the United States
has chosen the Goldenrod for its national floral
emblem, while the Rose of England, the Thistle
of Scotland, the Shamrock of Ireland, and the
Leek of Wales act in the same capacity for the
British Isles.
Man paid a high compliment to the mystic
veneration in which he holds the plant world
when he, in his primitive beliefs, invariably
conceived of heaven as some terrestrial paradise
of luxurious vegetation. The Persians had their
Mount Caucasus; the Arabians dreamed about
an Elysium in the Desert of Arden; the Greeks
and Romans had bright mental pictures of the
Gardens of Hesperides; and the Celts hoped
to spend their postmortem existence on an en-
chanted isle of wondrous beauty.
Such beliefs have fallen into disuse, but man
is still a long way off from a solution of the
various mystic phenomena of the plant world.
