PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
Everything in plantdom has its own peculiar
style of structure and beauty. All are worthy
of imitation and reproduction, provided only
it is done in the right place and the right way.
It must be remembered that, in origin, orna-
ment was first symbolic and then decorative.
Real ornament is never unduly prominent but
subordinates itself to the idea and structure of
the whole.
Man has imitated the plants also in things of
a lowlier nature. Cups, vases, pitchers and
other utensils were undoubtedly first suggested
by similar shapes in plantdom. It is not too
fantastic to imagine that the smoking pipe is
modelled after the flower known as the Dutch-
man's Pipe. An electric wire running down
the chain of a suspended lighting fixture looks
all the world like a climbing vine. Human
jewelry has its prototype among the flowers.
Our garden beauties powdered their faces long
before their human sisters ever thought of that
method of self-adornment It is said that
Greek dancers and athletes sometimes exer-
cised before certain slender plants in order to
pattern their bodies after them.
