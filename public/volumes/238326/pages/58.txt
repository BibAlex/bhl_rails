COMRADES OF THE PLANT WORLD
ter which contains elaborated food material.
Many choose the latter course, but a goodly
number, especially those of primitive struc-
ture, have entered into profitable partnerships.
The minute one-celled plants called Zoo-
chlorella or Zooxanthella have chosen the fresh
water sponge Ephydatia Fluviatilis for their
messmates. Sometimes they live with the Hy-
dra called Viridis and impart to it a bright
green colour.
There are whole regiments of microscopic
parasites which thrive on living plant tissue
and cause spots and rust to appear on Apples,
Peaches, Pears and other fruits and number
among their cohorts Rose-blight, Wheat-rust,
and various Mildews. The larger messmate
does not receive very much benefit from the re-
lation, in this instance, except when the minute
guests serve to cover a cut or an abrasion with
a protective mantle, just as Mildew shields
cheese or jelly from decay.
Cases where Fungi render very valuable ser-
vices to larger plants are exemplified by the
Monotropa or Indian Pipe. This pallid scaven-
ger grows on the decaying vegetable matter
