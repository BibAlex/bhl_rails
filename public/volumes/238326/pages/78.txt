ART IN THE PLANT WORLD
Nature is the true and original sculptor.
From her we learn our rules of symmetry and
design. All her plant creations are finished
with a faithfulness to artistic principles which
is quite exact. Nor does she build houses with
false exteriors. Her structures show forth the
necessity of truth in real esthetic creation.
Bartholdi's exquisite Statue of Liberty, viewed
from the interior, is an ugly, hollow tube. A
stalk of corn not only has a pleasing exterior
but is made up of symmetrically formed and
packed interior cells. From a giant Redwood
to a microscopic vegetable organism, every line
and structual unit in the plant world is perfect
in its inception and execution.
Each plant, viewed as a whole, has its own
peculiar style of structural beauty — the variation
of line and form which stamps it with charm.
This differentiation extends to all parts of the
plant and gives character to leaves, stem,
flowers and fruit. Marvellous is the art worked
out in the minute parts. The tendril of the
Passion Flower, the radicle of a Seedling
Maple, the feathery hair on a stalk of Mullein —
all these are shaped according to the unknown
