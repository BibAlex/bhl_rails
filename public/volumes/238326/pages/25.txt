PERSONALITY OF PLANTS
and use, in the carbon of our pencils, portions
of their very bodies.
Everything was on a grand scale in the "Old
Red Sandstone" age. There were no real trees
yet, but the Asterophyllites, with their tall, slen-
der stems, looked much like Palms. The Eryp-
togams were immense Mushrooms. Algae,
Zostera and Psilophytons covered the shores
with a tangle of seaweed vegetation.
In the succeeding carboniferous period, the
plant world reached the climax of its dominion.
While the variety was still very much limited,
its vigor and luxuriance were astounding. The
Tree-ferns seem to have come down to us un-
changed from that time, but other plant des-
cendants have dwindled in size greatly. Our
humble Mares' Tails were then twenty or thirty
foot trees called Calamities. The Club-Mosses
were giant Lepidodendruns. Other immense
plants which have no direct descendants were
the Sigillarias and the Lomatophylos. With its
flexible, fluted and checkered stems, saw-edged
leaves, and hanging garlands of parasitic Ferns,
the carboniferous forest presented a remarkable
scene.
