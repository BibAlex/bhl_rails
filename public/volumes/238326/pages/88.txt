MUSIC IN THE PLANT WORLD
It would seem as if such a tree were trying to
express many mysterious wonders of which man
has little knowledge.
The trees are not altogether dependent upon
their leaves for their music. The barren
branches of fall and winter sing in a most at-
tractive way. Their dry and discarded leaves
litter the ground and carry on crackly songs
of their own, or sing as they play tag in whirls
of wind. The Elm is a pleasing autumn singer
and the Willows, when covered with ice, rattle
their twigs like a minstrel's bones. As the win-
ter wind hums around the Cottonwood Trees,
it rocks the seed balls in their natural cradles
with a sighing, crooning sound. This is the
way the Tree sings to her babies! When the
wind soughs through a hollow tree, it produces
a ghostly sound suggestive of a mourning or
dying person. A current of air rubbing two
boughs together causes a scrunching sound
which sends the shivers up one's back.
It is reasonable to believe that every tree and
plant has its own individual voice as set in mo-
tion by the wind. A Nature-lover does not have
much difficulty in distinguishing a great many.
