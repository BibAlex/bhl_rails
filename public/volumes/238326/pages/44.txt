MIGRATIONS OF PLANTS
tlement by plants gives us many hints about
prehistoric climatic and geographical changes.
Geologists generally believe that the British
Isles were once joined to the mainland of Eur-
ope. It was at this time that they were settled
by vegetation. Some of this plant life came
from Spain and some from southwest France;
there was also a Germanic group. The floating
ice of the glacial period brought over hardy
visitors from the Scandinavian peninsula. A
few plant immigrants arrived from North
America and landed on the west coast of Ire-
land.
St. Helena is an isolated volcanic mass built
up seventeen thousand feet from the bed of the
ocean. It therefore has its own peculiar vege-
tation, a portion of which is believed to have
been evolved on the spot from the one-celled
state. According to Sir Joseph Hooker, forty
out of fifty flowering plants and ten out of
twenty-six Ferns "with scarcely an exception
cannot be regarded as very close specific allies
of any other plants at all." Sixteen of the Ferns
are common to Africa, India or America and
were probably carried there by the wind.
