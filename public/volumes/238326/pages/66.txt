MARRIAGE CUSTOMS OF PLANTS
the pole, these would-be feasters readily pass
the guardian hairs just above the stamens, pass
the stamens themselves and unintentionally fer-
tilize the pistils with pollen they have picked up
on other marauding expeditions. Having par-
taken of honey, the Flies seek to escape, but
now find the way barred by the down-pointing
hairs which have bristled up in a militant man-
ner. The insects must stay until the plant de-
cides to release them, which is never until the
stamens have ripened and showered them with
a fresh supply of pollen.
The Orchids are among the most beautiful
and extraordinary flowers in the world. Their
noteworthy development has come about
through their efforts to secure abundant and
efficient insect fertilization. So certain are
their methods that they ordinarily do not re-
quire the services of more than one stamen.
In one variety, the English Spotted Orchid,
the pollen is enclosed in two sacks or bags pro-
vided with long stems. These sacs are lodged
in special cavities near the pistil in such a man-
ner that the sticky ends of the stems come in con-
tact with the head of a nectar-sucking Bee.
