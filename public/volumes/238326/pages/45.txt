Ocean currents also brought other species from
Africa.
In 1883, a most interesting thing occured on
the A9iatic island of Krakatoa. A violent vol-
canic eruption wiped every vestige of life off
its surface. When the flow of lava ceased and
the earth cooled once more, Krakatoa was to
all intents and purposes a volcanic island newly
risen from the sea. It presented the exact
analogy of a recently created bit of land wait-
ing to be settled by the plants. In 1883, it was
as barren as the face of the moon. In 1888, a
Mr. Hemsley described its appearance as fol-
lows : â€”
"The first phase of the new vegetatiorj was a

forming a green, slimy coating, such as may

a hygroscopic condition, in the absence of
which it is doubtful whether the Ferns by
which they were followed could have estab-

reproduced from microscopic spores, which
are readily conveyed long distances by winds.
Eleven species of Ferns were found, all of very
