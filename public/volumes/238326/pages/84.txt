ART IN THE PLANT WORLD
so as to make very effective window screens.
The subject of home plants is fascinating.
It is well to note that it is not always necessary
to go in for the more elaborate varieties. It
is surprising what a delicate and pleasing decor-
ation is made by so humble a thing as a sprout-
ing Carrot or a Sweet Potato Vine.
Outdoor and landscape gardening are whole
sciences unto themselves. In general, a Ren-
aissance house looks best surrounded by formal
and well-clipt flower beds. Houses on the
Gothic order should have undulating lawns
and irregular groups of shrubs and trees about
them.
Plants and flowers are the first and original
artists. Their creations are our best and most
worthy models. We can use them both as ex-
amples to be imitated and beautiful objects with
which to surround ourselves. They are one of
our greatest esthetic inspirations.
