This comparison shows that, while the mineral agrees in all
essential respects with andorite, it is slightly high in lead sulphide
and correspondingly low in silver and antimony. This may be due
to incipient alteration along the lines discussed below.
The andorite gives, before the blowpipe, the usual reactions for
silver, lead, antimony, and sulphur. In the closed tube it decrepi-
tates slightly and fuses at a moderate temperature but without con-
spicuous decomposition, yielding faintly perceptible rings of sulphur
and antimony oxide, oxysulphide, and sulphide. In the open tube
it gives a copious sublimate of antimony oxide. The mineral is
soluble in hot concentrated hydrochloric acid.
ALTERATION OF THE ANDORITE.
While andorite was originally the most abundant metallic
mineral of the ore, typical unaltered andorite crystals are now rare,
the majority of the individuals being more or less affected by a
change which is first manifested by a granular appearance and
prismatic cleavage or parting. With further alteration a porous
core is developed in the andorite mass with a brilliant blue or purple
tarnish. In extreme stages of alteration the andorite contains a
central cavity filled with finely felted wool-like material or is re-
placed entirely by stellar aggregates of fine fibers. Partial analyses
indicate that crystals in the first stages of the alteration which have
been dulled in luster with the development of granular or sub-
fibrous appearance and prismatic parting do not differ greatly in
composition from the unaltered andorite. Two partial analyses of
materials showing these changes in properties gave the following
results :
