SERIES 3. — IMPLEMENTS USED IN SHAPING STONE.
.Plates 55 and 56.
The series begins with the stone hammer, used very generally by
primitive peoples in shaping stone. Analogous forms of the tool
occur the world over, and European and American forms are iden-
tical. In shaping brittle stone the discoid or globular hammer (Nos.
1, 2, and 4) is held in the hand and flakes are removed by sharp
blows, while tough varieties are shaped hj pecking, or bruising, and
grinding. The bone implement (No. 3) is used in removing small
flalves or chips by pressure (see result in No. 4, series 1, and No. 5,
series 2). Drills (Nos. 6, 7) are employed in perforating or in deep
cutting. The core made by the copper tubular drill is shown in lower
figure 7. Abrading stones (No. 5) serve to rub down surfaces and
sharpen edges, and chisels (No. 9) are employed in carving soft
varieties of stone, as soapstone, shown in lower figure 9. The shaping
instruments of advanced peoples are of metal (No. 10), but are ex-
tremely simple, save where a machine is used as the motive power.

the great advance of the stoneworking industry.)
