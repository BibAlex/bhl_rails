loaned by Dr. W. E. Ford. Those for diopside were determined by
Wright and Larsen^^ on the artificial mineral.

The refractive indices of the Tuxtla diopside-jadeite approach
closer to those of diopside than to those of soda jadeite; this may
be attributed to the presence of a small amount of babingtonite
molecules, which would tend to raise the values for these constants.
It is difficult to account for the anomalous extinction angle.
Provenance. — The question of the provenance of the jadeite (and
chloromelanite) that was used by the ancient inhabitants of Mexico
and Central America is one of great interest, and one that is as yet
unanswered. It was suggested years ago by Pirsson^^ that jadeite
may be formed through the metamorphism of highly sodic igneous
rocks, such as nephelite syenite or phonolite. Bearing this possibility
in mind, and taking into consideration the distribution through
North America of igneous rocks of different general chemical com-
positions, I have for long had a suspicion that the original localities
of the Mexican and Central American jadeites are along the Pacific
coast, rather than in the interior or near the Gulf. The establish-
ment of the occurrence among Mexican and Central American
artifacts of two distinct kinds of jadeite — a soda jadeite and a
diopside jadeite — might aid in throwing some light on the interest-
ing problem of the provenance of the material, wliich has not yet
been found in situ.
Some archaeological considerations. — Although not a student ol
American archaeology, I venture to add a few remarks on certain
stylistic and archaeological features of the Tuxtla statuette; these
may be of interest, though they are foreign to the subject of this
paper. They are offered only because they are based on some gen-
eral archaeological principles, applicable to Mayan as well as to
•2In view of the difflcult accessibility of the Bisiiop Jade Book it may be of interest to state the
principal crystallographic results of Penfield, which do not seem to have become a part of the general
literature of mineralogy. He found that jadeite is nionoclinic, with a : b : c=1.103 : 1 : 0.613; angle j8 =
72° 44J'. The planes present were : o(lOO), 7n(110), 7!(130), and t(Ill) ; with the fundamental angles.

34% and 2V=about 70°.
