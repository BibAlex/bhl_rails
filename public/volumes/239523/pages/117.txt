Synonyms. — Nordmann described a new genus and species under
the name EpacMJies paradoxus in his Mikrographische Beitrage.
1832, part 2 (p. 45). In the text on pages 46 and 47 he gave refer-
ences to plate 12, figures 12, 13, and 14, but no such plate was pub-
lished with his paper, and the only illustration that has ever appeared
is a single figure published by Burmeister in 1833. He claimed that
the species belonged in the genus Lernanthropus on account of its
resemblance to Lernanthropus pupa,^ and this claim was afterwards
acknowledged as correct by Nordmann himself. Accordingly the
species paradoxus has been included in the key just given.
In the same paper in which Nordmann acknowledged Burmeister's
claim ^^ he endeavored to establish upon Beneden's Lemanthropus
petersi a new genus, which he proposed to call Stalagmus. The
validity of this genus has been denied by most authors, and appar-
ently with good reason. Although it differs in many particulars
from other species these differences do not seem to warrant generic
distinction.
Again in this same paper Nordmann described (p. 508) and figured
(pi. 7, figs. 5-8) some specimens which he referred to Beneden's
species kr0yeri., but which are certainly distinct, and hence the}' have
been given the new name nordmanni.
In his discussion of this genus ^° Goggio established a new species
which he named lichiae, but the following year he acknowledged it
as a synonym of Brian's trachuri.
