shaping and finishing, and the firing or baking is accomplished with-
out the aid of a furnace.
In the center (pi. 41) is a Zuni woman building up and smoothing
the walls of a vase, using her fingers. When the shape is perfected,
a white wash is put on, and the surface is polished with a smooth
stone (right). The other woman paints the design in black and red
pigments with rude brushes (left), and the baking is later accom-
plished in a hot fire.
Finished specimens of the work are shown.

The processes involved in the manufacture of earthenware are
varied, and the course of their development is perhaps better under-
stood than are the processes of other arts, because the plastic clay
has received and preserved the record in ways peculiar to itself. The
implements and devices are of several classes. There are the model-
ing tools, bits of gourd (No. 1), shell, wood, or bone; the modeling-
texturing tools, which serve for shaping and decorating at one and
the same time (Nos. 2 and 3) ; the polishing stones (No. 4) ; the in-
cising tools (No. 6) ; the brush (No. 7) ; stamps (No. 8) ; the mold
(No. 9) . Besides these there are devices for baking or firing, glazing,
and ornamenting, not shown here for want of room.

From the whole field of products of the ceramic art the vase alone
is chosen for illustration in this exhibit. The simplest forms are the
rude, unpolished cups and bowls of primitive tribes (Nos. 1, 2, and 3) .
