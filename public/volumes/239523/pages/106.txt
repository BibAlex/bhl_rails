ABT. 5. NORTH AMERICAN PARASITIC COPEPODS WILSON. 23
Genus ANTHOSOMA Leach.
Caligus (part) Abildgaard, 1794. See under Anthosoma crassum.
Generic characters of female. — General body form short and
rather stout. Cephalothorax covered with an ovid carapace more
than half the entire length of the body. Genital segment and
abdomen entirely covered dorsally by two large elytra, which overlap
considerably along the midline; also, entirely concealed ventrally
by three pairs of overlapping foliaceous swimming legs. Abdomen
small and one-jointed. Egg strings narrow and three times the body
length. First antennae slender, six-jointed; second antennae stout,
jointed, terminating in a strong claw; maxillipeds short and very
strong, with a powerful terminal claw.
Generic characters of male. — General body form and appendages
very similar to those of the female, but the genital segment and
abdomen have no dorsal elytra and so are visible in dorsal view.
The first two pairs of foliaceous swimming legs have one-jointed
rami in the notches on the inner margins.
Type of the genus. — Anthosoma crassum (Abildgaard), mono-
typic.
Remarks. — This genus has but the single species and it is easily
recognized by the dorsal elytra and the foliaceous swimming legs,
since they are quite different from anything found in other genera.
In spite of the fact that the genus is so old and so well known there
are still some details of structure which have never been presented.
