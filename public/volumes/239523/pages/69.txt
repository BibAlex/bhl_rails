approximately the angles of epidote, which suggested that it might
be allanite. A crystal was accordingly crushed and embedded in an
oil having an index of refraction of 1.695 and examined with a
petrographic microscope, when it was found to be doubly refracting
almost throughout and distinctly pleochroic in tones of pale dirty
brownish green and greenish black. Its ii.dices of refraction were
all distinctly lower than that of the oil, suggesting that the mineral
was allanite (??=!. 68 Larsen) rather than epidote (?i=1.73-1.77 Lar-
sen). Since the identity and orientation of the crystal were not sus-
pected when it was measured, the direction of elongation was
mounted as polar. The angles measured are given below as inter-
facial angles.

RUTILE.
Common red-black to deep-red rutile is unusually rare in these
sands, the titanium being present mainly as ilmenite, with some
titanite. Rare rounded prisms of deep-red rutile were found in a
sand from Rhodes Creek, near Pierce City, and in a Snake River
sand from Minidoka. A steely-lustered prismatic crystal 6 mm. long,
found in the polycrase-bearing sand from Centerville, was identified
as rutile. The prismatic zone is deeply striated, the forms present
being a(lOO), 7/i(110), and ^(130). The crystal is terminated by the
pyramid e(Oll). This crystal is shown in the drawing (fig. 23).
It was peculiar in showing greenish internal reflections and when
the crystal was crushed and examined in transmitted light the color
was yellowish green, a very unusual color for rutile. As empha-
sized under " zircon," some of the light-colored crystals Avhich have
been described as that mineral may be rutile, the angles of rutile
and zircon being so similar that very accurate measurements are
necessary to distinguish between them.
AUGITE.
Augite is common in all of the Snake River sands examined and
also occurs in lesser amount in several samples from Clearwater and
Nez Perce Counties. It was not found in anv of the sands from the
