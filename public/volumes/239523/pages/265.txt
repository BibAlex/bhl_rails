seal the Eskimos of Norton Sound employ a very light harpoon, which
is a model of delicacy and effectiveness. It is lanced from a spear
thrower. In the same and in adjoining regions the large whale toggle
is found of the same pattern, but clumsy looking, and it is used in the
hand as well as lanced from a spear thrower. In the neighborhood
of Point Barrow a seal is shot with a rifle from the edge of the ice and
then retrieved by hurling a toggle harpoon at it in order to get a hold.
