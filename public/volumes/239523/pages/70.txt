BLACK SANDS FROM IDAHO SHANNON".

:>
Boise Basin. This mineral coincides roughly in distribution with
the rose-pink or purple variety of garnet referred to pyrope. In
several Snake River sands augite is the most abundant ingredient.
Those from Wapi and Minidoka especially contain-
ing 6 per cent or more of the mineral. The augite-
bearing sands frequently contain more or less olivine
in clear yellow crystals.
The augite occurs in irregular grains and imperfect
crystals which vary from emerald green through
various shades of pistachio and olive green in color.
They are very similar in color to some of the titanite
occurring in the sand from Bear Creek, Camas
County, but differ in form and luster. The crystals
are commonly prismatic in form and are etched and
corroded so that, although bright and glassy, very
few of them have faces which yield measurable sig-
nals. There is no cleavage visible and the glassy
green grains and crystals were at first thought to be
olivine. Careful search, however, revealed crystals
which could be measured and these gave the angles
of augite. The few measurable crystals found gave
fairly good signals in the prism zone but the terminal
faces are invariably etched and dull. One crystal gave a
" schimmer " reading on a terminal face which indicated approxi-
mately the negative pyramid s(Ill). The angles measured on this
crystal which identify it as pyroxene are given in the following table :

Several of the coarser unscreened sands from Minidoka, which
were rich in augite, contained small pebbles, the great majority of
which were seen under the binocular to consist of a cellular gray
rock containing glassy-green grains in a light gray ground. The
