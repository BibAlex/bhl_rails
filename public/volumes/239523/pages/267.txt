SERIES 4. â€” SINKERS.
Plate 27.
A sinker is a heavy object attached to a fishing line or net in order
to bring the hook into the area of the animal or to hold the line
or the net upright in the water. The earliest type of the sinker is
a common stone. Such forms would naturally be chosen as would
not slip from the line in the water, so notched stones were used.
Most savage tribes have discovered that by a peculiar method of
lashing they can fix any heavy object in a sling to serve for a sinker.
Among civilized peoples metal sinkers of various forms, which in-
clude also the characteristics of a lure to entice the animal toward
the net or bait, have been substituted for the simpler boulder. In a
large collection of sinkers will be found special forms for special
fishes, or environments, or appliances. For some uses the sinker
must rest on the bottom, as an anchor ; for others it drags, as in the
drail ; for others it is suspended in the water simply as a weight. As
with other fishing devices, so with this, there has been a refinement
coincident with culture progress. The first fishermen used no lines
or sinkers, the latest exhibits a new style of sinker for each kind
of fish.
No. 1. Pieces of turtle shell tied to a cord, forming a crude sinker. Bengal,
India 103,312
No. 2. Stone sinkers, rough or slightly modified by pecking, lashed in slings
of rawhide. Alaskan Eskimos 63,737,63,744
No. 3. Stone sinkers notched or grooved for purposes of attachment- 42,920, 17,837
No. 4. Polished stone sinkers or plummets grooved or notched for suspension.
These objects could easily have been fastened in a sling of cord or
bark. From mounds of the Ohio Valley 7,790, 42,491
No. 5. Sinkers, ivory or stone, perforated for attachment to a line or net. In
one example there is a suggestion of a lure in the form of a small
fish 63,377, 44,935, 56,577
No. 6. Eskimo sinkers of bone or ivory, carved in the form of fishes to act as
lures. The Eskimos are clever in making sinkere of this kind to imitate
various small animals on which the larger ones prey 38, 277, 33,194
No. 7. Eskimo sinkers of bone and colored stones, perforated for suspension.
Bottom, of bright colors to attract the fish, ingeniously riveted or
