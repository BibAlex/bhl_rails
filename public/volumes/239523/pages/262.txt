Cut-and-thrust weapons, with hilts, form the class, including
sabers, swords, rapiers, claymores, and their congeners. When
fastened to the end of a shaft or handle, they are halberts or Japanese
long swords ; when throw^n from the hand, they branch out into the
large class of African trumbases and throwing irons. The cut-and-
thrust series here shown begins with a natural object, pointed and
capable of slashing, and proceeds along the road of progress in ways
suggested in this exhibit. The saber has but one edge, the back being
thick and strong. The sword is the perfection of this type of
weapons, having two edges and a point. The saber cuts flesh and
blood vessels, and in its modern form with its dull edge also makes
ugly bruises, and so comes into the category of bruising weapons.
The sword is for piercing, cutting, and even for breaking bones, and
in its largest form is used with both hands. Burton regards it as the
most exalted weapon in single combats.
