2 PBOCKEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL, MUSEUM. vol.60.
This species is nearest to Guenther's P. tenuis from the Yangtze
Kiang, China, but differs in having the eye smaller, the barbels
slightly longer, and the caudal deeply cleft. It is very much more
elongate than Dybowski's P. usswriensis from the Ussuri, Amur,
and Sungari Rivers, which species it otherwise closely resembles,
except in its emarginate caudal.
The writer is indebted to the authorities of the United States
National Museum for permission to examine and de^^cribe this new
fish.
