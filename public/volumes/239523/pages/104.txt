Rejected genera. — In 1837 Kr0yer published ^ the description of a
new species of parasitic copepod, which he named Aefhon quadratus.
It was founded on a single specimen taken from the gills of a West
Indian Sen-anus. For discussion of this genus see p. 30.
In I860® Lubbock described and figured a new species which he
called Baculus elongatus. He said that it resembled the Caligidae
more than the Dichelesthiidae, to which its long antennae would ally
it. It has since been proved to be a stage in the development of Pen-
nella, and hence becomes a Lernaean.
The genus CJaveJla is rightly a Lernaeopod, as was explained '
but it has been used by many authors to designate species belonging
to the present family. To obviate the difficulty of having the same
genus in two different families Poche suggested the name IlaUchekla.
for such species as belong to the Dichelesthiidae, and for these species
the name Clavella becomes a synonym.
A genus called Cycnus was established by Milne Edwards^ to in-
clude a single species, but the name had already been used by Hube-
ner for a genus of Lepidoptera in 1816 and hence cannot be retained
for the copepod genus. In 1854 P. J. van Beneden described a genus
and species which he claimed as new and to which he gave the name
Congencola pallida.^ This has proved to be the same generically as
Milne Edwards's specimens, but differs from them specifically. Ac-
