of one plate. Each plate has three reddish slits, each on a well-
defined ridge. Button large, round, and reddish. Just below the
spiracles is a prominent elevation with an indentation in the center.
Spiracles located slightly above the longitudinal axis. Anal open-

separated, the space nearly equal to the height of one plate. Each
plate has three dark-yellow slits, each on top of a well-defined ridge.
Button large, round. Spiracles located on the upper side of the
longitudinal axis. Below and between the spiracles is a large, dark,
rugose elevation with a central depression. Anal opening small, far

Length, 5 to 8 mm. ; diameter, 2 to 4 mm.
74. HYPOCHAETA LONGICOKNIS Schiner.
Very small ; dull yellowish red. Spiracles black, faintly shining,

nal axis. Anal opening small, quite far below the stigmal plates.
