TRIGONA PALLIDA Latreille.
La Chorrera, Panama, April 12, 1912 (Busck). I found what is
presumably Latreille's type in the Museum at Oxford. It is much
broken, with no head. Thorax, abdomen, and hind legs light rufo-
testaceous. No doubt the species which I have known as pallida.
The specimen is labeled in Latreille's writing.

5 In the Oxford Museum I found T. ruflcrus (Apis ruflcnis Latreille), labeled in La-
treille's writing. I noted : Wings fuliginous, paler apically ; hair on head and thorax
above black ; hind tibiae and tarsi red ; sides of face gray-pruinose ; cheeks pale gray-
pollinose ; mesothorax shining ; robust species. This is the species generally known
under this name.
