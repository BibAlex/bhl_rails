6 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. vol.60.
The clypeus (except a black band on each side, not reaching lat-
eral corners), labrum and greater part of mandibles are cream color;
there is a narrow transverse supracylpeal band; lateral face marks
consisting of bands along the orbits, ending very acutely about level
of antennae ; scape cream color in front.
CENTRIS POECILA SEGREGATA Crawford.
Female. — Cayuga, Guatemala, June, 1915 (Wm. Schaus). The
wings are dilute fuliginous.
CENTRIS TRIGONOIDES Lepeletler.
San Salvador (S. Calderon). Five males. This agrees with Le-
peletier's description, noteworthy points being the dark legs (with
tarsi chestnut red), the greatly swollen hind femora, and the white
face markings. In the long spines on the hind trochanters and the
color of the antennae it agrees with 0. dentipes Smith. The hind
tibiae have black hair on outer side, and their femora a good deal of
black hair beneath. The eyes are rather pale purplish red ; in male
tarsata Smith, from Guatemala, they are green. The eyes are also
green (with dark margins) in 0. totonaca Cresson.
MESONYCHIUM DECORATUM Smith.
Cayuga, Guatemala, May (Schaus and Barnes) ; Posoya, Ecuador
(F. Campos R.).
EUGLOSSA (GLOSSURA) IGNITA Smith.
Males from Cayuga, Guatemala, September, 1915 (Wm. Schaus),
and Colombia (Baker collection). The latter is unusual in having
the scape dark, with a small yellow spot, and the mesothorax more
or less coppery.
EUGLOCGA (GLOSSURA) PILIVENTRIS IMPERIALIS, new sabipecies.
Fe7n.ale. — Rich green, but when seen from a direction opposite
the light appearing briUiant purple ; on the abdomen the broad hind
margin of the first segment is especially purple.
Rio Trinidad, Panama, March 16-23, 1912 (August Busck). Four
females, quite uniform in their beautiful coloration.
Type.—Csit. No. 24882, U.S.N.M.
EUGLOSSA VARIABILIS Friese.
Male. — Alhajuelo, Canal Zone, Panama, May 28, 1912 (A. Busck).
This species is a little larger than E. co7'data, and more shining, but
it is possible that Ducke is correct in regarding it as a form of
cordata.
EUGLOSSA VARIABIUS MIXTA Friese.
Fernale. — Rio Trinidad, Panama, March 19, 1912 (A. Busck) .
