ART. 18. BEES IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM- — COCKERELL. 3
black and red ; first tAvo abdominal segments with very pale tawny
yellow hair, overlapping the third; third with black hair; fourth to
sixth with bright red ; venter with much rusty-black hair.
Tagdumbash, Pamir, 13,000 feet, June 11, 1894 (W. L. Abbott).
Type.— Cat No. 24879, U.S.N.M.
This could be confused with B. hizonatus Smith, but the malar
space of the female is considerably shorter than in Smith's insect.
The paler wings and longer third antennal joint readily separate it
from B. tunicatiis Smith. From B. niveatus Kreichbaumer it is
known by the much shorter malar space. B. alticola Kriechbaumer
looks like abhotti, but has a considerably longer malar space.
BOMBUS MASTRUCATUS STRAMINEUS Frie^se. 1909.
Female. — Pognor La, Eupshu, Ladak, 16,000 feet, July 22, 1897
(W. L. Abbott). There is apparently more white hair on the thorax
posteriorly than in Friese's type. The mandibles are dentate.
BOMBUS TSCHITSCHEEINII Radoszkowsky.
This is a close relative or subspecies of B. melanurus Lepeletier,
with a broad black band between the wings. Dr. W. L. Abbott
obtained it in two localities. (1) Tagdumbash, Pamir, 13,000 feet,
June 14, 1894. Two females, of the full size of melanu7nis, but with
the light pubescence dull creamy-white instead of yellow. (2) Ooti,
Rupshu, Ladak, 15,500 feet, August 4, 1897. One female, hardly
20 mm. long, anterior wing 15.5 mm.; pale pubescence distinctly
ocherous. Two distinct races appear to be indicated, but more mate-
rial is desirable. Other species of Bombus reach very high altitudes
in the Himalayan region: thus B. 'nifofasciatus Smith, 12,500 feet;
B. -flavescens Smith, over 10,000 feet; B. miniatus Bingham, over
10,000 feet; B. fiavothoracicus Bingham. 12,500 feet; B. waltoni
Cockerell, 15,000-16,000 feet.
BOMBUS ROBUSTUS HORTULANS Friese.
Female. — Banos, Ecuador (F. Campos). The type locality for
hortulans.
BOMBUS ATRIPES Sinitli.
" S. W. pt. Hanan Prov., China " (L. R. Thompson) . Four fe-
males. The province is marked " Honan " on my map. A magnifi-
cent species, colored in the manner of Bombus morawitzi Radosz-
kowski, but the wings are dark fuliginous (pale in morawitzi) and
the malar space is much shorter. Smith described this and six other
Bombus from Chusan, but they probably came from more than one
locality, as he says : " Mr. Fortune informed me that all the BomJbi
were found on the top of hills in Cliusan and adjoining mainland."
