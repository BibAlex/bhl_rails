30 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. vol.60
si|[!fned a new serial number, and the original number accompanying
the sand is given. It is to be remembered that none of these are
natural sands, all having been greatly concentrated by gravity proc-
esses or separated magnetically before coming to the museum. In
many instances the samples are merely fractional products of several
successive concentrating and purifying processes. The arrangement
is by localities, the counties being listed alphabetically.
ADA COUNTY.
1. Snake River, near Boise. Original number P 114. Abundant quartz ; rare
obsidian, biotite, pyrope, augite, olivine, chalcedony, and hornblende.
Probably tailings from a concentrating table. Average grain diameter
0.5 mm.
2. Same locality. Original number P 114. Abundant quartz; common augite
and olivine ; rare biotite and obsidian. Evidently also tailings. Average
grain diameter 0.75 mm.
3. Same locality. Original number P 114. Abundant quartz and ilmenite;
rare pyrope, almandite, biotite, magnetite, olivine, augite, and obsidian.
Average grain diameter 0.5 mm.
BINGHAM COUNTY.
4. Snake River, at Rosa. "Auriferous sand." Cat. No. 53,625 U. S. N. M.
Abundant ilmenite, magnetite, pyrope; occasional augite, almandite, and
quartz ; rare zircon, gold, olivine, corundum. Average grain diameter
0.1 mm.
