Los Angeles County, California (Coquillett).
Type.—C2.i. No. 24897, U.S.N.M.
No date or plant-record, but it will probably be found on one
of the native compositae. In my key it runs to P. rectangulata
(^ockerell, differing at once by the shining thorax. It is close to
P, townsendi Cockerell, but smaller, with dark hind tibiae and other
differences. It is even closer to P. stottleri Cockerell. differing by
the entirely yellow neck, mainly yellow first abdominal segment, etc.
PEKDITA EXCLAMANS Cockerell.
Male. — San Diego County, California, April (Coquillett). It dif-
fers a little from New Mexico specimens, having the yellow on pleura
divided into two areas, and the fourth broad yellow band on abdo-
men interrupted. Possibly a distinct race is indicated.
PERDITA QUADRAKGULARIS Cockerell.
il/a?e.— Sanderson, Texas, May 9, 1912 (J. S. Mitchell). De-
scribed from New Mexico.
