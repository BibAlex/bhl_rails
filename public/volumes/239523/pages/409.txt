TOL. 60,
In tlie remarkable structure of the body and the legs, this genus
seems to possess characters which make it stand alone among the
Pseudococcine forms, and to fully justify its isolation as a distinct
genus.
Genus RIPERSIELLA Tinsley.
Genotype. — Ripersia rumicis Maskell.
Reference.— FQvn^ild., Cat. Cocc. World, 1903, p. 115.
This genus name was first published by Professor Cockerell, with
a sufficient indication of Tinsley's authorship, and included two
species, but the type was subsequently designated by Professor Cock-
erell as Maskell's species.
This species is represented in the Maskell collection by two slides,
one of " adult female, 1890," the other of " head and abdomen of

Adult female. — Practically naked, elongate oval when mounted;
antennae short and stout, placed very close together at the anterior
apex of the head, 6-segmented, the first and last longest, the last with
three stout spines ; legs small, stout, the tibia and tarsus about equal
in length, claw long, slender, only slightly curved near apex, with-
out denticle, claw digitules slender, apparently acute at apices, tarsal
digitules not observed, hind coxae without pores; mentum rather-
long triangular, indistinctly 2-segmented; spiracles small, not ab-
normal; with four pairs of dorsal ostioles; anal ring small, stout,
with six well-developed setae, without pores of the type found in the
ring of Pseudococcus, for example, but with some relatively large,
faint, uneven areolation; cerarii wholly wanting, tlie anal lobes not
developed, their location indicated by a group of three setae about
as long as those of the anal ring and placed on each side of this;
