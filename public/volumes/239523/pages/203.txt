OXOBOLUS, new genus.
Body large and robust, typically about eight times longer than
thick, narrowing a little forward and more strongly caudad. Clypeal
foveolae 2+2 or 2+3. CoUum acutely narrowed down each side, the
angle narrowly rounded. Anterior border raised as far dorsad as
level of lower edge of eye, opposite which the margin is sinuate.
Repugnatorial pore above middle of side and lying in front of the
principal sulcus or suture. No scobina present. Anal valves
strongly compressed. Anal scale transverse, the caudal edge straight
or nearly so.
In the male the seventh legs have the coxae much enlarged and
these flattened anterocaudally, carrying the legs consiiicuously far-
ther ventrad than in the more anterior pairs; the coxae and the three
following joints strongly compressed ventrally, their mesal edges
forming a more strongly chitinous ridge. The sixth legs in male
with similar chitinous ridges. Coxae of fourth and fifth legs strongly
compressed anterocaudally and produced ventrad ; the coxae of third
legs similarly extended ventrad but scarcely compressed.
