Adult female. — Scale as described by Maskell; body normally
nearly circular, with the pj^gidium slightly protruding, often appear-
ing oval, broader than long, due to the failure of the abdominal seg-
ments to expand during treatment; derm membranous, pj'^gidium
slightly chitinized ; antennae tiny tubercles pointed at tip, but with-
out setae ; spiracles small, stout, not accompanied by pores ; abdominal
segments rather indistinct, with little clusters of short tubular ducts
and tiny spines set in rings, beneath and at the margins of segments,
the ducts more numerous; pj^gidium without lobes or plates, the
margin somewhat undulating, with a small median ventral, mar-
ginal, chitinized thickening, this with a tiny seta on each side; dor-
sally with four small setae on each half of the pygidium, the first
two, one anterior to the other, not far beyond the chitinous thicken-
ing, the third and fourth widely separated, and much bej^ond the
first two, all submarginal; ventrall}?^ with the same number, but of
smaller setae, and with the pair at the outer end of the row, instead
of the inner ; with a few scattered, tiny, tubular ducts ventrally close
to the margin; paragenitals wanting; anal opening large, circular to
triangular, placed rather close to the posterior apex of the pygidium,
with distinct internal tube; apparently without dorsal setae or pores;
ventrally with a single seta on each side anterior to and diagonally
outside of the anal ring and three more in a group in the same direc-
tion near the anterior edge of the pygidium ; nearly all of the pos-
terior margin of the pygidium broadly but faintly thickened.
Intemiediate stage female. — Cast skin large, very convex, covering
the adult, approximately circular, margin of pygidium of this stage
with lobes and spines as shown in figure ; body itself nearly circular,
antennae short tubercles bearing two rounded knobs and three spines ;
margin of abdominal segments with a very few setae and tubular
ducts; pygidium with two pairs of well-developed lobes, the median
largest, protruding strongly, deeply notched at apices, with the outer
tooth shorter than inner, second lobes similar in shape, but much
smaller and less prominent, and with a blunt tooth bej^ond these,
probably corresponding to third lobe; marginal setae, dorsal, one
small, on outer edge of median lobe, one, large, outside of second lobe,
one, large, bej'^ond marginal tooth, and one more, large, near end of
pygidium, ventral, possibly one on median lobes, one beneath and
beyond each of the other three dorsal setae, all small; with an in-
cision with more or less distinctly thickened edges between the
median and second lobes and traces of another outside of the second
lobes ; no marginal paraphyses ; anal opening median, circular, fairly
close to apex of pygidium ; dorsal marginal tubular pores ore or two
opening into first incision, two or three in the rudimentary second
incision, and one beyond each of the three large dorsal marginal
setae; with a micropore tube between the median lobes and another
