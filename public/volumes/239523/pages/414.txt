MASKELL GENERA OF COCCIDAE — MORRISON.
59
The type species is represented in the Maskell collection by two
slides, one of "adult female, 1897," and one of "larvae, 1897,"
There appears to be no unmounted material of the species.^^ It has
fortunately been carefully redescribed by Green, and also discussed
by Ferris (see reference), so the writers have limited their work on
this species to the preparation of some illustrations and to giving,
li generic diagnosis.
GENERIC DIAGNOSIS OF KUWANINA.
Dactylopiine coccids (of the Fernald Catalogue) of uncertain
position; adult female oval, posterior end somewhat more heavily
chitinized and faintly nodulose, antennae tiny unsegmented tubercles
with apical setae, legs wanting, mentum apparently 1-segmented,
with small cribriform plate behind each posterior spiracle, derm

setae spine-like, small, scattered, more numerous posteriorly, derm
pores normally quinquelocular, but varying from 3-7, also varying
in size, set in bottoms of short tubes, anal ring small, heavy, entire,
without pores, with six short setae ; intermediate stage (from Green),
body short oval, antennae 2-segmented, legs wanting, mentum 1-seg-
mented, derm pores, etc., in general similar to those of adult; larva
(from Green), rather elongate oval, antennae short, stout, 3-seg-
mented, apical segment relatively very long, legs small, rather stout,
derm pores sparse and irregularly scattered, anal ring simple, incom-
plete, with six short setae, body with a pair of apical setae.
The writers are able to contribute nothing new in regard to this
Cfenus.
