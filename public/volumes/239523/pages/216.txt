ART. 8. MILLIPEDS OF CENTRAL, AMERICA CHAMBERMN. 47
metazonites yellow. Cauda yellow distally and along middle. Head
smooth. The sulcus across vertex sharply impressed. Anterior margin
of collum less convex at sides than in the middle. Anterior corner
rounded as usual, the posterior one nearly rectangular. Caudal
margin convex each side of the weakly and widely concave median
portion, the lateral portions* straight. Dorsal surface transversely
depressed behind the middle part of anterior border, this border thus
appearing elevated. Second, third, and fourth keels with posterior
angles subrectangular, the anterior ones rounded, smooth, with no
lateral tooth. None of the keels have the posterior angles more than
slightly produced until those of the seventeenth segment. Those of
eighteenth a little more acute. Those of nineteenth small, with keel
in front of pore swelling essentially obliterated (pi. 18, figs. 1 and 2).
Caudal margin of keels normally with two teeth, but sometimes with
only one. The lateral margin of the pore-bearing keels indented in
front of the pore swelling excepting on seventeenth, eighteenth, and
nineteenth segments. The surface of all the metazonites, including
the collum, is strongly roughened, with numerous small and irregu-
larly polygonal, weakly elevated areas. The areas are larger in two
caudal transverse rows on the last segments, a caudal series of areas
less distinctly indicated on others.
Last tergite and anal scale as shown in plate 17, figure 10. and plate
18, figure 3.
