long been correctly recognized and is one of the few well-lniown
genera of the Tenthredinidae which does not have a synonym. In
the larva and in the adult the genus Cladius is closely allied to
PHophorus.
The genus is distributed throughout the Palearctic Eegion. One
species has been described from the northern Oriental Region and
there is one species in the Nearctic Region. The fossil Cladius re-
cently described by Professor Cockerell should probably be referred
to Priophorus (p. 36). From our present knowledge it is fair to
assume that the genus Cladius originated in and is naturally confined
to the Palearctic Region. The North American species will prob-
ably be found to be an European form and the species from northern
India be found to occur onl}^ in that portion which is Palearctic.
Generic Characters^ Adults. — Clypeus arcuately emarginate; an-
tennal foveae deep, large, extending almost to the eyes; supraclypeal
area strongly convex, rectangular in outline; inner margin of the
eyes slightly converging below ; anterior basitarsus subequal or longer
than the three following joints (fig. 3) ; the male antenna with
joints 3, 4, 5, and 6 with apical dorsal projections and with the third
joint with a strong basal projection beneath; the :intcnna of the
female short, the third joint compressed, distinctly concave be-
neath; radiellan cell with a distinct appendage; cerci long and
slender; lower margin of lancet strongly curved and armed with
eight large teeth ; the posterior margin of the lancet plates strongly
armed.
Larvae. — See characters in above key. Larvae of only one species
available for stud3\ and all characters for genus are taken from this
species.

The location of the type of isomerus Norton is not definitely
known, but it is presumed that the female bearing number 185 in
the Harris collection is one of the tj'pes ; all others are probably lost.
In 1892 Riley synonymized the American bristly rose slug
{isomerus) with the common European species {pectinicornis) and
