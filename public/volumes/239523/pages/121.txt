mose, three-fourths as long as the whole body, rather stout and bluntly
rounded at the tips. Anal laminae slender and filiform, four times
as long as wide, each tipped with two tiny setae.
Color (preserved material), a uniform yellowish brown.
Total length, 1 mm. Cephalothorax 0.40 mm. long, 0.35 mm. wide.
Fourth legs, 0.72 mm. long.
{leidyi, to Dr. Joseph Leidy, one of the early American pioneers in
the study of the Crustacea.)
Remarks. — This new species is especially distinguished in the fe-
male by the long and slender fourth legs and by the shortness of the
dorsal plate, which shows the anal laminae and sometimes a portion
of the abdomen. In the male the best mark of recognition is the large
squarely truncated cephalothorax and the greatly reduced third legs.
The latter scarcely show in dorsal view and are so reduced as to be
easily overlooked. The species is fairly common, and many speci-
mens can often be obtained from a single fish.
LEENANTHROPUS POMATOMI Rathbnn.
Lemanthropus pomatomi R. Rathbun, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., vol. 10, 1887, p.
567, pis. 33-35. — M. J. Rathbun, Occasional Papers, Boston Soc. Nat.
Hist., vol. 7, 1905, p. 98.
Mr. Richard Rathbun established this species in 1887 for more than
one hundred specimens taken from the gills of biuefish Pomatojnus
saltatrix Linnaeus, caught in Vineyard Sound in 1883 and 1885. He
published a complete description of both sexes, accompanied by ex-
cellent figures, in the reference given above.
A few specimens were found at Beaufort, North Carolina, by the
present author in 1905, and from one of the females, whose eggs were
just ready to hatch, many nauplii were secured. These were examined
at the time and differed considerably from the one in figure 57.
The following is a list of the specimens at present in the collection
of the United States National Museum, including those obtained by
Rathbun :
