AKT. 8. MILLIPEDS OF CENTRAL AIMERICA CHAMBEELIN. 43
Localities. — Honduras: La Ceiba (type locality), a male and
female (W. M. Mami) : Guatemala: Livingston, one male (W.Wilson,
February, 1885).
Type.— Cdii. No. 845, U.S.N.M.
The male from Guatemala is larger than the type and has the mar-
gins of the posterior keels a little more oblique. The tip of the
outer processes of the gonopods appear to have been broken off
(Cat. No. 5021, M,C.Z,).
104. AMPLINUS NITEUS, new species.
Plate 16, fig. 9.
This is a large form readily distinguishable in having the polygo-
nal areas obsolete in the middle region of all the tergites, the median
region to the naked eye appearing smooth and shining. Under the
lens, however, the areas are seen to be vaguely outlined and become
normally developed in the lateral regions where they form the
usual three series, these extending out to the marginal thickening of
the keels. The nineteenth tergite is entirely smooth, no polygonal
areas at all being developed. The posterior angles of keels from
the fourth caudad are a little produced and even in the most poste-
rior the processes are of but moderate length. The anal valves pre-
sent a smooth, low, rounded swelling over middle region, this leav-
ing a longitudinal furrow at ectal border and one along mesal mar-
ginal thickening. Anal scale of usual form.
Gonopods as shown in plate 16, figure 9.
The type has apparently become bleached from long preserva-
tion, so that the original coloration can not be given.
Length, male, about 65 mm. ; width, 10 mm.
Locality. — Costa Kica: Basin of San Juan River (P, Biolley).
