3. Apex of the first and all of the following joints of the hind tarsi black ;
clypeus with a shallow V-shaped emargination ; sheath obtusely pointed
apically from a broad base irregularis (Dyar).
Only the apical joint of the hind tarsi black (apices of some of the joints
may be slightly brownish) ; clypeus with a shallow arcuate emargination;
sheath obliquely truncate from a broad oblique base gregarius (Dyar).
4. Third antennal joint not produced at base beneath and not wider at the base
than the pedicellum ; body black 5
Third antennal joint strongly produced at base beneath so it is wider than
the pedicellum 6
5. Anterior margin of clypeus with a deep V-shaped emargination ; apex of hind
tibia and most of hind tarsus black irregularis (Dyar).
Anterior margin of clypeus with a rather deep U-shaped emargination ; hind
tibia and first four tarsal joints pale simplicicornis (Norton).
6. Abdomen and mesepisterum reddish yellow viminalis (Fallen).
Body entirely black gregarius (Dyar).
KEY TO THE LARVAE.
1. Larvae with subdorsal, as well as supraalar and epipleural rows of black
body spots gregarius (Dyar).
Larvae without subdorsal, but with supraalar and epipleural rows of
black body spots 2
2. Spiracular area not darkened viminalis (Fallen).
Spiracular area partially blackened by spot confluent with epipleural black
spot irregularis (Dyar).

The location of the type of this species is unknown to us. Ameri-
can specimens have been carefully compared with European speci-
mens identified by Konow and there seems to be no reason to doubt
that this is the European species and that it was introduced before
1888, when first seen by Lintner. It is our most easily distinguished
species in the Cladiinae, as it is the only one in North America in
which the abdomen and mesepisternum is pale.
Female. — Length 8-9.5 mm. ; length of the antenna about 5 mm.
Clypeus shining with sparse, setigerous punctures, basally gently
convex, the apical margin with a deep arcuate emargination which
in outline is approximately the same as the outline for one of the
lobes; supraclypeal foveae deep, punctiform; lateral spyraclypeal
area broad, gradually sloping to the antennal foveae ; ocellar basin
defined with rounded walls, pentagonal in outline; middle fovea
