Family CHILENOPHILIDAE.
This group is used to include all genera formerly embraced in the
Geophilidae which have a coxopleural suture present and conspicu-
ously chitinized in the second maxillae. While in some genera of
the group the coxae of the second maxillae are but weakly united
with each other, this character shows considerable variation and
does not hold for most of the West Indian and Central American
forms placed here by the author. Because of indications of transi-
tion the group may ultimately prove untenable ; but pending further
extension of our knowledge it is retained for its obvious convenience.
SUTURODES, new genus.
