part composed of ilmenite.
COLUMBITE.
The samarskite concentrate from Idaho City described above con-
tains important amounts of a mineral in black crystals which proved,
upon measurement, to have the angles of columbite. x^side from the
difference in form, which is not always manifest, this mineral greatly
resembles ilmenite, which occurs commonly in the sands. The colum-
bite makes up about 10 per cent of the high samarskite sand and is
more abundant than samarskite in the garnet-bearing sand. The
crystals vary considerably in habit, ranging from tabular parallel to
the pinacoid h{010) to square prismatic. The common forms and
habits are illustrated in the drawings (figs. 16 to 19, inclusive). The
color is black, and the luster is more vitreous than metallic. The
prismatic planes are usually very brilliant, but the terminal faces
are frequently more or less dull and pitted. This is especially true
of the unit pyramid w(lll), the faces of which are most frequently
dull and often show rounded depressions. Under the microscope
the powdered mineral is translucent on thin edges, wath a brown
color. Frequently several similar crj^stals are grown together in
parallel position and many crystals are attached to small masses of
quartz and muscovite. In the coarse polycrase-bearing sand from
Centerville crj^stals up to 1 cm. in length occur sparingly which
have the form and appearance of columbite. These are invariably
dull with a grayish-black color and more metallic luster. They also
are more opaque than those described above. Judging from appear-
ance alone it seems probable that these crystals from Centerville are
more nearly pure iron columbate, while the brilliant black crystals
from Idaho City are probably higher in their content of tantalic acid,
and possibly they contain some manganese. The forms and angles
measured on crystals from Idaho City are given in the following
