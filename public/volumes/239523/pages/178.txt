THE CENTIPEDS OF CENTRAL AMERICA.
By Ralph V. Chamberlin,
Of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
This paper is primarily a report upon the centipeds from the
Central American region contained in the collections of the United
States National Museum. Surprisingly little has been done upon
the centiped and milliped fauna of this region; and that our
knowledge is still far from complete is amply attested by the per-
centage of new forms appearing in each additional collection studied,
this being especially noticeable in the case of the much more numer-
ous millipeds with their more restricted distributions. The mil-
lipeds will be treated in a separate report to follow. The centipeds
now known from the several countries of the region under consider-
ation are listed separately below.
