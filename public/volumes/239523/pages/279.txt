Somewhat higher in the scale are Nos. 4 and 5, which have slightly-
polished surfaces and rudely incised decorative designs. Following
these are examples illustrating advances in polishing, painting,,
stamping, casting, and throwing on the wheel. Glazing came in with
or shortly after the invention of the fixed wheel. In the latter part
of the series are shown illustrations of the higher forms of shaping,
surfacing, decorating, and firing, closing with that marvelous prod-
uct, porcelain.
