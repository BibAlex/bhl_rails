The difference is obvious. Of the American jadeites only 4, or
about 33 per cent, show compositions that are closely similar to those
of Burma. This is a subject which it is hoped to study soon in con-
nection with some large collections of jades from Middle America.
Consideration of the densities of jadeites leads also to the sugges-
tion of the possibility of the existence of a definite, equimolecular
mixture of jadeite and diopside, possibly much as dolomite is related
to calcite and magnesite. In a discussion of the densities of the jade-
ites of the Bishop collection, Hallock" shows that the average of 107
jadeites (including a few chloromelanites) is 3.3202. He then gives
the following table of grouped averages, from which the chloromel-
anites are omitted:
43 jadeites average 3. 3351
27 jadeites average 3. 3252
8 jadeites average 3. 3182
4 jadeites average 3. 3041
19 jadeites average 3. 2517
The average densities are clustered at either end. Using the figures
given, if weights are assigned to the two heaviest and most numerous
average densities according to the number of determinations, com-
bining them we arrive at the result:
70 jadeites of average density 3. 331
19 jadeites of average density 3. 252
Between these there occur only 12 jadeites, with a wide interval be-
tween them and those of lowest density. These figures, so far as
they go, would seem to mdicate that archaeological "jadeite " is mostly
the pure soda jadeite, and that a fairly definite diopside-jadeite also
occurs quite abundantly, but that there are comparatively few inter-
mediate members of the series.
Because of the intermediate position of the Tuxtla diopside-jadeite
it will be of interest to state succinctly the correlation of some of the
properties of it and of the end members of the series. The data for
soda jadeite were determined by Merwin on the two small crystals
isolated by Penfield from the material the analysis of which is given
