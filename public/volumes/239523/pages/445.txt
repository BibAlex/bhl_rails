98 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. vol. 00.
stout setae; spiracles small, anterior placed just behind the mouth
parts, accompanied by 2-3 small disk pores, posterior placed far
back, fully one-third the body length from the anterior, about the
same size but without pores; eye spots represented by faimt mar-
ginal protuberances a little behind the antennae; with a few tiny
tubular ducts around the margin of the cephalothorax ; first two
abdominal segments with a considerable cluster of small tubular
ducts and a few small slender gland spines with expanded bases ven-
trally at margin, remaining segments with similar but fewer ducts
at margin and dorsally, including one or two large ducts to a seg-
ment and no gland spines ; each segment ventrally with a slender sub-
marginal seta and one or two others, smaller, inside this on each side ;
pygidium only faintly chitinized, lobes small, triangular, pointed,
normally not or only very slightly protruding bej^ond the irregular
margin, median lobes slightly smaller than the second pair, widely
separated by a quadrate protruberance bearing two slender ventral
spines at its base and having a large short-tubular duct between it
and each lobe, second lobe placed well beyond the first, also triangular
pointed, third still farther beyond the second, and considerably
smaller; margin with a large triangular indentation beyond the
third lobe; without gland spines; dorsal marginal setae, one out-
side of each lobe, ventral the same, and with one beyond the marginal
notch, all slender, not very long; ventrally with submarginal setae,
considerably larger than marginal and anterior to these, as follows :
1, 2, 2, 2; without incisions with thickened edges, but with dorsal
marginal incisions into which short tubular ducts open, these ducts
one inside the firet lobes, two between the first and second lobes, one
just inside and above the second lobe, two between the second and
third lobes, one behind third lobe, and three beyond marginal
notch; without chitinous paraphyses; anal opening fairly large,
oval, much nearer base than apex of pygidium ; paragenitals want-
ing; dorsal pores numerous, not arranged in definite rows of closely
set pores, although in indefinite rovv^s, about three in first, four in
second, 7-8 in third, 5-7 in fourth, and about five in fifth, with
some corresponding inner groups of about three each; without
thickenings except those running in from the "lobes"; with a few
ventral micropores and several small setae in the genital opening
region.
Intcriiiediate stage female — (From exuviae only). Apparently
difi^ering from the adult only in the reduction in size and numbers
of the structures described for the latter stage.
Larva — (Embryonic). Oval, antemiae 5-segmented, the fourth seg-
ment so constricted as to give somewhat the appearance of another
segment; legs slender, normal, apex of abdomen not at all chitinized,
with no traces of lobes or gland spines; with two long apical setae.
