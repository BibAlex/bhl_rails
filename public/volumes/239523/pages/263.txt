HISTORY OF PIERCING PROJECTILE WEAPONS.
Piercing weapons are either held in the hand or attached to a shaft.
They are thrown from the hand, slung from the throwing stick, or
moved by elasticity. Those moved by elasticity may be discharged
from a blowtube, from a bow, from an arbalest, or from a firearm.
The progress of invention in the piercing projectile is marked in the
perfecting, firstly, of the projectile itself; secondly, of the elastic
device or projector; and, thirdly, of the mechanism of release. Illus-
trations of the projectile are not shown. The series presented here
serves to illustrate the progress of the bow and the arbalest, bringing
the development to the gun and the pistol.
