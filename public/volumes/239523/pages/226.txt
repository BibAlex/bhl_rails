Family CRYPTODESMIDAE.
Genus CYNEDESMUS Cook.
This genus was proposed primarily for a species from Grand
Canary; but as that species was not described the Cuban Crypto-
deswus omartientatus Karsch, which was included, must stand as the
genotype. While in the absence of a knowledge of the gonopods of
C. omamentatus the matter can not be wholly certain, there is little
doubt that this species is congeneric with certain other West Indian
species, as for example the Haitian caraihianus Chamberlin and
(/ranulofrons Chamberlin, which were described under Treseolohus.
These species do not seem to be generically distinct from the Mexican
and Central American species described by Pocock under Lopho-
desmus in the Biologia. Cynedesmus is, in consequence, here
adopted.
