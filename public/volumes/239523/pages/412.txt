ART. 12. MASKELL GENERA OF COCCIDAE MORRISON. 57
merit's strongly marked by lateral and dorsal constrictions; antennae
reduced to minute unsegmented tubercles, placed at the anterior end
of the body and each bearing about six small spines; legs entirely
wanting; spiracles large, each set in a deep pocket in the chitinized
derm, with a patch of small tubular glands behind each posterior
spiracle; derm with numerous clear pores scattered over both sur-
faces, at the bottom of which are small triangular pores or tubular
ducts; in addition with circular multilocular disk pores at the pos-
terior end of the body; body setae all rather stout and short, a few
at the posterior margin of the apical segment longer and more slender,
the setae very rare except on the apical abdominal segments, where
they are rather numerous ventrally, especially along the middle line;
apical abdominal segment sometimes faintly bilobed; anal ring a
heavy band placed a little dorsally and at the inner end of a short
tubular invagination, ring bearing numerous small pores and six
setae, slender and projecting a little beyond the circular opening of
the tube.
Intermediate stage female (possibly adult before maturity). — Oval
with the posterior apex of the body, only, chitinized and brown, the
apical segment very broadly rounded, the remainder of the derm clear
and membranous; antennae, mentum, legs and anal region as m
adult, derm pores and setae along the margin of the body apparently
much more numerous than in adult in proportion to size.
Larva. — Body elongate, parallel-sided, the ends rounded ; antennae
C-segmented, the apical segment as long as the three preceding
together ; legs normal, rather slender, claw simple, digitules all long,
slender, slightly knobbed; mentum short and stout, obscurely 2-
segmented; derm with marginal rows of large triangular pores,
dorsally with a submedian row of smaller but similar pores and
an additional submarginal row anteriorly, ventrally also with a
row of much smaller pores, this row submarginal posteriorly and
submedian anteriorly, finally with a group of such pores at each
spiracular opening; posterior dorsal ostioles conspicuous, anterior
not noted ; the abdominal segments with a pair of rather stout spine-
like setae on each margin, one larger, one smaller, those on the apical
segment large, the remainder gradually decreasing in size anteriorly,
apical segment also with a pair of much longer, slender anal lobe
setae ; anal lobes developed only as very slight protuberances, with a
few pores and six short slender setae.
Maskell placed one other species, first described by him as a Sphae-
rococcus, and now known as Antonina graviinis (Maskell), in this
genus in 1898. This species closely resembles Sphaerococcus casuari-
nae Maskell in size and shape, and when the intermediate stages are
known may require a modification of the statement under Sphaero-
