This form is separated chiefly on the characters of the prosternum.
This differs from L. vulcani (Pocock) in lacking the stout outer
third tooth on each side of the prosternum. The prosternal margin
extends out horizontally considerably beyond the ectal tooth, much
as in L. minor Chamberlin ; the edge a little ectad of the outer tooth
is produced cephahid, the special ectal seta being borne upon the
prominence, as shown in figure 6. Articles of antennae, 33 to 39.
Ventral spines of penult legs, 0, 1, 3, 3, 1-0, 1, 3, 3, 2, with three
