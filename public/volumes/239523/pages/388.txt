and two galls under No. 226. The National collection of Coccidae
fortunately contains a few lots of this species, received from
various entomologists in Australia, and from these it has been pos-
sible to prepare additional mounts for study. The following descrip-
tions have been obtained from all the material available ; as Maskell's
description and figures of the gall seem quite satisfactory nothing is
added on this.
Adult female. — Elongate, parallel-sided; derm clearing on boiling
in potassium hydroxide, except the posterior lobe of the body, this
remaining somewhat chitinized ; antennae acute conical, the segmen-

tation incomplete, but perhaps 5-segmented; with two small, incon-
sj^icuous eye-spots near the antennae; anterior legs stout, fingerlike,
the tibio-tarsal articulation very incompletely indicated, the tro-
chanter apparently fused with the femur; intermediate legs repre-
sented by large evaginated pouches or sacs at the apex of which are
small, somewhat chitinized plates, each bearing the rudiments of a
claw, digitules and some setae ; posterior legs represented by smaller
lobes with the apices even less developed than in the intermediate
pair; the prominence of these sacs apparently varying inversely in
proportion to the extent of the distension of the body through ovarian
development; mentum apparently 1-segmented, the additional seg-
