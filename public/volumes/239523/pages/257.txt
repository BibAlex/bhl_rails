was devised, which conferred on the user vastly augmented power.
The implement was notched, grooved, or perforated to aid in fixing
the handle. Later on stone was supplemented by metal. Copper,
bronze, iron, and steel followed in order.
The triumphs of human effort and ingenuity may be realized by
comparing the stone hammer, still in use by half the race, with the
machine hammer of to-day, illustrated in No. 14.
In very early times with our own race .the hammer served as a
weapon, and it still serves as such with most primitive people. In
civilization this office is taken by more highly perfected devices, but
vast expanse of function has taken place in our modern industries.

SEBIES 2. â€” SAW.
Plate 17.
The saw is a tool for severing materials by abrasion and cutting.
The most primitive form of the saw is a siliceous stone having a
ragged edge. Such an implement would be of great service to the
savage in his working in wood, bone, horn, antler, ivory, and stone.
The series passes through forms in stone, in sand cutting, and in
metal, and finds its climax in the saw with composite edge in the
sawmill, and in the refinement and specialization of the working
part of the implement for various kinds of cutting. The prehistoric
peoples of Europe as well as of America used stone saws for wood
and bone. They were chipped flint, resembling knife blades, three
or more inches long and serrated on one edge. As the objects cut did
