cordingly Beneden's genus name must be substituted for that of
Milne Edwards, and the type of the genus becomes Congericola pal-
lida Beneden.
Nordmann in 1832 described" a genus and species called EpachtJisii
parad.oxus. The next year Burmeister " showed that Normann's
genus was a synonym of Lemanthropus.
In January, 1898, Bassett-Smith proposed a new genus to be
known as Helleria^ with the type species armata}^ This name had
already been used three times for crustacean genera which were not
copepods. This fact being called to his attention, Bassett-Smith in
November of the same year changed the name to Gyhicola}^
Gerstaecker published ^* a new genus of Siphonostoma called
Lonchidium^ with the single type species aculeatum. This proved
to be generically the same as Beneden's Kr^yeria, which had ap-
peared in the preceding year. This fact was recognized by Nord-
mann in 1864,^^ but it was misinterpreted by Bassett-Smith,^^ who
reversed the precedence and made Kr0yeria a synonym of
LoncMdvu/m.
Risso in 1816 published a Histoire Naturelle des Crustaces des
Environs de Nice, in which he described (p. 162) a new species of the
genus CaZigus, G . imhricatus. Leach later in the same year estab-
lished in the Supplement to the Encyclopedia Brittanica (vol. 1,
p. 406) a new genus of Entomostraca, which he called Anthosoma
smAthii. Both Risso's specimens, which were examined by Leach,
and those of Leach himself were subsequently shown to be the same
as had been described by Abildgaard in 1794 as " Caligus crassusy ^^
Leach's generic distinction, however, was valid, and hence the species
became Anthosoma crassum (Abildgaard) ; but in spite of this Risso
again described his species as new in Histoire Naturelle des prin-
cipals de I'Europe meriodionale (vol. 5, 1826, p. 136), this time under
the name Otrophesia hnhricata^ which, of course, becomes a synonym
of Anthosoma crassum.
P. J. van Beneden established a new species and genus of parasitic
copepod,^^ which he named Pagodina rohusta. This is shown on
page 60 to be identical with the genus Nemesis and becomes a
synonym of the latter.
For Nordmann 's proposed new genus, Stalagmus^ see page 36.
