12 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL, MUSEUM. vol.60.
That such a bird cloak as is here suggested was worn by the Amer-
indians is indicated by the same copper figure cited above from Hodge.
Besides the bird mask the man wears an obvious cloak/^ that is evi-
dently part of his ceremonial costume. This cloak represents very
clearly the bird's wings, the coverts and what appear to be the thumb
wings being shown, while the long primaries make up the greater part
of the cloak, and their tips form a fringe-like bottom, much as is
indicated in the Tuxtla figure.
An additional resemblance between the two figures is that the legs
of the copper figure are hanging and do not reach the ground, as is
also the case with our figure; while the man appears to rest or be
seated on a sort of pedestal, much as Apollo is represented on the
omphalos in Greek art. The question arises whether the lower part of
the Tuxtla statuette, on which the legs and feet are depicted crudely,
may not represent a similar pedestal or seat of the "omphalos"
form. Attention may also be called to the very similar represen-
tation of the ear and ear plug in the two cases.
" This is seen better in the line-drawn restoration on p. 346, but it is easily visible in the photo,
graphic reproduction on p. 848.
