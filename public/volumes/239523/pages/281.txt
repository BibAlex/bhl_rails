SERIES 2. ABORIGINAL AMERICAN SCULPTURE.
Plates 52-54.
The American tribes seem to have displayed a strong predeliction
for sculpture. They shaped their stone implements with great skill
and delighted in the representing of animal forms. Religious motives
inspired most of the more elaborate work, although esthetic apprecia-
tion was not wanting.
The series of objects here presented covers nearly the full range
of native achievement, although the best examples shown fall far
short of the highest types of Aztec and Maya work. The simplest
forms are shown in plate 52, and a series of progressive steps lead up
to the higher forms in plates 53, 54. It is believed by some that
germs of culture have occasionally reached America from other lands
and that sculpture on this continent is not wholly of native growth.
Many tribes are still practicing the lowest forms of the art, while
others, such as the Northwest coast peoples, are well advanced.
