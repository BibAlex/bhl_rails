persistently resists separation by decanting. It can generally be
removed by boiling in some thin colloidal solution, like soap solution,
the flocculent matter being thereby held in suspension while the dia-
toms are settling. By one or two such boilings and careful de-
cantations this silicious floe will be largely or wholly removed. Very
careful washing is required after this soap treatment before the
diatoms are put away in 35 per cent alcohol.
However the author may have tried to make plain the different
steps in preparing diatoms for study, he recognizes that some con-
fusion may exist in the minds of students in regard to some parts
of this technic. A letter of inquiry, directed to him at the United
States National Museum, Washington, District of Columbia, will
receive an answer, in which the points in question will be more care-
fully explained.
