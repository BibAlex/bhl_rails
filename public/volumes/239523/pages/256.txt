took place no doubt when the shaping of wood became an important
feature in the savage economy. In the most primitive forms the
stone blade is flaked into shape (No. 1), and in the more highly de-
veloped (Nos. 4 and 5) it is pecked and ground, the distinguishing
characteristic of the implement being the single bevel of the edge.
The hafting is accomplished in a variety of ways. One of the highest
forms of the simple tool is the steel hand adz of the present period
(No. 12). This implement may be regarded as the prototype of the
modern planing machine, which is a compound adz, several blades
being mounted on a revolving shaft. A model of this device appears
in No. 13, which is the working part of the superb machines of to-day.

SERIES 1. HAMMER.
Plate 16.
The hammer has been from the beginning an important factor in
human progress. The earliest known forms are round stones, which
were employed in various useful arts, for shaping implements, in war,
md in the chase. Identical forms are used by such living tribes as
still occupy the first few rounds of the ladder of culture.
As the pioneers of civilization advanced step by step to higher levels
the hammer was modified and improved. The simple rounded stone
