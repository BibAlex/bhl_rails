SpecifiG characters of nauplius. — General form ovate, nearly twice
as long as wide, widest through the bases of the third appendages,
narro^ved posteriori}^, with evenly curved lateral margins. Ap-
pendages long and slender. Eye double and situated so far forward
as to touch the anterior margin. Balancers close to the posterior end
of the body, long and slender, with a slight S curve, extending
outward nearly at right angles to the body axis. On each lateral
margin in front of the base of the balancer is a small but distinct
notch.
General color brown, the food mass in the posterior portion of the
body and the central digestive tract a very dark brown, the margins of
the body and the muscles connected with the appendages much lighter
in color, the appendages themselves and the balancers a light gray.
Total length, 0.35 mm. Greatest width, 0.19 mm.
Remarks. — This nauplius may be distinguished from that of
hrevoortiae by the length and narrowness of the body, by the greater
relative length of the appendages, and by the presence of eyes, or
rather of a compound eye, on the anterior margin. The color is
also quite different in the two nauplii, especially by transmitted
light.

Host and record of specimens. — ^Mr. Richard Rathbun obtained
about 50 specimens, all females, from the gills of menhaden, Bre-
voortia tyrannus^ captured in Vineyard Sound in 1883 and 1885.
The following specimens have been added to the Museum collection
since his paper was published, all from the same host: Six females
captured at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, September 3, 1904, with
Cat. No. 54052, U.S.N.M. ; 35 females, most of them very small, and
a single male from the gills of several young fish only 4 inches long
at Beaufort, North Carolina, August 10, 1905, with Cat. No. 54054,
U.S.N.M.; 15 females, some of which are still fastened to the gill
filaments, taken at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, August 6, 1901, with
Cat. No. 54053, U.S.N.M. ; 10 females taken July 20, 1905, at Woods
Hole, Massachusetts, with Cat. No. 54056, U.S.N.M. ; 2 females taken
July 20, 1905, at Beaufort, North Carolina, with Cat. No. 54055,
U.S.N.M. These records, with those of Rathbun, show that the
species is quite common along our Atlantic coast, but thus far only a
single male has been obtained, and yet diligent search for males was
made at Woods Hole during the entire summor of 1903 and at
Beaufort during 1905. Finally a school of very young menhaden
