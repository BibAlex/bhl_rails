1. The length of the female figured by Scott was 21.70 mm.,
including the fourth legs, that by Claus was 12.50 mm. without the
fourth legs, while Nordmann's species was only 7 mm. without the
fourth legs.
2. The cephalothorax in kr0yeri is trapezoidal in outline, the
antennal area is separated from the rest of the head, with a large
lobe on either side at its base. The two diameters of the head are
in the proportion of 5 for length and 6 for breadth. In nordmanni
the cephalothorax is triangular, pointed anteriorly, with sinuate
sides, the antennal area is not separated, and the two diameters are
equal.
3. The anterior portion of the dorsal plate in kr^yeri is wider than
long, the two diameters in the proportion of 4 to 3 ; in nord'niam,ni it is
longer than wide, in the proportion of 6 to 5.
4. In kr0yeri the posterior margin of the dorsal plate is an evenly
rounded half circle, in nordmanni it is squarely truncated, leaving
sharp corners and a sinuate margin.
5. In kr0yeri the dorsal plate entirely covers the genital segment,
the abdomen, and the basal half of the fourth legs, its margin reach-
ing well beyond the tips of the anal laminae. In nordmanni the abdo-
men is entirely, and the genital segment is partially, visible in dorsal
view, and the fourth legs project nearly their whole length.
6. In kr^yeri the fourth legs are widest at the center and taper
toward both ends, the tips being acute. In nordinanni the fourth legs
are of uniform width throughout with squarely truncated tips.
Such an accumulation of differences shows that Nordmann was
dealing with a distinct species, and the name nordmanni is suggested
for it.

Host and record of specimens. — Seven males and 16 females were
taken by Dr. Edwin Linton from the gills of the silver gar, Tylosurus
mannus, at Beaufort, North Carolina, September 1, 1902. A single
female has been isolated and made the type of the new species, with
Cat. No. 54063, U.S.N.M. The remaining specimens of both sexes
become paratypes, with Cat. No. 54064, U.S.N.M.
Specific characters of female. — General shape short and thickset;
cephalothorax half as long as the body, narrowed anteriorly, but
widened across the posterior margin until it equals or slightly exceeds
the anterior margin. The anterior end is inclined downwards and
forwards and its lateral flaps are so long they protrude far in front
of the ventral surface. This gives it an appearance very similar to
the old-fashioned poke bonnet. Body with the shape of an hour-
