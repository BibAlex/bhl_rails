INTRODUCTION.
This is the sixteenth '^ paper in the series dealing with the parasitic
copepods in the collection of the United States National Museum,
and comprises the family Dichelesthiidae.
The genera belonging to this family are closely related to the
Caligidae and Lernaeiclae and are included with them in the group
known as the Caligoida. They are gill parasites and when fully
developed the females probably remain attached to the same spot
on the gills of their host. In this sense they may be properly called
fixed parasites, but they never burrow into the tissues of the host
after the manner of the Lernaeidae, and yet one of the genera,
C'aetrodes, furnishes a very respectable compromise in this direc-
tion. While it does not itself burrow into the gill filament of its
host, it does in some way so irritate the gill epithelium that the
latter grows up into a flap or fold, entirely surrounding the body of
the copepod and holding it securely in place.
Also other genera, such as Anthoso77ia, Eudactylina^ Nemesis.^ and
Dichelesthiuni, produce enough irritation with their prehensile claws
in the gill epithelium to cause it to grow up around the claws them-
selves, but so far as known it never surrounds any portion of the
copepod's body, not even the anterior margin of the head. In con-
sequence of thus remaining at least partially free there is no instance
of any material change in the parasite's bodily form or structure sub-
