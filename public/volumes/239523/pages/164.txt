A CONTRIBUTION TO THE ANATOMY OF DINOBOTH-
RIUM, A GENUS OF SELACHIAN TAPEWORMS; WITH
DESCRIPTIONS OF TWO NEW SPECIES.

In 1S89 P. J. van Beneden described an interesting cestode from
the mackerel shark (Lamna cornuVica) under the name Dinohoth-
num septaria}
The species has been recorded from the same host by Loennberg^
and b}^ Scott.^ Loennberg gives detailed description of the scolex
and of immature proglottides. Scott publishes a brief description
of the species and a protograph of a specimen collected by him.
Strobiles with adult, or ripe, proglottides were not seen by any
of the above-named authorities.
I am indebted to Dr. Maurice C. Hall, of the Zoological Division
of the United States Department of Agriculture, for photographic
copies of Loennberg's papers.
Tliis paper is a contribution from the laboratory of the United
States Bureau of Fisheries, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and the
zoological laboratory of the L^niversity of Missouri.
On September 1, 1903, 1 collected some cestodes from a small man-
eater shark, of which no description was published, but a record was
made,^ as follows:
Dinobothrium septaria Beneden. Host: Carcharodon carcharias Linton, MS
A t3r[3ographical error appears in the spelling of the generic name,
which is printed ^'Dinobothrium."
During the summer of 1920 I obtained three specimens of a cestode
from the bone shark, which also belong to the genus Dinobothrium .
Although at first disposed to refer the cestodes of these two lots
to the species D. septaria, I found difficulties of two sorts present-
