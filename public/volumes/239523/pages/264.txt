Plate 25.
The toggle harpoon is a piercing retrieving weapon driven into the
animal by means of a shaft. The toggle is attached to the end of a
line, and when the shaft is withdrawn it turns crosswise in the body
of the game, enabling the hunter to retrieve. In the simplest forms
a pointed bone serves for a toggle, but in the whaling harpoons much
ingenuity has been exercised in perfecting the various parts, namely,
the blade, the hinge, the barb, the socket, the line, the loose shaft, and
the shaft. In some examples poison and explosives are used. There
is a form of toggle used in catching water birds, fish, and crocodiles
which is baited, and thus becomes a fishhook or gorge. The Aleuts
shoot the sea otter with a delicate arrow which has all the parts of the
toggle harpoon, and thus becomes a toggle arrow. For the smaller
