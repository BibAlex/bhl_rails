scribed. It is probably more closely allied to the species here de-
scribed as j)runi. The original description is as follows :
" Mesonotum and collar black ; body black, with legs beyond femora
white; third segment of antennae shorter than fourth; clypeus dis-
tinctly emarginate ; median fovea large, shallow, circular ; Avings in-
fuscated on basal half. Length 6 mm,"
In a letter dated January 13, 1919, Doctor MacGillivray says:
" The type of Craterocercus infuscatus was collected at Ithaca, New
York, and is without date. The specimen is a female."

In his latest paper ^'' MacGillivray leaves this species in the genus
PHophorus, According to our opinion, it does not belong to this sub-
family. The basal vein, which joins the subcosta remote from the
origin of the cubitus (see fig. 8), the larvae and their habits are im-
portant characters which show that the species is Nematine. This
species, according to our opinion, is generically different from Prio-
phornis, and the genus Caulocampus, of which it is the genotype,
should be placed in the Nematine, tribe Hemichorini.
