are pointed, chisel-edged, tubular, screw-shaped, or bladed, as in the
latest forms. The manual part of the drill is at first a mere adapta-
tion to the hand of a portion of the tool. This is followed by crude
handles, spindle shafts, strap drills, pump drills, and so on, up to the
machine drills of our factories.
The Eskimos have three styles of apparatus for drilling â€” ^the hand
drill, the strap drill, and the bow drill. The strap drill, as a rule,
requires the services of two men, while the bow drill may be operated
by one man, using also the mouthpiece for a pivot at the upper end of
the shaft. The driller kneels or sits upon the ground and holds the
object to be bored in his left hand. The working end of the shaft
pierces this object, while the upper end is pointed and operated in a
stone or other hard socket set into the wooden mouthpiece, which is
grasped firmly by the teeth. With his right hand he revolves the shaft
by means of a bow and cord.
