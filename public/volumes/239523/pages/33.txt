Cocoon. — The cocoon is a semitransparent, whitish to pale brown,
thin walled cell; 7 mm. long by 3 mm. wide, irregularly oval. It
seems to consist of several layers, one complete inner envelope and
two or three partial outer envelopes that serve as further protection
and at the same time attach more firmly the inner case to the leaf
upon which it is spun.
Pupa. — Pale yellow white, length 6 mm. (alcoholic specimen) ;
living specimen described as grayish green; the thorax and end of
body slightly yellowish; head whitish green; ocelli brown; eyes
black; antennae, wing sheaths and legs white, with a slight green
tinge. Darkened pupa, 6 mm. long; head and thorax black, except-
ing legs and wing pad, which are yellow ; abdomen dark brown.
LIFE AND SEASONAL HISTOBY.
The studies which furnished information on the stages likewise
afforded an opportunity for observations to be made on the length
of the various stages and periods. Observations of this character
could hardly be made under natural conditions because the variation
in emergence of overwintering adults, coupled with the difference
in length of life under varying conditions, makes it but a short while
before all forms of the insect, especially all stages of the larvae,
may be found in the rose garden at the same time.
The following table is summary of the notes made upon the length
of the various periods and stages of eleven larvae of the second
generation. These larvae were under close observation during their
entire life, and since comparisons indicate that the life-cycle of the
preceding and succeeding generations (excepting the resting stage
of the overwintering generation, which is longer) is approximately
the same, the table will serve to represent the average (in days).
