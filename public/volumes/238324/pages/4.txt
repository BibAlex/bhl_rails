INTRODUCTION
During the course of a three year sojourn at the Oceanographic
Institute of the University of Recife a restudy of the reef corals of
the Brazihan coast was undertaken. During this period of time
the writer also participated in one of two cruises of the French
research vessel CALYPSO in Brazilian waters. Collecting was done
mainly by SCUBA diving and thus there was an opportunity to
observe extensive populations of living corals and to note their
vertical zonation and geographic distribution. These ecological data
have been applied in reevaluating some of the species descriptions
of the past. The present paper is a preliminary note giving a re-
vised list of the corals observed, a description of one new species,
and distributional data on hydrozoan corals. A more detailed ac-
count will be published following its submission as part of a
doctoral thesis to the Faculty of Sciences of Marseille, France.
