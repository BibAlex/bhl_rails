THE BEST ANNUALS.
enough to afford the most enthusiastic amateirr
a wide range of selection. All named are good.
There are many not in the list that are worthy a
place in any garden, and the catalogues will tell
all about them. But those named here are kinds
best adapted to the amateur, because they are
not delicate, and do not need coaxing in order
to get them to bloom.
In selecting annuals, do not make the mistake
—to which, I think, I have alluded elsewhere—
of getting more than you can do justice to.
Have fewer sorts, and grow these to perfection,
rather than undertake to grow a great many
kinds, and find that you cannot give them the
care they ought to have. Quality rather than
quantity should be the motto of the amateur
flower grower, if he would attain to the highest
success and satisfaction.
