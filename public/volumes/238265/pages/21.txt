THE PRACTICAL GUIDE TO FLORICULTURE.
The old Rocket still hrilds its own, and it ie,
indeed, one of our best plants for massing.
The two varieties most grown are purple and
white. This is most effective when grown in
clumps.
Tl)e Oriental Poppy is extremely showy. The
flowers are of great size, borne on long stalks,
and of the most intense scarlet, with a black
blotch at the base of each petal. This flower
produces a most striking effect when planted in
masses, where its vivid color can have a dark
background to display itself against.
For eflging beds of hardy plants, the Daisy is
the best plant we have. It must be borne in
mind that the Daisy spoken of (Bellis of many
catalogues) is not the Daisy of the meadow. It
is a very low-growing plant, bearing flowers of
pink and white about the size of a silyer
quarter, very double, and altogether charm-
ing.
1 have named above only the best and most
popular plants of the herbaceous or perennial
class. There are many other kinds well deserv-
ing a place in any garden, but lack of space
makes it impossible to speak of them all. Look
over your catalogues, if you desire to acid to your
collection. You will find all that are worth grow-
ing described there.
The proper time to transplant border plants is
in spring. If this is done then, tbe plants be-
come well established during the season, and
go into winter quarters in a strong, hf^althy con-
dition. If it is not done until tall, they do not
have suflicient time to fully establish themselves
before cold weather conies, and thRv are gen-
erally injured by the long, severe winter.
