THE PRACTICAL GUIDE TO FLORICULTURE.
Crocus are Chiondoxa, blue, with white center,
and Scilla Sibrica, blue.
In November, when you think the ground is
about to be frozen, cover your bulbs with coarse
manure, leaves, or litter of some kind. Let tbis
c.vering remain on in spring until you see the
tips of some of the plants peering through.
Then remove it very carefully, that none of the
tender shoots may be injured. If cold nights
come on, as they aro likely to all through
March, and often well along in April, at the
north, throw a blanket over the beds, first plac-
ing stakes at the corners and in the center to
prevent the covering from falling or resting
on the plants with such weight as to break
them.
The bulbs will ripen in a few weeks after flow-
ering. They can be taken up then and reset, if
desirable, or they can be allowed to remain in
the be-d year after year.
If left in the bed, annuals can be grown among
them without injuring them in the least, if care
is taken to not disturb them with hoe or rake in
preparing the soil for the others.
