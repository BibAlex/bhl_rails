THE PB ACTIO AL GUIDE TO FLORICULTURE.
After blooming, the tops can be cut off, and
the pots set away in the cellar. Give no water
during winter, unless the soil is in danger of
getting dust-dry. In spring, bring up the pots,
and water well. lu a short time sprouts will
be sent up all over the surface of the soil.
Cut these apart in such a manner as to retain
a piece of root with each, and put them off
into small pots. Then proceed as advised
above.
I shall not extend this list. Those who suc-
ceed with the kinds named can add to their
collections by selecting from the catalogues.
Grow these well, and jou will be able to under-
take the cultivation of others requiting more
careful treatment. But contiue yourself to this
list until you have acquired the experience
which justifies you in " branching out."
I have not included the Rose, because I find
it almost impossible to grow it well under such
conditions as generally prevail in ordinary liv-
ing-rooms. No pla^it is more difficult to grow
well, and unless one can grow a plant well it is
better not to attempt its cultivation. If one
cares to experiment with Roses, I would adviso
Queen's Scarlet, Agripijiua, crimson, and Her-
mosa, bright pink, yuccess will come with these
varieties, if any.
