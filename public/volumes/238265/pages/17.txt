THE PRACTICAL GUIDE TO FLORICULTURE.
Coroopsia lanceolata is one of the new
plants sure to win its way to popular
favor. It is very hardy. It sends up many
sleufler stalks, crowned with blos-
soms of the richest yellow. It is not a
large grower, therefore should be given
a place in the front row. For cutting, it
is quite as desirable as the annual vari-
eties, which it closely resembles in form.
It lacks the rich browu markings of the
annual kind, and does not bloom as
freely, but it continues to blossom until
froat comes.
The Dicentra. with its beautiful fern-
like foliage, and long, gi-acefully arching
sprays of drooping pink and white flow-
ers, dpserves a place in every collection.
This flower is popularly known as
" Bleeding Heart," because of its pecu-
liar shape.
The pink and white herbaceous Spireas
are extren)ely beautiful, ani no garden
is complete without them. Their panicles
of bloom have such an airy, graceful
efiect, lilted, as they are, on long, slen-
der stalks, well abiive the foliage, that
they seem dainty piumos waving in the
wind. For back rows m the border they
are amonjj our best plants. They truns-
plant easily and safely, grow rapidly,
reciuire but little atteutiOD, bloom freely,
