BULBS FOR WINTER BLOOMING.
is
every season, and have excellent success with
them. My method is to put three or four large
and healthy bulbs in each nine or ten inch pot.
1 fill the pot about half full of such compost as I
have advised for other bulbs, and press the bulbs
of the Lily down into it well, but do not covfjr
them. Then I set the pots away in a shady
place — but it need not be very dark or cool— as
i* has been my experience that they will not
cause of the greater substance of its flowers.
Mauy try to bring Lily of the Valley into bloom
in the house, and almost always they fail because
they give it the treatment advised for bulhs.
The "pips" should be procured from some re-
liable dealer— not a bunch of weak, inferior
ones chopped up from the run-out plants in the
garden. Keep them frozen, if possible, until
you are ready to force them. Then put them in

make top-growth until good roots have been
formed, whother in or out of the cellar. As
soon as the stalk begins to put up, add more
earth, and as it reaches up fill in about it until
you have the pot full of soil. The reason for
doing this is that the roots which support the
stalk are sent out above the bulb. By giv-
ing it earth to put forth these roots in, it will
not be necessary to furnish a stick for its sup-
port.
Lilium Longiflorum is, by some, considered
euperior to L. Harrissii, the Bermuda Lily, be-
moss, and place them where they can have a
steady heat of eighty or ninety degrees. The
moss should be kept moist at all times. They
should be shad'^d with cloth until the stems are
two or three inches high. Then the shading
should be removed in order to give the flowers
a chance to develop. This treatment, you will
observe, is such as can hardly be given in the
living-room. A greenhouse is needed for forc-
ing this flower. I cannot advise the amateur to
undertakt^ its culture in winter if he has only an
ordinary window in which to grow it. _
