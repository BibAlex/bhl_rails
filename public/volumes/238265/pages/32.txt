FLOWERS FOR GUTTING.

scious of. The next Sunday, at church, there
was a wide-moutlied bowl on the pulpit filled
with branches of these sa,m'3 ilowers and the
result was exquisite, and the reason why it was
BO was simply that the branches were allowed
t5 assume such forms as were natural to them.
Instead of reaching straight up, as they never
do on the tree, they spread themselves out close
to the pulpit cushion, making a wide, lew mass
of pink and whito beauty that was the perfection
of simplifity, because of its naturalness, there-
fore a perfect success.
For use ia large, low bowls, aa well as in deep
vases where it is desirable to have something
that droops or trails, we have no vine quite as
beautiful as our native Chmatis, with its pani-
cles of airy, gi-aceful white flowers. Both flow-
ers and foliage are charming. This flower is
one of the two or three kinds I would use with
Roses.
I have made charming decorations of it
in combination with the Oleander. Branches
of two or three feet in length should be cut, and
a weight of some kind attached to the lowor end
to hold them in place. If this is not done, they
are often drawn out of the water by the weight
of their droopj.a«4?i;^^s aad flowers, and when
you discover, Vliat has happened, they aro with-
ered. Notb^n<r can be finer for a simple pulpit
decoration j^han a bowl into which three or tour
branches otf ^^,ia clematis is fastened, the enps

possible effect. No matter how beautiful the
flowers are which yon put with them, they are
sure to sufler from comparison with the Lilies,
and the LUies seem to resent their presence.
Plants of Lilies growing in pots can be used
with other flowers in decorating rooms with
good results, but cut them and put them in the
same vase with other flowers and you will un-
derstand that there is a lack of harmony result-
ing from the contact which was not apparent
when the plants were used. It would seem as
if, iu ordir to assort their individuality prop-
erly, they must not bo forced to become too
famihar with other flowers. They are Lilies,
aristocrats of the floral family, and plebian flow-
ers must keep at a respectful distance.
Nothing makes a finer bouquet for the desk or
the breakfast table than a spray of Tea Roses,
cut so that a full-blown flower, a half opened
one, and buds in various stages of development
are secured, with some foliage of rich green and
the reddish tints peculiar to the young growth
of this variety of the Rose. A wine-glass makes
a good holder for such.a bouquet.
For large Roses, like the Hybrid Perpetual, or
the Provence, or others of the Jane flowering
section, bowls are better tha.n.v»'>"° -:-•"*""■
