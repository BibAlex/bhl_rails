A favorite small tree or shrub. A great

beautiful as Roses. Give this plant a hght,

and plenty of water. Given these, with consid-
erable root-room, fine plants can be grown by
any one. Small pots should be used at first.

No plant is more popular to- day than the
Chrysanthemum. And this is not to be won-
dered at, because no plant blooms with greater
profusion, or is easier to succeed with.
The secret of successful culture of the Chrys-
anthemum is rich soil— it can hardly be too rich,

rich, and mellow. Water daily, and in liberal
quantities. Make it a point to never let the
plants get dry at the roots. If they do, they
will be checked, and from this check they will
never recover fully. .

be useless to attempt to make a choice here.
Consult the catalogues, and select such colors,
from each class, as suit you best. I think tho
Chinese varieties give the best satisfaction.
