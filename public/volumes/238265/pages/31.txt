The ever-blooming Roses depend on constant
development of new branches for flowers. With-
out a steady growth of su-'h branches there will
be no flowers, as all blofsoms are borne on new
wood. In ordf-r to keep up the production of
new wood, it is necessary to cut back the old
branches from time to time. As soon as all
buds on a branch have developed into flowers,
cut that branch back to Pome etronfj branch-
bud. A little observation will enable you to
tell what bud to expect best results from. So
much for pruning. The condition of the soil is
(luite aa important. In order to keep up a
steady growth, it is necessary that the plants
which clay should play a prominent part, and
you can bo reasonat'ly sure of growing good
Roses if you carry cut the instructions about
pruning them. Stir the soil frequently to admit
air and moisture, but do not dig de^p enough to
disturb the roots. In hot, dry weather mnlch
the soil about the plants with clippings from
the lawn, or something that will shade the
ground and retain moisture. This is very im-
portant.
Some of the very best varieties for cutting are
the following :
