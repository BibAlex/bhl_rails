SOME OF THE BEST HOUSE PLANTS.

Alba pic<a,*upright grower, loavea epotttod
wi^h wbite.*^ *~
Argantea^giMatci,^\QiyQS of a bronzy olive,
marked with silver? A strong grower.
Albia, very|beautiful, green and olive, with
rich veinings.
Its flowers are mostly lavender and purple, or
grayish blue. They are of most exquisite fra-
grance. If the plant is given plenty of water,
kept in a euuny window, and cut back from time
to time, it will bloom the year round. Excellent
for use in small bouquets.
CAKXATION.
Diadema, large leaves, of palmate character,
heavily spotted with white.
Metallica, bronze green, veined with crimson.
Very fine.
The Rpx Begonias are not adapted to general
bouse culture. The varieties named above are
nearly as fine, and do as well in the sitting-room
as the flowering kinds.
The Heliotrope.
^This is aa.oW favorite, and deservedly so.
Carnation.
The Carnation stands next to the Rose in pop-
ularity. It is a beautiful flower, and its spicy
sweetness givesitan additional charm, It would
surprise the reader if bo knew how many hun-
dreds of acres of this flower are grown under
glass, for the winter trade, in all the large cities.
Many growers cut thousands of flowers daily,
during the entire season.
In growing it for the house, I would advise
planting the young plant;? in the garden bed
