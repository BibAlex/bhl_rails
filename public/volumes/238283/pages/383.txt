It appears from these results that there is a uniform decrease in specific
heat with increase in molecular weight. Furthermore the normal hydro-
carbons, such as heptane, C7H16, B. P. 98°, and decane, CiqHoo, B. P.
172°, have higher specific heats than their isomers, such for example as
isoheptane, C7H16, B. P. 91°, and isodecane, CioH.,2 B. P. 162°.
The same variation also appears in the methylene series, with high
values for certain members that probably indicate different structural
relations.
It is further interesting to observe the materially lower values given
by the methylene iiydrocarbons as compared with the values for the
paraffine hydrocarbons. Whether this be due to greater compactness
in the methylene molecule or to some quality of its ring structure, it
would be interesting to ascertain.
Perhaps the falling off in specific heat with increasing molecular
weight will appear to better advantage when arranged as ordinates on
a curve with the molecular weights as abscissae. Only those compounds
are given on the curve that are known to be normal, although, of course,
this is not known with reference to the higher members. The different
values of the isomers heptane and decane is shown on the shorter curve.
This uniform decrease in specific heat with increasing molecular
weiofht in the series C„Hon^2i suggest a constant i-elation analogous to
the law of Neumann.
If the constant K be expressed in terms of the specific heat multiplied
by the molecular weight and the product divided by the number of atoms
in the molecule, the specific heats found for the hydrocarbons of this series
give the following values for the |;onstant:
