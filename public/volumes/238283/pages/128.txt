RICHARDS. â€” THE STANDARD OF ATOMIC WEIGHTS. 181
Laboratory. If an adequate internationally representative body of
chemists should in the future decide that some other standard is better,
immediate change of practice will be made to suit the new decision.
One regrets that so much time should have been spent in discussing a
matter which involves no fundamental principle, but is simply a question
of form and of convenience.
The subject matter of the present paper may be summed up in the
following sentences. It is pointed out that oxygen has actually served
as the experimental standard of reference in a great majority of cases,
that a great bulk of valuable work has already been published on the
basis O = 16.000, and that the use of this standard involves no impor-
tant didactic difficulties. It is further contended that the decision of
the representative International Committee is in itself an important rea-
son for adopting this standard, and that uniformity of usage is more
important than any of the special advantages claimed by either side in
the discussion.
