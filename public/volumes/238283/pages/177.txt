Dichothrix penicillata Zan. On Cymopolia barbata, Port Maria, H.

Garden, Castleton, April, 1893, H.
*Spirogyra decimina (Muell.) *Kuetz. Mancbioneal, July, 1900,
P. & B.
Tbe spores agree with this species, and as far as can be judged from
dried specimens, the vegetative characters. A sterile Spirogyra from
Bath has the same dimensions of cells, but cannot be specifically deter-
mined.
Ulva fasciata Delile. In dense masses just below water mark, but
only in one limited locality, Port Antonio, July, 1891, P. & B.
P. B.-A., No. 221. Near Kingston, Duerden.
U. Lactuca var. rigida (Ag.) Le Jolis. Port Antonio, Aug., 1894;
Kingston, Montego Bay, June, 1900, P. & B. Near Kingston, Duerden.

E. flexuosa (Wulf.) J. Ag. Port Antonio, July, 1891 ; Runaway
Bay, July, 1900; washed ashore, Manchioueal Bay, July, 1900, P. & B.

E. prolifera (Muell.) J. Ag. Runaway Bay, Montego Bay, Mancbi-
oneal, on stones; also in fresh water at Bath, on stones in river, 1900,

*Stigeoclonium tenue (Ag.) Rab. No. 366, H., locality not given.
Diplochaete solitaria n. g. & sp. Frond epiphytic, consisting of
a single cell, with thick, transparent wall, and bright green contents,
spherical or flattened, the outline as seen from above round or slightly
oval ; two hairs arising from each cell, usually opposite, and from points
on the under surface quite near the edge. Cell 25-30^ diameter,
half this diameter being occupied by the wall ; hairs 4-6(U diameter,
slightly tapering, straight. On Laurencia obtusa, near Kingston,
Duerden.
This minute plant was observed on a specimen of Laurencia, after it
had been mounted for the herbarium, so that nothing is known as to its
development, but it seems so distinct from any described genus of the
Chaetophoraceae as to require a new name.
