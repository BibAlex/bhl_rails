reduced to a value q' ^ less than r — p^, in which case the sum of the
exponents of the three variables,
p^-\- q\^- in — r,
is less than m and reduction ensues. So it is only in the case in vphich
for every term
p,>s, s = 2, 3, m,
that we are not sure of reduction. Suppose the number of transforma-
tions after this point to be n. Then we get for the new exponent of t,
qs + n{p, — s).
Now by taking n large enough we can make the quotient
" {Ps - ■s) + qs

this is the same for two or more terms, we can make the fraction above
lowest for the one in which — is lowest. Accordingly, by a finite
number of transformations of type (43) we secure the condition that
p — y p . . . Q .

Consider the surface (42) with the condition 5, 2), the sth term being

dividing out each time the factor ^. The resulting term is
