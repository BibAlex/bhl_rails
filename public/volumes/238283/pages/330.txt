Quebec to Athabasca and British Columbia, south to Pennsyl-
vania, Michigan, New Mexico, and Washington.^ May-Aug.
* * Perigynia entirely smooth at the tip (exceptional forms of C. canescens might
be looked for here ; and very rare individuals of C tenuijlora might be sought
in the preceding section).
t- Perigynia oblong or ovate-oblong.
■w- Perigynia 3 to 4 mm. long, nerved : culms weak, almost capillary :
spikelets 2 to 4, loose, silvery -green or silvery brown.
= Spikelets closely approximate in a small usually bractless terminal
cluster : perigynia beakless.
35. C. TENUiFLORA, Wahlenb. — Figs. 129, 130. — Lax, the culms
2 to 6 dm. long, mostly exceeding the very narrow (0.7 to 2 mm. broad)
pale green leaves : spikelets subglobose, 3- to lO-flowered : perigynia 3 to
3.Jf mm. long, 1.5 to 1.7 mm. broad, with the bluntish scarcely beaked
tip smooth or rarely with one or two teeth, about equalled by the ovate
or ovate-oblong white scale. — Kongl. Vet. Acad. Handl. xxiv. 147,

Manitoba ; south to Westmoreland and Victoria Cos., New Bruns-
wick; southern Aroostook, Penobscot and Oxford Cos., Maine; Hamp-

British Columbia {Macoun^ hb. Geol. Surv. Can. nos. 25,571 &

1 The California material which has been referred here is C. Bolanderi, Olney,
differing in its less acutely angled culm, longer spikes of more approximate usually
more numerous lance-cylindric many-flowered spikelets, the lowest with or without
a short bract. The northwestern C Bolanderi, var. sparslflora, Olney (C. Deweyana,
var. sparsijlora, Bailey) is a distinct species, probably C. laevicuhnis, Meinshausen,
Acta Hort. Petrop. xviii. 326, in its small short-beaked strongly nerved finally
spreading thin-edged perigynia much nearer related to the eastern C. seorsa than
to the members of the Elongatae.
