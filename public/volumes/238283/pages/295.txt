contained in the silver ion carrying the same quantity of electricity.
Part of this material would be in the form of oxide, and would therefore
cause dark spots on the surface of the kathode, — spots which have
actually been noticed by other experimenters.
This interpretation serves to explain also the very high results ob-
tained by Lord Rayleigh in the presence of argentic acetate. The
possibility of forming slightly dissociated acetic acid would prevent any
considerably accumulation of ionized hydrogen, and the oxide-complex
would grow in concentration without hindrance. This explanation
seems more plausible than the provisional one suggested by Lord Ray-
leigh, — namely, that the acetate itself might be carried down with the
silver.
In order to submit these interpretations to the test of experiment,
electrolyses were conducted with solutions saturated with argentic oxide.
Kahle, Patterson and Guthe, and others, have likewise carried out such
electrolyses, showing that the deposit is as a matter of fact too great ; but
our trial is easier to interpret, because by means of the porous cup all
anode complications were excluded, and the result of experiment gives
the effect of argentic oxide alone.
Three trials were made, in which a given current of 0.25 ampere as
usual was run first through a standard porous cup voltameter, and then
through a cell precisely similar except that the kathode solution in the
latter was saturated with the argentic oxide. The following table cou-
tains the results : —
