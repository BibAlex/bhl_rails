lent to r independent equations, the order of the system is — (^ + m —

Whether n is odd or even we have finally a curve 2i of multiplicity
n — 1, whose equations are found by expressing the conditions that
the equations of the generating (w — 2) -flat have n — 1 roots in the
parameter in common. We derive a restricted system of the same
form as (II) in which however there are I -\- m — 2 (w — 2) rows and
I -\- m — (n — 2) columns. The order of this system is -. -.

has w-tuple points on it whose equations are found l)y expressing the con-
ditions that the equations of the generating (« — 2)-flat have n roots in
common. We again have a restricted system of the same form as (II),
in which, however, there are Z + m — 2 (ti — 1) rows and I -\- m — n + 1
columns. The order of this system is — - (I -{- m — n -{- 1) (I -{- m — ?^)
. . . . (I -{■ tn . 2 n -{- 2), which is the number of points in question. P'or
n = 3 these formulae for the order agree with those given in Salmon.*
A very special case is where the parameter enters only linearly in oi.e
of the equations of the generating (/i — 2)-flat. Let the equations of the
fiat be
B=a' r + b' t'"'^ +.... = 0,
where we make the same suppositions regarding a, b, a', b', . . . , as
before. The S^^i in this case is a ruled spread with m sheets through
the (?^ — 2)-flat, whose equations are
a = 0,b = 0;
it has no other multiple locus on it at all. Consecutive generating F„_2S
of the system intersect in the flat, whose equations are,

All the F„_iS of the system lie in the same (n — 2)-flat ; they generate a
developable (n — 3) -spread *S''„_3 in this flat. *S''„_3 is the section by this
flat of the developable (n — l)-spread enveloped by the (n — l)-flat B.
Consecutive generating F^?, of S,i_i intersect in generating ^„_4's of
