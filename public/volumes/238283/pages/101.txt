If there is a linear relation between f, e, and d, then these two consec-
utive generators intersect in an (« — 2)-flat, i. e., they are coincident
and we have a stationary generator of the system. If
then
e = 0,
is the equation of a stationary generator of the system. The equation
of the developable S,^_i in this case is

"We see that / is a factor of the left member of this equation. When
this factor is thrown out, the residual or proper developable is of a
degree less by one than before. The orders of the multiple loci pre-
viously given are also reduced, they only holding when there are no
stationary i^„_/s in the system. By means of Veronese's formulae we
see that when there are ^ stationary F„_/s the order of the A-way
developable is reduced from (m — \ -\- \) (m — n + X) to (n — X -{- 1)
{m — n -\- X) — (n — X) p.

We Lave treated up to this point the various developables that arise
from a curve in n-fold space. We shall show now that similar develop-
ables do not arise from the consideration of the tangent flats of spreads
of more than one way.
