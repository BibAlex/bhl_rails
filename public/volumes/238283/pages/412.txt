MABERY. — THE COMPOSITION OF PETROLEUM. 575
A portion of the original distillate 174°-175° was cooled to —10°,
which caused the separation of a crystalline mass. It was filtered cold,
but the solid remaining formed but a small part of the original oil.
The specific gravity of the filtered oil 0.8005, was slightly higher than
the unfiltered distillate. The quantity of the solid was not sufficient for
analysis or further examination. No further examination was made of
the filtered oil, for it was evident that the small amount of solid hydro-
carbon could not change the composition, nor other constants, especially
since, as siiown above, the original distillate has the composition of the
series C„H2n+2-
HePTADECANE, C17H36.
The fraction which collected at 188°-190° after the 42d distilla-
tion gave as its specific gravity at 20° after drying over sodium, 0.8017.
After agitation with sulphuric acid it gave 0.8019, and after purification
with fuming sulphuric acid, 0.8000. Under 760 mm. pressure this oil
distilled almost entirely at 288°-289°, with very little residue above
289°. The small residue was badly colored from decomposition.
Evidently it would not be possible to distill this oil continuously under
atmospheric pressure in presence of air without serious decomposition.
The formula of this distillate was established by two determinations
of its molecular weight and by analysis.
I. 1.4294 grm. of the oil and 25.7086 grms. benzol gave a depression
of 1°.17.
II. 1.4382 grm. of the oil and 25.6785 grms. benzol gave a depression
of 1°.18.
