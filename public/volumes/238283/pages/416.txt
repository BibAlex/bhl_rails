MABERY. — THE COMPOSITION OF PETROLEUM. 581
The melting point of the solid was found to be 33°-34° corresponding
to the melting point, 32°, that Kraflft found for the solid hydrocarbon
distilling at, 226°. 5, 50 mm.
A combustion of the oil filtered from the solid hydrocarbon gave
percentages of carbon and hydrogen required for CigHsg.
0.1495 grm. of the oil gave 0.4715 grm. CO2 and 0.1928 grm. H2O.
Calculated for Ciglljg. Found.

A determination of the molecular weight confirmed the formula: —
2.5445 grms. of the oil and 24.63 grms. benzol gave a rise of 0°.994.
Calculated for CioHjg. Found.

The formula was further verified by its index of refraction.
It gave the index 1.4515, corresponding to the molecular refraction : —
Calculated for CigHjg. Found.

With the distillate 212°-214°, 50 mm., the limit is reached of the
solid hydrocarbons whose molecular weight can be determined by the
freezing point method on account of the crystallization of the hydrocar-
bon before the benzol freezes. The molecular weights of solid higher
members were determined by the boiling point method.
The results described in this paper defining the physical properties and
formulae of the hydrocarbons separated from Pennsylvania petroleum dif-
fer in several essential particulars both from the hydrocarbons obtained
by Kraflft by decomposition of the monobasic acids with high molecular
weights, and those formerly reported as among the constituents of Penn-
sylvania oil. It has been shown that the hydrocarbon at 196° is undecane,
CnH24, and not dodecane as found by Pelouze and Cahours. Likewise
the hydrocarbon at 216° proved to be dodecane and not tridecane.
Since there was no method for ascertaining the molecular weights of
these bodies at the time when they were separated by Pelouze and
Cahours, and elementary analysis could only determine the series, it was
only by analogy that the homologous members of the series could be
guessed at. Since 182° was accepted at the boiling point of undecane,
naturally dodecane and tridecane should fall into the heaps at 196° and
216°.
