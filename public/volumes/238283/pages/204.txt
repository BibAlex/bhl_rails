REQUIRED TO REPRESENT T IS FiNITE.
6. In the foregoing paragraph it has been shown that the neighbor-
hood of each tangent line to the surface $ = 0, at the singular point
can be mapped on the neighborhood of a (regular or singular) point
of the surface y = 0. We now proceed to show that the whole
neijihborhood
o
T: Kl < 8, h|<S, |^|<S
can be covered by the neighborhoods of a finite number of such lines.
We distinguish two cases : —
Case I. — The polynomial </> (f, rj) has no multiple factors.
Case II. — This polynomial has multiple factors.
Theorem: T/ie neighborhood T can be completely covered by a finite
number of regions 7\, T^, T^, which overlap each other and which
are mapped respectively on the following regions ty, to, t^:
In Case I: 1) the region t^, i = 1, 2, k, consists of the neigh-
borhood of a singular point of the surface y*' = ;
2) the extent of each of the neighborhoods ti, t^, t^ having been
arbitrarily determined, the regions tj, J =: k + 1, v, then consist
of regidar regions of surfaces g^^ = 0.
In Case II : 1) the region ^;, V = 1, 2, k, consists of the neigh-
borhood of a singidar point of the surface ^''' = ;
2) the extent of each of the neighborhoods <i, <2 5 '« having been
arbitrarily determined, the regions tj,j=^K-\-\, v, then consist
of regions of surfaces g'-'^ = defined as follows : omitting the index j
throughout, we write
9 (^^ Vv = Li + Pi (Vv 0C + +Pr (Vv 0] ^ (^„. Vv 0,
where p^ (171, ^) is analytic throughout a region
\rix\<h, l^l<8-
Here r,for a given value ofj, is a positive integer satisfying the relation
1 < r <m.
Case I. — The polynomial <^ (f, ^ contains no multiple factors.
Here, the equation
