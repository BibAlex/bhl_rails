NICHOLS. — THE VISIBLE RADIATION FROM CARBON. 113
radiation as a function of wave lengtli and temperature. The equation
reached from quite ditFerent points of view by Wien * and by Planck.f
in particular, has been the subject of exhaustive discussion and of
experimental tests. To this end Pascheu t determined with the bolo-
meter the distribution of energy in the infra-red spectra of various
bodies from 15° C to 1300°. The materials thus subjected to measure-
ment were oxide of copper, platinum, lampblack, and graphitic carbon.
The range of wave lengths explored extended from 9.2// to 0.7^.
Luramer and Pringsheim § made similar determinations upon the ideal
black body, and Liimmer and Jahnke || finally repeated these measure-
ments in the case of the black body and of platinum. Wanner,ir working
with Paschen, made careful spectrophotometric measurements of the
visible radiation from the ideal black body. To test the applicability of
the Wien-Planck formula to these measurements, the equation is given
the form, —
log /= 71 — 72 ^;
in which
71 = ^og {c, X~^),
= — lo<r e.

The isochromatic curves are then plotted with the logarithm of the
intensities as ordinates and the reciprocal of the absolute temperature as
abscissae. The agreement of the equation with the observations is
found in the fact that isochroms thus plotted, at least as far as the work
of Paschen and Wanner is concerned, always take the form of straight
lines, and that the quantity Co computed for various wave lengths is
found to be a constant. Lummer and Pringsheim, on the contrary, find
in the discussion of their measurements that the constant, Cg increases
steadily with the wave length from 13,500 at 1.2 ^it to 16,500 at 5 ^, and
18,500 at 0.3//. The value of Co computed by measurements from
