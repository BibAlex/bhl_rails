MABERY. — THE COMPOSITION OP PETROLEUM. 583
After establishing a homologous series by analysis, evidently the only
means available for Pelouze and Cahours to determine the molecular
size of the hydrocarbons was to assume that a hydrocarbon constituted
the chief portion of any distillates that collected in unusually large
amounts, and to compute the series in unbroken order from the lower
members.
Several attempts were made to ascertain the presence of the hydro-
carbon C20H42; but the distillates between the limits 215° and 225°
were small, and in none of them did the molecular weight obtained
correspond to this formula.
HeNEICOSANE, C21H44, AND LiQUID HYDROCARBON, C21H42.
From Distillate 230°-232°, 50 mm.
Larger quantities of distillates amounting to 200 grams collected at
230°-232°, for the most part at 230°-23r- The specific gravity of the
unpurified distillate was 0.8321 ; after purification it gave 0.8230. A
combustion of the purified oil gave the following percentages of carbon
and hydrogen : —
0.1540 grm. of the oil gave 0.4813 grm. CO2 and 0.1968 grm. HgO.

There was evidently some loss in this analysis, but the percentages
are more satisfactory for the formula C2iH42. It will be shown that this
distillate was a mixture of a solid hydrocarbon with an oil of higher
specific gravity. Its molecular weight was determined at the freezing
point of benzol.
I. 1.4807 grm. of the oil and 25.9125 grms. benzol gave a depression
of 0°.949.
II. 0.6845 grm. of the oil and 19.48 grms. benzol gave a depression
of 0°.579.
