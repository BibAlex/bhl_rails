morpha rather than a Cladophora, but occasionally the free branches
have a series of secund, two or three-celled ramuli, issuing one from each
articulation. In the entangled mass more branching of this character
will be found, also long normal branches in no definite order. The habit
of C. intertexta is much like that of C. repens (J. Ag.) Harv., but the
filaments are two or three times as large as in that species, and the color
is a light green, somewhat whitish in drying, instead of the dull olive
green of C. repens ; the latter has, moreover, a vaguely dichotomous
branching, and articulations many times — according to Harvey, even
twenty times — the diameter. C. herpestica (Mont.) Kuetz. has fila-
ments of about the same size as C. intertexta, but it has long articula-
tions, up to fifteen diameters, and irregular branching, with the upper
branches fasciculate.
