BLACK. — THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A SINGULAR POINT. 291
Now, the transformation (2) being made, the points of the region
^= l^i<S, \v\<8, |C|<8,
which lie in the neighborhoods of" the lines
(-^A=ol " = '■'' ''
can, with the exception of the point (0, 0, 0), be transformed in a one-
to-one manner on the neighborhoods of the points (0, 0, 0) of a set of
surfaces
ffAi.,vi,0 = o, <T=i,2, s,
the coordinates being connected by the relation
By the neighborhood of the above line is here meant the set of points
(^, ■>?, 'Q which satisfy the condition
To deal with the points for which a, /3 would be infinite, cut the
surface
by the plane
The equations of the tangents to the curve of intersection at (0, 0, 0)
are
^^A T=l, 2, t<Tn.
By means of a transformation corresponding to (2),
the points of T which lie in the neighborhoods of the lines
^^A r=l,2, t<m,
can, with the exception of the point (0, 0, 0), be transformed in a one-
to-one manner on the neighborhoods of the points (0, 0, 0) of the set
of surfaces
9r (^V V>1) = 0, T = 1, 2, t<m,
