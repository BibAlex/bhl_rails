For values of k that satisfy this condition there is in general a continuous
locus of double points. If

there is in general only a finite number of double points on the locus. If
w - 2 ^' + 2 < 0, or /fc > ^-^^
Zi
there are in general no double points on the locus.
If there enter into the equations of the generating (« — Z,-)-flat p
parameters connected by p — 1 equations the properties of the system of
related loci will be similar to those of the system just described.
Any two consecutive -^„_i's intersect in an F,^^2^. while through any
^n-ik P'^.ss two consecutive -^„_i.'s. Any three consecutive F^_^^ intersect
in an -F„_-5i while through any i^,_3i. pass two consecutive i^„_2i's and
three consecutive F^^g-'s. Any two consecutive F„_,.^'s determine in
general one Fn_f.fr-i)' An exception may occur if r = a the greatest
integer in -• Thus, if n = \mod k), two consecutive points of Si do
not determine a {k -\- I) -flat where 2 ^ k.
If n = 1 (mod k), two consecutive lines of So do not determine a
(k + l)-flat, except in the case k = 2. In the last case, however, where
n = ^- — 1 (mod k), two non-intersecting (k — l)-flats do determine a
(2 ^ — l)-flat. Only in this last case can we retrace the steps if we
come down to the last spread. We can always retrace the steps if we
do not come down to this last case.

The equation in homogeneous coordinates of any (n — ^•)-flat, 2 "^ k,
may be written
x = ais + I3it -^ . . . . + yiw,
t/ = a2S + /Sit -}-....+ yot^,
z = a^S i- (3kt +....+ YkW.
In this form the equations of the flat contain k (n — k -\- 1) independent
parameters. These parameters must be connected by^(w — ^+ 1)— 1
equations for this (n — ^)-flat to be a generator of such a ruled
(?2 _ ^ -f l)-spread. Any curve is given by the equations
