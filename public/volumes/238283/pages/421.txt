The quantity of the hydrocarbon was not sufficient for a determina-
tion of its molecular weight.
The filtered oil gave as its specific gravity at 20°, 0.8296, a value
somewhat higher than that obtained before filtration. A combustion
gave the following percentages of carbon and hydrogen : —
0.1505 grm. of the oil gave 0.4717 grm. CO. and 0.1937 grm. HoO.
0.1411 grm. of the oil gave 0.4419 grm. CO2 and 0.1819 grm. HgO.
Calculated for CjjH^j. Found.
C 85.70 85.49 85.41
H 14.30 14.31 14.32
These proportions correspond to the formula C22H44, which is supported
by the high specific gravity.
The molecular weight of the filtered oil was also determined : —
1.0713 grm. of the oil and 19.60 grms. benzol gave a depression of 0°.858.
Calculated for CojUa- Found.

The wide difference in specific gravity between the solid and liquid
hydrocarbons at 240°-242°, 50 mm., point to different series. While
the percentages of carbon and hydrogen given by analysis could not alone
be depended on to prove the different series, the results of combustion
with specific gravity are sufficient. The differences in theoretical com-
position of the two series are 0.5 of one per cent for carbon and for
hydrogen. In combustions conducted under the most favorable condi-
tions and with the greatest care, the different series may be shown in
well purified materials. But with so many determinations, and the ex-
treme care in details of the method, while the percentages obtained are
sufficiently close to indicate the series, the results are not in all cases as
close to the calculated percentages as should be reached in the greater
precision of a few analyses.

From Distillate 258°-260°, 50 mm.
After the nineteenth distillation, 175 grams collected at 258°-260°,
50 mm., for the most part at 260°-261°, which deposited a considerable
quantity of solid hydrocarbon on standing. The specific gravity of the
unpurified distillate decanted from the solid was as follows : —
