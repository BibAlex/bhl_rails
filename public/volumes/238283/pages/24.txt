PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSES OF NEW SPECIES OF
LABOULBENIACEAE. — IV.
By Roland Thaxter.
Received May 6, 1901. Presented May 8, 1901.
Additional material illustrating the well-marked generic type de-
scribed in a former paper as Monoicomyces renders necessary some
modification of the original diagnosis, as well as the separation of several
species in a second nearly allied genus, which I have called Eumonoico-
myces (E. Papuanus being taken as the type), that is well characterized
not only by constant differences in the structure of the peculiar anther-
idium, but also by reason of certain differences in gross habit which are
constant in normal forms of all three of the known species, one of which,
EJ. invisibilis, was formerly placed by me in Monoicomyces.
EUMONOICOMYCES nov. gen.
Receptacle consisting of a basal and subbasal cell ; the latter producing
terminally a sterile appendage and laterally a fertile branch (abnormally
more than one) the axis of which is coincident with that of the receptacle
from which it is not distinguished and consists of a series of superposed
cells which may bear a sterile appendage, an antheridium, or an anther-
idium and a perithecium ; the three terminal cells usually bearing these
organs in the order mentioned. The antheridia consisting of a single
stalk-cell, and a single, often obscure, basal cell ; the body of the antherid-
ium consisting of a series of numerous antheridial cells in four (?) vertical
rows which extend obliquely inward and upward, emptying into a com-
mon cavity, and replace entirely the two tiers of wall-cells and the anther-
idia of Monoicomyces ; the terminal cells growing upward directly to
form four unequal sterile terminal appendages, similar to those of
Monoicomyces.
