corresponding wave lengths of the comparison source (in this case the
acetylene flame), the relative distribntion of energy in the visible
spectrum from the carbon rods. The other curves, which I have termed
isochroms, indicate the rise in the energy of any particular wave length of
tlie visible spectrum, with increase of temperature. Each of these curves,
taken by itself, is entirely independent of the nature of the light of the
comparison source, but the absolute relation of such curves to one another
can only be obtained when we know the distribution of energy in the
spectrum of that source. By means of the isocliroms, it is, however,
possible even without this knowledge to compare the rise in intensity
of any single wave length of the spectrum with increasing temperature.
The set of curves shown in Figure 17 are plotted directly from obser-
