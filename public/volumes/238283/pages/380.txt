Since 1819, when Dulong and Petit, on the basis of their work on
thirteen of the chemical elements, announced the law that atoms of all
elementary bodies possess the same capacity for heat, or that the specific
heats of the elements vary inversely as their atomic weights, the specific
heats of the elements have been important physical constants. With
some exceptions, the constant 6.54 represents the product of the atomic
^weight into the specific heat. Later work showed that this law could be
extended to compounds. In 1831, Neumann discovered that compounds,
with analogous composition have the same specific heat. Or in a series
of compounds with analogous composition the specific heat varies inversely
with the molecular weight. These laws apply to approximately forty ele-
ments and to solids only at temperatures much below their melting points.
The specific heats of many organic compounds have since been deter-
mined, and although no law has been stated, it is evident that, in certain
homologous series of organic compounds, a condition exists in some of
these series analogous to the law of Neumann. For instance, deter-
minations have been made on a few of the alcohols with the following
results I
Ethyl alcohol 0.680
Iso-propyl alcohol 0.5286
Iso-butyl alcohol 0.5078
Iso-amyl alcohol 0.4932
That the variations on certain homologous series so far as they have
been observed do not conform to a general law, is shown by the follow-
ing series, in which the specific heats increase with increase in molecu-
lar weights :
