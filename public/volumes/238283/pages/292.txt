pare the nitrite, we had recourse at first to a method used by Proust.*
He has found that on boiling an argentic nitrate solution with finely di-
vided silver, the nitrite is produced in quantity. In repeating this ex-
periment, powdered silver reduced from purest silver chloride by the
Stas method was boiled in a ten per cent argentic nitrate solution.
Nitrite was indeed formed, but a very fine film of crystallized metallic
silver was formed on the surface ; a complication which seemed to point
towards the existence of a reaction similar to the solution of copper in
cupric sulphate. But it was found that pure silver nitrite in neutral
silver nitrate solution likewise deposits a fine silver mirror on exposure
to the light; hence the silver in both cases must be supposed to result
simply from the decomposition of the nitrite. The solution boiled with
silver was filtered through a Gooch crucible, and after cooling was em-
ployed in a voltameter with a porous cup. The solution containing the
nitrite deposited 2.27945 grams of silver, while pure argentic nitrate in
another standard voltameter deposited 2.27944 grams, a difference of
only 0.01 milligram. (Exp. 15.)
Evidently the nitrite present had no effect at the kathode ; and the
liquid in an ordinary voltameter could hardly contain more nitrite than
this solution which had been boiled with metallic silver. In order to
pursue the matter further, however, we prepared silver nitrite from pure
potassium nitrite and silver nitrate.f Pure potassic hydrate was neutral-
ized with nitric acid ; the nitrate was re-crystallized and fused in a silver
crucible, and the resulting mixture of nitrate aud nitrite was extracted

This reference has evidently been lost, since no text-book, including; Dam-
mer, gives it, although all mention Proust's observation. After a long search
through tlie journals published in Proust's days, the reference was rediscovered.
