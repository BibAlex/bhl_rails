The filtered oil gave as its specific gravity at 20°, 0.85 G9. It gave
percentages of carbon and hydrogen requii'ed for the series CaH2a : —
0.1504 grm. of the oil gave 0.4711 grm. CO2 and 0.1945 grm. HgO.

From Distillate 272°-274°, 50 mm.
After the nineteenth distillation, 150 grams collected at 272°-274°,
50 mm., that became partly solid on standing. The decanted oil gave
as its specific gravity 0.8448 at 20°. A part of the distillate was then
cooled to —10°, and the solid filtered cold under pressure.
The distillate was purified by treatment with successive portions of
fuming sulphuric acid, until the acid was nearly colorless, then washed
with sodic hydrate and a concentrated solution of calcic chloride, and
dried over fused calcic chloride and sodium. Nearly one third of the
volume was removed in purification. The purified oil then gave as its
specific gravity at 20°, 0.8598, and at higher temperatures: —
60°, 0.8375 70°, 0.8366 80°, 0.8354
A combustion of the purified oil gave percentages of carbon and
hydrogen required for the series CnHan.
0.1539 grm. of the oil gave 0.4769 grm. CO2 and 0.2000 grm. H2O.
