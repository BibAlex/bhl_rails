we derive the equation of an (n — l)-spread S„_p which is ruled by the
system of (« — 2)-flats, F ^s*
Two consecutive i^„_2's intersect in an (« — 4)-flat, whose equations
are,
The elimination of the parameter from these equations gives a re-
stricted system equivalent to three independent equations. The locus is
an (n — 3)-spread ruled by the F„_iS. *S„_3 is a double spread on S„_i.
Three consecutive i^„_2's intersect in an (n — 6) -flat ^„_6, whose equa-
tions are,
If we eliminate the parameter from these equations we derive a
restricted system equivalent to five independent equations. The locus
is an (n — 5)-spread *S„_5, ruled by the i^„_6's. S,,_^ is a triple spread
on *S'„_j and a double sjjread on S„_s .
Similarly r consecutive i^„_2's intersect in an (n — 2 r)-flat i^„_2r5 whose
equations are,
On the elimination of the parameter we derive a restricted system equiv-
alent to 2 r — 1 independent equations. The locus is an (n — 2 r + 1)-
spread, *S„_2r + i> ruled by the i^„_2r's. S„_2r + i is an r-tuple spread on
S„_-^ ; it is a multiple spread on other spreads of the system.
Two distinct cases arise according as n is odd or even. If n is odd,
n — 1
then — - — consecutive i^„_2's intersect in a line, Fi, whose equations are,
* From now on we shall use 5^ to denote the A:-spread of this system.
