A DESCRIPTION OF EPIDOTE CRYSTALS FROM
ALASKA.
By Charles Palache.
Presented by John E. Wolff, January 8, 1902. Received February 7, 1902.
The epidote crystals described in this paper were sent to the Harvard
Mineralogical Laboratory for crystallographic study by Mr. W. C. Hart
of Manitou, Colorado, to whom we wish to express our thanks for the
generous supply of material placed at our disposal.
This material is from a new locality for the mineral and is remarkable
for the size and unusual habit of the crystals ; it therefore seemed well
worthy of description.
According to Mr. Hart the epidote is found at Sulzer, Prince of Wales
Island, Alaska. It is in the close vicinity of a body of copper ore and is
further associated with garnet, albite, magnetite, and quartz. The coun-
try rock of the region is limestone, which is cut by numerous igneous
dykes, and it seems probable that the deposit is the result of contact
metamorphism of the limestone by -the dyke rocks, resembling closely in
this respect the epidote occurrence with copper ore in the Seven Devils
Mts. in Idaho.*
The specimens at hand consist of several loose crystals and a mag-
nificent cluster of large crystals implanted on massive epidote. The oi^ly
associated mineral is quartz in small clear crystals of later formation
than the epidote.
The epidote is very dark green to greenish black in color, but oil-
green and translucent in thin crystals or where bruised or cracked. The
larger crystals are in the form of nearly square tables, which measure as
much as 5.5 cm. each way and 3 cm. in thickness. In the smaller crystals
the tabular habit is less pronounced and the mineral sometimes assumes
the ordinary prismatic habit parallel to the b axis. The crystals are not
