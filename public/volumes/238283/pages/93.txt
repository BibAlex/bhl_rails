we may eliminate the coordinates of P' leaving a single equation in
a, /3, . . . . y. For an (n — l)-flat to be tangent to an (w — l)-spread,
one relation between the coefficients that enter into their equations must
be satisfied. We conclude then that the (n — l)-fl.ats that touch n — 1
(« — l)-spreads envelop an *S'„_i.
Let us consider only those tangent (?i — l)-flat8 to an (n — 1)-
spread that touch it at the point of an (« — 2) -spread that lies on it.
Let U=0
be the equation of the (n — l)-spread and let
U= 0, F- 0, . . . ,
a restricted system equivalent to two independent equations, be the equa-
tions of the (n — 2)-spread on it. We derive now the equations
— la y
and U' = 0, V = 0, ...
If we eliminate the parameters from these equations there remains
a restricted system equivalent to two independent equations in the
coefficients a, /?,... y. For an (?2 — l)-flat to be tangent to an
(n — l)-spread at a point of an (n — 2)-spread on it requires two con-
ditions between the coefficients in the equation of the (n — l)-flat.
These two conditions may be used as part of the n — 1 conditions that
connect the coefficients of an (n — l)-flat that envelops a developable
'S'„_i. We have then the theorem that the (n — l)-flats that are tangent
to p (n — l)-spreads at the points of p (n — 2)-spreads that lie one on
each (n — l)-spread, and are tangent to a other (?z — l)'flats, where
n — l = 2p-fcr, envelop a developable.
In a similar manner for an (n — l)-flat to be tangent to an (n — 1)-
spread at a point of an (n — 3)-spread that lies on it imjjoses three con-
ditions on the coefficients that enter into the equation of the (ti — l)-flat.
To be tangent to the (n — l)-flat at a point of an (?i — 4) -flat on it
requires four conditions, etc. To be tangent to an (n — l)-spread at a
point of a curve that lies on it requires n — 1 conditions between the
coefficients, which is just sufficient to make the (« — l)-flat envelop a
developable.
We have then the general theorem that the (n — l)-flats that are
tangent to p {n — l)-spreads at points of p (n — ^)-spread3 that lie one
