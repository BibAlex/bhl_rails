The elimiuation of the parameter from these equations gives a re-
stricted system equivaleut to n — 1 iudepeudent equations, the equation
of aS'j whose order is n (m — n -\- 1).
We can find the equations of those exceptional points where n -\- I
consecutive i^„_i's intersect iu a point, if we eliminate the parameter from
the n -{- 1 equations

The result is a restricted system equivalent to « independent equa-
tions; it is of order (n + 1) [m — n), which is the number of such
points, cusps on Si- We may verify this result by forming the resultant
of these (« -f 1) equations. If we eliminate the variables from these
equations we have a determinant of order n -\- 1. If we expand this
result t enters to the degree (n + 1) (m — n) so that there are (n + 1)
(m — n) values of t that cause this resultant to vanish. These values of
t give the special points in question.*
Any double point on *^„_j must lie on two i^„_2's. We may find the
equations of the total double spread on »S'„_i, by expressing the conditions
that the equations of an i^„_2 regarded as equations in the parameter,
have two roots in common. These conditions are f

* For n = 3, these results agree with those of Salmon, Geometry of Three
Dimensions, p. 296. Neither the results there nor these hold when the system has
stationary (n — l)-flats.
