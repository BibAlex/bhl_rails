Next, as / {ii, V, w) can be supposed to be irreducible, we have a
relation of the form
9
L {u, V, w)f{u, V, w) + M{u, V, w) — [/(m, V, w)'\ = X 0', w)
= (v, w)a + (y, w)a+i + + (v, w)„ ^ 0. (j)
Now it is shown that the first member of equation (j) becomes divisible
by ^^•'"-Di'+i* after the substitutions (i), and the establishment of an
upper limit for the power of Cr which can then he taken out as a factor
of the function resulting from x (^» ^j? will secure a corresponding limit
for r, as is needed to finish the proof.
B. — Critique of Kobe's Analysis.
We now show in what respects Kobb's method and proof are at fault.
Some of these errors are noted in a memoir " Sulla riduzione delle singo-
larita puntuali delle superficie algebriche dello spazio ordinario per tras-
formazioiii quadratiche," by Beppo Levi.*
4. Kobb overlooks in his succession of transformations of type (g)
the occurrence of transformations which arise from 1, 3), c. These are
equivalent to
V =
\
^ ...
and here the number corresponding to yg' of (h) is zero; so that the
proof, even if correct in other respects, would fail to cover all the cases
involved.!
5. Without specific discussion of several unwarranted assumptions
of Kobb.t we show by an example the failure of his proof for the
upper limit of the exponent of the power of ^,. to be taken out as a
factor of X ('^i "') i^ (j) under the substitution (i). Let the given sur-
face be
f= )<2 — 2uw — v'-^ + 2inv + uvw — vw'^ — tiw' + w^ = 0. (k)
Here,
X (v, w) — - (4 + w"^) (w — vy.
