INTRODUCTION.
A. — Outline of Kobe's Treatment of the Problem.
The problem of the representation, by a finite number of parametric
formulae in two variables, of the neighborhood of a singular point of
an algebraic surface is considered and alleged to be solved in an article
" Sur la theorie des fonctions algebriques de deux variables," * by Gus-
tav Kobb. A brief outline of Kobb's method follows : —
L Treatment of the Original Singular Point. 1) Let the equation
of the surface be written in the form
where F is a function of the three independent variables x, y, z analytic
in the point x =^ a, y ^= b, x ^= c. The function F is transformed by
means of a change of axes to the form
* {^, V, = (i, V, 0,n + (.', V, 0,n+l + = (a)
where the expression (^, rj, ^)„ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree
??, the resulting surface (a) having the singular point considered at the
origin, while the function ($, r/, ^),„ is of a form convenient for later
treatment.
2) By the quadratic transformation
$ a, y,, = C" [(r, <T, !),„ + C (r, cr, l)^^, + ] "^
= C'[<f>(r,a)+Cx(r,cr)+ ] V (b)
