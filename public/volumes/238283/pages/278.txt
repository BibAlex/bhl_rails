These questions cannot be answered at present. The total amount of
work done in any case cannot be computed without a knowledge of the
compressibility of the substances involved throughout the total range of
volume, as has already been said. Unfortunately no suitable data exist

capable of satisfying the conditions of the problem. Before long I hope
to present such data, and to formulate answers to both questions ; for
the present the following unsatisfactory approximation is suggested as
being better than nothing.
From the study of many allied data I have been able to form an ap-
proximate evaluation of the compressibilities of sodium and chlorine.
