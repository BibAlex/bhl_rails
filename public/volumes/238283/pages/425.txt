On cooling the original distillate to —10°, it formed a thick pasty
mass. It was filtered under pressure, keeping cold. The filtered crys-
tals were pressed, and crystallized from ether and alcohol. Melting
point, 58°. The solids pressed out from the fractions from 288° to
302°, 50 mm., showed very slight variations in melting points.
288°-290°, 56°. 300°-304°, 59°-60°.
294°-296°, 58°. 302°-304°, 59°-60°.
The oil filtered under pressure was very thick and viscous. Its
specific gravity at 20° was 0.8688. A combustion gave the following
percentages of carbon and hydrogen : —
0.1500 grm. of the oil gave 0.4750 grm. COg and 0.1812 grm. U.O.
Calculated for C27H52. Found.
C 86.17 86.36
H 13.83 13.43
Its molecular weight at the boiling point of benzol corresponded to
the formula C27H52.
3.6506 grms. of the oil and 25.80 grms. benzol gave a rise of 0°.964.
Calculated for C27H5J. Found.
376 376.2
The index of refraction corresponded to the same formula.
The index was found to be 1.4722, and the molecular refraction: —
Calculated for C27H52. Found.
122 121.4
octocosane, c28ii58, and liquid hydrocarbon, c28h54.
From Distillate 310°-312°, 50 mm.
After the tenth distillation 75 grams collected at 310°-312°, from
which a considerable quantity of crystals collected above the oil on
standing. The oil separated from the crystals was then cooled to — 10°
and filtered cold under pressure. The solid was pressed and purified
by crystallization from ether and alcohol. Melting point 60°. Its
specific gravity was determined as follows : —
70°, 0.7945 80°, 0.7927 90°, 0.791 1'
