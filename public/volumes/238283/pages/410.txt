Combustion I. was made of the unpurified distillate dried over sodium ;
and combustion II., of the oil after treatment with fuming sulphuric
acid : —
I. 0.1440 grm. of the oil gave 0.4500 grm. CO2 and 0.1919 grm. HoO.
II. 0.1608 grm. of the purified oil gave 0.5002 grm. CO2 and 0.2198 grm.

In determining the boiling point of pentadecane under atmospheric
pressure, it distilled almost completely at 256°-257°.
A determination of the index of refraction gave 1.4413, from which
the molecular refraction was calculated : —

Dichlorpentadecane, C15H30CI2. — "With the small quantity of the hy-
drocarbon at hand, we did not succeed in limiting the action of chlorine
to the formation of the monochloride. Fractioned in vacuo under 13 mm.
the chlorinated product collected for the most part at 175°-180°. This
product gave as its specific gravity at 20°, 1.0045. A Carius determina-
tion for chlorine gave the following percentage : —

The heap that collected at 174°-175°, 50 mm., after the thirtieth
distillation gave as its specific gravity at 20°, 0.8000. After treatment
with concentrated sulphuric acid it gave 0.7964, and after treatment with
fuming sulphuric acid, 0.7911. It distilled almost completely at 275°-
