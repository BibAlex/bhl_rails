Introduction.
The following studies were made at Harvard University during the
fall and winter of 1898-99. The problem was proposed by Dr. C. B.
Davenport and the investigation carried on under his immediate direc-
tion. I wish here to acknowledge my indebtedness to his many sugges-
tions and helpful criticisms throughout the year. In connection with the
preparation of the manuscript for publication, I am under obligation to
Dr. E. L. Mark for many kindnesses.
The behavior of any organism toward artificial stimulation is prob-
ably always largely dependent on its normal environmental condi-
tions. The long action of those conditions, assisted, perhaps, by the
animal's own efforts, conscious or unconscious, to adapt itself to them,
finally results in certain habits and instincts. The process of adaptation
being extremely slow, organisms are strongly averse to great or sudden
changes in their environment and incapable of adjusting themselves to
them. As a rule, then, we should expect animals to seek those condi-
tions of light, heat, moisture, and other physical and chemical influences
which are most in accordance with those to which they are normally
subjected.
