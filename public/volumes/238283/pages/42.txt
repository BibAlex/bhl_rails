Ceratomyces procerus nov. sp.
Rather pale amber brown. Perithecium very elongate, of nearly
equal diameter throughout, the wall-cells in each row more than sixty
in number ; the conformation at the tip similar to that in G. confusus ;

Ceratomyces curvatus nov. sp.
Amber brown. Perithecium relatively large, inflated toward the base ;
the distal half up to the perithecial appendage of about equal diameter
throughout ; about forty cells, more or less, in each row of wall-cells ;
the configuration at the tip very similar to that in G. confusus^ the tip
itself more prominent, the apex more pointed ; the perithecial appen-
dage about nine-celled, the distal half pale, curved or recurved, broader
below, shorter and stouter. Receptacle much as in G. confusus, the basal

Ceratomyces Mexicanus nov. sp.
Dark amber brown. Perithecium with a slight submedian inflation ;
distally broad, the outer margin turning abruptly inward distally to the
inconspicuous retracted tip, which lies close at the base of the perithecial
