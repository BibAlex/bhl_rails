and the neighborhood of the original point is represented by the neigh-
borhood of the curve
<^(r, cr)=0, C=0, (c)
on the surface
^ (t, (T, = 0.
3) The neighborhood of the curve (c) is included in the domains of
a finite number of points which are
a. regular points of the curve (c), the domain of each being repre-
sented by a single jiower series
T=p(cr,0; (d)
h. critical points of the curve (c), the domain of each being repre-
sented by an equation of the form
^ + pi(cr, r^-^ + + ^^-l(cr, ^ + p^ (cr, 0=0; (e)
c. points at an infinite distance on the curve (c), the domain of each
being represented by an equation of form (d) or (e) in the variables

4) The selection of the points in 3) depends upon the character of
the curve
c^ (r, cr) = .
a. If is irreducible, all points of class 3) b are first taken, then all
points of class 3) c, these being regular; finally a finite nnmber of
points of class 3) a. Here, all the points selected, if singular, are of
order less than 7n.
/). If <^ is reducible, but contains no multiple factors, the same selec-
tion of points holds as in a, but there may occur a singular point of
order m.
c. If <^ contains multiple factors, all critical points of the curves cor-
responding to any factor, together with all points of intersection of two
different factors, are first taken, then all points of class 3) c, these being
possibly singular ; finally, a finite number of regular points of the several
curves corresponding to the different factors of <^, these last points being
possibly singular points of the surface. In this case, there may occur
a number of singular points of order m.
2. Treatment of Points Determined in 1. The same treatment as in
1 is apjilied to each of these points and to each of the corresponding
