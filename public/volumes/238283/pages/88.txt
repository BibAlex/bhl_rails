The present paper is a discussion of those loci in w-fold space that
can be generated by flats whose equations involve a single arbitrary-
parameter. The ruled loci of space of three dimensions can be repre-
sented in this way.
I. Loci DERIVED FROM AN (« — 1)-FLAT WHOSE EQUATION INVOLVES
A Single Arbitrary Parajieter; Developables.
1. Description of the derived loci.
Let us consider the loci derived from the equation
A = 0,
the equation of an (n — l)-flat involving a single arbitrary parameter A..
If the parameter enters rationally, we suppose it to enter to as high a
degree as ?i, the number of ways of the space. If the parameter enters
rationally to the degree m where m < w, the locus is of a special kind to
be discussed later. As the parameter varies continuously we have a
1-fold infinite system of (?^ — 1) -flats.
Two consecutive (n — l)-flats of the system intersect in an {ii — 2)-flat
whose equations are
^ = 0, |i = o.
If from these equations we eliminate the parameter there remains a
single equation of an {n — l)-spread, S,^_^^ which is ruled by the 1-fold
infinite system of (n — 2)-flats.
Three consecutive (n — l)-flats of the system intersect in an (ii — 3)-
flat whose equations are
