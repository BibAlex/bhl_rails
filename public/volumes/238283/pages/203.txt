tion $ = 0, and thus represents the latter equation within the corre-
sponding limits, i. e., when
or
K|<S, hil<e, ^J<c,
\i-aJ\<e\C\, h-^CKcUl, \t\<S.
Next we consider points for which ^ = 0, but i, -q are not both zero.
For these we use the transformation
^ = l>?, K=Crj. (8)
Then, by the same method of treatment as above, putting t, for "rj and
7} for ^, and taking 13 = 0, we derive a set of surfaces
ffA^r^V,t) = 0, T=l, 2, t<m,
on which are mapped all points of the original neighborhood for which
hl<8„ _^
< ei,
and so all points for which
hi < Si, K! <h\v\, \^-%v\ <h\v\'
Here, we have a function corresponding to (f, >;) :
Now, for the infinite roots of
we put the equation into the form
(i,a)
-, 1, ^ ) - 0.
\ rj
So the equation
«^(l, =
is such that its roots for | = are the same as the ratios of the infinite
roots of the equation
and by 3, 3) these ratios are all finite.
