the weighings were actually made to the hundreths of a milligram the
final corrected data are rounded off to the nearest tenth of a milligram,
since the deviations of the results show that the hundredths could have
had no significance.
The extreme difference between the highest and the lowest values in
the preliminary series is 0.33 unit, in the second series 0.09 unit, and in
the third series 0.14 unit. At first sight these variations seem large, but
their relative magnitude appears smaller when the great molecular weight
of uranous bromide, 558.34, is taken into consideration. Thus the
extreme percentage error of the preliminary series is 0.06, while those
of the last two series are only 0.016 and 0.024 per cent respectively.
