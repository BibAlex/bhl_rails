and all such points, a finite number in all, will be treated like the
critical points of the previous case. But also any point on a multiple
factor is a critical point of the curve, and further treatment is needed
for such points.
Suppose f = a, r? = yS is a regular point of a factor <^i ($, r/) of mul-
tiplicity r, i. e. of the irreducible factor whose rth power is equal to
</>i(^) v) ^"^ "°t a point of any different factor of (ji($, -q). Then, in
the corresponding equation of form (7), g^ will contain a term ^'^ as the
lowest term in ^"^ free from rji and ^, and by Weierstrass's Theorem *
we can develop the function about the point in the form
C + P^ (vi^ 0C+ + Pr (vi, Ol ^(C' vu = 0. (9)
These functions
P;,(vi, 0' X= 1, 2, r,
are shown by a method similar to that used for the functions in Case I
to be analytic within a region
\vi\<h-e, U|<8i,
where h is the distance to the nearest value of rji which gives a point
of intersection of two different irreducible curves corresponding to factors
of cf) Q, rj), or to a critical point of one of the irreducible curves.
Now none of the excepted points can be at infinity, on account of the
provision in 3, 3). So the points on the surfaces g = in 5 will also
afford developments of order (9), and by the method of Case I, we
have a similar region for the convergence of the coefficients of the
different powers of $ in the polynomial, i. e. the exterior of a circle
including all of the excepted points.
Accordingly, in this case also, we represent the neighborhood of the
original singular point by a finite number of neighborhoods of new
singular points together with a finite number of functions, some of which
are now not analytic for the values of the arguments considered, but
satisfy equations of the form
For the further treatment of these functions, we shall establish an
auxiliary theorem in § 2.
