This is the general equation connecting fugacity and surface tension at
constant temperature and pressure. If t is variable we may dififereutiate,
^„ and s being constant, obtaining
dE Tlinl; = sdt,
or expressing the constancy of T and P,
This equation completely confirms the validity of equation (19) as
applied to surface energy and corresponds to equations (20) and (21).
An important form of energy which we have not yet discussed is
electrical energy, whose dimensions are potential, and quantity of elec-
tricity. If these be represented by tt and e, respectively, in any case
where the fugacity is influenced by the electrical potential, we should
have the equation,
There are in fact a number of cases in which the potential may be
shown to have an effect upon the escaping tendency, the most important
being that in which the potential influences the fugacity of the ions. The
following equation has been amply proved experimentally, and thermo-
dynamically is shown to be rigorously exact on the assumption that the
ions form an ideal solution.
in which tt is the potential at which equilibrium is established between
an electrode and its ions at the osmotic pressure 11, if e is the charge of
one gram-ion and ^is at constant temperature and pressure a character-
istic constant of the electrode. In other words, 11 is the osmotic pressure
of the ions which will be in equilibrium with the electrode when the
