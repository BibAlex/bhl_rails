Halodictjon mirabile Zan. Washed ashore, St. Ann's Bay, March 30,
1893, H.
Spermothamnion Gorgoneum (Mont.) Bornet. On Codium tomento-
sum, Port Antonio, Aug., 1894; Kingston, July, 1900, P. & B. Port
Antonio, Feb. 27, 1893, No. 175 a, H. P. B.-A., No. 441.
" Both cystocarps and polyspores have been found in Jamaica speci-
mens ; in the former the spores have thick cell walls and are arranged
as in Spermothamnion ; the involucre is only slightly developed. The
polyspores are quite numerous, in an ovate or subspherical mass, occu-
pying not more than half the diameter of the large, hyaline sporangium."
Note from label of P. B.-A., No. 441.
S. Turneri var. variabile J. Ag. On Bryothamnion Seaforthii, Kings-
ton, July, 1900, P. & B.
Callithamnion byssoideum var. Jamaicensis Collins. In dense
tufts on rocks, Port Antonio, Feb. 27, No. 170, H. P. B.-A., No. 443.
" This plant has the divided cystocarps, with conical lobes, characteris-
tic of C. byssoideum ; antheridia and tetraspores also agree ; but the
habit is strikingly different, everything being condensed, the branches
relatively shorter and stouter, and very densely set, the terminal ramuli
often arranged more like C. corymbosum. It may possibly be the same
as C. Hypneae Crouan in Maze & Schramm, Algues de Guadeloupe ;
the name must be considered as provisional, awaiting comparison with
authentic specimens of the latter." Note from the label of P. B.-A.,
No. 443.
C. corymbosum (Eng. Bot.) Lyng. On Codium tomentosum, Port
Antonio, Aug., 1894, P. & B.
Haloplegma Duperryi Mont. Washed ashore, Morant Bay, Annotto
Bay, Orange Bay, 1894; Kingston, July, 1900, P. & B. Only a few
fragments at each place.
Crouania attenuata (Bonnem.) J. Ag. On Cryptonemia crenulata,
Morant Bay, July, 1894, P. & B. In small tufts, Navy Island, March
10, 1893, H.
Antithamnion Butleriae n. sp. Fronds erect, ecorticate, simple or
with a few branches, which may be dichotomous, alternate, or occasion-
ally opposite, diameter near base about 30^, cells 3-6 diameters, walls
tliick. The lower portion of the frond or branch is naked ; above that
each cell bears normally a pair of ramuli, issuing at about two-thirds the
height of the cell ; the lowest ramuli are simple, subulate, of from two to
six cells about as long as broad; sometimes by the suppression of a
ramulus the branching is apparently alternate ; fiirther up the frond these
