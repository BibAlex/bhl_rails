A PRELIMINARY ENUMERATION OF THE
SOROPHORE^.
By Edgar W. Olive.
Presented by Roland Thaxter. Received November 9, 1901.
Owing to unavoidable delay in the publication of a monograph of the
Acrasie^ and their allies which the writer has in preparation and for
which figures have already been drawn, the following preliminary
synopsis, which includes all the known forms and which will be sup-
plemented as soon as possible by the more extended paper, has seemed
advisable. This investigation was undertaken some years since at the
suggestion of Professor Thaxter, and a majority of those species that I
have myself studied have been kept under observation in pure cultures
for a long period, so that the constancy of the characters distinguishing
them has been definitely determined. As far as I am aware only one
member of the group has been heretofore reported from America,
although certain of them are very abundant in laboratory cultures. Of
the European representatives several remain unknown except through
the original diagnoses, which are unfortunately, in a majority of cases,
meagre and unaccompanied by figures.
A comparison of the conditions presented by the individuals which
constitute the so-called fructifications of these organisms indicates that
the term spore cannot be properly applied to them in all cases. In the
genera Sappinia and Guttulinopsis the individuals, even in mature
fructifications, are merely slightly contracted and hardened, secreting no
definite wall. At germination such resting individuals, therefore, gradu-
ally assume the form of a vegetative amoeba without casting off a spore
wall of any kind. In order to distinguish these bodies from true spores,
such as occur in a majority of the genera, as well as from the transi-
tory resting conditions of isolated vegetating amcebte which were first
characterized as " microcysts " by Cienkowsky, the term pseudospore is
