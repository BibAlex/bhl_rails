PROCEEDINGS OP THE AMERICAN ACADEMY.
Nine such duplicate experiments were made. The first of these was
a crude trial, and need not be recorded ; the eight others are given iu
the following table.
The apparatus employed was precisely like that described in the pre-
vious paper. For the sake of easy reference, the description is repeated
below.
Small cylinders of Pukal's porous ware (Berlin), suitable for osmotic
pressure experiments, were used to enclose the anode in order to prevent
the heavy anode-solution from reaching the kathode. These vessels
were 50 millimeters high and
— J A ^ 20 in diameter ; their walls
were not much over one milli-
meter in thickness. Their
impurities were removed by
boiling with nitric acid and
thorough washing with water.
Before being used they should
be carefully searched and
tested for cracks or imperfec-
tions. They were suspended
in the solution by means of a
platinum wire hung upon *a
glass hook, which insulated
the wire from the electric
connections. By means of a
siphon, or a small pipette
with a rubber top, the liquid
within the cup was always
kept at a lower level than
that without, so as to prevent
outward filtration.
The kathodes consisted of
large crucibles weighing only
GO grams, although they were
capable of holding 120 cubic
centimeters ; they were pro-
vided with lips. A crucible
exposes a smaller surface of
liquid to the impurities of the atmosphere, and gave in our expeiuments
a more evenly distributed deposit than a bowl.
