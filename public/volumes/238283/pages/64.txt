had been constructed for the purpose of securing uniform temperature
for the standard clock of the physical laboratory, and other similar
apparatus. The range of temperature in this room fluctuated through-
out the entire investigation be-
tween 18°C. and 19°C. The
ranofe was so small and the
variations occurred so gradu-
ally that no changes of electro-
motive force of a size which
it was necessary to consider in
these measurements could have
arisen other than those included
in the usual correction for
temperature.
The two cells were compared
with each other from time to
time by setting them in opposi-
tion to one another in circuit
with a sensitive galvanometer
and noting the deflection pro-
duced. It was found that
although one of them was sup-
plying current to the 100,000
ohm circuit of the potentiome-
ter, during the times when it
was necessary to close the key
of that circuit, the difference
of electromotive force between
the used and unused cell was
always very small, never more
than a few hundred thousandths
of a volt. At the end of the
entire set of measurements, the
difference was 0.00006 volts.
The absolute electromotive
force of these cells was checked by comparison with Clark cells of the
H form and of the test-tube form, constructed in this department in 1S98.
As a result of these comparisons it was found that the electromotive
force of the cell used in the potentiometer might be taken at 1.430 volts
at 18.°
