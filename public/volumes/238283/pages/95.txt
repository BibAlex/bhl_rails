In general « + 1 consecutive F„_j's do not have any common inter-
section, for the w + 1 equations,
9A ^ d^A ^
have no common solutions. If we regard these equations as homo-
geneous in the w + 1 coordinates we may form their resultant, and the
values of the parameter that cause this determinant to vanish, give
special points where w + 1 consecutive F^-^s, intersect. These points
are cusps on the curve ^i.
Reciprocally there will, in general, be a finite number of i^„_i's that go
through w + 1 consecutive points of *S'i.
Veronese has shown that a curve in w-fold space has 3 n singularities
which are connected by 3 (w — 1) relations, an extension of the Pluecker-
Cayleyan characteristics of a twisted curve in tliree-fold space.*
In this we have assumed that the variables that enter into the equation
of the enveloping {n — l)-flat cannot be expressed in terms of fewer
than w + 1 independent linear functions of the variables alone. If they
could be expressed in terms of v such linear functions, where v < «, the
developable *S„_i is a conoid with an {n — v)-way head, a case to be con-
sidered later.
The developable S^ of the series is ruled by {k — l)-flats, F^_^^. The
S^, where 2 < ^ < n — 1 can be given by means of its enveloping F^
whose equations involve a single parameter. The n — k equations of the
i^4 must however be of the form
9A S"-*-M
as we have previously seen. Even the S^ may be represented in this
manner.
Any (n - l)-flat ^ =
cuts the S^_^ in a developable (n — 2)-spread, for it cuts the system of
F„_^s, in a system of (n — 2)-flats that intersect consecutively in {n — 3)-
flats. We may see this in another way. By means of this new equa-
tion we can eliminate one variable from the equation of the enveloping
(n _ l)-flat. The resulting equation in n variables may evidently be
considered as the envelope of an {n — 2)-spread in a new (n — l)-fold
space. The {n — l)-flat cuts any S^ of the system in a (^ — l)-way
