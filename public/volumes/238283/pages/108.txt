If we eliminate the parameter from these equations we derive a
restricted system equivalent to n — 2 independent equations. The locus
is a surface /S'g ruled bj the -Fi's ; it is an ( — - — J-tuple surface on S^^.^.

have not in general any common solutions. If we regard these m + 1
equations as homogeneous in the n -\- \ coordinates and form their result-
ant, the values of the parameter that cause it to vanish will give points
where consecutive lines meet. The equations of these points may be
formed by eliminating the parameter from the n + 1 equations, which
gives a restricted system equivalent to n independent equations. These
points are double points on ^'2 and f — - — | -tuple points on S„_x.
