" Avrainvillea longicaulis at Montego Bay grew imbedded in mud
among eel-grass in shallow water, near a small island consisting of man-
grove swamp. It was discovered by the sense of feeling as we were
dredging in the mud among the eel-grass roots for Caulerpa. We were
continually feeling through the thick soles of our rubber boots a sensa-
tion as of stepping on drowned kittens. It proved to be the curious
fleshy fronds of Avrainvillea, somewhat resembling a downy, dirty,
swollen XJdotea, often full of worms and other small animals. Avrain-
villea grew also at Manchioneal, in an enclosed salt water pool, in eel-
grass with Penicillus dumetosus, rooted in a clean bottom of powdered
shells and coral ; but on the rocks bordering the pool was another species,
A. nigricans, with short stems, and tops not so flabellate, resembling in
shape our stemmed pufF-balls."

tridens. In any considerable collection typical forms of each and a
series of intermediate forms are to be found.
