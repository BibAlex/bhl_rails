both instances (Nos. 1 and 2) the animals were rather dry, and they
were not noticeably different in this respect after being well fed. No. 2
was less active and less precise in response after it had had plenty of
food. I think these experiments too few to warrant laying much stress
upon them, but I have given them here because they at least point in the
direction of what we might reasonably expect, since the natural desire of
the animal to escape from its narrow prison and the impulse to seek
food would both tend to make it go up, if given the opportunity.
Another element which may alter the slug's inherent geotaxis is
probably the state of fear. This element may be combined with the
impulse to seek food, as is perhaps the case in the instances just given, or
it may operate by itself. Animals which had just been captured were al-
ways kept in a small tin box. The captured animals would thrust them-
selves between the box and lid, which was not perfectly tight, in their
endeavors to escape, and they had to be frequently pushed back. When
they were transferred to the large box mentioned at page 187, it was
always found that they had all collected in the upper part of the smaller
box. This may have been solely for the purpose of getting air, but such
animals put on a glass plate were exceedingly active and restless^ and
usually exhibited a decided negative geotaxis. I have not made any care-
ful set of experiments to find out whether these negatively geotactic
animals afterwards became positive. In one instance, I confined over
night in a small flower-jar a slug (not a freshly captured one) which had
shown a very decided positive geotaxis. In the morning it was found at
the top of the jar, and, when placed on a glass plate, showed great activ-
ity, as though it sought to escape. In every one of the tests which I
then made, it responded negatively. From these few observations, it
