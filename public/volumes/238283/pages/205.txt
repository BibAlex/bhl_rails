296 PROCEEDINGS OP THE AMERICAN ACADEMY.
can have multiple values of | only for a finite number of values of ^,
these being the values for which the equations
91
have common roots, and by the condition 3, 3) none of these values of
yj become infinite.
Now we consider all such values of r;
'^ = Cr, r = 1, 2, ly
for which the equation, considered as an equation in |^
has multiple roots. Deal with each of these as in 5, c^ taking the place
of yS in (6) ; then, in equation (7), some of the ju 's will, in general, be
greater than unity, i. e. some of the equations ^ = will have for the
lowest terms in ^ alone exponents greater than 1. For such as have
their /x =1, there are regular points. The others will afford singular
points unless they have terms of the first degree in either rji or t,.
Surround these points by neighborhoods
|^J<S, hil<8, \^\<h,
i. e.
|?-aj<5, i:^_c,|<8, ia<8»
which are to be considered later.
Now let »; = i be any value for which the equation
has not equal roots. Then the equations ^^ = of (7) each have a term
in ^ to the first degree, free from rji and t,, and thus the points of the
surface g = lying in the neighborhood of the point ^^ = 0, rji = 0,
^ = 0, can be represented by a power series
So, in this case, we have m developments
^^ = P^{m,0^ o-=l, 2, m,
and, by using the relations (4), we have
i = Pa(v,0^ 0-= 1, 2, m.
It is readily seen that the function
i = pivuO
