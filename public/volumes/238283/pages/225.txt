while all later transformations can be taken of the type
i^ = in+lC, Vf^ = •7^+1 C (43)
After V transformations of type (40), since there can be no interchange
of terms among the coefficients of the different powers of the $ variables
in the A' factor of (37), the surface will take the form
[C + P-2AV^, 'C)C' + + Pm^^^^^ 0] ^(t., v., = 0. (44)
Now by the same reasoning as used for the function H in § 3, 5, if v is
taken large enough, the coefficients of the powers of $t, in A^ will all be
of the type
s = 2, 3, m.
For any one of the functions
>7,. + v(0
there is a determinate succession of transformations of type
which will leave it of the same degree after the I is divided out, all
others reducing the degree at once , i. e., if
» 1?^ + >' (0 = ■^M + Cll ^ + ^^2 r + >
we must take
etc.
So, unless the factors
■rii' + V, (0, s = 2, 3, m
are all equal, Ave must have finally some coefficient of a power of ^^ with
the •>7„ present only in the E factor, and by taking v large enough we
come to a point where all the factors
f]^ + v,(0> s == 2, 3, . . . . . m,
are equal, some of them possibly having zero exponents.
Tlieu we use the transformation
-qv + Vs (0 = Vy (45)
