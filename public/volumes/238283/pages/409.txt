Monochlortetradecane, C14H29CI. — Since only small quantities of the
purified hydrocarbons were available for the study of the chlorides, great
care was necessary to avoid too high chlorination. Most of the hydro-
carbons gave only sufficient of the chlorine derivative to verify its formula
by the percentage of chlorine. The chlorine product obtained from
tetradecane was fractioned in vacuo until it collected in larger quantities
at 150°-153° under 20 mm. A determination of chlorine gave the
following result : —
0.1966 grm. of the oil gave 0.1245 grm. AgCl.
Calculated for C14H29CI. Found.
CI 15.25 15.65
Its specific gravity at 20° was found to be 0.9185. The quantity of
product was not enough for other determinations. Another portion of
the chlorine product collected at 175°-180°, 17 mm., wliich gave as its
specific gravity at 20°, 1.032. A determination of chlorine gave the value
required for the dichloride : —
0.1937 grm. of the oil gave 0.2125 grm. AgCl.
Calculated for Ci^HogClj. Found.
CI 26.55 27.12
A determination of molecular weight at the freezing point of benzol
confirmed the dichloride : —
1.3407 grm. of the oil and 19.81 grms. benzol gave a depression of 1°. 255.
Calculated for C14H28CIJ. Found.

PeNTADECANE, C15H32.
The specific gravity of the fraction 158°-159° (50 mm.) dried over
sodium was found to be 0.8054 at 20°. After treatment with concen-
trated sulphuric acid it gave 0.7939, and after thorough treatment with
fuming'sulphuric acid it gave 0.7896.
The molecular weight was determined by the Beckman method : —
I. 1.050 grm. of the oil and 35.9775 grms. benzol gave a depression
of 0°. 675.
II. 1.3946 grm. of the oil and 23.2679 grms. benzol gave a depression
of 1°.37.
Calculated for Found.
