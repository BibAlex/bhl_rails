ordinates. If these curves could be extended to the Hue representing zero
cross-section, the temperatures indicated by the points in which each of
them cuts that line would give the temperature of the portion of the
flame to which the curve corresponds. There is a considerable element
of uncertainty in extrapolation even over so short a range as this : but it
is obvious from the character of the curves lying within the limits of
observation, that each of them trends upward, and it seems highly prob-
able that they all meet the line of zero cross-section at a temperature not
far from 1900°. The fact that the curves cut this line at nearly the
same temperature would seem to indicate that the distribution of tempera-
tures from the centre of the flame outward for a distance of about 1 mm.
is a nearly uniform one.
It would perhaps be unwise to attempt to draw any more definite con-
clusion from the probable trend of these curves; but I have ventured to
extend them in the manner shown in the figure, so that the curve for the
region 1 mm. from the centre of the flame reaches the zero of abscissae
about, twenty degrees above that for the centre of the flame, i. e. at 1920°,
and. the intermediate curves at temperatures lying between them. I
regard this as an extreme treatment of the case, and allude to it only to
indicate that, in accordance with common belief, the highest temperature
