Since we are dealing with infinitely dilute solutions in the same solvent,
t/^i = p III and \p. = p Ha, therefore

This is the desired equation connecting temperature and escaping
tendency. Its form can be simplified by a slight rearrangement.

Leaving in this form for the present the equation connecting tempera-
ture and fugacity at constant pressure, let us determine the influence of
pressure on the fugacity at constant temperature. I have already dis-
cussed this question in a previous paper,* but instead of using the
general equation there derived it has seemed preferable to base all
the reasoning of this paper directly upon the four laws stated in the
introduction.
Let us consider any simple substance and a solvent, so arranged f
that the pressure upon the substance in question may be altered without
* Loc. cit.
t Several such arrangements are described in the paper just mentioned.
