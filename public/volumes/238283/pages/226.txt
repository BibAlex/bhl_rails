and arrive at the form (42) required. Now any further transformation
of type (40) in which the 8 is not zero will leave the rj variable present
only in the E factors, so that the general term (after the first) of the
function Xv is of type
r^^(^".,OC~*' ^--=2,3, m.
Suppose, after this, there are p transformations of type (40). Then the
corresponding term after the factor ^™'* has been divided out is
and if this is of degree not less than m, as it must be if we are not to
secure reduction, we have
m — s -\- q^ — ps > m
or p S J
~ s
thus securing an upper limit for the number of transformations of type
(40) which do not give reduction of singularity. Accordingly, after the
form (42) is reached, it is only when all later 8's are zero that we are
not sure of reduction.*
5. A sufficient number of transformations of type (43) applied to (42)
secures either
1) reduction of singularity, or
2) the condition that for some term (the rth) of the X factor
s = 2, 3, m.
If, for any term
a transformation of type (43), after the factor C™ has been divided out,
yields
decreasing the exponent of ^ by r — p^. This decrease takes place at
every such transformation, and thus the exponent of ^ must finally be
* We do not lieed to consider the possibility of liaving all the coeflBcients of the
powers of |^ lower than the m-th vanish, for then the function X^ would have
m equal factors 1^ and this case has been excluded.
