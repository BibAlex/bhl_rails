it is probably among the most compressible of metals.

When the more obvious experimental errors have been considered,
two important questions at once suggest themselves : Does this propor-
tionality signify equality, or is some of the energy of compression stored
as potential energy and not manifested as heat ? Again, if this equality
exists, is it always exact, or is it modified by subordinate secondary
effects ?
* Tliese values are calculated from very accurate determinations of specific
gravity made recently in this Laboratory. See These Proceedings, 31, 168
(1895).
