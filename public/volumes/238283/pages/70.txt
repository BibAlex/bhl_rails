upon a smooth curve {g) as shown in Figure 14. This curve, when ex-
tended to the line corresponding to zero cross-section, gave for the tem-
perature of the flame 1780", a temperature sufficient to account for the
success of Smithells's experiment, already described, in which platinum
wires of small diameter were melted in the outer sheath of such a flame.
I found it easy, by holding a wire of the size used in junction IV. in a
plane parallel to that of the flame, and moving it gradually toward the
latter to verify his statement. The wire was readily melted.
It was not thought necessary to make further experiments upon this
flame. The region selected was, so far as one could judge from the
brightness of the luminous sheath, the hottest portion of flame. My
measurements upon this region would lead to the conclusion that the
luminous sheath of ordinary gas flames is at least one hundred and twenty
degrees lower than the corresponding region in the acetylene flame.
Luminous flames of ordinary illuminating gas would perhaps repay
further study, but owing to the fact that such gas is an ever varying
mixture and that it is burned under conditions of pressure, etc., such as
to give a fluctuating character to the flame, the problem would have at
