RICHARDS AND HEIMROD. — THE IMPROVED VOLTAMETER. 441
and Patterson and Guthe have attracted most attention. Since the first
three investigations used a voltameter of the original Lord llayleigh
type, a correction of —0.05 per cent should be applied to each. More-
over, Kohlrausch and Kahle did not heat their deposits to redness ;
hence an additional reduction of about 0.016 per cent* is necessary.
Finally, Kohlrausch deposited the silver on a silver kathode, while
Lord Rayleigh and Kahle made tlieir determinations with platinum
kathodes — a correction which leads to a further reduction of .01 per
cent for Kohlrausch's value, or 0.076 in all. Patterson and Guthe, on
the other hand, deposited the silver on platinum, but used old solutions
saturated with silver oxide. Such solutions may have yielded about
0.135 more silver than the standard. When the correction for heating
is added to this the total reduction becomes 0.15 per cent. Thus we are
led to the following table : —
TABLE XVL
The Corrected Electrochemical Equivalent of Silver.
(1) Lord Rayleigh and Mrs. Sidgwick,t 0.0011179 -0.050% 0.0011173
(2) Fr. «fe W. Kohlrausch,! 0.001 1183 -0.07G 0.0011175
(3) Kahle,§ 0.0011183 -0.066 0.0011176
(4) Patterson & Guthe, II 0.0011192-0.150 0.0011175
Average 0.0011175
The greatest deviation from this average is 0.02 per cent, a remark-
able agreement considering the variety of physical method used by the
experimenters. Lord Rayleigh and Kahle used an electro-dynamometer
and Kohlrausch an accurate tangent galvanometer for the calculation of
the current, while Patterson and Guthe made themselves entirely free
from the acceleration of gravity or the strength of the magnetic field by
means of an absolute electro-dynamometer. Hence for the present the
great bulk of evidence seems to favor the value 0.0011175, the mean of
four entirely independent determinations, as the true electrochemical
equivalent of silver. Our data also give the electrochemical equivalent
of copper in the cupric condition as 0.00032929 gram per ampere per
second.
The number of coulombs attached to one gram equivalent of any
electrolyte is therefore 96,580.
