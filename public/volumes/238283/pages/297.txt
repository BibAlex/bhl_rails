In an atmo.sphere of nitrogen an excess of .05 per cent in the deposit
was observed. Our own experiments in the same direction verify the
results of these experiments, and need not be recorded here.
Putting aside for the moment the question concerning the nature of
the irregular compound which can thus be partly oxidized out of exist-
ence, it seemed worth while to discover if an oxidizing asrent in the
solution could remove this compound to such an extent as to cause the
filter paper voltameter to yield accurate results. The only practical
oxidizer for this purpose is hydrogen peroxide. A fairly strong solution
was prepared from pure crystalline barium peroxide and dilute sulphuric
acid. The excess of acid was removed with barium hydroxide, and the
solution was filtered. In this solution the usual amount of silver nitrate
was dissolved, and this was used in the large bowl as well as in the lipped
crucible, both anodes being wrapped in filter paper. In the large bowl
black crystals of argentic peroxide, or AgyNOu, were soon formed
which bridged across to the kathode. While the result in the bowl thus
became useless, the crucible showed no such disturbance, but yielded
nevertheless a deficit of .14 per cent on comparison with a standard.
This must have been due to a side reaction, especially since the kathode
was found covered with small gas bubbles, which were probably oxygen.
It is possible that negative electricity was carried from the kathode to
the solution by the ionizing of a trace of oxygen. Better results were
obtained after the hydrogen peroxide had been diluted to one-tenth its
former strength ; these are recorded below: â€”

The usual difference of from .04 to .08 per cent is thus reduced to
.025 per cent ; therefore hydrogen peroxide seems to eliminate a part
