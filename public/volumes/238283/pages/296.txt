The only difiference is now in the opposite direction ; and this was due
to known experimental error. In experiment 27 a small loss of silver
particles in the wash-water from the silver cell produced the difference of
0.009 per cent. It is highly probable that but for this accident, the deposit
on silver would have been equal to that on platinum, as it is in No. 28.
These results permit us to draw two conclusions. First, it is not the greater
inclusion of silver salt in the crystals which increases the total weight
when the kathode is silver. Otherwise 27 and 28 should have grown
heavier in the same ratio. Secondly, it is the anode solution again
which is responsible.
The increase in the deposit on a silver surface indicates the existence of
silver in the solution in a supersaturated state ; and this existence shows
that there must be present some complex gradually dissociating, with
metallic silver as one of its products. If this is the case, we should ex-
pect to find that an oxidizing environment would be capable of removing
this cause of inaccuracy, while substituting another easily removed by
nitric acid. As a matter of fact, Schuster and Crossly * have shown
that deposits made in vacuo are heavier than when made in air ; again
those made in an atmosphere of air are heavier than when made in oxy-
gen. Of course it is understood that in all three cases the anode was
only wrapped in filter paper. The solution usually contained fifteen
per cent of silver nitrate, but sometimes as much as thirty per cent.
They used the solution over and over again, thereby accumulating the
irregular compounds. Under reduced pressure (about " 1 ^ inch "), the
deposits exceeded those made in air by about 0.04 per cent, while the lat-
ter exceeded those in oxygen by 0.04 per cent more. Myers, f who re-
peated these experiments, found the difference between deposits in air
and in vacuo to be as much as 0.10 per cent for 20-40 percent solutions.
