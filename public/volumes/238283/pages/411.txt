276° uuder 760 mm., barometric pressure. In determining the molecu-
lar weight of this fraction at the freezing point of benzol, it gave the
formula C16H34 : —
I. 1.1507 grm. of the oil and 35.27 grms. benzol gave a depression
of 0°71.
II. 1.1833 grm. of the oil and 35.63 grms. benzol gave a depression
of 0.715.

Determinations of carbon and hydrogen were made in the unpurified
distillate (I.), in a portion purified with concentrated suljjhuric acid (II.),
and in a third portion purified with fuming sulphuric acid (III.), vvith the
following results : —
I. 0.1477 grm. of the oil gave 0.4600 grm. CO. and 0.1973 grm. HgO.
II. 0.1454 grm. of the oil gave 0.4522 grm. CO. and 0.1986 grm. H.O.
III. 0.1454 grm. of the oil gave 0.4516 grm. CO., and 0.1971 grm. H2O.

Dichlorhexadecane, C16H33CI2. — The chlorine product obtained from
hexadecane collected for the larger part at 205°-210°, under 16 mm.
Its specific gravity was 1.0314 at 20'\ A determination of chlorine
gave a value required for the dichloride : —
0.1477 grm. of the oil gave 0.1525 grm. AgCl.
Calculated for CicHjjClj. Found.
CI 24.61 24.44
This formula was also confirmed by its molecular weight : —
0. 5019 grm. of the oil and 18.21 grms. benzol gave a depression of 0°.457.
Calculated for CigHsjClj. Found.
