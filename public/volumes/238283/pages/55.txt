changing the pressure on the solvent and without preventing the sub-
stance from passing freely into or out of the solvent. The osmotic •
pressure of the saturated solution depends upon the pressure on the
substance. If the latter is represented by P and the former by 11, then
for P + d P the osmotic pressure will be 11 + </ 11. We may moreover
represent the molecular volume of the substance by v at pressure P,
by V — dv aX pressui'e P -\- d P ; the molecular volume in the solution
by v' at osmotic pressure H, hy v' — d v' Sit H ■\- d 11. If a gram-mole-
cule of the substance at pressure Pis (1) dissolved against the osmotic
pressure 11, (2) its solution concentrated to 11 -f c? TI, (3) removed from
solution against the pressure P -{■ d P and (4) allowed to expand from
P + d P to P, a,u isothermal cycle is formed, and if each step is made
reversible the total work of the cycle is zero. The work obtained in the
several steps may be represented by Wi, JV^, etc.

This is an exact general equation connecting the osmotic pressure of a
saturated solution and the pressure upon the pure solute. It is entirely
analogous to equation (6). Since we may choose a solvent in which the
solute is as slightly soluble as desired we will choose one in which the
solution may be regarded as infinitely dilute. Then,

From equation (8), if/ = pU. Therefore In i/^ = In IT + In p, and
