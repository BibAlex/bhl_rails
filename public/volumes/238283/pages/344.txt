mature fruit uo difference is apparent between plants from Christiania,
Norway, and Aroostook Co., Maine.
The sheath, said by Professor Bailey to be " less conspicuous " in the
American plant, is 4 cm. long, by 2.7 mm. wide in one of Macrae's
Montreal specimens, fully as conspicuous as in the best developed
European material. There is, then, no reason why the American Carex
saltuensis, Bailey (C. altocaulis, Britten) with no constant vegetative or
morphological character and with a broad range from northern Labrador
to the Mackenzie River, northern New England, New York, the Great
Lakes and the upper Rocky Mts., should be treated as distinct from C.
vaginala of Greenland, northern Europe and Asia.
Carex capillaris.
C. capillaris, L. Sp. 977. The Linnaean plant was the low plant
of the Scandinavian mountains, described as a span high. This plant,
well represented in the Gray Herbarium by European specimens from
Andersson, Holmgren, Hoppe, Lehmann, Tuckerman, and others, varies
in height from 3 to 25 cm., the spikelets being subapproximate or
scarcely remote, the lower at most 2 cm. apart. This dwarf plant
occurs likewise in Greenland and northeastern Asia. It has been ex-
amined from the following regions in America — Labrador, Dead
Islands (J. A. Allen) : Newfoundland, without locality (La Pylaie) ;
Middle Arm, Bay of Islands {A. C. Waghome) : Quebec, dry stony
ground, near summit — 1,150 m. — Mt. Albert (J. A. Allen): Maine,
