animal's main food. The cannibalistic tendencies of the slug, together
with an unavoidable deterioration due to repeated handling, necessitated
a frequent renewal of the animals.
The methods used in the experiments were simple. The slug was
placed on a circular glass plate set horizontally in the bottom of a
cuboidal wooden box which was made impervious to light and covered
with a thick, black clotli. Precautions were taken to avoid thermal and
chemical influences by keeping the box at as equable a temperature as
possible and by wiping the plate free from slime before each test. The
tests were made only when the animal had definitely oriented itself and
was moving ahead in a straight line. Two series were made. In the
first series the dorsal tentacle was touched gently with the forefinger.
The box was then immediately covered with the black cloth. Observa-
tions were made after the lapse of 20 to 30 seconds and the position of
the animal noted. The right and left tentacles were touched alternately.
