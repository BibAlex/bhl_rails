A determination of its molecular weight verified the formula : —
1.7583 grm. of the substance, and 24.39 grms. benzol gave by the
boiling point method a rise of 0°.5231.
Calculated for C25H52. Found.

Melting point of the solid hydrocarbon, 53° -5 4°.
HeXACOSANE, C26H54, AND LiQUID HYDROCARBON, C27H52.
From Distillate 292°-294°, 50 mm.
After the fifteenth distillation, 100 grams collected at 292°-294°,
50 mm., which deposited a considerable quantity of solid crystalline
hydrocarbon. These crystals were filtered, pressed, and purified by
crystallization from ether and alcohol. Melting point, 58°. The
specific gravity of this hydrocarbon was determined as follows : —
60°, 0.7977 70°, 0.7956 80°, 0.7943
A combustion of the solid gave the following percentages of carbon
and hydrogen : —
0.1508 grm. of the substance gave 0.4709 grm. COo and 0.2033 grm.
