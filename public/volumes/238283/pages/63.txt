L N N' L' minus the area M M' N' N. The former area is equal to
P
R T\n~, and if the latter be designated by A we have the equation,
RT\nt = ET\n^,-A. (29)
Now if the point M' is moved in the direction of greater volume, equa-
tion (29) holds true continuously, and therefore is true if M' is taken at
infinite volume. But at infinite volume

and therefore
R T\n^ = PT\DP-A^, (30)
if A^ represents the total area bounded by the line M N and the curves
M M' and N N', each produced to infinity. This equation may be
written,
i?7'ln^ = -^^,orln^ = --^,or ^^Pe^^, (31a)
where e is the base of natural logarithms.
The deviation of the fugacity from the gas pressure is, therefore,
dependent upon the area A^. The case that has been chosen in which
the curve M M' lies within N N' is of course the common one. For
gases of the opposite type, hydrogen and helium, the formulae will be,
i? T'ln-^ = + ^^ and i/. = Pe^ â€¢ ' (31b)
"We see at once that for all known gases and vapors except hydrogen
and helium the escaping tendency is less than the gas pressure ; for
these two, greater. The determination of the value of the fugacity at
any pressure involves the estimation of the area A^. This must be
done by integrating the most exact empirical equation of the isotherm of
a gas between the pressure in question and the pressure zero. This
method has the disadvantage of all extrapolation, but the value thus
obtained may be checked by using a second empirical equation of
another form and recalculating A^. If the two results coincide the
value obtained will in all probability be very near the true value of A^.
In conclusion it may be remarked that equation (29) applies to the
isothermal of all substances, not merely to gases, and can be frequently
of use. For example, if it is possible to pass continuously from vapor to
liquid along an isothermal, it is evident that in passing from a saturated
vapor to its liquid,
