on each, tangent to cr (n — l)-spreads at points of cr (n — k -\- l)-spreacls
that lie one on each, tangent to t (n — l)-spreads at points of t (n — 2)-
spreads that lie one on each, and finally tangent to v other (n — 1)-
spreads, where p, cr, . , . t, v, are non-negative integers connected by
the relation
w— l=;^.p + (^— 1)o-+.... + 2t + v,
envelop a developable »S'„_i.
Similar cases occur in three-fold space where we have the tangent
planes that are common to two surfaces enveloping a developable surface
as do the tangent planes to a surface at the points of a curve' on that
surface.*
4. Some additional properties of developables ; sections.
Other properties of an »S'„_i may be deduced by regarding it as the
envelope of an (n — l)-flat whose equation involves a single parameter.!
Through any point in space can be drawn a definite number of tangent
i^„_i's to the Sn^y For substitute the coordinates of the point in the
equation of the variable {n — l)-flat and there is a certain finite number
of values of the parameter that satisfy the equation.
Any i^„_i of the system meets its consecutive i^„_i in a definite i^„_2, a
generator of S^-^ whose equations are,
Any three consecutive -F„_i's meet in a definite -P„_3, a generator of *S';^2>
whose equations are,
, ^ 9A ^ 9^A ^
^ = ''9X = ''9^^ = ''
Any n — 1 consecutive jP„_i's meet in a definite line Fi, a generator of
S2, whose equations are,
^ = 0,^ = 0,. ..^^, = 0.
Finally, any n consecutive i^„_/s meet in a definite point of the curve of
regression of »S'3. The equations of the Fq are,
