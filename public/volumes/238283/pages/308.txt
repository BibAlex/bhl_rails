RICHARDS AND HEIMROD. â€” THE IMPROVED VOLTAMETER. 443
increasing the deposit of silver. Most of this polymerized material
decomposes at ouce, however, forming the silver dust at the anode.
6. The hydroxyl ion discharges at the anode, forming silver oxide
and prohably so-called peroxide. Ionized hydrogen is thus developed.
7. Dissolved gases affect the deposit whenever they react with the
complex ions.
8. Nitrite is formed at the anode, but has probably not much efTect
on the weight of the deposit.
9. The deposited silver always contains included solution, varying in
amount from 0.01 per cent to 0.04 per cent according to circumstances.
10. A new name, coulometer, is proposed, to replace the old and
unsuitable designation voltameter.
11. The true electrochemical equivalent of silver is probably
0.0011175 milligram per coulomb.
12. Therefore, 96580 coulombs are associated with one gram equiv-
alent of any electrolyte.
13. The electrochemical equivalent of cupric copper is 0.00032929;
therefore the electrochemical atomic weight of copper (63.601) is in
close agreement with the chemical value (63.604).
14. F'araday's law is thus verified for two kathious more exactly than
ever before.
