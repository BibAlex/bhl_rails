have not in general any common solutions at all.
If the equation of the (n — 2) -flat involve k parameters connected by
k — 1 equations, the properties of the derived system of loci is the same
as in the case just discussed.
8. Mutual relations of the derived loci.
Two consecutive i^„_2's intersect in an i^„_4, three in an F„_^, r in an
Fn-iri — H — ^"^ ^^ -^1' ^^ ^ 's ^^^1 <^'' o ^" ^'^ -^0 if " is even. Tliere is a
1-fold infinite system of each kind of flats. The i^„_2's are generators
of Sn_x, the i^„_4's of *S'„_g, the F^_2,'!?> of »S'„_2,.+i. Let us consider the
case where n is odd. Through any F^^_^ pass two consecutive i^„_2's,
w — 1
through any F^-^t pass r consecutive F„_2S, through any Fi pass
consecutive F,^_2^- Any F,,^^ contains two consecutive F„_iS, three con-

secutive F„_eS, — - — consecutive i^i's. Any i^„_2r contains two consecu-
tive i''„_2(r+i)'s5 any two consecutive i^„_2/s determine one -F„_2(r_i)'s. "We
may then reverse the process and start with S^-, which lies in the space
of n ways but in no flat space of a less number of ways. Through each
two consecutive i^i's of this surface pass three-flats i^g's, these i^s's will
generate a four-spread «S'„_4. Through each two consecutive i^g's pass
five-flats; this can be done as the i^,_3's intersect consecutively in i^i's.
These five-flats will generate a six-spread S,^. Finally, through each two
consecutive F^_^9, pass i^„_2's ; these F,,_2^ generate an (w — l)-spread
S„_i. If we start with the system of (ti — 2)-flats we come down finally
to the surface, or starting with the surface we may work back to the
system of (n — 2)-flats.
If n is even, through any F,^_^ pass two consecutive F„_2S, through any
Fn-2.r pass T cousecutive i^n^o's, through any Fq pass - consecutive i^^a's.
