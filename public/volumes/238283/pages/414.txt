It is evident from the slight change in specific gravity after purifica-
tion, and the percentages of carbon and hydrogen, that the original
distillate consisted to a large extent of octodecane.
Monochloroctodecane, C18H37CI. — The product obtained by the action
of chlorine on octodecane, collected in greater part at 185°-190°, under
15 mm., and this fraction gave as its specific gravity at 20°, 0.9041.
The percentage of chlorine corresponded to the monochloride : —
0.1482 grm. of the oil gave 0.0782 grm. AgCl.

The results given above were obtained with the hydrocarbon that was
liquid at ordinary temperatures. When it was found that crystals sepa-
rated from this distillate at 3°, and that it became pasty at 0°, it was
cooled to — 10°, when it became so thick it filtered only slowly. The
solid after filtering was melted and again cooled and filtered, after which
it was perfectly white. It was then crystallized from ether and alcohol,
after which it melted at 20°. It was estimated that twenty per cent of
the original oil separated as the solid hydrocarbon on cooling. It was
difficult to separate the solid completely on account of the great solvent
action of the oil.
The filtered and pressed solid melted at 20°, and after crystallization
from ether and alcohol and from gasoline, the melting point could not be
raised. Kraflft* gave 28° as the melting point of octodecane, which he
obtained from stearic acid; but his octodecane boiled at 214°. 5 under
50 mm. pressure. The specific gravity of the solid hydrocarbon was
