a restricted system equivalent to re — 1 independent equations. We
have then the case of an (n — l)-flat whose equation involves n para-
meters connected by w — 1 independent relations ; this is equivalent to
the case of a single equation containing one arbitrary parameter. TVe
may, in general, consider the system of developables as given by an
(« — l)-flat whose equation contains a single arbitrary parameter or
/' parameters connected by X; — 1 equations.*
3. The tangent (n — \)-Jlats that are common to w — \ (n — l)-spreads
envelop a developable.
The equation in homogeneous coordinates of any (n — l)-flat may be
written
x = ay + fiz-{-....-{-yw.
This equation involves n independent parameters ; if we connect them
by any n — 1 independent equations we shall have the equation of an
(n — l)-flat that contains but a single independent parameter, so that
the 1-fold infinite system of (k — 1) -flats represented by it envelop a
developable. The tangent (n — l)-flat at any non-singular point of a
developable S„_i contains the generating F'„_2 through that point and
touches the S„_i all over this flat, t We may speak of this developable
Sn_i as enveloped by its tangent i^,_i's. If then we impose on an
arbitrary (n — l)-flat any conditions that give rise to w — 1 independent
equations between the coefficients in its equation, the (?2 — l)-flat will
envelop a developable 'S'„_i.
Let U=
be the equation of an (n — 1) -spread. The equation of the tangent
(n — l)-flat at any ordinary point P' is
9U' 9U' 9U' ^
dx' dy' dw'
If we impose on the equation of the arbitrary (yi — l)-flat the condi-
tions that it shall be this tangent {n — l)-flat, the coefficients in the two
equations must be proportional. We must have then
9U[ 9U>_ 91P
9 x' ^= 9 y' = . . . . 9to'
— la y
From these equations by means of the equation
U = Q,
