Monochlorheptadecane, C17H35CI. — The chlorine product from hepta-
decane collected in considerable quantity at 175°-177°, 15 mm. Its
specific gravity at 20° was found to be 0.8962. The percentage of
chlorine corresponded to the monochloride : —
0.1510 grm. of the oil gave 0.0807 grm. AgCl.
Calculated for CJ7H35CI. Found.

On cooling a portion of the distillate I88°-189° to —10°, it formed a
pasty mass from vrhich a small amount of a crystalline solid was ob-
tained by filtration. The solid after crystallization from ether and
alcohol melted at approximately 10°. The amount of solid was not
sufficient for purification or examination. The filtered oil gave as its
specific gravity at 20°, 0.8035, slightly higher than the distillate before
filtration. Since the original distillate showed the composition of the
series, GJ^2n+2^ it did not seem worth while to make any further exami-
nation of the filtered oil.

After the twenty-sixth distillation larger quantities of distillates col-
lected between 198° and 204°, mostly at 199°-200° (50 mm). The dis-
tillate l99°-200° distilled for the most part, although with considerable
colored residue and bad odor, at 300°-301°, under 760 mm. After dry-
ing over sodium its specific gravity was 0.8054, after agitation with
sulphuric acid, 0.8035, and after purification with fuming sulphuric acid,
0.8017, at 20°.
Its molecular weight was ascertained by the Beckman method at the
freezing point.
I. 0.9963 grm. of the oil and 36.4129 grms. benzol gave a depression
of 0°.53.
II. 0. 9926 grm. of the oil and 23.2544 grms. benzol gave a depression
of 0°.84.
