L. decussata Mont. Washed ashore, Hope Bay, July, 1891, and Aug.,
1894, P. & B. Very abundant in 1894. P. B.-A., No. 89. The finest
species of the genus, with fronds in shape of a fir tree, sometimes over a
meter in length. Apparently confined to the islands on the two sides of
the Atlantic.
L. elongata Zan. Hope Bay, July, 1891 ; Montego Bay, July, 1900,
P. & B.
L. pulverulenta Ag. Washed ashore, Manchioneal, July, 1900, P.
& B.
L. valida Harv. In large tufts, Port Maria, March 17, 1893, No.
283; Port Antonio, March 10, 1893, No. 240, H. Hope Bay, Orange
Bay, Montego Bay, 1891 and 1900, P. & B. Under No. 687, P. B.-A.,
a form was distributed as L. tenuis, which it now seems better to regard
as L. valida. It is difficult to see how the two species can be distin-
guished, when one has a large number of specimens. Harvey's name,
being the older, must be maintained.
