The oil was agitated several times with concentrated sulphuric acid
until the acid was not much colored, and washed with sodic hydrate and
water, and finally with salt brine. On account of the high specific
gravity of the oil some heavy solution such as brine or calcic chloride
was necessary to separate the water and oil. The oil was dried for
examination over calcic chloride and metallic sodium.
A combustion of the oil gave the following percentages of carbon and
hydrogen : —
0.1508 grm. of the oil gave 0.4711 grms. CO2 and 0.1945 grm. H2O.
Calculated for
C23H45. CjaHjg.

A part of the carbonic dioxide was evidently lost, but the results point
to the series C^Uo^, which represents the composition of the oil, much the
larger part of the distillate.
A portion of the distillate was cooled to — 10°, and filtered cold to
separate the crystalline solid. The solubility of the solid hydrocarbon
seemed to diminish rapidly with lower temperatures, consequently a
small proportion of the solid remains in the oil below — 10°. After
pressing and crystallizing from ether and alcohol, the solid melted at 45°.
Krafft's hydrocarbon, CgsHig, melted at 47°. 7. Two determinations of
its specific gravity at 60° gave (1) 0.7894, (2) 0.7900.
A combustion of the solid gave results for the series C„H2„+2 '• —
0.1515 grm. of the substance gave 0.4710 grm. CO2 and 0.1989 grm. HoO.
Calculated for C03H43. Found.

A determination of its molecular weight at the boiling point of benzol
was made : —
1.1208 grm. of the substance and 23.08 grms. benzol gave a rise of
0°.412.
Calculated for C23H4g. Found.
