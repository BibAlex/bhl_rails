argentic bromide determined. Tlius from each of these analyses two
distinct ratios were obtained as a basis for the calculation of the molecular
weight of uranous bromide, — the ratio of uranous bromide to argentic
bromide, and that of uranous bromide to silver.
As would naturally be expected from the complexity of operations
involved, determinations of the sodium in the filtrates from the argentic
bromide gave unsatisfactory results. The large quantity of filtrate and
wash waters had to be evaporated to small bulk, the uranium precipi-
tated, and the sodium determined in the residue. It seemed advisable to
make a series of separate analyses for sodium only, and use the average
percentage of sodium found as a constant correction. This method was
used in the work upon cobalt and nickel.*
Accordingly three alkali determinations were made, wholly in platinum,
the material not coming in contact with glass at any time except during
the original collection and weighing of the sublimed bromide. The sub-
limate was dissolved in pure water, in a platinum dish, and the uranium
was precipitated with pure ammonium sulphide. The ammonium sul-
phide was freshly prepared for each analysis, wholly in platinum. It left
no residue on evaporation in platinum. The precipitated sulphide was
digested on the water bath to expel most of the excess of ammonium
sulphide, filtered through a platinum funnel, and the filtrate and wash
water evaporated to small bulk in a platinum dish. The sodium bro-
mide was then converted to sodium sulphate and weighed. The follow-

The average of these three determinations, 0.095, per cent, is practically
identical with the amount of sodic bromide found in the cobalt and nickel
work, which was 0.10 per cent. The porcelain tubes used in this inves-
