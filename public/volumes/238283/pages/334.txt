Carex aquatilis.
C. AQUATILIS, "Wahlenb., Kongl. Acad. Handl. xxiv. 165. — Plants 3 to
9 dm. high ; leaves 4 to 7 mm. broad : spikelets ^ slender ; the pistillate 1.5
to 5.5 cm. long, 3 to 4.5 mm. thick, the lowermost often long-attenuated
and remotely flowered at base : scales dark, subacute, hardly equal-
ling or barely exceeding the perigynia. — Northern Europe, Green-
land. In North America from the Shickshock Mts., Gaspe, Quebec,
1 The inflorescences of Carex are simple or compound spikes, racemes, or pani-
cles ; and, since in other genera of Cyperaceae, as Ci/perus and Scirpus, the ultimate
spicate divisions of the inflorescence are called spikelets, that term is here adopted,
for the sake of uniformity and clearness, for these ultimate spicate divisions of
the inflorescence of Carex. The species in wliich there is a solitary simple in-
florescence (or true spike), as C. gynocrates and C. exilis, are few in comparison
with those in which the inflorescence has more than one such division. From the
occurrence in those plants, however, of occasional secondary divisions of the in-
florescence, the term spikelet seems not inappropriate to the normal inflorescence
of such species.
