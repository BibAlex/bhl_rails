WOLFF AND PALACHE. — APATITE FROM MINOT, ME. 525
dary lines were sharp and the readings generally good. From the
average of a large number of readings the following values were
obtained :
w^-„ = 1.G3353 ojLi = 1.63067
t^_c = 0.00191 a,-€ = 0.0020
£jj,==: 1.63162 eLi= 1.62865
The crystal was then heated to 320° C. or until decolorized and the
indices again determined as follows :
wj,.^ = 1.63346 ej,, = 1.63165 w — c = 0.00181
The change in the bi-refringence and in both indices is within the limits
of error.
The pleochroism is strong and the ray vibrating parallel to c (c) red-
dish purple, perpendicular to c (w) deep violet blue. In converging
light the thick clear crystals show on the basal plane a marked bi-axial
character with the vertical axis the acute (negative) bisectrix and a
division of the base into six sectors, in each of which the axial plane
is parallel to a prism of the second order (or perpendicular to a lateral
axis). These sectors come out clearly with the sensitive tint of the
gypsum plate ; while some are almost perfect, others merge together
and overlap at the centre of the crystal. The angle of the optic axes
in one of these sectors was measured iu the optic angle apparatus :
2E,-, = 20°,
but it appears to vary in different sectors of the same crystal. These
phenomena of apparent orthorhombic symmetry were described and fig-
ured by Mallard * for the violet apatite from Schlaggenwald, but appear
to be even more distinct in the Maine apatite. While driving off the
colonng matter destroys the pleochroism the anomalous bi-axial characters
are not affected.
Conclusion.
The Minot apatite is a pure fluor-apatite with a fluorine content lower
than that necessary for the formula Ca5F(P04)3 and indicating Groth's
formula Ca5P3(F.OH)Oi2 as also deduced by Jannasch from the analysis
quoted above. Rammelsberg f explained the low content of fluorine
(and chlorine) in certain apatites as due to removal of these elements
