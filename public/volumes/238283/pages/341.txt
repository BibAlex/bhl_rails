Carex pennsylvanica.
Carex pennsylvanica, Lam., is one of the widest-distributed of the
North American Carices, and as one of the earliest-flowering it is per-
haps better known to the general botanist than any of the other species.
In the length and breadth of its leaves, the comparative height of its
culm, etc., the plant shows considerable variation, and many formal
varieties have been based upon these characters. But since they are
all of a purely vegetative nature, often produced in a colony of the
species by changes of ecological conditions, none of these variations
seem to the writer of sufiicient constancy to merit recognition as more
than trivial forms. The color of the spikelets, also, a character too
commonly relied upon to separate C. pennsylvanica from the closely
related C. pihdifera, L. (C communis, Bailey), is not to be accepted
as final, since C. pennsylvanica, ordinarily characterized by dark reddish
brown scales, may often have them pale or even straw-colored when
growing in deep shade. Furthermore, C. pihdifera in northern Europe
as well as in America is frequently found with dark red scales, especially
when growing iu very sunny or exposed situations. The simplest means
of distinguishing C. pennsylvanica from its nearest common ally is in
its stoloniferous character-, for when well developed the plant produces
