secure a limit for the values of x and 2, and thus we have represented
a neighborhood of the curve
(f>(x,y) = 0, « = 0,
on the surface
^ (x, y» 2) =
as required.
Now, however small the neighborhood we shut off about the points
in the region |^| < h for which qo(y) vanishes, since the results estab-
lished above would hold also in a circle of radius hi > h, but still less
than the radius of convergence of the series for p (t/) in (/3), we can fill
up the remainder of the circle of radius h with circles within which
go (y) does not vanish, these circles overlapping at all points the bounda-
ries of the excepted neighborhoods and not reaching up to the excepted
points. Within each of these circles we have a development of type
(k). Consider one of these new circles. We want to consider the
neighborhood of the curve
«^3 (^8' ^2) = ^a"* + n (2/2) ara™ -1 + + r^^iy^) = 0. (v)
If this is a multiple curve of the mi-th order and nii < m, we have
reduction. Moreover, if nii = m, but
iCs"' + ^1(^2) a^s"!-' + + r„^(yz) ^ [^3 + Pz(.y^)T^^
we also have reduction. We need consider, therefore, only the case
that

and show that this case can repeat itself at most but a finite number of
times.
4. Suppose the function <jiz{xz^ y^) has the form (v'). Apply to the
surface <^3 (xg, y^, z^ = 0, (k), the transformation
and reduce the result to the form
^4(2^4, ^2, 22) = ^i"'^(y2) + ZzFii^i, ys. 22) = (0). (o)
If any term in ZoFi(xi, y^i ^2) is of degree in x^ and z^ together less
than mi, it appears at once that we have a line of lower order. So we
assume there are no such terms. Also, as the coefficient of x^^i does
not vanish identically in ^2 (io fact, not at all) no transformation of
