tively 0.20 and 0.24 milligram. These losses, accompanied by audible
decrepitation, must have been due to retained electrolyte.

The gauze kathode thus showed an average surplus of less than a
tenth of a milligram. But even this slight error is explicable, for it is
clear that the argentic nitrate held by the electrolyte must have left silver
nitrite or silver behind on heating. If we assume that the temperature
of ignition was enough wholly to decompose the electrolyte, the average
loss of 0.57 milligram would correspond to a residue of about 0.1 milli-
gram, while the corresponding residue from the weaker solution used in
the porous cup voltameter could not have exceeded 0.02 milligram. The
difference between these two figures is exactly equal to the observed
difference between the gauze voltameter and the porous cup voltameter,
so that the two may be said to give precisely identical results.
An important point connected with this experiment is the f\xct that
the kathode surface available for deposition on the gauze had an area of
less than half that on the inside of the large crucible. Hence the current
density in the gauze voltameter must have been over twice that in the
standard.
There has thus been accumulated a convincing array of evidence indi-
cating that the porous cup A^oltameter affords a means of depositing the
amount of silver which really corresponds to the quantity of electricity
sent through it. The numerical averages may be summed up in a brief
table as follows : â€” >
