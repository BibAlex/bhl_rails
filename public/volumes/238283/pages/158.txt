In all these cases, there i? seen to be a gradual diminution in the degree
of response as the intensity of light diminishes. Again, from an animal
which responded negatively to a certain intensity of light, a positive
response could be got by weakening the light sufficiently (Nos. 2 and 3,
Table XII.), and a positive animal could be made to give a negative
response by using stronger light (No. 1, Table XIL), as the following
instances show.

No. 3, Table XIL, shows a less regular response than any of the other
animals. From a response of — 37° it drops to one of —2.5°, and, under
the influence of a still lower intensity of light, it again rises to a marked
negative response of —32.° At a still lower intensity, it gives a striking
positive response of +36°. Here, however, we have well illustrated in
particular individuals the law laid down for all slugs, — that they are
negatively phototactic to strong intensities of light, the precision of re-
sponse varying correlatively with the intensity of the stimulus ; that to
weak intensities they are positive ; and that to a certain intermediate
intensity they are neutral.
A glance at the intensity column (Table X.) shows that the slugs are
