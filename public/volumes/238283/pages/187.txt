254 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY.
G. damaecoruis J. Ag. Annotto Bay, Aug., 1894; Mauchioueal,
July, 1900, P. & B. P. B.-A., No. 788.
G. divaricata Harv. In short tufts, Navy Island, Port Antonio, March,
1893, Nos. 155 and 228, H. Port Antonio, July, 1891 ; Port Morant,
Rio Bono, June, 1900, P. & B. P. B.-A., No. 789. Generally dis-
tributed but nowhere common.
G. Domingensis Sond. Mauchioneal, June, 1900, P. & B. Found
only in a very limited station, in large tufts on rocks about one meter
depth, in rough water; very luxuriant plants, showing beautiful shades
of violet.
By J. G. Agardh this is considered as merely a form of G. multipartita
var. polycarpa. Imperfectly developed specimens have some resemblance
to that variety, but well developed plants are quite different; the habit
reminds one rather of Laurencia pinnatifida. All three kinds of fruit
were found in the Manchioneal specimens, the cystocarps and tetraspores
as usual in this genus, the antheridia in crypts, as described by Thuret
for G. confervoides. The description of G. Krugiana in Hauck's Puerto
Rico list is quite suggestive of some of these specimens.
G. ferox J. Ag. Washed ashore, Morant Bay, Julj^, 1894, P. & B.
G. multipartita (Clem.) J. Ag. Port Antonio, July, 1891 ; Port Mo-
rant. Montego Bay, Ora Cabessa, Manchioneal, 1900, P. & B. No.
380, no locality, H. Near Kingston, Duerden. Chitty. P. B.-A.,
No. 885.
G. Wrightii (Turn.) J. Ag. Annotto Bay, Aug., 1894; Montego
Bay, June, 1900, P. & B. A few plants only.
The fresh frond is very stout and densely branched, and not at all
compressed ; it shrinks much in drying, and herbarium specimens give
the idea of a flattened frond.
Hypnea divaricata Grev. In large tufts on rocks in shallow water,
Montego Bay, Manchioneal, 1900, P. & B.
H. musciformis (Wulf.) Laraour. On stones at tide mark, Port An-
tonio, March, 1893, Nos. 147 and 223 ; St. Ann's Bay, March 24, 1893,
No. 320, H. Near Kingston, Duerden. Common everywhere, P. & B.
Chitty.
H. Valentiae (Turn.) Mont. Annotto Bay, Aug., 1894, P. & B.
The species is here taken in the same sense as by Hauck, Hedwigia,
1887, Heft 1, to include H. nidifica J. Ag. and H. fruticulosa Kuetz. ;
forms corresponding to both of these occur at Annotto Bay.
Cordylecladia irregularis Harv. Annotto Bay, Aug., 1894, P. & B.
Near Kingston, Duerden.
