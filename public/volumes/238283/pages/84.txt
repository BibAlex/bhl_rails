law of radiation of the ideal black body, I have plotted the various i;0-
chroms obtained in the course of this investigation in logarithmic form :
absolute temperatures being taken as abscissae and the logarithm of the
intensity as ordinates. These logarithmic isochroms, as will be seen from

Figure 23, in which three curves from Figure 19 are reproduced, are
straight lines. The range of temperatures is doubtless much too small
to bring out the curvature found by Lummer and Pringsheim, but the
curves show clearly the change of direction with the wave length men-
