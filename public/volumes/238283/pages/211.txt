Any point in T'can be carried by a suitable transformation into a
point on one of the surfaces g^z= or g^ — 0. Let G be an arbitrarily
chosen (large) positive quantity; then any point of 7' fur which
\^\<G\^\, \v\<G\i\, |C|<8,
is carried by the transformation (4) into one of the neighborhoods con-
sidered on the surfaces ^ ^ 0.
If ^ = 0, but ^, r] do not both vanish, then the point (^, i], s) is car-
ried by (5) into one of the neighborhoods considered on the surfaces
^. = 0.

A. — A Lemma.
1. The treatment of the multiple curves of Case II depends on the
following
Lemma. — Given an analytic surface
^{x, y, s) = <^(a;, y) + «*(a:, y, «) = o, (a)
where
is a multiple curve ; let <f>{x, y) have the form in the neighborhood of the
point X = 0, y = 0,
^{x,y) = [x+p{y)YE{x,y), (/?)
where p (y) is analytic at the point y = 0, and p (0) — 0. The function
^ (x, y, z) shall be analytic at the point (0, 0, 0), but shall not be divisi-
ble by X + p(y) at that point. Consider a region for which \y\ <, h,
and let h be chosen
a) less than the radius of convergence of the Taylor's series which
represents the function p (y) developed about the point y = 0, and
h) sufficiently small, so that the points (x = p (y), y) will lie in the
region in which E(x,y) is analytic and different from zero. Then the
part of the neighborhood of the curve
x + p(y)--=0, z = 0,
which lies on the surface
^{x,y, s) =
can be transformed, by means of quadratic transformations of the type
