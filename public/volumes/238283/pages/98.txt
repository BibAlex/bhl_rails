MORENO. — ON RULED LOCI IN W-FOLD SPACE. 133
The order of the curve 2 is,
^ (2m — w) (2m-n — 1) (2 m — 2 w + 2) — n(m — w + 1).*
(n-l)\
The equations of all the «-tuple points on /S„_i are given by means of
a rectangular system similar to (I), in which, however, there are only
2 (w — 7i) rows and 2 m — n — 1 columns. They form a restricted
system equivalent to n independent equations, whose order is
1
n
— (2 m — n — I) (2 m — n — 2) . . . . {2 m — 2 n) ;
this is the number of n-tuple points. The number of the n-tuple points
other than the cusps on Si, are
— (2 ?« — w — 1) (2 m — n—2) (2 m — 2 7i) — {71 + 1) (m — n).
These points necessarily lie on 2i ; they are either n-tuple points on 2i,
or else they are ?i-tuple points on the combined curves *S'i and 2i. In
three-fold space the double curve on the developable may have tripl
points on it ; it can have no double points off of the cuspidal curve.
If m = n, then the order of Si is n, and there are no cuspidal points
on the curve ; this is the rational normal curve of Veronese. f The
order of S,^_i in this case is 2 (n — 1) ; no developable S„_x can be of
lower order unless it is a cone or conoid, for no curve of lower order
than n can lie in the n-fold space without at the same time lying in a
space of fewer than n ways.
Let us consider the case where m = p < w, where p is an integer.
Any J9 + 1 consecutive i^„_i's intersect in an Fn_p_i whose equations are
' 9t ' 9tp
If we use two homogeneous parameters X and fi instead of the single
parameter t, these equations may be written
* For n = S, this result agrees with that in Salmon, Geometry of Three Dimen-
sions, p. 296.
