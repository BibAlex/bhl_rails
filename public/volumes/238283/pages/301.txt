111 the porous cup voltameter all the aoode reactions which constitute
the most serious causes of inaccuracy are safely eliminated by keeping
the contaminated liquid within the porous cup. It is obvious that this
device, or some other accomplishing the same end, should always be used
when accuracy is desired.
III. The Purity of the Silver Deposit.
An important question remains to be answered, namely, is the deposit
thus obtained perfectly pure silver, or does it contain traces of included
mother liquor ?
That impurities in the solution, such as copper, or any of the common
metals occurring with silver, do not affect silver deposit to any great
extent has been shown by Lord Rayleigh. Even if the solution actually
turns green from the copper dissolved at the anode, not a trace of copper
can be detected in the deposit. We used on one occasion commercial
silver nitrate with an anode of sterling silver wrapped in paper, and
found that the difference between this and the standard was about .024
per cent, or only about .02 per cent smaller than a similar deposit with
the purest silver. Metals of greater solution tension than silver have
therefore no important effect on the weight of silver, although they may
change the structure of the silver deposit. Of course they had always
been excluded in this work.
