A functional sign expressed by means of a letter will always represent
an analytic function.
Tiie symbol E {x, y, z, ) will always represent a function which
is analytic at the point (0, 0, ) and for which ^ (0, 0, )
^ 0. If written with a subscript, as E^ {x, y, z, ) it represents a
particular function of the class ; if without a subscript, it represents a
general function of the class ; so that two functions E {x, y, z, )
both expressed by the same symbol, need not be equal to each other.
B. — The Transformations.
3. The equation
F(x,y,z) = Q
can be transformed to the form
^ (^, -n, = a, j7. 0». + (^, V, 0«.+i + -
where
1) m > 2,
2) the polynomial
contains the term ^'",
a, ri, i)„. = c^ a, v)
3) the points in which the curves corresponding to the irreducible
factors of ff> (f, r}) cut the line at infinity shall be distinct from each
other and from the point in which the line f = cuts that line.
To do this, we first make the transformation
X = U + a, :=! V + b , Z T=: w -\- c ,
thus obtaining
^(^, I/, z ) =/(«, '', ■?<'•) = (u, v, w),„ + {u, V, w),„+y +
Here, m > 2, the singularity now being at the origin. Next we make
a linear homogeneous transformation with non-vanishing determinant,
V = a.i+ /3.r, + y.^V (1)
with the result :
f(u, V, w) = <!> ($, rj, = (t\ V, 0,„ + (^, V, 0,«+i + = .
For this equation, conditions 2) and 3) can be secured, as is readily seen
by a proper choice of the coefficients in transformation (1).
