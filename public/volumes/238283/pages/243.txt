toplasm containing an oil-like refractive globule of an orange or amber
color. Fructification unknown.
Living in fresh water. Ireland, Germany, Pennsylvania and New
Jersey (Leidy).
In this provisional arrangement, I have followed Cienkowsky in refer-
ring this species to the Labyrinthuleae, although I regard it as improbable
whether Dijilophrys Archeri and D. stercorea should be included in the
same genus. The aggregations of the vegetating amoebse of D. Ai-cheri
seem to be an association of the young in groups, the colonies being
formed by successive division of the individuals ; and there is nothing
definite known concerning a resting stage.
Diplophrys stercorea Cienkowsky.
Archiv. f. mikr. Anat., Bd. XII. p. 44. PI. VIII. 1876.
Individuals lens- or spindle-shaped, about 4/a-6/^ long? bearing at both
ends several pseudopodia, almost bilaterally symmetrical. In the interior
a nucleus, one or two contractile vacuoles and a yellow pigment body.
Both the isolated and united individuals of the net-plasmodium finally
becoming aggregated to form without change of shape pseudospores borne
in sori, which are usually stalked, sometimes sessile.
On dung of horse, cow and porcupine. Russia ; Cambridge, Mass. ;
Intervale, New Hampshire.
This species has been met with twice in American cultures, and so
far as I am aware, with the exception of D. Archeri, is the only repre-
sentative of the Labyrinthuleas which has been found in this country.
A form, which is probably the resting condition of Chlamydomyxa labij-
rinthuloides Archer, has been found growing in the cells of sphagnum,
at Kittery, Maine, by Professor Thaxter. As Archer and others have
pointed out, however, it is very doubtful whether this peculiar organism
should be included in the Labyrinthuleae.
