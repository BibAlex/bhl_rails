where there are 2 (m — 2) rows and 2 m — S columns. This restricted
system is of order ^ (2m — 3) {2 m — 4). The double spread repre-
sented by these equations consists of two distinct parts, »S„_2 and 2„_2.
The order of 2„_2 must be,
^(2m — 3)(2 m — 4) — 3 (m — 2) = 2 (m — 2) (m — 3).
A triple point on S„_i must lie on three i''„_2's. We may find the equa-
tions of the total triple spread on *S'„_i by expressing the conditions that
the equations of the F„_2 have three common roots. These conditions
are expressed by means of a rectangular system similar in form to (I),
in which however there are only 2 (?« — 3) rows and 2 m — 4 columns.
The order of the restricted system is
^ (2 m - 4) (2 m - 5) (2 m - 6).
This triple spread consists of two distinct parts, S„_s and 2„_3. The order
of 2„_3 must be
1 2
-^(2m-4) (2m-5)(2m-6)-4(m-3)r=-(m-3)(m-4)(2m-l).
In like manner we can find the equations of the total ^-tuple spread
on *S„_i, by expressing the conditions that the equations of the F„_i have
k roots in common. These conditions are expressed by means of a
rectangular system similar to (I), in which, however, there are only
2 {m — k) rows and 2 m — k — 1 columns. This is a restricted system
equivalent to k independent equations, of order ^ (2 m — ^- — 1)
(2 m — k — 2) . . . . (2 m — 2 k). This spread consists of two parts,
/S„_j and 2„_t; the order of the latter is
_L (2 m - /5; - 1) (2 m - ^ - 2) (2 m - 2 ^^ - (^- + 1) (m - k).
The total {n — l)-tuple curve on S^_i is given by means of a restricted
system similar to (I), in which, however, there are only 2 {in — n ■{- 1)
rows and 2 m — n columns. We have then a restricted system equiv-
alent to w — 1 independent equations whose order is
^— -: (2m-n) (2 m - w - 1) . . . (2 m - 2 w -f 2).
