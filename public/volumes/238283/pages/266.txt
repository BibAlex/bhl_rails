tiwation were of the same manufacture as those used in the nickel and
cobalt work, and since the method of preparation of the three bromides
was practically the same, probably the quantity of sodium extracted from
the tubes by the action of the hot bromine vapor was the same, — on the
average^ — in all three cases, and not far from 0.10 per cent. Conse-
quently, in calculating the following results, this value was used as a
constant correction. The effect of applying the correction is to raise the
calculated atomic weight about two tenths of a unit. Of course by this
method the quantity of sodic bromide calculated will vary somewhat from
the exact quantity present, in individual determinations. The arerage
result, however, will undoubtedly vary but little from the result obtained
if the alkali could be determined in each sample. It certainly is very
much nearer the truth than the results to be obtained by the cumber-
some method of determining the alkali in the filtrate from each precipita-
tion of argentic bromide.
Analvsis No. 2 was rejected on account of contamination of the
uranous bromide by shreds of asbestos from the packing of the jacket, and
No. 4 was not used because the combustion tube cracked during sublima-
tion, rendering probable the formation of some oxy bromide. The silver
required in analysis No. 6 was determined for practice preparatory to
the final series, being 0.9087 gram when all corrections were applied. It
is not included in the table, since its nature was essentially preliminary.
As usual, all weighings were reduced to the vacuum standard. While all
