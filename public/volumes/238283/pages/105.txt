This determinant and its derivatives vanish for the point P', therefore
the locus is a quadratic three-way cone with its vertex at P'. This
cone is intersected by the tangent plane at P' iu a pair of straight lines
which is the required locus. If a point cc, ?/, . . . , be taken on either of
these lines, we have three independent equations just sufficient to deter-
mine the ratios of the four differentials ; i. e., just sufficient to determine
the consecutive point P", so that the tangent plane at this consecutive
point will intersect the tangent plane at P' in the point selected. That
these two consecutive tangent planes have no further intersection may
be further shown by forming the equation of the plane that goes through
their common intersection and through both the points P' and P". The
equations of this plane are
A" V . AU' - A" U' . A F =0,
A' V" . AU" — A' U" . AV" = 0.
These equations in general represent a definite plane so long as P' and
P" are not coincident.
It would be of interest to examine the motion of the point of inter-
section along these lines as the point P" circles about the point P', and
to see whether at any time the consecutive tangent planes intersect in
one of these lines.
These lines are not inflexional tangents to the surface ; lines meeting
the surface in three consecutive points do not generally exist in a space
of more than three ways. For such lines would have to satisfy both
AU' = 0,
A F' = 0,
and
A" U' = 0,
A^ V = 0,
