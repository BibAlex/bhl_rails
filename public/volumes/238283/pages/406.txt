MABERY. — THE COMPOSITION OP PETROLEUM. 567
In September, 1896, I set out to ascertain the composition of the
principal hydrocarbons in Pennsylvania petroleum above 216° so far as
they can be separated by distillation on a laboratory scale. Through the
courtesy of the Standard Oil Company, I procured a barrel of crude oil
from Oil City and this material has been used to separate the hydro-
carbons that will be described in this paper. That this oil was an
approximately average specimen of Pennsylvania petroleum, appears
from its properties. A determination of the specific gravity of the crude
oil at 20° gave 0.8095. A combustion of the oil dried over sodium
gave the following percentages of carbon and hydrogen : Carbon, 85.80 ;
Hydrogen, 14.04. Eight hundred grams distilled in the ordinary way in
the following proportions : —
50°-150° 150°-200° 200°-250° 250° -300° +300°
166 88 83 100 337
Fifty -six kilos of the crude oil was distilled in quantities of 10 litres each
in a porcelain still, collecting under atmospheric pressure to 200°, and
within limits of 10° under a vacuum of 50 mm. to 300°, then within
limits of 5°, and finally within limits of 2°. After eight distillations the
following proportions collected : —
124°-126° 136°-I38° 156°-158° 174°-176° 188°-199°
Grams, 125 145 240 205 240
199°-201° 210°-212° 226° -228° 242°-244°
225 335 150 130
Since the weights of these fractions represent all that came from the
original crude oil, it is possible to gain a very general idea of the pro-
portion of the hydrocarbons which are contained in the crude oil. But
such estimation must be only approximate from the fact that any dis-
tillation however thorough gives only an approximate separation, and a
considerable portion of any hydrocarbon must be contained in the in-
termediate distillates.
The percentages of the weights are as follows : —
C13H28 C14H30 C15H32 C16H34 L17H36
124°-126° 136°-138° 156°-158° 174°-176° 188°-199°
0.22 0.26 0.43 0.37 0.43 per. cent.
C13H33 C19H40 C20H42 C21H44
199°-201° 210°-212° 230°-232° 242°-244°
0.40 0.60 0.27 0.23 per, cent.
