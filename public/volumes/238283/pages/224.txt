BLACK. — THE NEKJHBORHOOD OP A SINGULAR POINT. 321
3. The quadratic transformations to be used are of two types
1) $^ = $n+iC^, ^,a = (^^i+i + S^+i) ^Mi (40)
2) 1^ = $^+iv^, i^ = (^,.+1 + ^)^+i)Vn' (41)
In a succession of transformations of type (14) we see that yi = 0,
since the first set of points is taken on the line f = 0. Further, sup-
pose after the substitution rj — 8i = rji'm ^ oi (39) the expression
(f, Vl Om
contains terms besides the J™ ; then it cannot be composed of m equal
linear factors, for that would require a term containing f""^ ; but no
such term can arise from the factor X of (37), and, on the other hand,
it could not be the product of a term from X by a non-constant term of
the ^ factor, for then, on account of the constant term of the -E factor,
there would have to be present in <5 a term of degree lower than m. So
as soon as the function corresponding to <^ of $ contains more than the
»ith power of the $ variable, the function corresponding to (f, rj, t,)„^ is
no longer the product of m equal linear factors, and we have one of the
cases treated earlier.
The same considerations apply to the transformations corresponding to
type 2), since, when the transformation which deals with the infinite
region is introduced, the first one of that order is of form
Accordingly, the most general succession of transformations here is
one in which groups of types 1) and 2) alternate. We shall call them
the t, and rj types respectively, and when a change is made from one type
to the other, we shall speak of it as a reversal of type.
We shall treat the subject in two cases, first supposing that there is
no reversal of type in the succession of transformations used, and later
supposing that reversals of type occur.
