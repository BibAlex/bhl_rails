and the total negative responses of the left side (column 7), — these
responses being necessarily right-hand movements. The total movement
in degrees to the left (column 10) was likewise obtained by adding the
total negative responses of the right side and the positive responses of the
left side. Column 1 1 gives the total number of animals used in each series.
In the region of negative phototaxis, the total positive and negative
angular migrations, and the average negative phototaxis of all the series
(1-7, inclusive) when the right and left sides respectively were turned
toward the light, were as follows.

This shows on the whole a less sensitive right side, or, to put it differently,
a more marked negative phototaxis of the left side. How is it when the
animals become positively phototactic? Table XVII. gives the average
positive response of the right and left sides for series 8 to 18, including
series 7a, 8a, 2a, and 10a.

Here an asymmetrical response is less strongly marked. The left side,
however, appears on the average to be somewhat more strongly attracted
toward the light. The results prove that the asymmetry in response of the
right and left sides cannot be wholly due to a tendency to move toward
