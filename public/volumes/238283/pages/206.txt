is analytic within the region
\vi\<h-e, |^|< h^^O,
where h is the distance to the nearest value of tji for which the equation
corresponding to
has a critical point, e is a positive number which can be taken arbi-
trarily small and, having been chosen, determines an upper limit, not
zero, for 81. In fact, ^ is a continuous function of the two independ-
ent variables t^^, ^ within this region ; furthermore, for any fixed value
of t, such that | ^ | < Sj, f is an analytic function of 771 throughout the
region | ?;i | < A — e ; and, similarly, for any fixed value of 771 such that
I 'Ji I < ^ — ^) f is an analytic function of ^ throughout the region
Also consider the surfaces
in 5. Here also we have m regular points of surfaces, and as a result
m functions of the form
These, by the same method of proof as above, are seen to be analytic
when
\1\< h^-e,, \rj\ <8^,
where k is the nearest point in the {-plane for which the equation
has multiple roots for ^, i. e. the smallest value of ^ for which the
equation
has equal roots for $. But this is the smallest value of - for which the
equation
(W-) =0
* Cf . Briot et Bouquet's Theorie des fonctions elliptiques, § 28. The proof of
continuity there given for polynomials in two variables will apply with very
slight modifications to analytic functions of any number of variables. Cf. further
