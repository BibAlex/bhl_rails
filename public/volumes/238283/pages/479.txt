678 JOHN PISKE.
the opinion of others, all combined to secure the approval of a large
reading public, and thus earned for him the honorable title which has
been conferred upon him since his death, " Popularizer of useful knowl-
edge." — In its restricted application to the field of history, this
epithet was adopted by Colonel Higginson in some remarks before the
Massachusetts Historical Society in February, and was repeated by him
with emphatic recognition of the honor thereby intended to be conferred,
at the March meeting of the Academy.
Fiske's whole life was, in the words of Mead, " a noble illustration
of resolute intellectual integrity." " Only another John Fiske," says
Professor Royce, " if such a being were possible — a man as widely read as
he was, and with a soul as sweetly humane in sentiment, as clear in vision,
as free from pettiness, as childlike in faith in what it had once accepted,
and yet as keen in critical intelligence regarding what it rejected as was
his soul — only such a man could estimate adequately Fiske's beneficent
life-work and his manifold mental accomplishments."
In conclusion let me say, that in accepting the appointment to write
Mr. Fiske's memoir, I did so with the full consciousness of mv unfitness
for the task, if knowledge of the subjects discussed in what the London
"Times" terms the bewildering variety of his publications, were to be
made the basis of one's qualifications. To find a memorialist up to this
standard might be difficult even in the Academy. It seemed to me,
therefore, that all that could be expected of any person would be to
throw upon the screen a composite picture, made up from contributions
by Fiske himself and by the various writers who have furnished biog-
raphies of his life and criticisms of his works. This is what I have
striven to do.
