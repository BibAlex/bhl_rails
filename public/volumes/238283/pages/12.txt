RICHARDS. — SIGNIFICANCE OF CHANGING ATOMIC VOLUME, 5
affinity of a substance for itself is not unlike that of the substance for
another, no great contraction or expansion occurs on mixing. Thus
benzol and tuluol when mixed scarcely change in volume at all, while
alcohol and water contract considerably. That is just what would be
expected if affinity is the cause of contraction.
In order to use such facts it is not necessary to imagine an atomic
theory adapted to them. Such a theory is ventured upon at the end of
this paper, but the facts are significant without it. One only has to bear
in mind that liquid and solid substances resist compression, and hence
that when we find them compressed we have reason to believe that
pressure has been applied upon them. It is rather a matter of common
sense than a hypothetical abstract conception.
In order to present in a clear light the complications involved in the
study of even a simple series of cases of chemical compression, the facts
concerninij the molecular volumes of several metals and their oxides are
recorded and discussed below.
