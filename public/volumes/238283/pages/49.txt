this vapor alone. A change of temperature will change the vapor pres-
sure in A B without changing the total pressure on the liquid, which
is always equal to the outside pressure on F. We may simplify this
arrangement by making the layer of inert gas so thin that it may be
regarded together with the membrane B C merely as a single membrane,
which is impermeable to the liquid but permeable to the vapor. In

Figure 2 it is represented by the dotted line B. The spaces B C and A B
are filled with liquid and vapor respectively, and the pistons A and C can
be moved up and down so as to distribute the substance between the
liquid and gaseous phases as desired. The whole is removed from the
influence of gravity. Let us start with one gram-molecule of the sub-
stance, all in the liquid state, and pass through the following reversible
cycle, during which the pressure, P, upon the piston, C, remains constant,
while the pressure upon A is always kept equal to the vapor pressure.
At first the piston A is at B ; the space B C has the volume v^. (1) The
temperature is raised from T' to T + d T, the pressure on A being raised
at the same time from p, the original vapor pressure, to p -\- dp, ?,o that
none of the liquid evaporates. The piston C moves down on account of
the expansion, dv^, of the liquid. (2) All the liquid is evaporated at
temperature T -\- d T, C moving to B, and A moving up to furnish the
volume, Vi. (3) The temperature is again brought to T; the pressure
on A to jo. A moves down on account of the contraction dv^. (4) All
the vapor is condensed and the original condition is restored. The
amounts of work done by the system in the several steps are : —
Fi = Pdv^,
F2 = - P (^2 + dv^) + (jo + dp) (fi + rfvi),
TF3 = — pdvi,
Wi = Pv^ — pvi.
