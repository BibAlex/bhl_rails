Next, suppose (t], ^)„ does contain terms in rj, but no term in rj", i. e. we
can express it in the form
where (tj, ^)„_r_s contains terms in both 7]"~''~' and ^-^' and 5 > 0.
Then if any transformation
is applied, there can be divided out of (77, ^)„ the factor ^" leaving behind
as the term of highest degree one in f]"''. This cannot be cancelled
with any term from another part (rj, C)n+i> foi" ^^J term from this would
have as a factor ^' after the C" has been divided out. As long, tlien, as
the rj variable does not enter to the highest degree in the expression
corresponding to (?;, ^),j if n > 0, the degree of the S factor is decreased
with each transformation, while the exponent of ^ outside may be in-
creased. Accordingly, by a finite number of transformations, we re-
duce the S factor either to an £ function or to an expression in which
the 7] variable enters to the highest degree in the collection of terms
of lowest order. In the former case we have the form required. In
the latter case, suppose for convenience that this condition holds for the
function S (rj, C)- By Weierstrass's Theorem we develop in the form
S(v, - Iv" + niOv"-' + + r„(0:\E(r],
=^T(r],OE(r,,0- (28)
Consider the n factors of T(r], Q,
T(r,, Q = Ulrj + S,(02. (29)

If the factors are not all equal, pair them off, so that in each pair there
will be two different factors, leaving a number of equal factors :
Now, for each pair,
we have the relation
^. + P.iv, oi^' = L^O $ 0, (31)

since the two factors are unequal. Then, by the same reasoning as used
