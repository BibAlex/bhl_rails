RICHARDS AND ARCHIBALD. — CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS. 357
less and less satisfactorily with the facts, the amount of mercury actually
found always exceeding the calculated amount. Evidently this disagree-
ment may be due to the fact that some of the new complex acid remains
in the uudissociated state ; the calculation considers only the ion, while
the mercury weighed in analysis constituted the sum total. The exact
calculation of the amount uudissociated is impossible for two reasons;
iu the first place, the mode of dissociation of such a tri-ionic compound as
ILHgCli is uncertain ; and in the next place, we have no data for the
extent of the dissociation of the compound beyond the strength of a nor-
mal solution.
In spite of this double uncertainty, it is possible to make an approxi-
mate calculation. This is sufficient to show that in a general way the
argument is sound. The approximate calculation is based upon the fact
that so far as the extent of dissociation of the complex acid is known, it
is equal to that of bydrochloric acid at the same concentration.* On mak-
ing the assumption that this relation holds in very strong as well as in
moderately strong solutions, and waiving entirely the uncertainty as to the
possible existence of the half-way ion HHgCl4', the proportion of the
