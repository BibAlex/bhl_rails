BLACK. THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A SINGULAR POINT. 287
present article, supply the deficiency, and treat at once the more general
case of an analytic surface, i. e., the case that the function F (ar, y, z) is
not merely a polynomial, but is any analytic function which vanishes
at the point (a, b, c.)

A. — The Fundamental Theorem.
1. The theorem, the proof of which forms the subject of this article,
is the following.
Theorem : Let F (x, y, z) be a function such that
1) F (x, i/, z) is analytic in the three independent variables in the
neighborhood of the point x = a, y = b, z = c ;
2) F(a, b,c) = 0;

then ive can represent all values of {x, y^ z) satisfying the equation
F{x,y, z)=0
and lying in the neighborhood of the point (a, b, c) :
|x-al<8, \y-b\<h, \z-c\<Z,
by a finite number of parametric formulae of the following type:
x — <i>p (u, v) 1
y = ,l;p(u, V) V p = 1, 2, p, (A)
where «/)p, \pp, Xp ^'"^ analytic in the arguments (it, v) throughout a cer-
tain region ; further for each set of values of (x, y, z), the values (0, 0, 0)
excepted, there corresponds for at least one value of p a pair of values
(m, v) lying within the region in which the functions 4>p, i//p, Xp <^^^ con-
sidered, and for any value of p for which this is the case, there corresponds
no second pair of values. To the set of values (0, 0, 0) corresponds at
least one, and in general an infinite number of pairs of values {u, v) for
every value of p.
2. Explanation of Symbols. The symbol (x, y, z, )„ indicates,
in the expression in which it appears, the total collection of terms
of degree n in the arguments taken together, which belong to that
expression.
