The order of the restricted system is ~ (I + m — n + 2), the order
of «Si.
We find the equation of the double spread 2„_2 on /S',,^!, by imposing
on the equations of the generating i^„_2 the conditions that they have two
common roots in the parameter. These conditions are,*

where there are I -\- m — 2 rows and I -\- m — 1 columns. This is a
restricted system equivalent to two independent equations ; the order of
the system is h (l + rn — I) (I + m — 2). On 2„_2 must be aS„_3. We
find the equations of 2„_3 by expressing the conditions that the equations
of the generating flat have three common roots in the parameter.! The
result is a restricted system similar in form to (II), in which, however,
there are only Z + ?« — 4 rows and I + m — 2 columns. This restricted
system is equivalent to three independent equations, and its order is ^
{I -\- m - 2) (/+/« — 3) (I + m — 4).
The equations of 2„_^ are found by expressing the conditions that the
equations of the generating (n — r)-flat have r roots in common. By an
extension of the previous method we derive a restricted system of the
same form as (II), in which, however, there are only I + m — 2 (r — 1)
rows and I -{- ?n — (r — 1) columns. This is a restricted system equiva-
