BLACK. — THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A SINGULAR POINT. 317
of 4 shows that the left side becomes divisible by ^""-Hf*. So we have
either
(m — 1) fi < qi or {tn — l)fj, < q^
and thus an upper limit for fi, the number of transformations which
leave the order of the singular point unchanged.
Now, to consider the transformation (33), we see that it is a one-
to-one transformation by which the surface remains analytic near the
origin, w^ (Q ^^^ wo (() contain no constant term, for otherwise the
factor
rjv + wi (Q or f;, -f c,)2 (0
could be combined with the £J factor. Then the transformation (33)
leaves the £ factors still £J factors, and the factors vanishing at the
origin still vanishing there. Also, it is easily seen that this transfor-
mation leaves the terms of type ((, •>/),„ still in the part (tV, -q^, Om'
Further, if the function $„(^^, 7y„, t,) goes over into X{^y, rji,, I), we have
9^_9X _ 9X91; _ 9X
9^v 9 $v 9^v 9iu 9 $v
and similar conditions hold for the partial derivative with reference to
r)y. Accordingly, if by the transformation (33) <I>„(fi., rji,, C) goes over
mto il{$v, rjv, C) ^^ replace equations (25), (26), and (27) by
A(f., v^, l)HCu ^., + Q. Cs, ^v, 0^= ^ e^ECU 0. (35)

Now, in a further succession of transformations of type (14) on the
surface Cl (^„, yji,, Q = 0, if tliere enters either a y or a S not 0, then on
the right side of equation (34) or (35) the only factor remaining outside
of the E factor is a power of ^, and we must finally have a reduction as
shown above. So it is only in the case in which all the y's and 8's of
the later transformations are that we are not already sure of reducing
the singularity. Now if in O (|i,, qy, Q there is any term of degree less
than m in if^, and rjy combined, such a succession of transformations must
reduce this term to a degree less than m and thus reduce the singularity.
