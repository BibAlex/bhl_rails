S'„_s. By means of an (?i — 3)-way developable lying in an (w — 2)-flat
and two arbitrary curves we can generate a ruled (u — Ij-spread by
taking all the (/t — 2) -flats that can be drawn through the enveloping
(« — 3)-flats of the developable so as to meet both curves.
We have seen that the section of an (n — l)-way developable by an
(n — l)-flat gave an (?? — 2) -way developable of the same nature, so
here the section of an (n — l)-spread ruled by (n — 2)-flats b}' an
(n — l)-flat gives an (n — 2)-spread of the same nature as the (n — 1)-
spread.
III. Loci derived from an (n — ^')-flat whose Equations
INVOLVE a Single Ahbitrary Parameter.
12. Description of the derwed loci.
We shall comj^lete the general theory by considering the locus of the
1-fold infinite system of (« — ^-j-flats, where 2 ^ k whose equations all
coutaia a single arbitrary parameter. Let the k equations of the flat be
A = 0, B = 0, . . . , (7=0.
The equations of the locus of these i^„_t's are found by eliminating the
parameter from these equations. The result is a restricted system
equivalent to ^^ — 1 independent equations.
The locus is an {n — k -{- l)-spread /S^.j^, ruled by the F„^^'s. Any
two consecutive i^„_t's intersect in an (n — 2 k)-^-a.t i^„_2i whose equa-
tions are
9A 9B
A = 0,^ = 0,B=0/^ = 0,....
If we eliminate the parameter from these equations, we derive a restricted
svstem equivalent to 2^—1 independent equations. The locus is an
(71 — 2 /t + l)-spread S„^2k+i ruled by the i^„_2i's ; it is a double spread
on S„_^.
Any three consecutive i^„_2*'s intersect in an {n — 3 X-)-flat F,^^ whose
equations are,
The elimination of the parameter from these equations gives a restricted
system equivalent to 3 ^' — 1 independent equations. Their locus is an
(ii — S k + l)~spread ruled by the F,,_o^'s.. aS^.^j+i is a triple spread on
