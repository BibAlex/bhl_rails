MORENO. — ON RULED LOCI IN W-FOLD SPACE. 157

a restricted system equivalent to 7i — 1 independent equations. If we
eliminate the coordinates between the equations of the flat and curve, we
derive a restricted system equivalent to ^ — 1 independent equations in
the parameters alone. These are the conditions that must be satisfied
for the (n — l-)-flat to meet the curve. In a similar way we may derive
a restricted system equivalent to k — p independent equations in the
parameters alone which are the necessary and sufficient conditions for
tlie (» — ^•)-flat to meet a certain p-spread where 1 ^ jo ^ ^- — 1. We
may have then curves, surfaces, . . . , or ;o-spread8 where 1 < jo < ^ — 1
for the director loci of a ruled (n — k + l)-spread. The numbers of loci
of each kind that must be taken are A, /x, . . . v, p, namely, non-negative
integers chosen to satisfy the equation
\{k—l) + iM(k — 2)+ + v.2 + p.l=k{n-k+l)-l.
If we consider a group of one or more points as a director locus of the
spread, we have to select integers to satisfy
K . k + \ {k — 1) + . . . . + p . 1 = k (n — k + 1) — 1.
We may apply this to special cases. The director loci of a ruled surfece
in three-fold space are three curves. We may take one curve and a
group of K points, in which case the ruled surface is reducible and has for
its components k cones whose vertices are the k points and whose
common base is the curve in question. In four-fold space the director
loci of a ruled surface may be five surfaces, three surfaces and one curve,
or one surface and two curves. The ruled surface in each case consist-
ing of all the lines that can be drawn to meet all the director loci. In
the same space the director loci of a three-spread ruled by planes may
be taken to be five curves.
If the director loci be all taken on any »S'„_t_,.i, then the locus of all the
(n — ^)-flats that can be drawn to meet these director loci will include
as one of its components the *S'„_j.+i in question ; it may or may not
have other components.
There are several special cases illustrative of these methods that can
be worked out in still greater detail. Some of these I hope to make the
subject of another jmper.
