BI.ACK. — THE NEIGHBORHOOD OP A SINGULAR POINT. 325
If n is taken large enough, the exponent
q, — ns
is made less than s, so that we have
s > q, — ns > 0,
or 1'- 1 < 7i < £f.

So the term for which — is least is among those first reached in which
the new exponent of ^ is lower than s.
In the same way we show that, by applying a succession of transfor-
P
mations of type (47), the term for which — is least is among the first
lot reached for which the new exponent of rj^ is less than s. But, by

the surface in form (48).
7. A further succession of quadratic transformations of type (43) as
applied to the surface in form (48) will reduce the singularity. This
follows at once by the reasoning in the first part of 5.
D. — Succession of Quadratic Transformations in which
THERE ARE REVERSALS OF TtPE.
8. A succession of transformations in which there is a sufficient num-
ber of reversals of type will secure a surface of type (42).
If there is but a finite number of reversals, after the last one we are in
the same position as at the start in 4, and the succession of trans-
formations which follows, not having any reversal of type, will enable us
to secure the condition derived by the method of 4. So we need here to
consider only the possibility of an indefinitely large number of reversals
of type.
In equation (37) consider any one of the coefficients
Pr(v,0 = tPriU) = tl{ri,On, + (77,On,+l + ]
where p^ (rj, 0)^0.
A transformation of type (40) will give for p^ a function from which we
