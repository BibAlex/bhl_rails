The equation of tl^e locus of all the lines that meet the spread twice at
(1) is A C^i = 0.
From the analogy of three-fold space, this locus of lines is called the
tangent {n — l)-flat to the {n — ])-spread, at the point (1).* At each
point of an {n — l)-spread there is in general a unique tangent (n — I)-
flat.
A j9-spread is given by the equations,
V=0,
w=o,
a restricted system equivalent to n — p independent equations. In a
similar manner the equations of the locus of all lines that meet the
jt)-spread twice at any non-singular point ( 1 ) are,
A ?7i zzr 0,
A Fl = 0,
Since these equations are linear we may select any n — p that are inde-
pendent and the rest are superfluous.! We have then a jo-flat which
from analogy is called the tangent p-flat to the /^-spread at the point (I).
At any point of a /(-spread there is in general a unique tangent p-^att
We define a tangent r-flat at a given point of the jO-spread where
r < p as an r-flat that lies in the tangent p-flat at that point and con-
tains the point. If r > p, we define a tangent ?--flat at a given point
as an r-flat that contains the tangent p-i\at at that point. The locus of
tangent lines then to a />-spread is simply the locus of tangent jo-flats to
the spread. The locus of tangent planes, 3-flats, . . . , (p — l)-flats is
this same locus. If then there are developables that arise from a
jo-spread, where 1 < /) their number is not so great as n — p — 1, for
* This proof is given in Dr. Story's Lectures on Hyperspace.
t Some of these equations may be satisfied identically ; this will be the case
when (1 ) is a multiple point on any of the [n — l)-spreads, but not a multiple point
on the /^-spread.
