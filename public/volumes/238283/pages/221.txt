in 4, the succession of transformations (14) which leaves the degree of
T unchanged will secure for equation (31) a form
The left side of the equation is divisible by ^^ and so the right side
must be,
V < X,
and we have an upper limit for y, the number of transformations which
leave the factor N^. of the second degree, and as a result leave the func-
tion T of the nth degree. So, unless the function T{rj, C) in (28) is
composed of ?^ equal factors of form
Lv + ^ (OT, (32)
the transformation of (14) will finally reduce its degree. Then, by ap-
plying the same reasoning to the resulting function, we see that finally
the function corresponding to S(r}, ^) either becomes an J^ function or
has besides the JiJ factor a factor of form (32), thus securing the form
(25) if we divide out the factor ^("•-D",
The condition (26) is secured by using on the second equation in
(20) the same kind of reasoning as applied in 4 and 5. Then we take
for V the larger of the two values required to secure conditions (25)
and (26).

6. A transformation
^V = iw — Wg (0 ) .ggs
Vv = rj„ — 0)1 (^) )
applied to the surface
^.(^., /i., =
in 5 will secure a form in which the singularity will be reduced by
either
1 ) a further succession of transformations as in 3,
2) the method of the Lemma, § 2.
Let us consider here the case in which either rj or r, in (25) and (26)
is zero. Then in one of the equations a further succession of trans-
formations of type (14) will not change the power of ^ as a factor on
the right ; and if there are /x such further transformations, the reasoning
