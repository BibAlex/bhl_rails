For very high temperatures no experimental data for the radiation
from carbon exist excepting the measurements described by Lucas, f It
has been rutlier the fashion to leave Lucas's work altogether out of
account as being hopelessly at variance with more recent results. Kay-

His results, nevertheless, which I have given graphically in Figure 24,
appear to me to be of significance. His formula for the relation of tem-
perature to current, t = 25 i, must of course be regarded as only ap-
proximately correct even at moderate temperatures. The curve for the
relation between the current i;i a carbon and the temperature, up to about
