ON THE HYDROCARBONS IN PENNSYLVANIA PETROLEUM
WITH BOILING POINTS ABOVE 216°.
Received March 24, 1902. Presented April 9, 1902.
In a former paper* the principal hydrocarbons in Pennsylvania,
Ohio, and Canadian petroleum below 216°, were shown to have the
composition represented by the general formula CnHgn + a- Concern-
inor the constituents with higher boiling points very little is known.
Pelouze and Cahours f collected distillates to which they gave the fol-
lowing formulas : —
216°-218° 236°-240° 255°-260° 280°
C13H28 C14H30 U15H32 C16H34
From paraffiue the following hydrocarbons have been separated (Beil-
stein's Handbook) : —
212°-215° 230°-235° 252°-255° 273°-275°
C13H28 ^14^130 ^15 "32 ^leHsi
So far as I am aware, these are the only allusions to the composition
of Pennsylvania petroleum in these portions. It appears that the dis-
tillations were made under ordinary atmospheric pressure in presence
of air with no attempts to avoid decomposition under these conditions.
Then, furthermore, as I have suggested in a former paper, the high
specific gravity of the distillates separated by Pelouze and Cahours
indicate that their distillates were obtained from Canadian petroleum.
It does not appear that any attempts have been made to ascertain the
molecular weights of the individual hydrocarbons. Indeed this has been
