These {n — 3)-flats may be cousidered as arising from the intersection
of two consecutive in — 2)-flats of the system of {ii — 2) -flats. Tlae
elimination of the parameter from these equations gives a restricted sys-
tem equivalent to two independent equations. The system represents an
(/i — 2)-spread, »S„_2, which is ruled by the (?i — 3)-flats.
In like manner r consecutive (ii — l)-flats of the system intersect in
an {n — r)-flat whose equations are
. . dA ^ 9'--' A ^
^ = 0, _^0,...^^ = 0.
Any of these (n — r)-flats may be considered as arising from the inter-
section of two consecutive (« — r -\- l)-flats of the system of (?2 — r + 1)-
flats that are the intersections of r — 1 consecutive (w — l)-flats of the
system. The elimination of the parameter from these equations gives
a restricted system equivalent to /' — 1 independent equations. These
equations represent an (ii — r + l)-spread, *S„_,. + i, which is ruled by the
1-fold infinite system of (n — r)-flats.
The locus of the intersections of n consecutive (n — l)-flats of the
system is a curve, while n -\- 1 consecutive (w — 1) -flats do not in
general have any common intersection.
We will use S^ to denote that one of the related spreads of this system
that is of k ways. It is geometrically evident that each one of these
spreads is a developable spread.*
Considered in this light we see that the (n — 2)-spread is a double
spread on »S'„_i corresponding to the cuspidal edge or edge of regression
in ordinary threefold space. f
The *S'„_o is a double spread on a^„_2, etc., and *S'i on /S'2. We see also
that ^„_3 is a triple spread on S„_i ; Killing calls it doubly stationary.
Finally, Si is an (w — l)-tuple curve on S^-i ; it is a multiple curve on
all the other spreads of the system. J
