a more prolonged exposure at high temperatures, and that thus it might
be possible to extend the measurements beyond the point reached with
the rods of black surface. This was found to be the case.
As has already been indicated in a previous paragraph, the indications
of a thermo-junction at these high temperatures was subject to serious
suspicion. I was obliged to content myself, therefore, with estimations of

the temperature based upon the difference of potential between the ter-
minals of the rod. Fortunately the relation between the electromotive
force and the temperature up to 1400° was of such a character that but
little error was to be feared in extrapolating. The relation between
electromotive force in volts and temperature is shown in Figure 21.
From this curve temperatures above HOC were determined.
