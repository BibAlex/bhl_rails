in which form the parameter no longer appears. Any p + 1 consecutive
i^„_i's intersect in the same i^„_p_i as any other consecutive p -\- \ ;
i. e., all the -F„_i's of the system contain the same F^_p_-i^. Any p-flat
that does not meet this i^i_p_i cuts »S'„_i in a developable (/> — l)-spread
of order 2 {p — 1). This developable {p— l)-spread of order 2 (/> — 1)
lying in a ;j-flat is exactly similar to the case in /j-fold space where
m = n. The curve at the base of this system is of order p\ it is the
rational normal curve of p-fold space. Hence we may derive this system
by joining by lines all points of a developable {p — l)-spread of order
2 (p — 1) in a j9-fold space, to all points of an (n — p — l)-flat that does
not meet the p-flat that contains the {p — l)-spread. <S„_x is a conoid
of (n — 2)-flats with an (n — p — l)-way head. The generating -F„_2'3
of Sn_i arise from the junction of the (m — p — l)-way head with the
generating (p — 2) -flats of the (p — 1) -spread. The generating F„_s3
of *S'„_2 arise from the junction of the {n — p — l)-way head with the
system of generating (p — 3)-flats of the (p — 2)-spread, and so on.
Any conoid ruled by a 1-fold infinite system of y-flats with a (q — l)-way
head is a developable spread, but not so if it has only an r-way head
where r ^ q — 2. The latter spread is a developable only when the
consecutive g'-flats have {q — l)-way intersection. Any conoid ruled
by a 1-fold infinite system of (n — 2)-flats that have an (n — 3) -flat in
common is a developable, but if they have only an (n — ^)-flat in com-
mon where A; ^ 4, the conoid may or may not be developable. The
cones and conoids with a 2-fold infinite system of generators are not
developables at all.
The points of intersection of two consecutive generators are not in
general points of intersection of three generators. The equations of
a generator may be written
e+(^-l)rf+ ('"-'H'"-^^ + .... = 0,
/+(,„-i). + ('"-'H"'-^) rf+.... = o.
The points of intersection of three generators of the system are given
by the equations
