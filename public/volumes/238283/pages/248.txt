RICHARDS AND ARCHIBALD. â€” CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS. 351
These facts, together with similar facts concerning solutions of three
other chlorides, are represented in the accompanying diagram. Evidently
the first parts of the four curves are very similar in tendency, but as the
highest concentrations are reached, the curves develop individuality.
Mercuric Chloride found in various Solutions.

0.2
0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 O.a
0.9 1.0
The ordinates represent equivalent concentrations of the solvent chlorides, and
the abscissae represent grams of mercuric chloride per litre of solution. Tlie data
for baric, calcic, and hydric chlorides are to be found on pages 352, 353, and 354.
Manifestly some particular property of the several solutions must be
responsible for the reaction ; and since the reaction results in raising the
quantivalence of the mercury, it may be concluded that the particular
pi'operty in question is the tendency of some molecular species already
in the solution to combine with mercuric chloride.
