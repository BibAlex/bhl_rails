Tliis is 0.017 per cent more than the average of the preceding series.
Probably a mean of the average of the two series, or +0.050 per cent,
represents as nearly as possible the correction to be applied to Lord
Rayleigh's voltameter. This value is not only an average of averages,
involving twenty-three determinations, but is also very nearly the mean
between the two extreme results 0.012 and 0.093. It may probably be
relied upon to within 0.01 per cent of the total weight of the silver.
It finds support in some results given in Kahle's * paper. He made a
comparison between an ordinary voltameter and one in which the anode
solution was constantly siphoned off and thus prevented, more or less
perfectly, from reaching the kathode. The solution in both voltameters
was strongly acid, but equally so. The siphon voltameter de[)osited, in
good agreement with the above results, O.Oo per cent less silver than
the ordinary voltameter.
The fact, however, that the extremes vary from .012 per cent to .093
per cent indicates that unless great care is taken in the way in which
the anode is wrapped, in the strength of the current and in the size of
the anode, the depositions in the ordinary voltameter according to Lord
Rayleigh are untrustworthy.
