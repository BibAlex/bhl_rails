or of equal simplicity containing the fugacit}' instead of the vapor
pressure. Let us proceed to the determination of the laws according
to which fugacity changes with changes in the variables upon which
the condition of a substance depends, considering in the present paper
only those systems which are composed of a single chemically simple
substance.
III.
Influence of Temperature and Pressure on the Fugacity.
Let us consider two phases of a substance at the same temperature
and pressure, but not necessarily in equilibrium with each other. A
solvent may be chosen in which both phases are soluble without molecu-
lar change, and to so slight an extent that the saturated solutions may
be regarded as infinitely dilute. In such a case the solubility of each
phase is governed by the following equation, which may be obtained
directly from equations (2) and (3),

in which 11 is the osmotic pressure of the saturated solution and Q the
reversible heat of solution (that is, inclusive of the osmotic work). We
may write for the two phases,

Q^ — Q„ may be conveniently replaced in the following way. Let one
gram-molecule of the first phase be dissolved in the solvent, this solution
then diluted or concentrated to the osmotic pressure lis, and then the
gram-molecule removed as the second phase. If these three steps be
done reversibly the heat absorbed in each will be respectively

The total heat change is a function only of the conditions of the two
phases, not of the path by which one passes into the other, and may be
designated by ^1,2, thus,
