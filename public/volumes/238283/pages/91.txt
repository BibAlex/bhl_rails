tive F„_{s intersect ia an i^„_2, three in an i^„_3, r in an I\_r, n — 2
in an F2 or plane, n — I in an Fi or line, ?i in an Fq or point. There
is a 1-fold infinite system of these F„_2S which are generators of aS'„_j,
a 1-fold infinite system of i^„_3's, generators of S,^_2, a 1-fold infinite
system of lines generators of S2, the developable surface.
Through any F„_2 there pass two consecutive -^„_i's, through any F„_^
there pass three consecutive i^„_i's, through any Fq, n consecutive F„_^'s.
Through any i^„_3 there pass two consecutive i^„_2's, through any F„_i
there pass two consecutive i^„_3's and three consecutive i''„_2's, and so on.
We may then reverse this process and start with the curve of the
system. Through any two consecutive points of the curve there passes
a line, an F^, through any three consecutive points an osculating plane,
an F2, through any four consecutive points an osculating 3-flat, an F^,
through any n — consecutive points an osculating (n— l)-flat, an F^_^*
That these operations may give unique results this curve must lie in
the n-fold space and in no flat space of a less number of ways. If the
curve lie in a ^'-flat, where k ^ n — 1, all the ^-flats through ^ -f 1 con-
secutive points coincide and definite (k -f l)-flats are not determined at
all. By a theorem of Clifford, such a curve must be of an order as
great as n.f
This theorem has been generalized by Veronese.l
Let us consider any curve in ?i-fold space whose equations are,
</> = 0, X = 0, . . . . V' = 0,
a restricted system equivalent to h — 1 independent equations. The
equations of the tangent at any point P' of this curve are linear equa-
tions whose coefficients are functions of the n non-homogeneous co-
ordinates, x', y', . . . . v'. The same thing is true of the equations of
any of the osculating flats at the point P'. The osculating (n — l)-flat
is given by a single equation, the coefficients of which are functions of
these n quantities x', y', . . . v'. If we regard these as n parameters
they are connected by the equations,
,^' = 0, x' - 0, . . . . .^' = 0,§
* We shall say a A-flat osculates a curve if it contains k + 1 consecutive
points of it. Killing, loc. cit.
