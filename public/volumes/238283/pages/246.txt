Introduction.
Long ago Miahle observed that a concentrated solution of common
salt acts upon calomel with the formation of small amounts of mercuric
chloride.* Many years afterwards, one of us,t without knowing of his
work, rediscovered this reaction, and found that the fluctuations in the
potential of the " normal calomel electrode " of Ostwald, are due to its
disturbing influence. At that time it was shown that the reaction is
much diminished by dilution, and hence that a decinormal solution is far
better as an electrolyte than a normal solution. The "decinormal
electrode," thus recommended for the first time, has since come into
common use.
It was shown also that neither light nor oxygen are important causes
in effecting the decomposition, but that the reaction is much furthered by
increase of temperature. No attempt was made at the time to fathom
the matter, but a suggestion was made that the reaction might be due to
the catalytic action of the ionized chlorine of the dissolved chloride.
The investigation of the problem which was at that time promised has
now been continued, and the object of this paper is to show that while the
second condition of this suggestion seems probable, the first does not hold.
Another example is thus afforded of the frequently recurring circum-
stance of the removal of a reaction from its classification among catalytic
phenomena after better acquaintance with its nature.
