two consecutive i^„_2r's determine one i^„_2(r-i) except in the case that
r = -. "We cannot then start with a curve and retrace our steps ; two
consecutive points of the curve S^ do not determine uniquely a plane of
the system. The FJ% of the system in general intersect consecutively
in the points of S-^. Starting with such a system of planes we may
retrace our steps. Through any two consecutive planes of the S^ we
may pass a four-flat. These four-flats are generators of ^S's. Through
any two consecutive F^^ we may pass six-flats ; they are the generators
of S-j. Finally through any two consecutive i^_4's pass {n — 2)-flats ;
they are generators of »S'„_i. We may retrace our steps only in case we
do not begin with aS'i.

Let the equation of such a ruled {n — l)-spread S^_x be
<^ = 0.
We shall show that the equations of the generating flats of the spread
may be represented by linear equations involving a single parameter.
The equation in homogeneous coordinate of an arbitrary (ii — 2)-flat in
w-fold space may be written
X = ai z -\- ^i s -\- . . . . + yiW
y = ao z + /32 s + ...• + 72 w.
In this form the equations of the (n — 2) -flat, which we may call the
(n — 2)-flat^-6, involve 2 (ti — 1) independent arbitrary parameters.
These parameters must be connected by 2 (n — I) — 1 equation to make
A B a generator of such an (n — l)-spread. "We wish to connect these
parameters in such a way that A B will be a generator of the *S'„_i in
question. The equations of a curve on ^ are
<^ =z 0, C7i = 0, ZZs = 0, . . . U„_o = 0.
If we eliminate the coordinates between these equations and the equa-
tions of ^ 5 we derive a single equation in the 2 (n — V) parameters.
This resulting equation is the necessary and sufficient condition for A B
to meet the curve. In a similar way we may derive 2 (« — 1) — 1
such conditions and make A B meet 2 (« — 1) — 1 curves on ^. If
from these 2 (n — 1) — 1 equations and the equations of ^ 5 we elimi-
