BLACK. — THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A SINGULAR POINT. 293
where g^ has a term in ^'^'^ free from 7/1 and ^, since a^ — a^, ^ 0. So
there are near the point (0, 0, 0) /i,^ values off satisfying the equation
g^ = for every pair of values of 771 and ^ in the neighborhood of the
point 7;i = 0, ^ = 0. Now, for any such set of values of $ , t^i, ^,
different from the set (0, 0, 0), satisfying the equation g — 0, there is
a corresponding set of values of f, 77, ( satisfying the equation 4> ($, rj, ^)
= 0, their coordinates being connected by the relations (2), (6), and (6'),
which are equivalent to the required relation (4). Also by considering
s _
the other factors of 11 ($ — a^)'^'^, we get (s — 1) other equations of form
(7), the corresponding coordinates being connected by relations of
form (4).
No two points (f, rj, ^), (|', rj', tj) of T (distinct from (0, 0, 0)), de-
rived from points (f^, 77^, ^j) (f^„ tj^, ^2) lying respectively in the neigh-
borhoods of the singularities which are given by two distinct equations
can be the same. For suppose
^ = 4^' = ^: (f<, + a^) = 4 (4' + «a')
^ == C = Ci =C.
Then we must have
4 + a<r = 4' + «<r''
and, by taking the neighborhoods of the singularities in question suffi-
ciently small, we can insure that the difference ^^ — ^^, is less in abso-
lute value than the difference u , — a . In a similar manner it is shown
that, if the equation y = 0, regarded as an equation in f , has equal
roots for all values of 771, ^ in the neighborhood of the point 771 = 0,
^ = 0, the equation 4> = must also have equal roots at the corre-
sponding points, and this case has been excluded. So as each equation
^r = has near the point (0, 0, 0) ^ values of ^ ? in general distinct,
for each pair of values of 7/1 and ^, and as 2 // = m, the collection of
equations
9^ = ^^ 0-= 1, 2, s,
has within sufficiently small limits as many different roots as the equa-
