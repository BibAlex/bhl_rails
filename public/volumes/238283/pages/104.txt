a restricted system equivalent to two inde^Dendent equations. Tlie
tangent planes at P' and P", any two consecutive points, have for their
equations
9U> 9U'
d x' 3 y
9V' 9 V
AV' = x'^+y%^ + .... = 0,
9 x' d y'
and
/52 U' 9'^ U' \
Let us take the first two equations in each set to be independent, then
the rest are superfluous. Since P' and P" are points of the surface,
U' =0
F' =0
9U'

V" = V + ^dx' + = 0,

From these three sets of equations we derive

These four equations are homogeneous in the five differentials dx',

eliminate the other four. We have
