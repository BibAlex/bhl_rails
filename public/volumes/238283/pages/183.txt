Many specimens agree with the descriptiou of C. Mexicana J. Ag., but
all intermediate forms occur, and often the same individual will agree with
one species in one part of the frond, with the other in other parts.
E. Mitchellae Harv. ? Kingston, March, 1893, Nos. 141, 142,372,
H. Not exactly like the type of this species, the plurilocular sporangia
being longer and sometimes clavate. Possibly E. Duchassaingianus
Grunow.
Striaria attenuata (Ag.) Grev. Montego Bay, June, 1900, washed
ashore on sandy beach, P. & B.
S. attenuata var. ramosissima (Kuetz.) Hauck. With the type, June,
1900, P. & B.
Colpomenia sinuosa (Roth) Derb. & Sol, On coral rocks, Port Anto-
nio, March 8 and 23, 1893, Nos. 153 and 212; Port Maria, March 17,
1893, No. 273, H. Anuotto Bay to Port Antonio, in shallow water,
Aug., 1894, P. & B.
Hydroclathrus cancellatus Bory. On coral rocks, Port Antonio, Feb.
10, 1893, No. 234, H.
Cutleria sp. A single specimen, attached to a frond of Udotea flabel-
lata, seems to be the Aglaozouia form of some Cutleria, but in the absence
of fruit it is indeterminable. The frond consists of radiating articulate
filaments, united laterally, and varying much in diameter.
Turbinaria trialata Kuetz. Washed ashore, Port Antonio, March 8,
1893, No. 211 ; in tide pools, Port Maria, March 16, 1893, No. 249, H.
Washed ashore, Port Antonio, July, 1891 ; Montego Bay, July, 1900,
P. & B. P. B.-A., No. 774. T. vulgare, Sloane, is undoubtedly this
species.
Sargassum bacciferum (Turn.) Ag. Washed ashore. Port Maria,
March 18, No. 248, H. Sloane, Chitty.
S. lendigerum (L.) Kuetz. Washed ashore, Port Antonio, July,
1891, P. & B. In tufts in tide pools. Port Maria, March 17, 1893, No.
292, H.
S. platycarpum Mont. Washed ashore. Port Antonio, July, 1891, P.
& B. Same locality, March 8, 1893, No. 210, H. P. B.-A., No. 775.
S. vulgare Ag. Washed ashore, Port Maria, March 18, 1893, No.
247, H. The references to Sloane and Chitty are doubtful, and some
other form may have been referred to under this name.
S. vulgare forma ovata n. f. Washed ashore, Montego Bay, June,
1900, P. & B. P. B.-A., No. 776. Leaves thick, dark, ovate to subor-
biculate, coarsely and sharply, sometimes doubly toothed, usually slightly
oblique at the base. The branching is dense, the leaves numerous and
