0.7830 at io, and 0,7816 at ^o. Krafft gave 0.7768 as the specific grav-
ity of CigHss at 28°. A determination of the molecular weight of the
purified hydrocarbon confirmed its formula : —
1.1003 grm. of the oil and 19.65 grms. benzol gave a depression of 0.941.

This molecular weight, showing that the hydrocarbon boiling at 300°
is octodecane, does not agree with Kraflt's conclusion as to the formula
of the hydrocarbon obtained from stearic acid. In heating stearic acid
with hydriodic acid KrafFt assumed that all the oxygen is removed,
leaving intact the carbon of the carboxyl, with the formation of octo-
decane. But when this work was done the only means of verifying the
•formula was by analysis, which was sufficient to determine the series,
but not the individual members of the series. While the results of
Krafft's combustions gave almost exact values for the formula CigHgg, the
size of the molecule could not be determined. Krafft looked upon the
hydrocarbon boiling at 303° as having the formula C17H36.
The specific gravity of the oil after cooling and filtration was some-
what higher than before, 0.8110 at 20°, and higher than the specific
gravity of the filtered solid octodecane, 0.7830. The molecular weight
of the filtered oil was the same as before filtration.
0.9904 grm. of the substance and 16.10 grms. benzol gave a depression
of 1°.184.

A combustion of the liquid hydrocarbon showed some change in the
proportions of carbon and hydrogen : —
0.1483 grm. of the substance gave 0.4636 grm. CO2 and 0.1954 grm. HoO.

While there is a narrow difference in calculated percentages between
the two formulae, the percentages found, together with the higher specific
gravity, indicate that the filtered oil was a mixture of the two series C„H„2
and H„C2n+2-
