order. That is to say, the solution tension of a metal appears to be
associated with the excess of affinity of the metal for hydroxyl over its
affinity for itself, and intensity of potential seems to be associated with
intensity of atomic compression. The inference to be drawn from this
comparison is of coarse that the formation of the metallic ion in water is
connected with the affinity of the metal for water, — an affinity
which manifests itself even when both of the " bonds" of oxygen are
filled.* Similar attraction for nitrogen or sulphur would explain cases
in which the solvent does not contain oxygen.
If this is true, contraction should take place when salts are dissolved
in water. This inference is amply verified by facts. In some cases the
solution occupies even less space than the water alone, involving a total
contraction greater than the volume of the salt itself. The best known
of these cases are those of lithic, sodic, and baric hydroxides, and
* Briihl has suggested that oxygen is the cause of dissociation, but he ascribes
it rather to quadrivalence than to a general affinity.
