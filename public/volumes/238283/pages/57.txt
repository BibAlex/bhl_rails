The value of h for a perfect gas may be found from the second of the
above conditions, equation (21). For a perfect gas, according to the
definition of fugacity,
ij/ = P, and therefore
We see, therefore, that the value of h which satisfies the condition of
equation (21) is expressed by a far simpler function than entropy is.
Let us see whether this value for the perfect gas is consistent with the
other condition that,
dh= ±dS.
For a perfect gas the following equations for isothermal change are
familiar :
dQ Pdv vdP RdP p,, ^
db = ~ = -^ — ~ = p— = — RdlnP,
and from equation (22),
d h =^ R d In Pj hence, for constant temperature,
dh = -dS, (23)
and the condition is satisfied. The value R\n P satisfies both the above
conditions for h in the case of a single state, the perfect gas. Moreover,
every substance is capable of being brought into the state of a perfect
gas isothermally by evaporation and indefinite expansion. Consequently
it is easy to show that for any state of a substance either of the two
conditions will define a value of h which is consistent with the other
condition. Thus by the first condition, expressed now by equation (23),
the difference in value of h between two states of a substance is equal to
the difference in entropy and opposite in sign, that is,
h. — ho ^ 02 — *Ji'
If we choose as the second state the vapor of the substance at such a
low pressure, P.,, that the vapor may be regarded as a perfect gas,
A2 == ^In Po, from equation (22), and the last two equations give,
h, = S,-S, + R In P„ (24)
in which -S, represents the entropy of the vapor at pressure Po. This
equation furnishes a complete definition of the value of h for any state.
Let us see whether this value satisfies the other condition of equation
(21).
