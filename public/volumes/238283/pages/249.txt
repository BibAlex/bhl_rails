This conclusion concerning the action of the substances on mercurous
chloride is reinforced by the facts concerning the extent to which mer-
curic chloride is dissolved by solutions of various chlorides. Solutions of
sodic chloride dissolve amounts of mercuric chloride which increase with
the amounts of common salt present, until the saturation point is reached,
while solutions of hydrochloric acid dissolve a maximum of mercuric
chloride at a concentration of acid of seven times normal, remaining
almost constant in action upon further concentration.*
The parallelism between the tendency of these soluble chlorides to dis-
solve mercuric chloride on the one hand, and their tendency to decompose
mercurous chloride on the other hand, is thus rather striking.
In addition to the four chlorides given iu the tables, cadmic chloride
was used in a special series of experiments. The solution after digestion
with calomel was analyzed by immersing in it a roll of clean copper
gauze, which was dried and weighed, and then ignited in hydrogen and
weighed again. Preliminary experiments showed this to be a convenient
and sufficiently accurate method of determining mercury in the presence
of cadmium.
Although solutions of 2, 4, and 8 times normal were used, in no case
