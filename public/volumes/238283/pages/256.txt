In order to obviate the difficulty aud exclude air a glass jacket was
slipped over the joint between the tubes. The construction and use of
this jacket will be made clear by reference to the accompanying drawing.

A, outer porcelain tube fitted with ground glass joint B ; C, inner porcelain tube
with ground-glass stopper D ; E, boat containing oxide and carbon ; F, furnace ;
G, glass jacket; H, H, H, H, packing of asbestos wool; I, weighing bottle; L,
tube for admitting nitrogen, sliding within tube M through rubber connection N,
and carrying at its end stopper of weighing bottle ; P, sublimate ; R, rod for
removing sublimate.
The jacket was drawn down at the ends, so as to fit the porcelain
tubes A and C as well as possible, and the spaces between the tubes and
the jacket were packed tightly with asbestos wool. This packing makes
a joint sufficiently tight to withstand a pressure equal to that of eight or
ten centimeters of water. The jacket was provided with a long tube, M,
within which slid a second tube, L, connection being made by means of
the short piece of rubber tubing, N. To the end of the inner tube was
attached, by platinum wires, the stopper, 0, of the weighing bottle. The
outside diameter of L was very little less than the inside diameter of
M, thus leaving very little space between the walls of the two tubes.
For this reason, and also on account of the length of the tube M, — about
fifteen centimeters, — there was little danger of bromine diffusing up in
sufficient quantities to attack the rubber connection, N. Even if this
were the case there could be no possibility of contamination of the sub-
