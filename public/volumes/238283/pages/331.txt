= = Spikelets remote, the uppermost strongly divaricate-pedunculate ; the lower-
most subtended by a long leaf-like bract : perigynia beaked.
36. C. TRiSPEKMA, Dewey. — Figs. 131, 132. — Culms almost fili-
form, 2 to 7 dm. long, usually much overtopping the soft narrow (0.5 to
2 mm. wide) leaves: the 2 or 3 spikelets, 2- to 5-jlowered: the finely
many-nerved perigynia 3.3 to 3.8 mm. long, 1.6 to 1.8 mm. broad,
slightly exceeding the ovate-oblong pale obtuse to mucronate-acumiuate
scale. — Am. Jour. Sci. ix. 63, t. 3, fig. 12; Hook. Fl. Bor.-Am. ii. 213;
Schwein. & Torr. 1. c. 311 ; Carey, 1. c. 543; Boott, 1. c. i. 29, t. 74;
Bailey, Froc. Am. Acad. xxii. 144; Macoun, 1. c. 122; Britton, 1. c.
353, fig. 855; Howe, 1. c. 35. — Mossy woods and bogs, Newfound-
land and Labrador to Saskatchewan, south to northern Pennsyl-
vania, Ohio, Michigan, and Nebraska (according to Webber), and in
the mountains to Garrett Co., Maryland. Ascending to 770 m. in
the New England mountains. June-Aug.
++ ++ Perigynia 1.2 to 1.5 mm. long, nerveless, with a very short broad truncate
beak, or beakless : culms wiry : spikelets 3 to 5, closely flowered, in a
greenish-brown or straw-colored linear spike.
37. C. elachycarpa. — Figs. 133, 134. — Tufted, the stif slender
culms 3 or 4 dm. high, strongly scabrous above, longer than the soft
narrow (1 to 2 mm. broad) green leaves: spike 0.5 to 1.5 cm. long;
the cqjpressed asceiiding narrowly ovoid approximate or slightly remote
spikelets 3 to 6 mm. long : perigynia oblong, plump, smooth and nerveless,
subtruncate at base, shorter than the oblong-ovate acuminate dull-brown,
green-ribbed scales. — Maine, wet sandy river bank, Fort Fairfield, June
29, 1899 {M. P. Cook, E. L. Shaw & M. L. Fernald). A unique
plant, in maturity strongly suggesting an immature slender form of C.
echinata, or the little-known C. helvola, Blytt, which, however, have
very different perigynia.
■*- -1- Perigynia broadly elliptic to suborbicular : spikes mostly tinged with
brown.
++ Terminal spikelet with conspicuous ciavate sterile base : perigynia rather
abruptly contracted to the slender beak.
= Spikelets mostly distinct, the lowest 4 or 5 mm. thick.
38. C. NORVEGiCA, WiLLD. — Figs. 135, 136. — Glaucous Q.ndi freely
stoloniferous ; culms smooth and soft, 1 to 4.5 dm. high, mostly over-
topping the soft flat rather narrow (1 to 2.5 mm. broad) leaves : spike
