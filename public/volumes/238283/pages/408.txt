MABERY. — THE COMPOSITION OF PETROLEUM. 671
TeTRADECANE, C14H30.
The fraction 142° -143°, collected after the twenty -fourth distillation,
gave as its specific gravity, after drying over sodium, 0.7848. After
agitating with concentrated sulphuric acid, washing, and drying over
sodium, it gave 0.7847. After treatment with fuming sulphuric acid it
gave 0.7814; this determination, like the others, was made at 20°.
A determination of the molecular weight of this fraction purified with
fuming sulphuric acid gave the following result : —
I. 1.1049 grm. of the oil and 36.8505 grms. benzol gave a depression
of 0°.735.
II. 1.052 grm. of the oil and 35.970 grms. benzol gave a depression
of0°.7l8.

A combustion gave the following percentages of carbon and hydrogen :
0.1502 grm. of the oil gave 0.4698 grm. CO2 and 0.2024 grm. H2O.

This specimen was purified with common concentrated acid ; another
portion purified with fuming sulphuric acid gave slightly different pro-
portions : —
0.1458 grm. of the oil gave 0.4532 grm. CO2 and 0.1970 grm. H.,0.
Calculated for Cj^^H^ Found.

H 15.16 15.02
The boiling point of this fraction under 760 mm. was 236°-238°. On
account of decomposition when the oil is distilled in air, it is ditficult to
determine the boiling point with great precision.
A determination of the index of refraction of this hydrocarbon gave
1.4360, which corresponds to the following molecular refraction : —
