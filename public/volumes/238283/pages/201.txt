the coordinates being connected by the relations
By the neighborhood of the line
is here meant the set of points (f, -q, C) which satisfy the condition
The singularities of the surfaces
ffr (^^' V, 0=0
at the points (0, 0, 0) are at most of order m. Their further proper-
ties will be considered later.
Let G be an arbitrarily chosen (large) positive quantity, 8 a second
suitably chosen j^ositive quantity : then any point of T, for which
\^\<GU\, \v\<G\C\, 0<\i\<8,
is carried by the transformation (4) into one of the neighborhoods above
considered on the surfaces y^ = 0. If ^ = 0, but ^, r] do not both van-
ish, then the point (f, rj, Q is carried by (5) into one of the neighbor-
hoods considered on the surfaces g^ = 0.
In (3), the function <^ ($, r}) contains the term f "* by 3, 2). Apply the
transformation
V-^^Vi. (6)
whence (3) takes the form
^ a, V, = r [<^i (?, vi) + (xi (I vi^ 0].
In 4>i (t? Vi)f take out all terms not containing rji, so that
i>i (i, Vi) = n (^ â€” a^) -f 7/1 1//1 (^, Tji), fii + + ft, = m.
Then make the transformation
^-a. = 4 (6')
and we have
