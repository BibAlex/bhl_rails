has a singular point at
M = 1, V = I,
So the first transformation is
•« = (r + i)n
w= U
which, applied to (k), gives
mr'-cr' + raO =0 (m)
and
x(v,n^)=C'<T'a'+^). (n)
Now the set of transformations to which Kobb is naturally led in this
case is the following : — *
T = TiCl O- = O-i^i t = ^1
Tl = To 4 tTi = 0-2 4 ^1 = (l
whence
But this substitution in (n) gives
in which the exponent of ^^ increases indefinitely with r.
6. In the case in which the curve
«A (t, cr) 3-
has multiple factors, the regular points of such factors taken in 1 , 4) c
are possibly singular points of the surface, whose domains are repre-
sented by equations of form (e). When a further quadratic transfor-
mation is applied to such a point, we are not warranted in assuming
that the resulting developments will represent the whole of the domain
of the point considered.! Kobb makes this assumption in proposing to
* This set, combined with the transformation (1), possesses all the properties
required by Kobb in (g), (h), and (i) ; its appearance here invalidates his proof.
It can easily be shown, moreover, that the most general set of transformations
wliich he could use in this case would produce the same condition as shown here.
t The development about the point first considered, to begin with, is a relation
