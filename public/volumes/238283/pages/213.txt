mi being the lowest degree of any term in Xi and z together, and
F{xi^y^ z) including all terms of degree higher than m^ in the two
variables Xi, z. Each coefficient p„ {v) ™ay be divisible by a power
of y, y. In that case, however, m,i must be less than w, for the term
in Xi'" is present in 4>i (xj, y, z).
By means of a transformation with non-vanishing determinant,
$1 can be thrown into the form :
*i (xi, y, z) — <I>2 (xo, y, 20) =
9o(y)a:2"'' + qi(y)xr-'^-2 + + g„n(.i/)-2"^ + ^2(^2, y, ^2) = (ri)
where ^o (y) ^ 0.
Consider first the points of the circle \y\ < h at which ^o (y) =■ ^5 if
such exist. Each one of these points y^, (i = 1, 2, k) is a singu-
lar point of ^2 = of order not greater than m, and its neighborhood
l^il<f' \y-yi\<^> \^\<^
may be chosen arbitrarily small.
Surround each of these points in the
circle \y\ = h hj A circle of arbitrar-
ily small radius c'. We now proceed
to consider the region about an arbi-
trary point a of the circle \y\ < h not
lying in any of the regions just cut
out. Let
yi^y — a
and let 4>2 then be written in the form
*2 (a;25 y^ ^2) = ^2 (a^2, yz, ^2) =
70(^2)3^2'"' + 9i (^2) a^2"' ~' 2:2 -f + q„,^ (^2)^2"'' + ^2_0^2, ^2, ^2)

3. Apply to the function ^2 the quadratic transformation
X2 — 'l'3'^2-
* Here, for the first time, a quadratic transformation of the type that trans-
forms but a single variable is employed. Such transformations do not occur in
Kobb's analysis. They appear to be indispensable.
