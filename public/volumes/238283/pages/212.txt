BLACK. — THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A SINGULAR POINT. 305
on a finite number of regions ti, T2, t , which fall into two
categories : —
1) the region Ti(i ■= \, 2, k) is the neighborhood of a singular
point of order < m ;
2) each of the neighborhoods of 1) having been determined arhitrarily
small, the region tj ( i ^= k -\- 1 , v) is then a regidar piece of an
analytic surface, represented in its whole extent by a single set of para-
metric formulae of the type {A).
By the neighborhood of the curve
x+p(y) = 0, 2 = 0,
is meant the set of points (x, y, z) satisfying the relation
\y\<h, \z\<h, \x + p{y)\<^.
B. — Proof of the Lemma.
2. To prove the lemma we begin by expressing equation (a) by means
of ifi) in the form
«D {x, y,z) = lx+p (^)]"' E(x, y) + z^{x,y,z)z^O, (y)
and then making the transformation
x-\- p{y)=x^, (S)
thus obtaining the equation
$(a;, y, z) = ^^(x^, y, z) = x{'E{x^, y) + z^^{xi, y, z) = 0. (y')
Here, the function E{xi, y) is analytic and different from zero in the
neighborhood of any point Xi ^ 0, y = yQ, Qy^ | < h), which corresponds
to the neighborhood of the point x^ = ;; (yo)i y^^ and hence E (xi, y) is
analytic throughout a region including in its interior the region
if the positive quantity € is suitably chosen. A similar remark ap-
plies to the analytic character of the function ij/i (xi, y, 2), and hence
$1 (xi, y, 2) is an analytic function of its three arguments throughout
a region including in its interior the region
l^il < e> \y\< h, |^|<s.
Now express equation (y') in the form
"^1 (a^n y, «) = 2p,. (y) x{!? + F{x^, y,z) = Q^ («)
