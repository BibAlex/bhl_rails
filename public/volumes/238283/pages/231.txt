Then, for a transformation of type (49), supposing the new K's to be
K/, K/, we have
K/ = Ks + n„
K/ = K, + n„
and so
K/ - KJ = Kt- Ks - (n. - n,) < K, - K,.
Also, for a transformation of type (50), if the new II's are IT/ 11/, we
have
n/ = n, + K„
n/ = n, + K„
and
IT/ - n/ = n, - n, - (k, - k,) < n, - n,.
So when a condition of type (52) holds, any transformation applied will
reduce the difference of either the II's or K's, if in fact it does not
change the sien of the difference. Further, the reduction is each time
by a value not infinitesimal, for it is at least 1 j st, as is seen by con-
sidering the values of K;. and IT,, in (51). So the succession of trans-
formations of whatever kind must finally reduce the difference of either
the it's or the K's to zero, or change its sign, and then we secure either
condition a) or b).
When one of these conditions has once been secured, any further
transformation will not change it; for, in condition a), a transformation
of type (49) will add at least as much to the K^ as to the K,, and so
retain the inequality of the same order, and similar conditions are seen
to hold in the other cases. Also, as one of the conditions a) or b) must
hold finally, whatever the pair of values s and t, we shall have some
value as ?■ such that
n, < n„ K, < K„ s = 2, 3, m.
from which follows the required condition

11. The method of G, applied to the surface resulting from the treat-
ment of 10, will secure the result of 6. It may be that already either
p, < r or q, < r, but in such a case the number of transformations of
