take out the factor ^"'', the other factor being of degree less than n^ unless
the part (17, ^)nr has n^ equal linear factors. For, if
and not all the linear factors are equal (or linearly dependent), then the
substitution
gives
tlr
C n {ap-rji + ttpSi — /3p)
p = \
and leaves an absolute term in any factor for which
apSj 4^ /3p,
thus securing in the product of the factors terras of degree less than n^.
Also the degree might be lowered on account of terms in some later part
as (r/, Qnr+k- But, if all the factors of (77, Qn,- are equal (or linearly
dependent) and 81 is taken so as to satisfy the condition
o-pOi = Pp, p := 1, 2, n,. ,
then after the factor C^ is divided out, we have left but one term in rj^''^
which cannot cancel with any term from another part of the function, as
all later terms have as a factor some power of ^. Accordingly a suc-
cession of transformations of type (40), if it does not reduce the degree of
the part not divisible by ^, must leave a term in 77 "^ Now when the
reversal of type is first made, the e of (41) is zero, as is seen by con-
sidering the use of transformation (8) § 1, 5, Then we take out a
factor 7] "'■ and leave a constant term. So a succession of transformations
which contains reversals of type must reduce the degree of the function
/),. (possibly to zero), except for factors taken out which are powers of
the 7] and I variables. Accordingly, by a succession of transformations
containing a sufficiently large number of reversals of type, the coefficient
p^ must be reduced to the type
9. All further transformations to be considered may be taken of the
types
