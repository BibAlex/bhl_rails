cliaracter was not constant, however, was proved by growing the form
on a sterilized nutrient medium, on which the fructifications showed
simply the normal method of branching.
Polysphondylium album nov. sp.
Sori and stalks white, the sori lOO/x to 200ju in diameter. Spores oval,
2.5//-3/i X 4^-5. 6/t.
On dung of toad from Eustis, Florida.
Althouirh the two forms above described have some features in com-
mon, their gross characters are such as to justify their being placed in
separate species. The sori of P. album are not only larger but are
usually more numerous in a whorl, hence its fructifications are more
conspicuous ; moreover, the stalks of this species are rather constantly
weak at the base, so that the fructifications lie close to the substratum
in a characteristic fashion.
CCENONIA Van Tieghem (1884).
Sorus globular, borne at the summit of a stalk which is dilated into a
sort of cupule, in which the sorus is supported.
Coenonia denticulata Van Tieghem.
Bull, de la Soc. Bot. de France, XXXI. p. 303-306. 1884.
Sorus yellowish; stalk colorless, 2-3 mm. high, having a dilated
base and expanding at the summit into a cupule which is finely toothed
at its edges ; each peripheral cell of the stalk bearing a tooth or papilla
on its exposed side. Spores 6/a-8/x, in diameter, with yellowish cell
walls.
On decaying beans. France.
This remarkable form, so far as I am aware, has not been met with
since it was originally described by Van Tieghem.
LABYRINTHULE^ Cienkowsky.
Organisms having two definitely recurring stages, â€” a vegetative stage
in which spindle-shaped or rarely spherical amoebffi, bearing usually
bipolar filiform pseudopodia singly or in tufts, may be either isolated or
combined by the union of the pseudopodia into colonies forming net-plas-
modia; and a fructifying stage, in which aggregations of individuals, com-
parable to pseudoplasmodia, form spores borne in stalked or sessile sori.
