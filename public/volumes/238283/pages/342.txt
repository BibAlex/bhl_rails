FERNALD. VARIATIONS OF BOREAL CARICES. 505
conspicuous elongated stolons, while C. pilidifera (C. communis) is
caespitose, with short assurgent basal shoots. As may be implied,
varieties of C. pennsijlranica based upon color of the spikelets are
quite as inconstaut as are those based upon the length or breadth of
the leaf, or other purely vegetative tendencies. In the character of its
perigynia, however, C. pennsylvanica presents three marked variations
which, from the material examined, seem to belong to well marked
geographic areas. These forms of the plant are :
C. PENNSYLVANICA, Lam. Diet. iii. 388. Strongly stoloniferous ;
the slightly caespitose small stools with reddish bases : leaves soft, com-
paratively narrow, 1.5 to 3.5 mm. broad, 0.5 to 5 dm. long, shorter
than, equalling, or often exceeding the slender culms : pistillate spike-
lets 1 to 4, globose or ovoid, loosely flowered, approximate or more or
less remote, the lowest rarely peduncled, often subtended by a narrow
leafy bract : scales usually maroon or red-tinged, rarely pale : perigynia
from subglobose to obovoid, puberulent, the short bifid beak one-fourth
to one-fifth as long as the body : staminate spikelet clavate, 1 to 2 cm.
long, sessile or short-stalked, usually reddish, rarely straw-colored. — In
dry or sandy soil from Cumberland Co., Maine, to Alberta, south to
Georgia and Neav Mexico. It is impossible to say from the original
description whether this or the following variety was intended by
Lamarck, but the commonest form of the species has been accepted
as typical since it was so considered by Boott, Kunze, and other classic
writers on the genus. The varieties and forms described by Peck
(46 Kep. N. Y. Mus. Nat. Hist. 51 ; 48 Rep. 76) appear to be vegeta-
tive states due largely to different degrees of light and exposure.
Var. lucorum. Perigynium puberulent or glabrate, with a con-
spicuous slender beak nearly or quite as long as the body. — C lucorum,
