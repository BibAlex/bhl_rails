where h^ is the distance to the furthest point in the r;-plane for which the
equation
has a critical point, and if e^ is first chosen arbitrarily small, 83 can be
determined not zero.
Now consider the neighborhoods of the critical points of the curve
Hi v) = 0.
In these, however small we take the 8, all the remainder of a circle in
the ^-plane including all the values for which the curve ^ = has
critical points can be covered with circles such as were determined for
the domains of the regular points above, these circles overlapping the
circles about the singular points and not reaching out to these points in
any case. Let the radius of the large circle be G where
G^ > 1 , G> h2-\- 62.
Then, if we take for 84 the smallest value of any 8j or S, the develop-
ments within these circles together with the neighborhoods of the set
of new singular points will represent all points of the original neigh-
borhood for which
Finally, taking for 8 the smallest of the three quantities 82? S3, S^, the
