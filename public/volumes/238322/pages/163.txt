agents in cross-fertilization was scarcely appreciated, however,
until the late Charles Darwin published the results of his re-
searches on Primula, Linum, Lythrum, etc., and his elaborate
work on the fertilization of orchids. The publication of these
works gave to flowers a new significance and to their study al-
most as great an impulse as did his immortal Origin of Species
to the general study of biology. Hooker, Bennett, Axell, Del-

pino, Hildebrand, Hermann Muller, and others abroad, and Dr.
Gray and Prof. William Trelease in this country, have followed
up this subject ; and no one can familiarize himself with the results
of their studies without a keen sense if not a conviction that in
the vast number of cases Sprengel's early statement holds strictly
true. By these deeper insights into the significances of the floral
world, and their harmonies with the insect world, we learn to
understand why night-blooming flowers are usually white, even
where their day-blooming allies are brightly colored, as in the
case of Lychnis vespertina and L. diurna ; or why the calyx,
which is usually hidden and green, becomes bright when exposed,
as in the berberry and larkspur. Many flowers are known to
close or " sleep," and while most of them follow the animal world
in taking this rest at night, yet there are marked exceptions. The
dandelion goes to rest at 5 P. M. and wakes at 7 a. M ., while the popu-
lar names of "four o'clock" and " John-go-to-bed-at-noon" suf-
ficiently indicate the sleeping hours of Mirabilis and Tragopogon.
Sir John Lubbock tritely asks, " What is the meaning of sleep in
flowers, if it is not in reference to insects ? " The closing during
those hours when the particular insects needed for pollination
