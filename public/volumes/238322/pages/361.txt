increase of more than one person. The rule, therefore, that the
average size of the family is not materially affected by including
the artificial or arbitrary family does not well apply to towns and
cities in which large institutions are located. For the United
States the statements given by the census, which includes all ar-
bitrary families, may fairly be taken as representing the average
family.
The decrease in the size of families is a subject which causes
some alarm. Taking the United States as a whole, it is found by
the census figures that in 1850 the average family consisted of
5'55 persons. There has been a gradual decrease, it being in 18G0
5-28, in 1870 5*09, in 1880 5'04, and in 1890 4'94. Looking at the
different geographical divisions, it is found that this rule holds
true except in the Western division, where the average size of the
family has risen from 4'18 in 1850 to 4"88 in 1890, the increase
having been steady through the intermediate decades. This re-
sult would have been expected, of course, on account of the set-
tlement of the "West in the last few years, the population having
increased rapidly and being more and more brought to the family
basis instead of that of single individuals or young families set-
tling in Western Territories. The small average size of the fam-
ily in Oklahoma, now a Territory just opened for settlement,
shows the influence of new settlements upon the size of the fam-
ily. In Oklahoma the size of the family will increase until popu-
lation becomes fairly dense, when it will follow the rule of older
communities and decrease. When population becomes more or
less urban in character the maximum is reached, and after that a
constantly receding average will probably be shown at each suc-
ceeding census. A study of one hundred of the principal cities
of the country having a population of 25,000 or more, and on the
basis of 1880 and 1890, shows with but few exceptions a decrease
in the average size of the family. The exceptions are chiefly in
the South and West, as might be expected, and as is found re-
garding those two sections generally. In New York city the
average size of the family has decreased from 4*96 in 1880 to 4*84
in 1890, while in Chicago the decrease has been from 519 to 4*99
during the same period.
It would be very gratifying if the Federal census statements
as to size of families and other social features of population could
be carefully verified by independent enumerations. This possi-
bility exists in some cases where States take an independent cen-
sus. I will call attention to one only, and that the State of Mas-
sachusetts, with whose statistics I am more or less familiar. The
United States census just taken gives the average size of fam-
ily in Massachusetts in 1870 as 477. The State census of 1875
gives the average size as 4'60. In 1880 the Federal census shows
