similarly difficult and complicated oviposition of the Cynipidce, as
Adler has shown. In dissecting the young fruits of the filamen-
tose yuccas, with a view to critical examination, I have found
that about half of them, on the average, contain nothing; but the
proportion varies greatly in different localities and according to
circumstances, and I may say that, as a result of my numerous
examinations, fully two thirds of the mature pods are found to
contain the larvae of Pronuba. All the experiments which I have
so far made, or have known to be made, prove conclusively that
the capsular species never set fruit without her aid.
Pronuba yuccasella is found in all parts of the country east of
the Rocky Mountains where the filamentose yuccas normally
range ; but has not extended to all sections where they are culti-
vated. The time of its appearance is strikingly coetaneous, east

of the Mississippi, with the blooming of filamentosa j while other
cultivated species which bloom either earlier or later, and which,
therefore, do not receive the visits of the moth, I have, as already
stated, never known to bear seed. On the Western plains, where
Y. angustifolia is native, the moth's season of appearance is
adapted to the flowering of this particular yucca. In California,
Yucca whipplei is pollinized by Pronuba maculata, an invariably
maculate species ; while, on the Mojave Desert, Yucca brevifolia is
pollinized by Pronuba syntlietica, a species still more abnormal
than yuccasella and modified to fit it to the peculiarities of that
particular species of yucca. In the Gulf States the typical yuc-
casella occurs, and fertilizes not only the filamentose yuccas, but
