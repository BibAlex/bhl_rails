XVI. THE KETREAT OF THEOLOGY IN THE GALILEO CASE.
By ANDREW DICKSON WHITE, LL.D., L. H. D.,
EX-PRESIDENT OF CORNELL UNIVERSITY.
ANY history of the victory of astronomical science over the-
- ology would be incomplete without some account of the
retreat made by the Church from all its former positions in the
Galileo case.
The retreat of the Protestant theologians was not difficult. A
little skillful warping of Scripture, and a little skillful use of that
time-honored phrase attributed to Cardinal Baronius, that the
Bible is given to teach us, not how the heavens go, but how men
go to heaven, sufficed.
But in the older Church it was far less easy. The retreat of
the sacro-scientific army of Church apologists lasted through two
centuries.
In spite of all that has been said by these apologists, there no
longer remains the shadow of a doubt that the papal infallibility
was committed fully and irrevocably against the double revolu-
tion of the earth. As the documents of Galileo's trial now pub-
lished show, Paul V pushed on with all his might the condemna-
tion of Galileo in 1616, and the condemnation in that same year
of the works of Copernicus and all others teaching the motion of
the earth around its own axis and around the sun. So, too, in the
condemnation of Galileo in 1633, and in all the proceedings which
led up to it and which followed it, Urban VIII was the central
figure. Without his sanction no action could have been taken.
True, the Pope did not formally sign the degree against the
Copernican theory then; but this came later: in 1664 Alexander
VII prefixed to the Index containing the condemnations of the
VOL. XLI. 13
