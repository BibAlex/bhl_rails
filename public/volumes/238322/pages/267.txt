and business economy.
Unfortunately, history gives lis little definite information re-
garding the origin of this one of the industrial arts. Surmises,
however, go for considerable in this case. The skins of birds and
animals formed a large part of the first clothing of man. Now
these would be found to grow hard and horny in their natural
state, and on exposure to moisture to become putrid and offensive.
Efforts to counteract this, and at the same time to render the skins
