There were, besides this, 2,319 currying establishments in this
country, with a product valued at more than $71,000,000. The cen-
sus figures for 1890 will undoubtedly show even larger increases
in production. This increase is reflected in the importation of
hides, which for the year 1891 aggregated $27,930,759. During
the decade important tanneries have been started in some of the
Southern States, and the industry is constantly expanding. This
fact appears in the extension of the American leather trade abroad,
but this is by no means what it should be. The exports of leather
in 1891 aggregated $12,026,556, a gain of a little more than a
million dollars as compared with the previous year. Sole leather
led, with a sale of 40,084,833 pounds abroad, at a total sum of
$6,430,764. It is interesting further to compare the exports of
leather and the manufactures of it for the past five years :

The gain in the exports of leather, indeed, have kept pace rela-
tively with the sale of the manufactures of it abroad, such as boots
and shoes. But Americans possess certain important advantages
in the making of leather that should give them a stronger hold in
the European markets. The continental tanneries have no better
facilities for getting hides, and they are handicapped by the lack
of oak and hemlock bark which our own manufacturers have at
hand. But, despite all this, the leather industry stands among the
first in this country in dignity, enterprise, and magnitude. Impor-
tant advances are yet to be made : but with the natural advan-
tages of our tanners, their thrift and inventiveness, with a con-
stantly expanding home market and a possible foreign one, there
appears to be no reason why it should lose its relative rank.
