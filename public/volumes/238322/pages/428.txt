At this the theological warriors of the Church waxed valiant.
Those great and good churchmen determined to fight. To all of
them this idea seemed dangerous, to most of them it seemed

allow that a man might be saved who thought the earth in-
habited on its opposite sides, but the great majority of the fathers
of the Church doubted the possibility of salvation to such mis-
believers.
Lactantius asks : " Is there any one so senseless as to believe
that there are men whose footsteps are higher than their heads ?
. . . that the crops and trees grow downward ? . . . that the rains
and snow and hail fall upward toward the earth ? . . . I am at a
