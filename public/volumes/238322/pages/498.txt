ODORS AND THE SENSE OF SMELL.

the molecular edifice. The efforts which have been recently made
to fill this void are more difficult to expound and follow than
fruitful in applications.
Six methods of extracting perfumes are known : The first is ex-
pression, by means of a special press, which is applicable without
too great loss to fruit-skins rich in essential oils, such as orange
and citron peel, previously grated. Another method is that of
distillation, which consists in heating flowers with water in a
boiler. The essential oil is volatilized and is condensed with the
vapor of water in a worm and a Florentine receiver. The water
usually goes to the bottom and the oil floats. The oils of neroli,
rose, patchouli, geranium, lavender, caraway, etc., are obtained in
this way. This process is not applicable to the delicate perfumes
of the mignonette and the violet ; and for them recourse is had
to maceration of the flowers in animal fats or mineral oils, which
have the property of absorbing odorous substances, and are then
washed in alcohol. The flowers are usually heated in the fat or
the oil for a variable number of hours. For perfumes which can
not endure a high temperature the petals are placed between two
frames of glass coated with fat. This is the process of enfleurage.
The pneumatic process, which consists in causing a current of
perfumed air or carbonic acid to be absorbed by coatings of lard
on glass plates, appears not to have given satisfactory results.
Another process consists in dissolving perfumes in very volatile
liquids like sulphuret of carbon, chloroform, naphtha, ether, or
chloride of methyl, and volatilizing the solvents, which can be
done at a low temperature in a vacuum. The last method has
given very satisfactory results in the extreme delicacy and great
accuracy of its returns.
