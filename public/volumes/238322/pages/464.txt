to the experiments in which the attention was fixed in a definite
direction. For example, the subject is thinking of the letter O ;
he does not think of it as in any special place, and the record,

well the difference between the movements while standing and
while sitting.
We have thus illustrated a variety of involuntary movements
obtained in different ways and with bearings upon many points
of importance to the psychologist. They by no means exhaust
the possibilities of research, or the deduction of conclusions in
this field of study, but simply illustrate in an imperfect way how
abundant and intricate are the expressions of the thoughts that
lie within.
