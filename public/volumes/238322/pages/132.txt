LITERARY NOTICES.

Frederick J. H. Merrill to that subject.
The papers relate to the historic and eco-
nomic geology of the field. The first paper,
on the Post-Glacial History of the Valley, is
the result of several seasons' study by the
author. The papers on Brick Clays and the
Manufacture of Brick were prepared under
the author's direction by Mr. Heinrich Ries,
after a detailed investigation of the region
between Croton and Albany.
A study of the Evolution of the Myth
of Satan is presented by Mr. William Henry
Hudson in a paper which was originally de-
livered as a Sunday evening lecture, on The
Satan of Theology and how we came by
him. The author finds that the Satan of
the Book of Job bears no resemblance to
the spirit of evil in our modern theology,
while the tempter, or serpent in the garden
of Eden, was not identified with Satan till
Persian influence had begun to operate.
The real origin of the theological devil is
then sought in the dualistic conception of
the Zoroastrian religion, which was trans-
planted into Judaism and has been built
upon till it has grown into the^ present ac-
cepted figure.
Of two Addresses on Anatomy, reprinted
by the author, Dr. Harrison Allen, of the
University of Pennsylvania, for more con-
venience in reading, the first, On Compara-
tive Anatomy as a Part of the Medical Cur-
riculum, was delivered before the American
Association for the Advancement of Science,
at its Boston meeting, in 1880; and the
second, On the Teaching of Anatomy to Ad-
vanced Students, before the Association of
American Anatomists, at Washington, in
1S91. The second address outlines a plan
for a thorough fundamental course of in-
struction in the science, representing the
idea which the author has long cherished for
having medical biologists as systematically
trained as those who elect the more general
field of natural history.
