hand a considerable foundation upon which to begin the develop-
ment of their art. But, once known, its extension could not be
hindered. Herodotus states that the Libyans wore leather cloth-
ing, and that the Phoenicians, whose home was a barren stretch
of shore, depended largely upon it in the construction of their

ships. Persian and Babylonian leather was long celebrated, and
as early as the beginning of the Christian era the Russians were
famous as skilled tanners. Hungary, too, acquired an early name
for its leather, having learned a peculiar process for making it
from Senegal. Boucher carried the art into France ; while Col-
bert, the enthusiastic patron of all the industries, did all that he
could in the way of personal and public effort to extend it. Thus
it was that leather became more and more an article of general
use, and thus it was that by the time Columbus started on his
hazardous voyages there had already grown up a considerable
industry in England, France, Spain, Germany, and Russia.
But despite all this growth the processes involved in the oper-
ation of tanning were not really understood until the close of the
eighteenth century, when they became objects of scientific study.
Before that time the art was purely an empirical one. The im-
mediate successors of Columbus brought with them to America
such crude knowledge of it as was current at the time. Leather
being a prime necessity, tanneries were started soon after the set-
tlement of each community, either by the men of that craft or by
the large farmers for their own convenience. Leather formed
at that time no small part of people's clothing ; indeed, leather
breeches appeared clear into the eighteenth century, though the
wearing of them was largely confined to servants and laborers.
