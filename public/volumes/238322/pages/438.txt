THE DELAWARE INDIAN AS AN ARTIST.

and many an interment was without any object of stone, bone, or
clay. On the other hand, in some lonely spot, some little knoll in
a forest, or prominent ridge of earth extending out upon a level
meadow tract, a single grave has been found, where objects of a
high grade of workmanship and suggesting a distinct advance
over the historic Indian occurred. The whole character of the
interment was different from that of the average or ordinary In-

mentioned, the objects found have been different in character as

can be done, with our present stock of knowledge, is to express,
tentatively of course, that this or that condition was probably
true ; and surveying the whole valley, after twenty years of tramp-

sonal adornment was the attachment to the person of feathers
and small stones of bright hues. Mica and quartz crystals are
common in graves. The glitter and glistening of these would be
sure to attract. But what of the next step, that of shaping from
formless masses objects that strike the fancy of the wearer ? To
