ANTHROPOLOGICAL WORK IN AMERICA.
By Prof. FREDERICK STARR.
THE object of this article is not to present a history of anthro-
pology in America, but to sketch briefly some of the work
at present done, so as to show the aims and methods of our work-
ers in the science.
That anthropology is yearly attracting greater attention among
us is shown by the way in which institutions of learning are
recognizing its importance. Not many years ago a scientific jour-
nal made the statement that but one institution of learning in the
United States, the University of Rochester, had the science upon
its curriculum. The way in which it was introduced there is
somewhat interesting. At that time the scientific work offered
to students at Rochester was admittedly insufficient in quantity,
but the way seemed hardly clear to the employment of any addi-
tional teaching force to do extra work. At this stage of affairs
Prof. Joseph Gilmore, in charge of the Department of Rhetoric
and English Literature, offered, in some degree at least, to meet the
need, to announce an optional course in anthropology. The work
was very elementary, extending over but a single term, and cov-
ering the field considered in De Quatrefages's little volume, The
Natural History of Man. From the beginning the course was a
favorite one, and many students elected it, The effect was good
and the example has been followed. Since that time instruction in
anthropology has entered into the work of a considerable number
of American colleges and universities. It is suggestive to inquire
how and why it has been introduced. At Yale, Prof. Sumner has
for several years given such courses, because he felt that students
unacquainted with the science could not profitably undertake
