stated that these laws were passed in consideration " of the dam-
age or injury which many sustained by the ill-curing of leather,
and by the shoemakers in making it up into shoes and boots."
Thus left to shift for itself, the industry steadily though slowly
progressed with the country until I860, when new inventions and
improvements in processes, and energetic men at the head of it,
gave it a decided impetus which has constantly gained in force
since.
As has been said, the fundamental processes of tanning have
changed very little since the early days. The hides, as they came

to the tanner, were first washed, and then, in order to remove the
hair, soaked in vats of water and lime or ashes. After having
been thus unhaired, they were put over a beam and scraped until
every remnant of flesh had been removed. After another wash-
ing they were " laid away " that is, packed in vats in alternate
layers of ground hemlock or oak bark. The object of this was to
bring about the desired union of the gelatin and tannin. The
operation, however, was a slow one, and oftentimes many months
were required to complete it. But study, of course, has been
since given to the details of these various steps, which has re-
sulted in a marked saving of time. In the preliminary process
of depilation there are two methods which are now commonly
followed by American tanners. The first is known as the " liming,"
which is used largely in the preparation of upper leather ; and the
second, known as "sweating," which is used for sole leather. In
the " liming " process the hides are soaked in a solution of lime
and water, as indicated above, until the hair-bulbs are loosened.
In sweating there are two methods also : the warm sweat, with
the temperature of the pit at 100 ; and the cold sweat, with it at
50 or 60. The former method is in general use in southern
Europe, while the latter is not only American in origin, but is the
