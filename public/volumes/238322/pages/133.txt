POPULAR MISCELLANY.
Origin of Greenland A r egetation. Some
interesting conclusions are drawn by Mr.
Clement Reid from a comparison of the
views of Prof. Warming and Prof. Nathorst
concerning the origin of the flora of Green-
land. Prof. Warming fixes the boundary
between the European and American prov-
inces of the arctic flora as in Denmark
Strait, and not in Davis Strait, as botanists
have generally placed it. The flowering
plants of Greenland include three hundred
and eighty-six species, none of which are
confined to that country. Of these, exclud-
ing the circumpolar forms, Prof. Warming
finds in the list thirty-six characteristic
Western against forty-two Eastern species ;
but suggests that as the flora of arctic Ameri-
ca is better known, the balance will prob-
ably be in favor of the Western forms. He,
however, includes among the Eastern plants
only those now living in Europe, while he
classes the Asiatic-American species as
Western. Prof. Nathorst reviews these con-
clusions on the basis of a map of the local
distribution of Eastern and Western forms in
Greenland. He thus finds that the coast
nearest to Iceland contains European forms
alone, the southern coast contains European
forms in a majority, and that part of the west
coast nearest to America yields principally
Western species ; but taking Greenland as a
whole the flora is more European than
American. He also finds that the Ameri-
can element of the flora of Greenland is not
entirely cut off by the Denmark Strait, but
extends eastward as far as Iceland. Prof.
Warming believes that the nucleus of the
present flora of Greenland represents part
of the original flora which was able to live
through the Glacial epoch on the non-glaci-
ated areas ; but Prof. Nathorst shows that
the few non-glaciated mountain-tops must
have been far too high for any phanerogams
to exist on them, and all the lowlands were
then covered with ice and snow. Both the
Eastern and Western elements of the present
flora of Greenland must, therefore, be sup-
posed to have entered the country in post-
glacial times. The tables of distribution
show at what points a large number of the
plants entered ; they came from the nearest
land, whether European or American. The
