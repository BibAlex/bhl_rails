THE DIAMOND INDUSTRY AT KIMBERLEY. 457
carats of diamonds, realizing by sale over 3,500,000, produced by
washing some 2,700,000 loads of blue ground. Each load represents
three quarters of a ton, and costs in extracting about 8s. 10e. per
load, realizing a profit of 20s. to 30s. per carat sold. The annual
