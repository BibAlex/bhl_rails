WHAT ARE DIATOMS?
201
Owing to their freedom of motion they were at one time sup-
posed to be animals. Now it is known that they are plants, as
they can perform all the functions of plants, and no animal', with
all his superiority, high nature, etc., is able to do this. They are
found everywhere in all inhabited countries, and in fact all over
the seas, so it may be readily granted that a plant so common and
wide-spread as this should be quite familiar to every one.
Again, not only are the living plants so wide-spread and com-
mon, but the shells of the dead ones remain intact for many years ;
and in certain localities these tiny shells are so numerous as to
form a large portion of the soil. Some of the best
known of these localities are the sites of Rich-
mond, Va., and Berlin in Germany. It is often said
that the city of Berlin rests on a foundation of

diatom shells. The little plant dies and decays, leaving the shell,
which retains its shape for many years. These cells are most
beautifully marked with very delicate tracery. No tools can be
made to perform such work as this. Some shells with the most
regular forms of markings are used for testing lenses, such as
Pleurosigma, shown in Fig. 1. Some of the most common forms
are represented by Figs. 2, 3, and 4, while another less frequent
and with more curious markings is shown in Fig. 5.
Now, though it is so easy to obtain large numbers of these
plants only a spoonful of mud from the bank of a stream or edge
of a pool, a bit of sea-weed thrown up on the shore will contain
