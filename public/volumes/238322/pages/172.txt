THE SURVIVAL OF THE UNFIT.
183
A glance at some statistics, published in the United States
census reports will "be interesting in this connection. The fol
lowing figures are taken from a table showing the number of
insane, idiotic, blind, and deaf-mutes in the United States, in the
years named, respectively, according to the census :
1880.
1870.
1860.
1850.
Defectives
251,698
50,155,783
98,484
38,558,371
68,451
31,443,321
50,994
Total population
23,191,876
According to these figures, the population a little more than
doubled in thirty years, while the number of defective persons
returned was nearly five times as great as it had been thirty
years before. During the decade from 1870-'S0 the increase in
population was 30 per cent ; during the same interval of time the
apparent increase in the defective classes was a little more than
155 per cent. There is much talk about the increase of insanity
in our day, and statistics appear to bear witness to the truth of
such reports. The following shows the ratio of insane popu-
lation to the entire population for the whole country in different
years : *
1860 1 to 1,310.
1870 1 to 1,100.
1880 1 to 570.
The latest report of the Census Bureau states that the total
number of insane persons treated in both public and private insti-
tutions during the year 1889 was 97,535, while during the year
1881 there were 56,205 treated; showing an increase in the nine
years of 41,330, or 73"53 per cent. This percentage of increase,
when compared with the percentage of increase of population in
the last decade, namely, 24'86, does not necessarily indicate an
increase in the proportion of insane persons to population, but
rather a great increase in the amount of asylum accommodation
provided, and a willingness on the part of the public to make full
use of all the facilities thus offered. The bulletin states that
the figures for the actual number of insane in the United States
can not be determined until the work of eliminating all duplicate
reports of cases has been completed.
The ratio of insane in public and private institutions of the
United States is to the entire population as 1"56 to 1,000. f As
these figures represent only institutions to which large numbers
of the mildly insane are never sent, they point to an increase in
insanity. Objections may be made to figures tending to show a
