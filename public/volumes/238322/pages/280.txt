the desired thickness by hand, entailing obviously a great waste
not only in time but in the large portions of the hide which it was
necessary to throw away. By the use of these machines, however,
these same hides may be split into two, three, or even five parts,
of such thickness as is desired, and each part rendered available.
This machine was not really perfected until about 18G0. As early
as 1800 rough attempts had been made to split leather by ma-
chinery, and in 1809 Seth Boyden, of Newark, N. J., secured a pat-
ent for such an invention. But there were serious obstacles which

rendered it impracticable, and it was left to the ingenious mind
and skilled hand of Alpha Richardson, of Boston, to overcome
them. He secured his first patent in 1831, but he continued to
make improvements upon this device until 1856. Then all were
grouped, and what is known as the Union splitting machine was
the result. This machine is the one which is now in common use
among American tanners. Its machinery is somewhat complex.
It consists of a small cylinder upon which is placed the hide or
leather to be split. As this cylinder turns, the leather is drawn
against a sharp knife firmly bolted to the bed of the machine.
Above the knife is a stiff spring which holds the leather closely
to the edge of the blade, and a gauge-roller, which by means of
