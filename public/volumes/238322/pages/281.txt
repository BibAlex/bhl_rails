screws regulates the thickness of the side, and by sectional tubes
or rings serves as a friction-roller. When it is desired to split
wholehides,a stillmore
complicated machine
is employed. This is
known as the belt-knife
splitting machine, and
was invented in 1854
by Joseph F. Flanders
and Jere. A. Marden,
of Newburyport, Mass.
The knife in this ma-
chine consists of an
endless band of steel,
which revolves at a
high speed, with its
cutting edges close to
the sides of a pair of
rollers. Through these
latter the leather is fed
and pressed closely
against the knife. The
lower roller is made up
of a series of rings
which are capable of
yielding so as to ac-
commodate themselves
to the varying thick-
ness of the hides. The
thickness of the splits
is determined by a
small hand-screw, by
which the upper roller
is raised or depressed
as the case may re-
quire. The knife itself
in its course of revolu-
tion comes in contact
with an emery-wheel
and thus is kept keen.
These machines pre-
sent a blade varying
between fifty - seven
and seventy-two inches
in length, and by them an ordinary cow-hide can be split into
three or four distinct parts with the utmost precision.
