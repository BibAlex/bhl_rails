converting it into an almost perfect vacuum, and at the same
time force liquor into it, producing a pressure of one hundred
pounds to the square inch. Between the hides he placed cocoa
matting, so that the free circulation of the liquor should be in no
way interfered with. In the top of the tank, where it was impos-
sible to put hides, some small blocks of wood were placed. He
afterward exhausted the air in his tank, forced in the liquor, and
then waited several days, but his experiment was a complete
failure. On examining the contents of the tank, he found the
wood thoroughly saturated with tannin, but the hides were
scarcely colored. The pressure that would kyanize wood would
not tan leather. Recently attempts have been made to employ

electricity to hasten the operation, but as yet no practical and
satisfactory " quick tanning " process has been found.
Few, if any, of the pioneer tanneries remain. That, however,
which used to belong to Mathias Ogden and Colonel Oliver
Spencer, at Elizabethtown, N. J., in 178-4, was probably a good
example of the original type. That consisted only of forty or
fifty oblong boxes, without cover or outlet below, sunk into a
bed of clay near a small stream. The boxes did duty as vats
and leaches. On one side of them stood an open shed which
fronted a half-dozen more boxes, the " limes " and " pools " of the
beam-house, while on the other side was a circular trough, made
of hewed timber, fifteen feet in diameter, in which the bark was
crushed by alternate wooden and stone wheels propelled by two old
horses. It was essentially a home-made plant. The wind swept
through it without hindrance, and the rain and snow beat un-
