HERBERT SPENCER AND THE SYNTHETIC
PHILOSOPHY.*
By WILLIAM H. HUDSON.
ASSISTANT LIBRARIAN, CORNELL UNIVERSITY.
THE present paper aims at furnishing an introduction to the
study of Mr. Spencer's philosophic system ; but, to avoid all
possibility of misconception, it may be well to state at the outset
in what sense the word introduction is here employed. Let it be
understood, then, that by it we mean neither an exposition nor
a criticism ; in other words, we do not now undertake either to
summarize the arguments and conclusions of the Synthetic Phi-
losophy, or to pass judgment upon them. Popular introductions
to abstruse and voluminous works too often confine themselves to
one or both of these methods ; our course, on the other hand, will
be a humbler, but, we may trust, not less useful one. Assuming
that the student of any great epoch-making work will feel himself
the better prepared to grapple with that work if he knows some-
thing of its genetic history I mean, of its inception, formulation,
and growth ; and will be placed in a more advantageous position
for judging of its essential merits if he understands its relation to
the thought and speculation of the time, we purpose to approach
Mr. Spencer's philosophy by way of its evolution ; to consider, not
what it is to-day, but rather how it came to be what it is to-day.
In a brief outline of the gradual unfolding and consolidation of
Mr. Spencer's thought, and in some appreciation of the historic
significance of his writings, will, we believe, be found the best
kind of introduction for those who would prepare themselves for
the direct and personal study of his works.
