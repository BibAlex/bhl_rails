THE DELAWARE INDIAN AS AN ARTIST.
By Dr. CHAELES C. ABBOTT.
WHEN a considerable collection of the stone and bone handi-
work of the Delaware Indians has been brought together,
and with this material before us we picture to ourselves the people
in possession of the country when first visited by the Dutch and

European, was far superior to their cleverest handiwork in the
seventeenth century. The European had to do with a diseased,
discouraged, and disappearing people. It is safe to assert that
history, as pertaining to the Delaware Valley, would have been
