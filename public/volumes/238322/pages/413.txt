hopes may be more acceptable and easier of
credit to those who doubt concerning the
present accepted view. Not " Calvary " the
crucifixion according to this view, was the
culmination of Christ's life work, and marked
the accomplishment of his mission, but the
temptation in the wilderness, in which " our
Lord literally bought back the spiritual free-
dom of mankind through the spiritual danger
that he, guarded with the weakness of the
flesh, was presumed to encounter when he
was led by the Spirit into the wilderness."
The Elements of Economics of Industry,
by Alfred Marshall, is an abridgment of the
first volume of the author's Principles of
Economics, noticed in our June number.
The reduction of the larger work has been
effected by the omission of many discussions
on points of minor importance and of some
difficult theoretical investigations, thus allow-
ing arguments that are retained to be given
in full. A chapter on trade-unions is in-
cluded in the present volume, although in the
larger work this subject is postponed to a
later stage. (Macmillan, $1.)
The results of extended study are em-
bodied in The English Language and English
G-rammar, by Samuel Ramsey. The former
part of the book is a general account of the
origin and present condition of our mother-
tongue, considerable attention being devoted
to pronunciation and spelling. The latter
part is a treatise on the nature and uses of
the parts of speech, closing with some sug-
gestions to young writers. Throughout the
volume the author gives his personal impres-
sions freely on controverted matters, though
acknowledging, as for example in his analy-
sis of the sounds in English speech, that
others see these things differently. (Put-
