THE PREHENSILE FOOT OF EAST INDIANS. 491
of the foot in the industry of a people advanced in civilization
does not appear to me to have been remarked.
The Ectromelians are able to use their feet after a long and
patient education, but they seem to serve the part of supplement-
ary organs. A report has been made to the Society of Anthro-
pology (Bulletin, 1875) concerning the Ectromelian Ducornet,
who, with only four toes, painted, holding his brush between his
two middle toes. I saw one who was exhibited at Marseilles in
1889. He drank, ate, fired guns, played cards, wrote, and played
on several instruments of music with his feet. On a closer ex-
amination of him it appeared, as is observed in all similar cases,
that there was no movement of opposition of the great toe. A
special anatomical peculiarity is connected with this physiological
function of the foot the distance between the first and second
toes. Let us look into this feature among the Indians, taking for
our example the extremely remarkable type of Fig. 1. It repre-
sents the foot of a Tamil in Trichinopoly, in which the space be-

tween the first and second toes was very large from birth. Tak-
ing the middle of the extremity of the first and the middle of the
second toe, I measured the two points A and B, the distance be-
tween which, on a foot placed in its usual position on the ground,
was forty-nine millimetres in the right foot and fifty-four milli-
metres in the left foot. This does not depend upon a simple di-
vergence of the ends of the toes ; the base participates in it, and it
seems to go back to the metatarso-phalangeal articulation. This
distance apart of the toes at the base is fifteen millimetres on the
right and sixteen millimetres on the left foot. When this Tamil

ing their great toe to a root or a bit of rock.
