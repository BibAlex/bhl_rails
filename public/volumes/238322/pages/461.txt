mind, and it is essential to determine in what measure each ap-
pears in the general result.
If you hold out your arm nearly on a level with the shoulders
and in line with them, you perceive at once that movements of
the hand to the front are
much more readily made
than to the rear, and
movements toward the
body more readily than
those away from the
body ; the tendency of
the hand is to move along
a circle of which the
shoulder is the center.
What we require is a
position in which move-
ments in any direction
are as readily made as in
any other ; and this may
be approximated, though only approximated, by holding the hand
at an angle of about 45 with the line joining the shoulders, and
with the elbow bent at an angle of about 120; this position* is

recommended for the normal tests. The usual result is a move-
ment toward the object of attention ; but when that is to the rear,
this tendency is sometimes outweighed by the natural tendency
* In one series we were able to measure the extent of movements in various directions,
and found half again as much movement toward the front as toward the rear, and a third
again as much toward as away from the body.
