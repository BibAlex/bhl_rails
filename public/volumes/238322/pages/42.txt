CAVE DWELLINGS OF MEN.

light from the front ; the houses, as a whole, are dry, warm in
winter and cool in summer, and do not suffer from lack of venti-
lation ; and their inhabitants, as a rule, are a healthy and vigor-
ous people. Some of the proprietors have whitened the fronts of
their dwellings, and have planted gardens in the ground over
them and in front of them, so as to give their homes a not un-
pleasing air ; and the cave dwellings are much drier and more
healthful than city basements.
Another group of inhabited caves is described in La Nature
by M. Brossard de Corbigny as stretching for the length of a kilo-

Charente-Inferieure, France. " They are excavated in a high bluff

mills, some still active while others are disused, and face the
broad river, commanding a view of the sea and the Cordouan
Tower in the distance. The caves are partly natural and partly
the work of man. They can not be seen from the top of the bluff,
and are accessible by goat-paths descending from the mills not
very pleasant walking for women and children, especially where
it has been necessary to cut stepping-notches in the rock. Not all
the paths are equally difficult of descent, and some leading to the
stations of the lobster-fishers go down to a kind of ladder that
reaches to the water's edge. Whatever path one follows, he is
sure at about a third of the distance down to come upon an exca-
vation suggesting the nest of some gigantic sea-bird of the olden
time ; but he will soon observe that the bottoms of the caves and
the roofs have been made smooth by the hand of man, while the
great openings looking out upon -the sea bear marks of erosion by
