THE SURVIVAL OF THE UNFIT. 185
sickly and defective classes, who are often as prolific as they are
inefficient. In our civilization these institutions have become a
necessity, but their abuse should be carefully guarded against.
What is urgently needed are homes or retreats where poor con-
valescent patients can recuperate after their discharge from the
hospital. As it is, such people, in a weakened condition, have no
place to seek the needed rest, and either fall victims again to a
former disease, or become chronic invalids. Here would seem to
be a more fruitful field for philanthropy than the building of
additional hospitals. Above all, more of an effort should be made
to get at the roots of the cause than to temporize so with the effect.
Municipal governments annually devote large sums of money for
the care of the sick, the criminal, and the insane, but devote no
energy to investigating and striving to prevent the factors that
are constantly at work in producing these classes. Here, if ever,
an ounce of prevention is equal to many pounds of cure. The
Department of Public Charities and Correction of New York
city, with its 15,000 wards, received $2,166,237 in 1891, and re-
quests an appropriation of $2,877,245 for 1892. If a part of the
money that is annually devoted to keeping alive the helpless and
suffering could in some way be diverted toward remedying un-
healthy domiciles, relieving overcrowded tenements, dissipating
polluted air and foul gases, supplying the best food at cheap
rates, educating the masses in the simple principles of hygienic
living, closing the saloons, and in many like ways checking the
sources of disease and degeneration, this knotty problem would
find its best solution. The way we can cure is by prevent-
ing. We permit factors to exist that degenerate men physi-
cally, mentally, and morally, and then bring up a clumsy,
mechanical, outside philanthropy to try and reform by patch-
work.
Probably one of the greatest dangers to organized society is
found in the criminal classes. The laws of the production and
confirmation of criminals, with their treatment, should be among
the most thoughtfully studied branches of political science. The
number of convicts in penitentiaries in 1880 was 35,538, while in
1890 it was 45,233, an increase in ten years of 9,695, or 27'28 per
cent, and during this interval the total population increased only
at the rate of 24'86 per cent.* Again, the total number of prison-
ers in county jails in 1880 was 12,691 ; in 1890, 19,538, an increase
in ten years of 6,847, or at the rate of 53'95 per cent.f Coming to
the inmates of juvenile reformatories, we find the number re-
ported in 1880 was 11,468 ; in 1890, 14,846, an increase of 3,378, or
