[ganong] boundaries OF NEW BRUNSWICK 427
the Eestigouche river. East, by the Gulf of St. Lawrence, as at present.
West, by the west line of Northumberland as then established (the
present west line prolonged, see Northumberland). South, by three
lines ; (1) by the prolongation of the rear line of a Tracadie grant, the
present line (run 1845) ; (2) the prolongation of a line drawn between
two certain lots in Newcastle, the present line'^ (run 1845) ; (3) the pro-
longation of the south line of a grant on the Little Nepisiguit 'from
the preceding line to the Northumberland county line (Map No. 39),
the present south-east line of Eestigouche (run 1872). That these
lines do not more accurately separate the Bay Chaleur settlements and
river basins, including the entire valley of the Nepisiguit, from those
of the Miramichi, is no doubt due to the imperfect knowledge of the
time, for according to the maps of the time (Bonnor, 1820, Lockwood,
1826, even Bouchette of 1831), such lines would thus separate those
rivers, and give all the Nepisiguit to Gloucester Eestigouche (which
see below), was set off in 1837.
Carleton. Set off from York, March 31, 1831, the eleventh
county, to separate the thriving settlements at Woodstock and upwards
from those on the lower river, and with Woodstock as shire town.
Bounded from York thus: — From the monument at the source of the
St. Croix due east to Eel Eiver, the present line (run 1847), thence
along Eel Eiver to its mouth as at present (the first natural feature
adopted as a county boundary in New Brunswick other than the sea
coast), thence crossing the St. John north 45° east to the western
boundary of Northumberland. This line was changed in 1834 to be-
gin at a grant line crossing Eel Eiver, following that line to the St.
John (changed to run as at present in 1854), thence to a grant line on
the eastern bank of the St. John and thence north 45° east (mag., 1790)
at as present (run 1847). The east, north (undefined until 1851), and
west (undefined until 1842, north of Mars Hill), boundaries coincided
with those of the former county of York, until Victoria (including
Madawaska), was set off in 1844.
Eestig-ouche. Set off from Gloucester, March 1, 1837, with some
additions from Victoria in 1873, the twelfth county, to include the
settlements centering around the Eestigouche Eiver, with Dalhousie
as shire town. North by Bay Chaleur and Eestigouche Eiver. West
by the former west line of Gloucester (which see), changed in 1854 to
the present line (run 1873) extending north-west from the old south-
west angle. South-east, by the old line of Gloucester, prolonged north-
east until intersected by a line drawn due south from near the mouth
' Very slig-htly altered in length in 1854 to make it start from the inter-
section of the preceding line with Portage River.
