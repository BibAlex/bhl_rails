where, however, he died, and the remainder of the expedition, after
enduring great hardships, returned the next year to England.
In 1608, Champhiin laid the foundation of Quebec, a city which
he determined should become the capital of La Nouvelle France,
a vast and splendid Empire of the West; and though in after years
his 'dream was realised and the Empire of the West indeed arose, it
was not the Flag of France that was destined to wave above her forts
and cities, but the Ensign of Great Britain.
Champlain achieved for France by land what Cartier, his famous
predecessor, had done for her by sea, and his memory is green
to-day in the land he so widely explored and so ably ruled for France,
first as Lieut. -Governor and afterwards as Governor. He has left the

a brave and enterprising Englishman, celebrated as having formerly
carried off the famous and beautiful Indian princess, Pocahontas, the
young daughter of the Emperor Powhatan, was sailing on a voyage
of discovery, with a ship of one hundred and thirty tons, carrying four-

to Virginia, whence, without delay, he was despatched with an expedi-
