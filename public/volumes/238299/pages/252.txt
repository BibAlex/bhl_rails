[BURPEE] CHARLES HEAVYSEGE 43
But Jephthah must face a more terrible ordeal than his wife's
anger. His daughter comes and pleads with him for her life — she, his
only beloved child.
Spare me, father, spare me ?
Cut me not down or ere my harvest comes ;
Oh, gather not the handful of my days
In a thin sheaf of all unripened blades !
Imprison me in some sad cell, deep dung-eon ;
Wrap me in chains ; . . . .
but, Jephthah, not at once
Demand my end ; still let me live ....
I will resign all pleasure, and accept
Of pain .... lonely dwell,
. . . . Beneath the fretted bars,
That measure me a few blue feet of sky, —
All I shall ever see ....
No more upon the upland lingering,
Behold the weary sun's low, cloud-coifed head
Droop in the drowsy west ; nor twilight dim.
Sickening through shadows of mysterious eve.
Die midst the starry watches of the night.
Jephthah replies:
I dare not let thee live, yet would now dare.
Yea, now do long to die for thee ....
How shall I part from thee ....
I have svv'orn,
And cannot from my honoured oath go back.
For by its answer has success been won
Then we hear the father's heart-broken cry:
Oh, hadst thou been less dutiful, less fair !
But thou hast been the sunshine of my years.
The hope, the care, the solace of my heart. .
Jephthah's daughter is not yet obedient to the sacrifice. She still
pleads for her life.
Jephthah desperately retorts:
Oh, spare me, daughter, these, most piteous pleadings !
Forbear, forbear : behold, I am as one
Who walks, while in his sleep, upon the leads.'
Again wc hear the daughter's cry:
It is a bitter thing to die when young :
To leave all things we loved, admired, most cherished,
Forgot, perhaps forgetting.
^ Hardly in keeping with the period.
