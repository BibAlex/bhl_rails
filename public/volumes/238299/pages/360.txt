Alexander, 1621.
Western limit of Acadia of
Champlain.
French grants, 1632-1710, the
same as the English claim.

Kennebec, as granted to
Alexander.
Vertical shading — Acadia
proper as defined by Char-
levoix.
Oblique shading — Eteche-
min region of Champlain
and Denys.
:^^ Charnisay's Government.
* LaTour's G-overnment.
— Cromwell's grant of 1656, the
same ceded to France by
the Treaty of Breda, 1667.
Norumbega — country be-
tween Kennebec and Pen-
obscat.
We may here note another map which attempts to represent some of
these ancient boundaries, namely, Genest's " Carte de la Nouvelle France,
pour servir à l'étude de l'Histoire du Canada" (1875), which shows the limits
of Denys' and of Charnisay's governments. The boundary between Char-
nisay's and La Tour's governments was, I think, at the Isthmus of Chignecto;
otherwise most boundaries are given correctly on the English map, No. 13.
