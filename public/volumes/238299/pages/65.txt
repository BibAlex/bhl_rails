XII ROYAL SOCIETY OF CANADA
relics, and portraits of tlie men of smbstanoe and energy who made
possible the material prosperity now almost universal; there are all
these things, perhaps stored away in dusty attics as unvalued rubbish,
and we ask that we may be made their custodians.
We are fortunate in being able to give our collection such fitting
shelter, and we trusit that our hopes of one day seeing a really great
and comprehensive National Museum, Picture Gallery and Library
worthily housed in a thoroughly restored building will, with the aid
of o-enerous sympathizers, yet be realized.
In taking our mission thus seriously, we may be permitted to
think that we are helping to sow and cultivate a genuine, united, and
enduring sentiment of Canadian nationality, worthy of the best effort
we can make, which, in its full flower, shall be a consummation of the
aspirations of the statesman who wrote:
" L'étranger voit avec un œil d'envie
Du Saint Laurent, le majestueux cours.
A son aspect, le Canadien s'écrie
Oh! Canada, mon pays, mes amours !''
