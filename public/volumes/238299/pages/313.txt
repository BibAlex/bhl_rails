// the friendly reader will spread before him a modern map of
New Brunswick, and will fix his attention upon all the boundary lines
shown thereon ; or, if he will observe closely the diagrammatic map of
the Province forming the frontispiece of the present paper, he will be
impressed by the irregularity of the network the boundaries make, and
by the seeming lawlessness of most of their courses. Closer observation
will show that a feiv of tlie lines coincide ivith natural features of the
country, such as sea-coasts and livers; but the great majority have no
such determinants, and are obviously entirely artificial. Everyone
versed in the history, of this Province will readily recall that some of
these boundaries have been subjects of serious international contentions,
have exhausted the powers of the highest diplomacy, and have brought
great nations within sight of war. A few are old, and interwoven with
the earlier periods of our history, while, others have had experiences
sufficiently remarkable or curious. Altogether, it is unlikely that any
other country of equal size Iws had its boundaries so often or con-
spicuously in contention, so fully discussed by many and weighty
commissions, so closely interlocked with its general history, or deter-
mined by so many distinct considerations as has the Province of New
Brunswick. It is the object of this work to attempt to explain the
precise factors which have determined for each New Brunsioick bound-
ary line its genesis, its persistence, its position, its direction and its
length.
