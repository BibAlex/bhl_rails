of Belledune river, until 1881 when it was restricted as at present.
East by the line south from Belledune river (run 1848) to the latter
line, changed in 1881 to run south four miles and thence south 50°
west, the present line (run 1872), to the south-east line.
Victoria. Set off from Carleton, April 13, 1844, the thirteenth
county, to separate the Tobique Grand Falls and the disputed terri-
tory from the lower settlements, and formed at this particular time
and with these particular boundaries in order to help make good a
claim to the territory then in dispute with Canada (see earlier, page
391). The shire town was Colebrooke, now Grand Falls, until 1876, when
it was changed to Andover. The line separating it from Carleton was
the Eiver des Chutes (the second natural county boundary in the pro-
vince), across the river, to a division line between lots, along that line
easterly and its prolongation to the county line of York. This was
changed by revised statutes of 1854 to a due east line from the mouth
of the Eiver des Chutes, but changed back by an Act of 1864 to the
former and present line (run 1863).
Albert. Set off from Westmorland March 27, 1845, the four-
teenth county, with Hopewell as shire town, recognizes the natural
separation imposed by the Eiver Petitcodiac, always difficult to cross
especially in winter. West, by St. John and Kings, the present line
(run 1836). South by Chignecto Bay as at present. East, by the
Petitcodiac as at present, the third river adopted as a county boundary
in New Brunswick. North, by the Petitcodiac as at present, and until
1846 by land grant lines, changed in that year to the present magnetic
lines (run 1846), this portion being given to Westmorland to retain
the head of the river in that county.
Madawaska. Set off from Victoria, April 14, 1873, the fifteenth
and newest county, to separate the French settlements into a county
by themselves, with Edmundston as shire town. Bounded from Vic-
toria by a line beginning on the St. John at the end of the Inter-'
national due north line and running N.E. (magnetic) to Eestigouche.
In 1875 this was changed to the present line, approximately following
Little Eiver for a distance, and then running true north to Eestigouche.
The dates here given for the erection of the later counties differ
from those given in the Act of 1896 in several cases. This is because
the latter gives the dates of confirmation by the English Government,
while I have given, as historically more important, the dates of erec-
tion by the Local Legislature. The dates of confirmation, when differ-
ent from those of erection are as follows; — the eight original counties,
1786; Carleton, 1832; Victoria, 1850; Eestigouche, 1838; Gloucester
and Kent, 1827.
