Tais belt has an average breadth of about four miles, aud, in con-
trast with the region to the south and east, is remarkable for the
persistency and comparative uniformity of the rocks composing it.
Among these, especially about Woodstock, are massive quartzites and
slates not obviously different from those of tlie region last described,
but with these, and over extended tracts almost to their entire exclusion,
are beds of volcanic or semi-volcanic origin, such as diorites, amyg-
daloids, felspathic sandstones or ash-rocks and agglomerates, with, in
places, extensive bands of granitoid grit, a rock only obscurely stratified
and at a short distance looking much like granite or syenite, but upon
closer inspection found to be largely a recomposed rock, and at times
becoming a distinct conglomerate. With these there are also, as on
Oak Mountain and in Monument settlement, well marked bands of
blood-red, somewhat hematitic slates, fragments of which, inclosed
in the overlying Silurian conglomerates, and very readily recognized,
afford the most convincing proof of the unconformity of the two
systems.
At various points along the course of the belt the rocks in question,
owing to their relative hardness and power of resistance, are noticeable
features in the landscape, and in the Oak Mountain Ridge, two miles
north of Benton, rise into a series of somewhat prominent hills.
Probably the most remarkable display of the " volcanics " is to
be seen along tlie course of Eel river above Benton, and in South
Eickmond and Monument Settlements, where, over very extensive
areas, including nearly all the country lying about such tributaries as
the Pocowogamis, Poeomoonshine and Gidney's brooks, hardly any-
thing else is met with, than dioritic rocks, often coarsely amygdaloidal.
These on water-worn surfaces are often seen to be also of a conglomerate
nature, blocks sometimes several feet in diameter being imbedded in a
matrix of apparently similar derivation.
It would, I think, be impossible for any one familiar with the
so-called Huronian rocks of southern New Brunswick to see the above
described beds of Carleton coimty without being struck with the very
close litholo'gical resemblances between the two. Wliile, however, the
former are in St. John coimty distinctly below and unconformable to
the Cambrian quartzites, the resembling beds are in Carleton interstrati-
fied with the latter, and must be regarded as being also a portion of the
Cambrian system, the Etcheminian and lower horizons being unrepre-
sented here. This view is further confirmed by the fact that in Monu-
ment Settlement the rocks of this volcanic and quartzite group are over-
laid by a considerable belt of black slates, which, though it has as yet
