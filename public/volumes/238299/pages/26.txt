PROCEEDINGS FOR 1901 IX
Majesty, Queen Victoria, who was a glory of the Empire, and had Â»won
by her public and private virtues the affection of all her subjects, and
the admiration of the whole world. We also pray that Your Excellency
will convey to His Majesty the expression of our most devoted loyalty,
and of our hope that the Eoyal Society will continue to receive from
him the same sympathy which was extended to it by the great Queen to
whom it owes the favour of its name."

T. Public Libraries. *
It is satisfactory to notice a steady movement in the great province
of Ontario in the direction of increasing public libraries and of other-
wise stimulating their efficiency. For instance, in accordance with a
resolution of the American Library Convention, held at Montreal in June
last, an Ontario Association has been regularly organized in Toronto.
Any person engaged in library work, as trustee, director, librarian or
in any other capacity, may become a member by paying the annual fee,
and any other person after election by the executive committee.
Libraries may join the association in the same way as individuals, and
shall be entitled to two representatives at the meeting of the association.
