SO doing he will pay a compensation to history and will discharge the
responsibilities which he cannot separate from the old King's hon-

he may not be playing the part of that worthy servant who earned
the high encomium from his Lord, " Well done, thou good and faith-
ful servant : thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee
ruler over many things " ? ^^
The Dominion of Canada, embracing as it does the whole territory
comprised in the ancient Royal Province of Nova Scotia, is governed
to-day by a Baronet of Nova Scotia, f in itself a circumstance of great
interest, but when it is further observed that Australia has for her
Governor-General a 13aronet of ISTova Scotia;;); and that India is ruled
by the son and heir apparent § of a Baronet of Kova Scotia; we find
that the dream of the wise and far-seeing King has, after all, been
realised; for, although King James the First built greater and other
than he knew, when he projected the Order of Baronet of Nova Scotia
to found and rule an Empire beyond the seas; nevertheless that Em-
pire has arisen — a vaster Empire than has been, — and by the Light
of Heaven's Guidance, under the administration of Baronets of 'Nova
Scotia, Viceroys of King Edward the Seventh, it increases, advances,
and flourishes.
