The operations of our Society for the year closing the olst of March
last have been attended with an encouraging measure of success.
The Society began the year with seven life members and 289
ordinary members. During the year one life member and 34 ordinary
members were elected. Deducting the number of members who had
resigned or died prior to 31st March, 1901, we began the current year
with a total number of 293 names on the roll.
The treasurer's report showed a balance carried forward from the
previous year of $95.42, and that receipts from all sources during the
year aggregated the sum of $1,006.42. The total expenditure amounted
to $1,062.36, so that we had a balance of $39.48 on the right side of
the ledger to carry forward into the current year.
The usual winter course of lectures given by the Society was
inaugurated by a conversazione in Goldsmith's Hall on the 23rd Novem-
ber, which was very largely attended by members and their friends.
The subjects of the lectures delivered, the dates of delivery and the
names of the lecturers are as follow: —
Nov. 30. — "Land and Letters of the Fastens " (illustrated), by Pro-
fessor Prince.
