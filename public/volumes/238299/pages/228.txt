[hill-tout] origin OF THE TOTEMISM OF THE ABORIGINES IS
of the sidia or dream totem; but as the serious differences in their
respective accounts of the northern totems show that one or other of
them has not fully understood this difficult and perplexing subject, and
that much remain yet to l)e learnt concerning it, I am disposed to
think that when fuller and more detailed investigations have been made
we shall find that s√ªlia-i'&m. underlies much of the totemism of the
Haida-Tlingit and Tsimshian as of the tribes which border them. How-
ever, whether it does or not, there is no doubt that the totems of this
region arise in one or other of the two ways I have pointed out, and
that the members of them do not regard themselves as descendants of
their totem prototypes as appears commonly to be the case in other
regions and amongst other peoples.
It would be interesting to continue our subject further and consider
the reasons which lead to the amalgamation of gentes into clan groups
and phratries which are sometimes endogamic, at others exogamic, and
why in one tribe we find two clans, in another three and in another
four. But the data bearing on some of these subjects are yet too imper-
fect and contradictory for any satisfactory results to l^e obtained from
the attempt, more detailed and systematic investigation being necessary
before we shall be in a position to undertake such a task.
