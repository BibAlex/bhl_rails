doubt upon many others. Upon Coronelli of 1689, however,
No. 11) a somewhat different boundary is given, for it runs from the
St. Croix to the watershed which it follows southwestward, while Nova
Scotia is confined between this and New England. Upon what grounds
Coronelli could thus limit Nouvelle Ecosse it is difficult to see. Vis-
scher makes the western boundary of Nova Scotia follow the St. John,
and it is of interest to note that he marks a boundary between the
peninsula and the mainland, the first boundary line so drawn. Dis-

Map No. 10. Sanson, 1656. Outline tracing from original ;
tinct boundary lines appear upon Delisle of 1703 (Map No. 8),
which is of interest as being the only known map which gives a bound-
ary to Gaspesie. Of much interest is D'Anville's map of 1746 which
according to Jefferys (Conduct of the French, 47) made the boundary
between English and French a line drawn N. from the western bound-
ary of New England, to 46°, and thence E. by N. through the country
to a point ten miles N. of Bay Verte. This line oi course was intended
to follow the parallel of 46°, the old northern limit of Acadia.
La Hontan's maps of 1708 and later (Winsor, America, V., 473), shows
an east and west line just above the parallel of 43°. After 1713 most
of the English maps at least mark the western boundary line of Nova
Sc>,tia from the source of the St. Croix, and this upon Popple is a
sinuous line running in a northerly direction, but upon Jefferys, 1755,
