of their legal foundations. In
establishing the north-west
angle in another place how-

phrase of their instructions,
which fitted the new position
as well as the old,^
In both insti'uctions and treaty

Nova Scotia is used, not as a
proper name but simply as a
descriptive phrase, to describe
a certain point. The treaty was
describing the boundaries of the

an absurdity an adherence to the
language of the instructions with
a change in their substance led
them elsewhere.
