32 ROYAL SOCIETY OF CANADA
There is a fine passage between Jonathan and David, the Hebrew^
Damon and Pythias. Jonathan, the king's son, sues for David's friend-
ship, and David, remembering the difference in their rank, is for a time
respectfully distant, but in the end succumbs to the genuine warmth
of Jonathan's love.
O, David, genius makes the world its vassal,
(says Jonathan)
Lo, now I woo thee, let us woo each other,
And not by means of woman-winning words,
But by the manlier proxy of our deeds.
Let thine, performed in Elah's steep-bound vale.
Approach to mine, performed at steepy Michmash.
Let Elah Michmash kiss, and Michmash Elah ; —
And for the rest, why, let us imitate them.
Saul is again possessed by Malzah, and raves wildly in his madness.
He exhausts himself with his mad rage, and Malzah, released for a
time from duty, sings:
There was a devil and his name was T ;
From Profundus he did cry ;
He changed his note as he changed his coat,
And his coat was of a varying dye.
It had many a hue : in hell 'twas blue,
'Twas green i' the sea, and white i' the sky.
Oh, do not ask me, ask we why
'Twas green i' the sea, and white i' the sky ;
Why from Profundus he did cry :
Suffice that he wailed with a chirruping note,
And quaintly cut was his motley coat. —
I have forgot the rest. Would I could sleep ;
Would I could sleep away an age or so.
And let Saul work out his own weal or woe :
All that I ask is to be let alone.
(sings)
Oh, to be let alone ! to be let alone !
To laugh, if I list ; if I list, to groan ;
Despairing, yet knowing God's anger o'erblown.
Oh, why should God trouble me ?
Why should he double my
Sorrow, pursuing me when He has thrown
Me out of his favor ? Oh, why should He labor
Down lower ever thrusting me into Hell's zone ?
Oh, let me alone ! oh, let me alone !
Oh, leave me, Creator, Tormentor, alone.
Peace ; here comes Saul, more wretched than myself.
