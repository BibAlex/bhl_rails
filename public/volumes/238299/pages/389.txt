Southack is another question, the solution or non-solution of which
does not affect the main point here involved, that the mouth of the
St. Croix on MitchelFs map is the Letete Passage with the Inner Bay
omitted. We are not, however, without light upon this latter question,
to solve which we naturally ask what charts were prohahly used by
Map No. 26. Blackmore, 1713. From original; X f
Southack himself in preparing his large chart of 1733 (Map No. 23)
for publication. Here we can speak with some certainty. In 1713
a survey of the Bay of Fundy was made by Blackmore, whose chart
has been reproduced in the preceding Monograph on Cartography
(366), and the Passamaquoddy portion of which is herewith repro-
duced. His survey was carefully made from Cape Mispeck to Point
Lepreau, and thence extended to the Wolves and Grand Manan, but
the boundary MS. showing that he or any of the others connected with the
Commission doubted the current interpretation of Mitchell's map is the follow-
ing passage in a Memorial presented by the American Agent at Providence,
Oct. 18, 1798, practically after the close of the whole discussion : —
" The undersigned Agent for the United States has the honour to suggest
that a few days before the last adjournment, the Agent for his said Majesty,
urged in his argument that a river marked on the map of John Mitchell
(which was the main guide in the treaty of peace between the above-men-
tioned powers as to the boundaries agreed on) by the name of Passamaquoddy
was in fact a stream issuing into the Bay of Cobscook, and that the other
river therein marked with the name of Saint Croix is in fact the Scoodiac —
that the argument was new in the controversy . . . ."
