of the map of Passamaquoddy were delivered to Governor Bernard in
August, 1764. On Feb. 9, 1765, Governor Bernard wrote the following
letter to Governor Wilmot of Nova Scotia, a copy of which is among
the Winslow papers.
Boston, Feb. 9, 1765.
Sr.
In my first letter to you proposing a settlement on the East side of the
River St. Croix, I had no other Authority for my designation of that river
but the information of the Indians now living there.^ Upon the receipt of
your letter of Deer. 16, I conceived that your Surveyor General understands
the river Passima [quoddy'] * to be the River St. Croix : if so, he annihilates
one river ; for all authentick geographers, that I have seen, distinguish the
River St. Croix from Passimaquoddy & place the latter "West of the former.
Capt. Southack [w/(o] surveyed that Coast with much attention at the end
of the last Century, in his large Chart, lays down those two rivers in that
manner, and describes them separately from his own observations on the
spot. Dr. Mitchell, who published his Map under the Authority of the board
of Trade, lays down those two rivers in the same manner. Mr. Turner, who
lately published a map of Nova Scotia, of not much authority, makes a river
Fall into that Bay, west of the river St. Croix, which he distinguishes from
St. Croix & calls Pesmocadie: which name he picked out of Popples inaccu-
rate Map. Now there are 4 rivers which fall into that Bay, of which that
called by the Indians Passimaquoddy is the most westerly: therefore accord-
ing to those Geographers St. Croix must be one of the other [three. Toi
elucidate this matter, I resorted to the foun [rfofiow worhsl to the voyages of
DeMons who gave [the name St.l Croix to that river, & the Voyages of
[Champlainl who accompanied De Mons in one of his voyag[es] thither. The
former were written by L'Escarbo[<] & are found translated in Purchases
[îcor/v-] the latter were written by himself & [p!<&]lished at Paris in 1632, I
mean the edition I have, which seems to be the first. They both agree in the
description of the place so as to put it beyond all doubt that Passimiquoddy
is not St. Croix ; but Champlain is much more explicit & seems to me to
point out plainly which is the river St. Croix. I send you an extract from
Champlain with references to a map^ of the upper part of the Bay which
contains all the rivers which fall into it ; from whence it appears to me, that
the River St. Croix is not that which the Indians lately pointed out, but
another Northwest of it : and as for Passimaquoddy my Surveyors have gone
thro it to Penobscot & it [ansicersi exactly to Champlain's Si[ccount of the"] R.
des Etchemins. [/ have"] no will or desire of my own [which rivl er shall be
deemed the River St. Croix : [nor do /] expect that the Country between Pen-
obscot & St. Croix will remain to this Province : but that it will be taken
into the King's hands in some way or other ; but then it dont follow that it
will be made part [of] the Province of Nova Scotia. If therefore my friends
should take grants on the West side of St. Croix, they might be hereafter im-
peached for being under the Seal of Nova Scotia «& out of its boundary. It is
for this rea son that I have been desirous of knowing the true River St. Croix:
