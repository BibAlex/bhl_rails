SACKVILLE, 1786. The old township (page 430, Map No. 40), including a
small portion of Botsford until 1805, a part of Shediac until 1827, en-
larged by a part of Westmorland and portions of Shediac and Bots-
ford in 1896.
[HOPEWELL, 1786. Since 1845 in Albert, which see.]
[HILLSBOROUGH, 1786. Since 1845 in Albert, which see.]
MONCTON, 1786. The old township,^ less extensive than at present, but en-
larged to nearly its present limits in 1835.
Dorchester, 1787. Set off from the unassigned land between Sackville and
Moncton, and included most of Shediac until 1827, and a part of Monc-
ton until 1835.
Salisbury, 1787. "Set off to include unassigned land west of Hopewell and)
Hillsborough ; partly included in Albert in 1845, which portion now
forms Elgin and part of Alma.
Botsford, 1805. Set off from Sackville and unassigned lands nearly as at
present, but including a small part of Shediac, enlarged in 1854 by
adoption of the due east line from Fox Creek as its southern boundary,
as shown on Wilkinson and on Loggie, but restricted again in 1896 ta
its present (which are nearly its original) limits.^
Shediac, 1827. Set off from Dorchester, Sackville, and a small part of West-
morland, nearly as at present, except for the change of its southern
boundary in 1896 from a due east line to the present position.
CHAELOTTE COUNTY, 1785.
The original seven parishes included only a part of the county,,
which was not all assigned to parishes until 1869 (possibly 1814).*
Their boundaries were adopted almost entirely from the lines of the
great grants made here in 1784 to the Loyalist Associations (compare
Monograph of Historic Sites, 338 and Map No. 34).
SAINT STEPHEN, 1786. As at present, but with its north line extended ta
the St. Croix until 1813, when it was enlarged northward to the ex-
tended north line of Saint David. But in 1823, it was reduced to nearly
its present limits by the erection of Saint James, and further by the
erection of Dufferin in 1873.
^ Strictly the boundaries would have fallen about as shown on Map No..
35, but the later maps show that it was assumed to be bounded northerly by
the county line.
" On Baillie's and other maps, Westmorland is extended to occupy the
angle between Sackville and Botsford.
' The Act of 1814 extending Saint Patrick and Saint George northward to
the county line, did not so extend Pennfield, but such an extension seems ta
have been assumed, for it appears on all maps even including Wilkinson. I
oan, however, find no legal justification for it, except that, as its northern
boundary in 1786 was the extended northern line of Saint George, the removal
of the latter northward may have been thought to carry the northern
boundary of Pennfield with it.
