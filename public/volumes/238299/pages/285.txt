perial Crown, holding in his Dexter paw, a Sword, Gules, in Pale, Hilted
and Pomelled Or, in the Dexter chief point a Thistle proper, ensign'd

Baronets of Nova Scotia are all entitled to Supporters as incidental
to their hereditary dignity, for " if Supporters be distinctive of, and ap-
propriate to those grades of hereditary rank theretofore existing in the
State, namely the Peers; and that Baronets are to be adjudged 'in all
things relating to privilege and other matters by the same rules, laws,
and customs by which other degrees of dignity hereditary are ordered and
adjudged,' then it follows that Supporters legitimately appertain to the
Order of Baronets. This was the conclusion of Lord Lyon King of
Arms when he assigned Supporters to the Nova Scotia Baronets." ^*
