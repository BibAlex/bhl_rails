American volume of the English Pilot and elsewhere was the natural
source of information for Mitchell. That he used it and took the
Passamaquoddy region from it is plain when the Passamaquoddy part
of the Southack Chart, reproduced herewith (Map No. 23) is com-
pared with the same region on Mitchell.^ The resemblance (allowing
for the difference of scale) amounts to identity, the more especially as

Q D^ -^^
Map No. 23. Southack, 1733. From tracing- of original ; x ^^,.
no other known map of the time shows anything like a similar topo-
graphy from which Mitchell could have copied this part of his map.
Our present question then resolves itself into this, what is the identity
of the St. Croix Eiver on Southack ? It appears to have been assumed
by everyone who has written on this subject from the Agents in 1796
^ This was well known to Sullivan, the American agent, for in one place
in his arguments he says, " The map of Mitchell was a collection from maps
then in being, and not from actual surveys. No doubt he depended much
upon Cap. Southack."
