BOUNDARIES OF NEW BRUNSWICK

before 1700 which extends the name Nova Scotia or New Scotland to
the peninsula. After 1713 however, the English maps naturally begin
to extend the name to the peninsula, while of course the French did
not.
The English and French commissioners cite a number of maps in
support of their respective claims ; some of these are here cited, but
others, notably those by Berry, Morden and Thornton are unknown
to me.
We consider next the maps showing actual boundary lines. The
earliest that I have found is that of 1640-1650 given by Winsor, (Am-

liest attempt to place the bounds of Nova Scotia upon a map, and

wirk boundary line is drawn, and it is the more interesting in that it
is French (Map No. 9). I cannot explain the aberrent features of
this rather remarkable map. The next to show a boundary is that of
Sanson of 1656 (Map No. 10) in which a boundary between New
England and the French possessions is drawn from just east of the
Kennebec to the watershed, which it follows southeast, a view entirely
in accordance with the views and desires of the French at that time,
but one in which the English by no means acquiesced, as our preced-
ing narrative shows. This boundary was repeated upon a map of 1663
given by Winsor (America, IV., 148), upon Duval of 1677 and no
