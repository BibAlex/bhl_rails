[MACKENZIE] THE BARONETS OF NOVA SCOTIA 115
many Members of the Order donned the White Cockade, and fought
and fell, like their fathers, in the cause of the same Royal House.
" For old hereditary right.
For conscience sake they stoutly stood,
And for the Crown their valiant sons
Themselves have shed their injured blood;
And if their fathers ne'er had fought
For heirs of ancient royalty,
They're down the day that might ha'e been
At the top of honours tree a " ^^
After the withdrawal of the Baronets of Nova Scotia from the
Royal Province, the wearing of the Cognizance gradually fell into dis-
use, a contributing cause being the dormancy of many of the titles
and the non-assumption of others by the heirs, owing to the unsettled
state of their fortunes and the disturbed conditions of the Kingdom
in general, though it was again " partially used at the Restoration.'' ^^
However, ias the heirs of those Baronets of ISTova Scotia, whose titles
became dormant from various causes, never lost their inherent right
to those titles, for, "As dignities cannot be aliened, sfurxendered or ex-
tinguished by the person^ possessed of them, neither can they be lost
by the negligence of any of the persons entitled thereto, in not claim-
ing them within any particular time," ^^ so neither did the heirs of
the Baronets of Nova Scotia ever lose the right to wear the Cognizance
appertaining to their Order which right merely lay dormant for a
period. Although dormant this right was however not forgotten by
the Baronets of Nova Scotia; and meetings were held in the reigns of
King George the First, King Greorge the Second, and King G-eorge
the Third, with the object of reviving the same. At a general meeting
held 14th of June, 1775,| twenty Baronets being present in person
and six by proxy, an authentic extract of the Royal Warrant of King
Charles the First, dated the 17th of November, 1629, by which the
Baronets of Nova Scotia were authorized to wear the Cognizance was
considered, " and several original medals of the order were produced
by several baronets, whose ancestors had worn them, together with sev-
eral patents of different dates. They then unanimously resolved from
respect to the crown, by which this badge was bestowed, and in duty
to their families, to r√©assume this privilege of their order." ^* Letters
were produced and read from twenty-three other Baronets of Nova

and Honorary Distinctions conferred on the British Navy, Army and Auxi-
liary Forces. 1891.
