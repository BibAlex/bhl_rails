are described in the grants of the townships in the Ms. grant books at
Halifax and in the New Brunswick copies. They are shown upon a
single published map, namely DesBarres chart of 1780, sketches from
which are given herewith (Maps Nos. 40, 41).^ These parishes have
since been altered somewhat by the erection of new parishes, etc., but

some of the old boundaries still persist, and they may be traced by a
comparison of the boundaries as given by DesBarres with the modern
map (Map No. 1). All of the other parishes of 1786 were, however,
new creations based upon the distribution of the earliest settlements.
In some cases parish lines, as we have seen earlier, have deter-
mined county lines, as in Gloucester and Restigouche, and in the
earlier boundaries of Kent.
