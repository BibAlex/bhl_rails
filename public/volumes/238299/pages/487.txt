region until 1855, when their very detailed and accurate surve_ys of
the entire boundary gave data for all maps down to the present. A
number of plans and sketches showing parts of New Brunswick as
made during the surveys of 1846-47, are mentioned in the Blue-book,
pages 96-98. An interesting point in connection with all maps pub-
lished between 1851 and 1855, which show the northern boundary, is
the fact that they show the line from the St. Francis to the point a
mile south of Long Lake running north-east, and very short, whereas
in maps since that date (Maps 32, 33) it runs more nearly east and
is much longer, a peculiarity earlier explained. The same maps also,
for reasons likewise earlier given, show the Patapedia emptying
through the Mistouche, the river which is noAV called upon our maps
Tracy's Brook.
Second, there was a series of maps, of more or less influence upon
the general maps, prepared to illustrate reports on the disputed terri-
tory. Of these the most important are those in Baillie's Eeports of
1844, and Wells' Eeport of the same year, and the maps accompanying
the report of 1848, and Dr. Lushington's award of 1851, both in the
Blue-book of 1851. The former is a particularly beautiful map in
soft colours. Other maps belonging with these are mentioned in the
Blue-book, pages 22, 23, 24. One of them, a plan prepared by Arrow-
smith in 1845 to illustrate the various lines proposed for the settle-
ment of the boundary is fully described on pages 96-98 of the Blue-
book. I have not as yet been able to see a copy, and perhaps it was
never published.
Third, we may consider the reflection of the phases of the
boundary controversy in the contemporary maps. Prior to 1783 all
of the maps showed Kova Scotia bounded by the northern watershed
and the due north line from the source of the St. Croix (Maps No.
14 and 15). In somewhat later maps, such as the Kitchin (Map No. 27)
â€¢of 1794, when the American boundary begins to deviate to the west-
ward, the interprovincial boundary is left undefined. The printed
maps of early in this century without exception, beginning with
Bouchette of 1815, make the Eestigouche the boundary, either by that
river to the due north line and along the latter as in Bouchette, 1815
and 1831, or from along the Eestigouche, and along Grand Eiver to
the St. John and the north line as in Henderson's map of the St. John
of 1827 and Baillie, 1832. It is not until after 1842 that any change
occurs in this 'arrangement.
Finally after 1855, beginning with Wilkinson of 1859, all the maps
show the line as at present.
