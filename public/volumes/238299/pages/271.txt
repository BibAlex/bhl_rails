INTKODUCTION".
The story of the Foundation of the Dignity of Baronet of JSTova
Scotia, with which this essay deals, is not one of mere empty titles
lightly won, but a record of honours bestowed by a patriotic Sovereign
with a fixed object in view and to achieve a definite purpose, viz., the
furtherance of a great colonial scheme, which originated in the brain
of a wise Ejng, who, though he did not live to see his dream realised,
designed the establishment of a mighty colonial Empire beyond the
seas, 1)Y means of which he foresaw that the good of the mother
country would likewise be promoted.
Projected by Eang James the First in 1624; erected by King
Charles the First in 1625; continued and strengthened with fresh
creations by the successors of these Sovereigns until the last of the
Order was created by Queen Anne, in 1707; the Baronets of ISTova
Scotia are associated entirely with the Royal House of Stuart, whose
vicissitudes and varying fortunes have found a counterpart in their
own, accompanied, in many instances, by circumstances of the most

In this essay, which deals with the Baronetage of Nova Scotia as
a whole, it is impossible, consistent with brevity, to refer particularly
to the fortunes of individual members of the Order. The writer, how-
ever, hopes in a future paper to relate the remarkable vicissitudes un-

his knowledge during the examination of various records, as well as
of old manuscripts and papers communicated to him by Members of
the Order and others; documents not only containing information of
great genealogical and historical value to the Baronetage generally, but
also recording incidents calculated to have a deep personal interest
for members of the Order individually; for, "However remote may be
the time and through whatever chaos of mouldering records the labo-
rious search must pierce, there is a peculiar feeling of gratification in
poring over an old ancestral document. It seems like stepping back
into the days of our forefathers and conversing with those who have
slept for ages in the silent dust.'^ ^
The ancient Baronets of Nova Scotia were not mere idle gallants
or Court favourites of the hour, but men of weight and standing spe-
cially chosen as fit for enterprise wliich called, not only for the posses-
sion of high courage and a spirit of adventure, but also for qualities
of an administrative and executive character, combined with a capa-
city to endure the unaccustomed hardsliips and privations necessarily
