[ BURPEE] CHARLES HEAVYSEGE 37
Zelelitlia:
stay here 'til I dismiss you.
The augel disappears, and Malzah sulkily mutters:
I will stay no longer.
Grieve Saul thyself ; kill David ; ay, kill me :
For to live thus is worse than Tophet's torment.
Then, turning to Saul, he cries:
I will end thee,— I'll tear thee yet to pieces ;
Kill or be killed, or die as other men :
Then will my liberty be mine again.
I do begin to find this task beneath me,
And hate thee even as I hate Zelehtha.
But the thunder-clouds of adversity are gathering thick and fast
around Saul. Even strife and change now but feebly stir him, whose
warrior soul had once gloried in conflict.
I feel I'm growing old ; (he says) and creep along
The remnant of my shortened days of age.
Indifferent, toward where looms desolate.
Death's sullen land ....
Oh, I am sick to the bottom of my being !
And there is no physician ; no going back
To youth, and health, and herd-keeping in Gibeah.
Malzah is at last released from his most obnoxious task, and in
unbounded delight breaks into song:
Now let me fly.
On legs of love and wings of joy ;
And peep into each crystal glass
Of fountain, as I by it pass.
To see if from my visage go
The traces of my recent woe :
Then blithely let me journey on
To meet Great Zaph ere sets the sun, —
Before the sun sets 'neath the sea,
Again to Zaph re-render me.
How he appears before Zaph, let Zepho, the messenger, describe: —
He doth his angel-form abuse.
Like naught in hell, like naught in heaven.
Nor earth-born ; — up to frolic given,
He cometh like a moving grove.
Covered with creepers quaintly wove ;
Half like an ivy-covered tower.
