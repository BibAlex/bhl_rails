Tn 1638 an addition was made to this grant, and the whole was then con-
veyed to Sir William Alexander himself, his son having died in the
meantime. Its limits are plain, and as shown on the accompanying map
No. 4 ; precisely the same territory was in 1663 granted to the Duke of
York, as will presently be noticed. Yet it would seem plain that neither
the King nor the Council for New England had any right to grant this
territory, which, at least as far as the Penobscot, was clearly restored to
l^'rance, at least in implication, by the Treaty of Saint Germain. But
this grant to Alexander, like his grant of Nova Sootia, gradually lapsed
and became extinct.
We must now notice another local grant, which, although it did not
have any direct connection with any part of the present Province of New
Brunswick, nevertheless indirectly did have an important influence upon
later discussions of the boundaries. In 1630, when the elder LaTour
was in England, he accepted a Baronetcy of Nova Scotia from Sir Wil-
liam Alexander, and in that year he and his son were granted two
baronies in Nova Scotia, which are thus described in the Suffolk Co.,
Massachusetts, Eecords : —
All the Country, Coasts and Islands, from the Cape and River of Ingo-
gon, nere vnto the Clouen Cape, in the said New Scotland, called the Coun-
trey and Coast of Accadye, following the Coast and Islands of the said
Countrey towards the East vnto Port de la Tour, formerly named L'omeroy,
and further beyond the said Port, following along the said Coast vnto Mir-
liquesche, nere vnto and beyond the said Port and Cape of L'Heve, drawing
forward fifteen Leagues, within the said Lands towards the North
(Slaftcr's "Alexander," 75.)
The location of this grant is perfectly clear ; it extended from Che-
gogin near the old Cape Forchu (about the present Yarmouth) along
the south coast of Nova Scotia as far as Mirleguash (that is, to about
