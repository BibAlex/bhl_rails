LXII KOYAL SOCIETY OF CANADA
Before the end of January, at the latest, reports of the work done
within the various provinces during the year ended December the 31st
previous, should be made by the secretaries for the provinces to the
general secretary, from which the annual report to the Eoyal Society
shall be principally compiled. By the first of January, therefore, the
annual reports of county secretaries and members should be sent in to
the secretaries of the provinces.
To cover the expenses of official printing and postage, a nominal fee
of twenty-five cents per annum is expected for membership (or one dol-
lar for five years in advance, or five dollars for life membership). Secre-
taries for the provinces, when remitting the amount of fees from mem-
bers to the general treasurer, are authorized to deduct the necessary
expenses for provincial office work, transmitting vouchers for the same
with the balance.
The names of those reporting any kind of valuable Iwtanical work
during the year will be published in the list of active members, even
should the payment of fees be forgotten. All payments are credited to
the current year and the future. Lapsed active membership can, there-
fore, he restored at any time without the payment of arrears — for there
are no arrears recorded in the Botanical Club of Canada.
