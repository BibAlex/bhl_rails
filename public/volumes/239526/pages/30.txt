Marginella mayii, Tate.
Tate, Trans. Roy. 8oc. S.A. xxiv., 1900, p. 93.
Mr. Brazier has shown me a shell of which he took a sinole
o
specimen in 8 fathoms off the Inner North Head, Sydney Harbour.
By comparison with an authentic specimen received from Mr.
W. L. Ma}'' I have identified this as a dwarf form of M. mayii.
Vermetus caperatus, Tate & May.
Thylacodes caperatus, Tate cfe May, Trans. Roy. Soc. S.A. xxiv.,
1900, p. 94.
During a recent excursion of the Field Naturalists' Club to
Balmoral this species was found by myself and others for the first
time in Australia in
plenty under stones at
half tide level.
The authors of this
species state that the
animal is unknown.
Mr. H. L Kesteven has
Operculum and radula. j^-^^j^^ prepared for me
the drawings for the accompanying illustrations
of the operculum, radula and the jaw as a whole and in detail.
The presence of an operculum necessitates the removal of the
species from Thylacodes.
Bifidaria macleayi, Brazier.
Fnpa {Vertigo) tnicleayi^ Brazier, Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S.W. i. ,
1876, p. 110.
(Plate iii., fig. 39.)
M}' drawing of this hitherto unfigured species is taken from an
authentic specimen in the Macleay Museum, 2-5 mm. in length.
It is labelled Barnard Islands, No. iii., a locality not named in
the original description. The genus Bifidaria was described by
Sterki.*
