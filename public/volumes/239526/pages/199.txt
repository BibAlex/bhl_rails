Kesembling N. rufipaljns, Casteln., but very distinct : by
head smaller ; prothorax with border wider and not the least
sinuate posteriorly, the posterior marginal puncture not in lateral
channel but on the widened border at each basal angle; elytra
with interstices depressed, eighth wider than ninth; mesosternum
concave between coxae, &c.
NOTONOMUS BAKEWELLI, n.sp.
Elongate-oval, robust. Head large ; prothorax subcordate;
basal angles subrectangular : elytra oval, strongly striate; inter-
stices convex, third 4-punctate, eighth narrow and convex
throughout its whole length. Black, a faint bronzy tinge on
prothorax near basal impressions, a ver}^ faint blackish-green
tint on elytra.
Head large (3*8 mm. across eyes), wide across occiput, convex;
frontal striae strongly impressed, wide, extending to cl3'peus; eyes
convex, not prominent; posterior part of orbits as long as eyes,
sloping gently to head. Prothorax broader than long(4-l x 5 mm.),
wider at apex (3-7 mm.) than at base (3'3 mm.); sides lightly
rounded on anterior three-fourths, lightly sinuate before base;
apex emarginate in middle; base truncate; basal angles strongly
marked, obtuse at summit; posterior marginal puncture placed at
basal angle outside lateral channel; border narrow, thick, reflexed,
thickened at basal angle to receive marginal puncture. Elytra oval
(10 X 6 mm.), rather depressed on disc; sides lightly rounded, lateral
sinuosities of apex almost obsolete; basal border joining lateral
border at humeral angles without interruption; interstices convex,
tliird, fifth and seventh wider than others, eighth narrow, about
same width as ninth on basal half, tenth interstice obsolete
except at apical extremity. Prosternum longitudinally channelled
towards base, intercoxal declivity rounded and rather wide in
