Phebalium Ralstoni, Benth.
Warrumbungle Ranges (W. Forsyth; October, 1901).
Previously recorded only from the Southern Dividing Range.
The Warrumbungle Ranges specimens are unfortunately only in
fruit, but they resemble so closely Dr. Leichhardt's type-specimens
from Castle Rock Mountain (a locality whose situation we do not
know) that we do not hesitate to refer them to this species. The}'-
differ from Bentham's description in the 'Flora Australiensis ' in
the prominent beak of the ripe carpels and in the stellate
tomentum on the young branches, which occurs sparingly also on
the underside or the young lea\'e8.

Jennings (J. L. Boorman ; October, 1901V A new locality
for a rare plant. This shrub grovv^s 5 to 6 feet high in rich
alluvial soil on the side of a creek. The Jennings specimens
are entirely identical with Mueller's type-specimens from the
Severn River. Other Xew South Wales localities, representing
a rather narrow-leaved form, are : — Head of Maeleay River, open
sandy ground (Carron; between 1860 and 1870); Braidwood(W.
Bauerlen; 1888); Bermagui (W. Bauerlen, 1889); Apsley Falls,
