312 REVISION OF THE GENUS yOTOSOMUS,
Note. — One specimen ((J) is less elongate; prothorax a little
shorter; elytra more metallic in colour (bronzy or brassy purple),
with more convex interstices, puncture of third interstice near
apex, eighth not reaching the base. Length 13, breadth 4-7 mm.
I should expect N. simulans, Chaud., to resemble this form in
colour, but to be a different species intermediate between N.
victoriensis and N. dyscoloides.

Elongate. Prothorax and posterior part of head aeneous (pro-
thorax sometimes of a purplish brassy colour); elytra dark violet;
under surface black, nitid; episterna of prosternum iridescent;
legs black. Head small (2-6 mm. across eyes), oval, convex ;
frontal impressions distinct, sharpl}^ defined, short, diverging
backwards; eyes convex, not protuberant. Prothorax of equal
length and breadth (3-8 x 3*8 mm.), widest before middle, not the
least ampliate at widest part, wider across base (3 mm.) than
apex (2*7 mm.), depressed across basal third; sides lightly and
obliquely narrowed to base, shortly subsinuate before base (the
posterior sinuosity sometimes obsolete); anterior angles obtuse,
not marked; base emarginate in middle, truncate on each side;
basal angles rectangular (sharply marked); border narrow, a little
more widely reflexed posteriorly than anteriorly, dilated at basal
angles to receive posterior marginal puncture, extending on each
side of base to lateral basal impressions — these deep, elongate,
narrow, sulciform at bottom ; lateral basal spaces depressed.
Elytra long (8x4*8 mm.), subdepressed, strongly declivous to
apex, truncate at base; sides lightly rounded, gently narrowed to
base; apical sinuosities well developed; basal border raised into
a short, strong subdentiform prominence at each humeral angle;
