Introduction.
Rock composition, geologic structure, coastal movements, and
the agents of denudation are the codepcndent criteria of any
theory as to the origin of present land forms.
Of late years the study of the topographical features of a
country as illustrating its geological histor}' has received much
attention.
The evolution of mature river systems from plateaux of accu-
mulation and erosion ; the appearances of land forms in gently
