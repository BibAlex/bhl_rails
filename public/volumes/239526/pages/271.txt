376 AUSTRALIAN FUNGI,
This is evident!}^ a serious disease of the Orange, rotting the
entire contents, while the skin looks quite healthy at first, although
ultimately becoming discoloured. Mr. French observed that 75%
of the Oranges examined were black inside (Internal Black Rot),
while the outside appearance of the fruit was perfect. There
was a considerable amount of 'Scale' on the skin, which undoubt-
edly rendered the fruit an easy prey to the fungus. This mould
varies considerably in its colour. It is snow-white at first, then
greenish and blackish, and the conidia form a yellowish-green
layer at first, then dark olivaceous.
7. METASPH.ERIA LEPIDOSPERMiE, U.Sp.
Perithecia in lines close together on stem, often on inky-black
patches, punctiform, minute, black, membranaceous, with pore,
erumpent through stomata, 72 ^ diam. Asci very delicate and
rupturing as soon as ripe, cylindric-clavate, rounded and thickened
at apex, narrowing towards base, and somewhat pointed at the
end, 86-90 x 13-1 5 ju; paraphyses slender, as long as asci. Sporidia
biseriate, elongated-fusoid to elongated-clavate, slightly curved,
typically 3-septate, and medium septum most distinct, not con-
stricted at septa, at first hyaline then honey -3^ellow, 25-26 J x 6 J-7/x.

The stems were conspicuously discoloured with inky-black
patches, which were isolated or run together, and either partial^
or entirely surrounding the stem. The minute perithecia running
in lines are just visible to the naked eye, and while they frequentl}^
occur on the discoloured stem they are also found on the black
patches. Hundreds of plants are attacked and dying; even the
young green shoots are affected, and die off before reaching
maturity.
