A GUM BACTERIUM FROM A KUCALYPT,
The bacterium differs absolutely morphologically from Bac.
levaniformans, the organism which occurs in cane-juice, and in
raw and refined sugars; and it is interesting that the same gum
should be formed by two widely differing species of bacteria.
The specific characters of the bacterium, which I have named
Bacterium eucalypti^ are given at the end of this paper.
In testing the various points connected with the growth of the
organism, it was found that growth occurred at 22°, 30°, and 37° C.
The bacterium did not appear to have a preference for either of
the higher temperatures; the growths appeared equally copious,
although at 37° it was dry and stiff, while at 30° it was moist
and flowing. A faintly acid medium (acidity = 0-075% tartaric
acid) enables the organism to grow better, and to produce more
gum than neutral or slightly alkaline media. Saccharose and
raffinose («.p'., Eucalyptus manna) are the only carbohydrates
from which the bacterium appears to form gum. No levan was
produced, and the growth was always scanty when dextrin,
starch, levulose, dextrose, lactose or maltose was substituted for
saccharose in the medium.
The composition of the fluid saccharose culture* as regards
sugars and gum was tested in the manner described in a former
paper t at the end of one, nine and nineteen days. The results
are calculated upon 100 parts of saccharose which the medium
contained in the litre, and due allowance has been made for the
evaporation of the culture fluid daring its incubation at 30°.
