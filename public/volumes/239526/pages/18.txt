As a rule A. Jimhriahim is flatter than A. tentoriforme.
Although the above characters are the most constant, none of
them can be implicitly relied on. I have seen A. fi^nhriatum with
a concave base and A. tentoriforme without any sign of a tooth.
There is, however, one recognition mark to which one may pin
one's faith — the operculum ; this will be always found reliable.
The differences are shown by my figures.

A. fimhriatnm A. tentoriforme.

The radulse are almost exactly alike; if there is any difference it
is that the marginals of A. fimhriatum are larger than those of
A. tentoriforme.
It is more than probable that both
species occur in South Australia and
Tasmania, though only A. fimhriatum
has been recorded from there. 2\
georgianus was obtained at King
George's Sound, S.W. Australia.
These two species would seem to
present an exception to the rule that
distinctive characters are inherited
earlier in successive generations, for
by that theory A. fimhriatum, should be
descended from discoidal ancestors, whilst y1. tentoriforme should
come from trochiform ancestors, and such a divergence of
ancestry would be manifested in anatomical characters.
