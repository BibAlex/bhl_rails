a dark almost black keel, the standard and wings often (not
always) striped with blue. The Paldrumatta Bore specimens are
much more hairy than Mitchell's prostrate type-specimens from
the Balonne River, Queensland.
Acacia rhigiophylla. F.v.M.
AVest Wyalong (R. H. Cambage; September, 1900).
New for New South Wales. Previously only recorded from the
desert on the Lower Murray River towards Mt. Barker Range
in South Australia.
Acacia harpophylla, F.v.M,
Marsden (R. H. Cambage; September, 1900).
The trees attain a height of 20 to 30 feet, according to Mr.
Cambage, and cover about 5 acres, 3| miles west of Marsden.
The most southern locality hitherto recorded is Coolabah.
HALORAGEa:.
Myriophyllum pedunculatum, Hook. f.
Mt. Wilson (Jesse Gregson ; December, 1901, in flower;
February, 1902, in fruit).
A southern species, recorded in these Proceedings in April,
1899, as "new for New South AVales " from Mt. Kosicusko, but
never found, or at all events recorded, north of this station. The
floating specimens from Mt. Wilson have long and slender stems
with leaves above 1 inch long; specimens growing in mud are
shorter, and resemble much more the Tasmanian specimen figured
by J. D. Hooker in his 'Flora of Tasmania' (Vol. i. t. 23 b.). The
male flowers are very shortly pedunculate or sessile; the carpels
are only sparingly tuberculate.
MYRTACEiE.
Baeckea diffusa, Sieb.
Port Macquarie (G. R. Brown ; February, 1897); Hastings
River (W. Best, communicated b}^ W. Forsyth; August, 1901).
Most northern locality recorded.
