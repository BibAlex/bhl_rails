560 MAMMALIAN AND REPTILIAN VOMERINE BONES.
Addendum (added 14th Felruary, 1903).
Since the above paper was sent off I have discovered the
presence of a pair of large prevomers in Titanosuchus; and also
a well developed pair of prevomers in a moderately large jDrimi-
tive Theriodont, allied to Lycosuclius, but as yet undescribed.
As a large pair of prevomers are known to occur in Tcipino-
ceplialus, the various stages in the evolution of the prevomer
may now be regarded as at least approximately known. From a
form like PareiasauruSy with a palate formed on the Rhj^ncho-
cephalian t3^pe, we get derived the Prototheriodonts Tainno-
cephalus and Titanosuchus — unfortunately as yet very imperfectly
known. In the next stage we find the true primitive Theriodonts
of the type of Lycosuclius (Proc. S. Af. Phil. Soc. 1902) with a
pair of moderately developed and quite distinct prevomers And
lastly, we have the higher Theriodont type represented by Gom-
phognathus and closely resembling the condition in Ornitlio-
rliynclms. In Gorgonops — which though veiy imperfectly known,
probably belongs to the Prototheriodonts, — we have the pre-
vomers anchylosed as in Ornitliorliynclius and JSLiniopterus (R.B.,
7th January, 1903).
