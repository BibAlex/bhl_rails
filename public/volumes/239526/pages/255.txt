336 AUSTRALIAN RHOPALOCERA : LYC.EyiD.E,
hewitsoiii, but has a more acute apex and a straighter outer
margin.
Hewitson gives an excellent figure of this sex only. Though
Miskin correctly determined a female specimen from Mackay for
Mr. R. E. Turner, yet he says that the Australian Museum con-
tained a female. But the specimens of 0. orrjutes have only been
there for about two years; and I have no doubt he mistook a
male of 0. amaryllis for the female of 0. oroetes, as he was doubt-
ful of his determination. Mr. F. D. Dodd, of Townsville, has
bred some fine examples of this species, from which m}^ descriptions
are mainly taken; they, however, do not show the blue in the
cell on the underside as shown in Hewitson's figure, but this is
the only variation. The recognition marks of this species are the
acute apex and straight outer margin to the forewing ; and
the straight discal dark band on the underside of the forewing.
A further recognition mark of the male is the purplish-blue tint
on the upperside; and of the female the absence of scarlet in the
cell of the underside of the forewing.
Loc. â€” Moreton Bay (Hewitson), Mackay (li. E. Turner),
Townsville (Dodd).
This species appears to be confined to Queensland.
