280 REVISION OF THE GENUS NOTOXOMUS,
NOTONOMUS FROGGATTI, 11. sp.
(J. Oval, depressed. Head small; prothorax subquadrate, much
wider at base (3'7 mm.) than at apex (3-1 mm.); posterior angles
obtuse; posterior marginal puncture distant from basal angle :
elytra rather depressed, strongly striate; interstices convex, third
5-punctate, tenth feebly developed near apex. Black, with faint
greenish reflections near lateral basal impressions of prothorax;
lateral channel of elytra greenish; legs piceous-red.
Head small (3 mm. across eyes), transversely impressed on each
side above base of eyes; front depressed, distinctly biimpressed.
Prothorax broader than long (4*2 x 4*9 mm.); sides lightly
rounded, greatly narrowed in a gentle curve to apex, lightly and
obliquely narrowed to base; basal angles wide, obtuse, a little
marked ; border wide and strongly reflexed behind anterior
marginal puncture; median line lightly impressed; lateral basal
impressions narrow, short, shallow, not reaching base in full
depth. Elytra truncate-oval (9-3 x 5 -6 mm.), lightly convex, rather
depressed on disc; sides lightly rounded, hardly narrowed to base;
lateral sinuosities of apex well developed, wide ; basal border
strongly raised and dentate at humeral angles. Intercoxal
declivity of prosternum narrow, rounded in middle; of mesoster-
num deepl}'' concave. Posterior femora strongly dilatate in middle
(at apex of trochanters). Length 16, breadth 5*6 mm.
Hab. â€” N.S.W. : Mount Kosciusko (given to me by Mr. W.
W. Froggatt).
Allied to N. strzeleckianus, SI., but differing by colour, smaller
head; prothorax more transverse, narrower at apex, much wider
at base; elytra more depressed, lateral border more widely reflexed
at base; posterior femora more dilatate, with lower side swollen
in middle, &c.
NoTONOMUs BASSi, n.sp.
(J. Oval, rather elongate, subdepressed. Head dark sub-
metallic-green; prothorax of a gilt cupreous colour; elytra purple-
black on disc and border, metallic-purple towards sides; under
.surface black; legs piceous.
