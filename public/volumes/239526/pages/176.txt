distinct, the lateral veins oblique, spreading, the marginal one
removed from the edge. Branches axillary, or se.veral together
forming a terminal funicle, terete, or flattened, from 6 to 12 lines
long, bearing from 7 to 8 flowers. Buds on a short, almost filiform
pedicel. Calyx pyriform, IJ lines in diameter, slightly angular
at the base. Operculum domed, shortly acuminate. Stamens
very short; anthers small, parallel, opening by longitudinal slits.
Pistil thick, clavate; ovary flat-topped. Fruit slightly angular
at the base, truncate, globular or pyriform, about 3 lines in
diameter, but less in the elongated form of the narrow-leaved
variety, constricted at the orifice, giving it a kind of thin rim
which dries red; valves occasionally exserted.
