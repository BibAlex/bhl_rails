CONTRIBUTIONS TO A KNOWLEDGE OF AUS-
TRALIAN ENTOZOA.
No. ii. â€” On a new species of Distomum from the Sawfish
Shark, Pristiojyhorus cirratus, Lath.

(Plate xiii.)
I am indebted to Professor Haswell for three specimens of
this Trematode, which were found in the body cavity of the
Sawfish Shark, PristiojyJiorus cirratus, Lath., at Sydney. I have
examined several specimens of the same host since receiving those
from Professor Haswell, but have found no Distomes, though in
the body cavity of one specimen a number of eggs were found
which very probably belong to the same species, for the eggs with
their very thick shells are characteristic of the species : the
worms may have escaped through the abdominal pores when the
fish was caught. This Avorm has a very extensible neck; fasten-
ing itself by the ventral sucker it stretches its neck out for more
than an inch, longer than the body itself.
DiSTOMUM PRISTIOPHORI, sp.n.
Body elongated, pointed at the anterior end, and rounded at
the posterior, flattened dorsoventrally, with rounded sides; head-
lobe triangular. Average length 25 mm., breadth 6 mm.
Oral sucker deep, cup-shaped and small ; subterminal, the
opening being on the ventral aspect; diameter 1*5 mm. Ventral
sucker orbicular, sessile, with deep cavity, larger than oral
