360 AUSTRALIAN NECROPTERA,
These were very soon captured by the neuropters striking out with
their hind legs; a fly enfolded on the stick}^ spiny tarsi was held
in a vice-like grip, while the leg curled round under the head;
and in a ver}^ short time it was sucked dry and dropped on the
bottom of the jar.
F. Brauer has given an account of the insect-catching habit of
the common European species {Bittaciis tipvlariufi, Fabr.).^

This is the commonest Australian species of ant-lion, and has
a 'wide range over New South Wales and Queensland. The
perfect insects are generally found resting on grass stalks or twigs
in open forest country, with their wings folded down over the
body. When disturbed they flit along with a very awkward
motion as if the wings were too big for the body, so that they
are very easily run down and captured.
Length of bod}'- 1 inch; expanse of wings 2^ inches.
General colour chocolate-brown, mottled and marbled with
light brown; face below the eyes, a line between them, under-
surface of head, thorax, and base of abdomen 3'ellow; antenme
dark reddish-brown, at the base and near the tip marked with
dull orange. Legs light brown, mottled with black. Forewings
semitransparent, thickly covered with a fine network of nervures,
mottled and shaded with black, forming a distinct spot at the
stigma; all the nervures clothed with little hairs, finest along the
front margin; hind wings similar in form, with the apical portion
deeply blotched with chestnut-brown, enclosing a double or con-
fluent white spot, with another small spot at the tip.
The larva of this species is, I believe, the common ant-lion
found forming funnel-shaped pits in sand under the shelter of
