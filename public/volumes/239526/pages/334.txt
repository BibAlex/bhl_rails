specific nomenclature. I have thought it would be useful to
collect these together.
LOTORIUM WATERHOUSEI, Ad. (t Ang.
This species, rightly treated as distinct by Tryon, has been
relegated to the synonymy of L. spengleri, Chemnitz, by Pritchard
and Gatliff (29, 264). The revolving ribs of spengleri are broader
than their interstices; those of luaterhousei are only half as broad,
and duplicate. The transverse lirse of the former are very much
coarser than those of the latter. The varices of L. waterhousei
are filled up inside, whereas in L. sj^engleri the porcellanous
interior may be seen in every varix. The epidermis of L.
spengleri is quite smooth; that of ivaterhousei is, as its authors
say, "squamato-pilose." In Port Jackson, where L. spengleri is
to be found on most of the rocks, L. waterhousei never occurs.
LoTORiUM GRACiLE, Reeve.
Both Watson (39, 394) and Dall (7, 227) disagree with Tryon
that this is a synonym of L. vespaceum.
LoTORiuM PARKiNSONiANUM, Perry.
I have said of this species that it is not related to the ^Hritonis ''
group. In arriving at this conclusion I have been influenced by
the evolution of the species as evidenced by its stages of growth.
It is one of the few species in which a neanic stage is plainly
definable. I regard it as being a very recent species evolved
from L. to7'tirostris, Tate. My reasons for so regarding it are â€”
(1) it has the contour of this species; (2) had it existed in Tertiary
times it is reasonable to suppose it would have been found in
these beds^ especially as (3) it is common on the coasts of South-
Eastern Australia; (4) in the neanic stage it is ornamented with
the complex sculpture of this form (vide 19, pi. 36, ff. 3, 4); (5)
some specimens of L. tortirostris show a tendency to lose their
complex sculpture on the ultimate whorls. On the other hand,
there is undoubtedly an underlying, but indefinable, resemblance
to the " tritonis "-group. This, it seems, is to be attributed to a
