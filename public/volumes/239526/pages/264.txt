Chrysopa ramburii, Schneider.
This is the typical form of this extensive genus. It is found
in tlie neighbourhood of Sydney, and, from an economic point of
view, is one of our most useful insect friends, for wherever mealy
bugs and other soft-bodied scale-insects appear in any quantity,
the active little larvaj of the Chrysopa follow them up, covering
themselves with bits of dirt and the remains of their food, so that
they might easily be mistaken for mealy bugs were it not for
their projecting jaws, long legs, and active habits. When full-
grown they form the usual, rounded, parchment-like pupa-cases,
which are attached to branches among the living mealy bugs.
The perfect insects are of a delicate green tint, with bright
golden-tinted eyes, and delicate gauze-like wings. The}'- often fly
to light on summer nights, and if they alight upon the table
produce a most disagreeable smell.
