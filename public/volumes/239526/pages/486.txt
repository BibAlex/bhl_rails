Tate as Jlactra picra, Deshayes,"^ is erroneous. The real Mad
pura,oi which I gathered an example on the beach at Green Island,
off Cairns, Queensland, is a larger and flatter species, with smooth
dorsal areas. Thirdly, after comparing examples of the so-called
Mactra jnira from South Australia with the types of Mactra
ahbreviata, Lamk., Mr. Mabille finds that the}^ differ in minor
characters and especially by the want of lamellae on the lunule
and escutcheon. He considers that the}^ may be a variety of
Lamarck's J/, ahbreviata. but prefers to regard them as a related
but distinct species.
Under these circumstances I refrain from describing it as a
new species, but as a temporary expedient will call it M.
ahbreviata var. Since the shell has never been figured I submit
drawings of the hinge and exterior of a specimen 40 mm. in
length, 33 mm. in height, and 23 mm. in breadth of conjoined
valves. It appears to be related to Mactra rvfescens, Lamk.
Collectors more fortunate than myself who have access to the
species are invited to ascertain whether the range of variation
includes Lamarck's type and to search Peron's collecting grounds,
especially King Island, for the type form.
