520 ON ECCALYPTUS B ICO LOR, A. CUNN.,
was quite justified in making two species, viz., E. pendida, 'Red
Box,' and E. bicolor, ' Bastard Box.'
'* This latter species occurs all along the banks of the South
Creek" (These Proceedings, xxv., 666.)
b. Note on E. parvijiora, F.v.M.
This is a name only given as a synonym of E. hicolor, A. Cunn.,
(in Journ. Linn. Soc. iii. 90) and it is referred to here in order
that it may be cleared up. It is the same as E. bicolor, A. Cunn.,
var. parvifloi'a, F.v.M. (B.Fl. iii. 215), and is E. populifolia,
Hook., as noted by Mueller himself in Herb. Melb. It is doubt-
less the same as " var. parvijlora, Benth." (should be F.v.M.
'■ Eucalyptographia ' under E. largiflorens).
1. E. bicolor, Duff, in ' Catal. of N.S.W. Forestry Exhibits,'
Melbourne, Adelaide, and other Exhibitions, is called " Slat}'-
Gum," and its timber is described as " hard, tough, strong,
durable, and said by experts to be one of the best hardwoods;
used for fencing, wheelwrights' work, bridges, railway sleepers,
and house building; plentiful. Hab. open forests south-western
river districts, Blue Mountains and the Darling River."
It is evident that the above partly refers to E. bicolor, A.
Cunn., and to E. polyanthemos, Schauer, and it is only referred
to on the present occasion as the source whence "^. bicolor, Slaty
Cum," has crept into numerous official reports.
2. E. pendula, Page. — This name was first published (name
only) in "Page's Prodromus; as a general nomenclature of all the
plants . . . cultivated in Southampton Botanic Gardens, by
William Bridgewater Page, London, 1818." 8vo. pp. 136.
In Steudel's ' Nomenclator Botanicus ' (ed. ii. Yol. i. p. 600)
appears the simple entry " pendula, Page, Nov. Holl." I have
been unable to ascertain that Page's name is more than a nonien
nudum.
3. E. pendula, A. Cunn. — In B.Fl. (iii. 215) this is quoted as
"A. Cunn. in Steud. Xom. Bot. Ed. 2." It is assumed to be a
synonym of E. pe^idula, Page.
