294 EEVISION OF THE GENUS NOTO^'OMUS,
convex, third 2-punctate, tenth well developed towards apex.
Intercoxal declivity of prosternum wide, fiat (or rather concave);
of mesosternum strongly concave; metasternum deeply longitu-
dinally channelled in middle (this median channel extending to
apex). Posterior femora with lower side strongl}'' dilatate above
apex of trochanters. Length 24, breadth 7 '3-8 mm.

NOTONOMUS JERVISENSIS, n.sp
2- Only differs from N. triplogenioides, Chaud., by — {a) colour
(prothorax black on disc, fier}'- copper near margins; elj^tra almost
black, with obsolete cupreous tinge, lateral margins of a fiery
copper colour); {h) prothorax with posterior angles much more
widely obtuse, the antebasal sinuosity of the sides obsolete.
Length 24, breadth 8 mm. (head 4'75 mm.; prothorax 5-5 x 7mm.).
/^ft6._N.S.W. : Jervis Bay (Fletcher; Coll. Sloane).
It is possibly a well marked variety of iV. triplogenioides, but,
even if this be the case, seems entitled to rank as a named variety.
NOTONOMUS LIRAGERUS, n.sp.
Elongate, depressed. Prothorax hardly broader than long,
lightly narrowed to base; basal angles rectangular; posterior
marginal puncture at basal angle on border : elytra depressed,
deeply striate; interstices very convex, third 2-punctate. Black,
nitid.
Head small, oval (3*2 mm. across ej^es), convex, faintly biim-
pressed between antennae — the impressions extending on to
clypeus; eyes convex, rather prominent. Prothorax almost as
long as broad (4'6 x 4*7 mm.), not ampliate at widest part, a little
wider across base (3*3 mm.) than across apex (3-2 mm.); sides
lightly rounded, shortl}^ and lightly sinuate before base; apex
truncate; anterior angles not marked, close to head; base emar-
ginate in middle, sloping lightly forward on each side; lateral
border narrow on anterior third, wide and reflex ed on posterior
two-thirds, extending round basal angles to lateral impressions;
median line rather strongly impressed, reaching base; lateral basa
