304 EEVISION OF THE GENUS XOTONOMUS.
iV. violaceomarginatus, and found it identical with the latter. iV.
purpureipe7i7iis is founded on the (J.
NOTONOMUS RUGOSICOLLIS, n.sp.
(J, Elliptical. Protliorax opaque, densely shagreened and
transversely striolate; sides lightly sinuate before basal angles;
posterior marginal puncture in lateral channel near basal angle :
elytra deeply striate; interstices strongly convex, third narrower
than second on basal third, 2-punctate; basal border prominent
at humeral angles. Head and prothorax black (a faint purple
tinge near sides of prothorax); elytra bronzy-black, submetallic
towards sides, metallic behind basal border, ninth interstice and
lateral channel of a bright brassy colour; under surface black;
legs piceous-black.
Head not large (2-5 mm. across eyes), subdepressed between
eyes, these prominent. Prothorax broader than long (3 x 3 -6 mm),
depressed on disc; sides lightly rounded, gently narrowed to apex,
very lightly narrowed to base ; anterior angles obtuse ; base
(2-7 mm.) wider than apex (2-5 mm.), emarginate in middle;
basal angles rectangular; lateral channel wide; median line deep,
reaching from base almost to apex; lateral basal impressions long,
narrow, deep; posterior part of space between basal impressions
longitudinally rugulose but not transversely striolate. Elytra
truncate-oval (7*7 x 4*35 mm.), lightly and widely convex, lightly
but decidedly convex on each side of apex; sides lightly rounded;
basal border arcuate on posterior margin, strongly raised and sub-
dentate at humeral angles; lateral channel wide; lateral border
narrow, reflexed, not narrower near base; sixth interstice narrowed
at base, eighth much wider than ninth on basal half, about as wide
as, but much more depressed than, discoidal interstices at middle
of length, ninth narrow, convex, interrupted on inner margin by
umbilicate punctures, tenth shortly but decidedly developed
before lateral apical sinuosity. Intercoxal declivity of prosternum
flat; of mesosternum wide, flat. Length 12-5, breadth 4*35 mm.
