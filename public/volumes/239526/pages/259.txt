362 AUSTRALIAN ^EUROPTERA,
blotches; hindwings with usiiall}'- three spots towards the tip, but
the markings are variable.
I have never taken this species alive, but I have specimens
from Grafton, Newcastle and Sj^dney. It will probabl}- require
to be placed in another genus when the classification is worked up,
as it differs from the typical Glenurus. Leach's type is said to
be in the Macleay Museum Collection.
Glenurus fundatus, Walk.
Myrmeleon fiLiidatua, Walk., Brit. Mus. Cat. Neurop. 320, 1853.
This is our largest species of ant-lion, measuring from an inch
to half as long again in the body; and with an expanse of over
four inches across the wings.
It has a very wide range over Australia; Walker records it
from Port Curtis, Q., Western Australia, and Tasmania. Mr.
Masters informs me that he has taken it about Sydney. I have
specimens from Kalgoorlie, W.A., and a fine series obtained at
Townsville, N.Q., was recentl}^ sent to me by Mr. F. A. Dodd.
General colour brown, thickly covered w^ith greyish hairs,
longest and densest upon thorax and legs; face, undersurface of
prothorax, base of forelegs and wings yellow ; antennae grej^
Wings hyaline; hindwings shortest but similar to forewings in
markings, the nervures so finely marked with dark brown that
they have a greyish tint.
Glenurus circuiter, Walk.
Myrmeleon circuiter, Walk., Brit. Mus. Cat. Neurop. 400.
This is one of the most distinctive Australian species on account
of the rich chestnut-coloured blotches and spots forming a varie-
gated pattern over the large hyaline wings, both pairs of which
curve round at the apex in front, and are distinctly arcuate on
the hind margin at the tips.
The species has a wide range. There are specimens in the
Macleay Museum labelled Rockhampton, Q., and New South
Wales. Mr. Masters informs me that he took it many years
