20 STUDIES ON AUSTRALIAN MOLLUSCA,
PupiNA CROSS EI, Brazier.
Pupina crossei, Brazier, Proc. Linn. See. N.S.W. i., 1876, p. 110.
(Plate iii., fig. 38.)
One of the type shells in the Macleay Museum is here
illustrated. It is from Palm Island (I understand the most
northern of that archipelago was the only one visited by the
Chevert Expedition), and is 7 mm. in length.
Pupina nitida, Brazier.
Fiipiaa nitida^ Brazier, Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S.W. i., 1876, p. 136.
(Plate iii., fig. 37.)
One of the original lot from Barrow Island is here figured. It
is 9 mm. in length. \
Sitala reedei, Brazier.
Helix {Conidus) reedei, Brazier, Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S.W. i.,
1876, p. 101. Helix (Conulas) inaino, Brazier, loc. cit. Comdiis
mairio, Hedley, op. cit. (2), vi., p. 75, pi. ix., f. 6. Sitala maino,
Hedley, op. cit., ix., p. 384.
(Plate iii., fig. 45.)
A specimen from Darnley Island (height 2*5, major diam. 3*4,
minor diam. 3 mm.) is here figured. I cannot distinguish this
from the New Guinea S. maino, which I therefore suppress as a
synonym. Because it is not of Latin form, the name maino is
not as acceptable as reedei.
Sitala nepeanensis, Brazier.
Helix (Conidus) nepeanensis, Brazier, Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S.W.
i., 1876, p. 102.
(Plate iii., figs. 40-42.)
One of the type lot from Nepean Island is here figured. The
dimensions of it are : height 2*6, major diam. 3*64, minor diam.
3-48.
