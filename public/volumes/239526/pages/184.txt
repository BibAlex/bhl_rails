NOTES AND EXHIBITS. 239
gummed, but the apparent protective influence of the salt only
extended to that variety; crops of Rappoe grown at the same
time were badly gummed.
Mr. Maiden exhibited (1) specimens of Eucalypts to illustrate
his papers. (2) Fruiting and flowering specimens of Cocos
Yatayi, Mart., cultivated in the Sydney Botanic Gardens under
the names of Cocos capitata C?), Mart., and Dlplothemium mariti-
mum, Hort. Syd., the Brazilian Wine Palm. It has been pre-
viously exhibited before this Society (it is largely grown in New
South Wales) as a Diplothemiuiii^ and recorded in the Agricultu-
ral Gazette of June, 1891, p. 356, under the .same name. The
correct identification of the palm is due to Dr. Udo Dammer of
Berlin. (3) A water-colour drawing of the fruits (receptacles)
of Ficus Bennettii, Seem., a Fijian species described by Seemann
from specimens in the Sydney Botanic Gardens. Seemann des-
cribed the fruits as very much less than shown in the drawing, he
probably having only windfalls. This year, however, they have
attained a size ( 3 by 1 j inches) which is greater than previously
observed, and their colouring, rich dark orange-red, is more
brilliant than has hitherto been noted. Mr. Maiden also
reported the occurrence of Manna from Dalgety, near Bombala,
on Eucalyptus Gunnii, Hook, f., var. rubicla, Maiden, and on U.
Stuartiana, F.v.M., it occurring annually on the former tree and
about every ten years on the latter.
