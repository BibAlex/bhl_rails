236 A GUM BACTERIUM FROM A EUCALYPT.
Saccharose-peptone agar. — The stroke becomes broad, raised or
hemispherical in section, sometimes undulating, and slowly gravi-
tates. The culture is of the appearance and consistency of thin
starch paste. The luxuriance of the growth is in striking contrast
to the growth on nutrient agar.
Potato. — The growth is dry and glistening, whitish or slightly
yellow and constricted. The colour deej)ens to cream or pale
buff, and the grov/th becomes raised. It is always meagre, and
does not spread over the surface of the medium.
Bouillon. — The medium Ijecomes turbid, and a fine white, loose
sediment is deposited, while a slight film forms on the surface.
A faint indol reaction is obtained In nitrate-bouillon the
nitrate is not reduced.
Milk. — The medium is unaltered.
Saccharose-peptone fluid. — The medium becomes milk-white, and
at a later stage becomes brownish-yellow. The gum can be
readily precipitated by alcohol, and Fehling's solution is strongly
reduced.
The nearest allied bacterium capable of forming slime from
saccharose appears to be Bact. gelatinosum hetoi, Glaser, which
forms dextran and alcohol, but no lactic acid. As the gum,
moreover, has only been obtained previously from Bac. levani-
fovinans the bacterium is evidently a new species, and therefore
I have named it, on account of its origin. Bacterium eucalypti.
