BY H. LEIGHTON KESTEVEN. 481
LoTORiUM BARTHELEMYi, Bemardi.
This unlocalised species is, as stated by Pritchard and Gatliff
(o^j. cit.), a synonym of L. spengleri, Chemn.
The following names proposed by Perry in 1811 (27) have lately
been reinstated by Mr. C. Hedley (le) : —
Perry's specific name. Specific synonym in use heretofore.
Lotoriutn cornutum. Lotorium exarcUum, Reeve.
,, parkinsonianum ,, fusiforme, Kiener.
,, ruhicundum ,, nodiferurn, Lamk.
In the same paper Mr. Hedley says " Monoplex formosus, Perry,
is recognised by Deshayes as a synonym of Triton clavator,
Lamarck, 1822 ( — Murex clavator, 1817). Triton sinensis, Reeve,
seems to me identical." At my request he has gone over this
ground again with me, and, as far as our material allows us to
judge, we have come to the following conclusions : —
(1) Triton clavator, Reeve, is not clavator, Chemn., 1795,
Dillwyn (9), Lamarck (21), and should be quoted as Lotorium
formosum, Perry.
(2) Lotorium clavator, Chemn., (4) (a binonial name), is probably
the correct name for the form hitherto known as Triton sarcostoma^
Reeve.
(3) Lotorium sine^ise, Reeve (30), is a valid species.
In conclusion I have to thank Mr. C. Hedley for a great deal
of assistance rendered me in my search through literature; and
the Curator, Mr. R. Etheridge, Junr., through whose kindness I
have been enabled to study Australian Museum material.
