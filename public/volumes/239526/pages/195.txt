272 EEVISION OF THE GENUS ^^OTOXOML^S,
like iV. variicollis, Chaud., and N. excisipennis, SI. ; from iV.
variicollis it is at once distinguished by the basal angles of the
prothorax not marked, and the posterior marginal puncture not
placed at the basal angle. N. excisipennis is thoroughly differen-
tiated from F. arthuri by its unusually narrow ninth elytral
interstice.
NOTONOMUS MUELLERI, n.sp.
Oval, robust. Head large ; prothorax subquadrate, lightly
narrowed to base; basal angles marked; posterior marginal punc-
ture at extremity of lateral channel just before basal angle;
elytra striate; interstices depressed, third 3-punctate on apical
two-thirds; humeral angles rounded. Black, nitid; legs piceous-
red.
Head large [4 mm. {^) to 4*3 mm. (9) across eyes], convex;
frontal impressions weak; eyes with orbits reniform, convex,
much more prominent in $ than in 9. Prothorax broader than
long (4'5 X 5-6 mm.), depressed towards base, very little narrower
at base (4 mm.) than at apex (4-2 mm.); sides lightly rounded,
obliquel}' (not roundly) narrowed to base without sinuosity; base
widely truncate; basal angles well marked, obtuse; bordernarrow,
terminating at basal angles ; median line light ; lateral basal
impressions wide, shallow, straight and parallel at bottom.
Elytra truncate-oval (11-5 x 6*7 mm.), depressed; base wide; lateral
apical sinuosities well developed, wide ; basal border joining
lateral border without any interruption; tenth interstice feebly
developed. Intercoxal declivity of prosternum rounded; of meso-
sternum lightly concave; metasternum not channelled to apex.
Length 17-21, breadth 6-7-8 mm.
Hah. â€” N.S. W. : Mount Kosciusko (specimens from Mr. W. W.
Froggatt).
A distinct species; in facies it resembles N. i^eroni, Casteln.,
but differs by colour, prothorax not sinuate on sides near base
and with basal angles obtuse; ^ with three basal joints of anterior
tarsi broadly dilatate and squamulose beneath, tfec. Its affinity
seems towards N. gippsiensis, Casteln.
