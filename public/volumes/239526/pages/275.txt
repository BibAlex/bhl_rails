382 A NEW SPECIES OF ARDISIA.
In the ' Flora von Kaiser Wilhelms Land,' by K. Schuhmann,
A. imperialis, collected by M. Hollrimg, n. 256, is recorded. It
is described (Eng. Jahrb. ix. 213) as a tree about 9 to 18 feet
high, and with deep rose-coloured flowers.
These species are all distinct from the one now described from
New South Wales.
I beg to thank Mr. J. G. Luehmann, F.L.S., Curator, National
Herbarium, Victoria, for the use of his herbarium, and also Mr.
Bauerlen for assistance in working out this species.
