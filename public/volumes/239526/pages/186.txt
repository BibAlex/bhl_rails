MiTRASACME PALUSTRIS, Sp.nOV.
A minute glabrous, often almost stemless herb, with a com-
paratively thick spongy white radix. Leaves linear-spathulate,
connate, rather thick and succulent, not numerous, and in many
instances apparently but not actually radical. Flowers pedicel-
late, numerous, in terminal umbel-like clusters; pedicels filiform,
ascending, ebracteate. Calyx about f line long when in flower,
little longer in fruit, broad, with two short herbaceous, deltoid,
often divergent acute lobes, not above ^ the length of the tube.
Corolla nearly as long as the calyx, white, campanulate, glabrous,
with short acute lobes. Stamens inserted below the middle of
the tube ; anthers not exserted, small. Styles distinct and
parallel, with the stigmatic ends adjacent but not cohering.
Capsule much shorter than the calyx, ovoid and slightly flattened,
membranous; seeds numerous, almost black, with a reticulate
testa.
Zoc â€” Midland Junction; in mud (W. V. Fitzgerald; October,
1901).
