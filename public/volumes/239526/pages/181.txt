234 A GUM BACTERIUM FROM A EUCALYPT.
with this bacterium and with Bac. fevaniforvians, but instead of
the calculated 55 grms. of reducing sugars which should have
been present there are only 18 grms.; the difference (37 grms.)
has disappeared, i.e., it has been converted into acids.
Although levan can be formed from saccharose, it must not be
forgotten that the gum found naturally in the exudate had in all
probability been formed from raffinose, the sugar of Eucalyptus
manna. This is indicated by the presence of manna in one of
the samples. That levan could be produced by the organism
from raffinose is to be expected from the fact found in the study
of Bac. levaniformans, viz., that the gum was formed chiefly from
nascent levulose, and from the fact that raffinose under the
influence of invertase splits up into levulose and melibiose.
Bacterium eucalypti, n.sp.
Shape, etc. — An actively motile, short coJi-\ike bacterium,
measuring generally in the stained and imbedded condition
0*5 : 1 /x. It stains well with violet and fuchsin, but feebly with
blue; it is decolourised by the Gram method. The flagella are
long, and vary in number from one to nine, and are studded over
the surface of the cell. No spores are formed.
Relation to temperature, etc. — The bacterium is aerobic, and
appears to grow equally well at 28° and at 37°.
Nutrient gelatine plate. — Small punctiform colonies are visible
in seven days, and by the eleventh day they have become rounded,
translucent white, and 3 mm. in diameter. When magnified they
appear round or rounded, and finely granular, sometimes with
central granules. The edge is smooth and slightly waved. The
deep colonies are irregular and finely granular.
Glucose-gelatine plate. — The colonies are glistening, translucent
white and rounded. When magnified they appear rounc^ed and
erose with co/^-like striations. The deep colonies are rounded to
elliptical, and have a striated margin.
