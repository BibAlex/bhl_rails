58 NOTES FROM THE 130TAXIC GARDENS, NO. VIII.,
differs from the type chiefly in the absence of all viscidity; and
in the short spreading hairs, which densely cover the whole plant,
except the old branches. The capsules attain fully J of an inch
in breadth. Male flowers not seen. Though Bentham describes
the species as glabrous, we find the tendenc}'- to hairiness in
several specimens, amongst others in Mitchell's specimens collected
at Mt. Pluto near the Warrego River, and described by Lindle}'
in "Mitchell's 'Tropical Australia,' p. 342, as E. j)uhescenii. Ben-
tham's remark in the 'Flora A^ustraliensis' in regard to D.piihescens,
" the supposed pubescence is apparently a mistake," shows that he
cannot have seen the type specimens, for Major Mitchell's speci-
mens are distinctly hairy, though viscid, sparse-leaved, and %vith
all the characteristics of a plant grown in dry country, very
different in appearance from the luxuriant hirsute form found by
Mr. Boorman at Jennings.

OXYLOBIUM PULTEN^A, DC.
Hastings River (W. Best, communicated by W. Forsyth ;
August, 1901). Most northern locality recorded.
PULTEN.EA PLUMOSA, Sieb.
Bombala (J. H. Maiden; November, 1901).
A rather rare PultencEa, confined to New South Wales.
Bentham gives its habitat as "Port Jackson to the Blue Mountains "
Since then man}^ additional localities have been discovered within
the borders of New South Wales. The most northern locality .
known to us is Apsley Falls, in the Walcha district, and its
southern limit has now been extended to Bombala.
PSORALEA ERIANTIIA, Benth.
Paldrumatta Bore, on sandy ridges (P. Corbett; October, 1901).
A rare plant in New South Wales, though with extensive range
in Central Australia. A sparingly branched erect shrub about
3 to 4 feet high, densely covered with a soft tomentum of white
hairs, especially long on the calyces. The flowers are white, with
