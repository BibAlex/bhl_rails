work on the British Mosses, with whioli Dr. Brotherus, in
* Bryales,' is in considerable agreement : â€”
Order MUSCI.
Suborder 1. SPHAGNALES.
Suborder 2. ANDRE.EALES.
Suborder 3. BRYALES.
Group A. NEMATODONTES (Polytrichaceffi).
Group B. ARTHRODONTES.
Subgroup i. Acrocarpi.
Subgroup ii. Pleurocarpi.
Among the Acrocarpi we have followed, without distinct
headings, the Order Haplolepidei {Fissidentacece, Archidiacece,
Ditrichacece, Dicranacece, Leucohryacece, C alymperaceoi^ Pottiacecc,
Enca^yptacice, Grimmiacece), and Diplolepidei [Orthotrichacece,
Sjjlachnacece, Funariaceoi, Bartramiacece, Bi'yacece, JIniacece).
Among the Haplolepidei we have placed first, w4th Dr. C. Mueller,
the distichophyllous Fissidentacece. The terms, Haplolepidei and
Diplolepidei, scarcely apply to the non-peristomate members of
the included families, but they form a valuable practical guide to
the arrangement of the Acrocarps. The Pleurocarps are all
Diplolepidei.
The Mosses of Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands are excluded
from this Census on zoogeographic srrounds.
We have refrained from stating the fruiting season of the
different species, there being considerable variation north and
south, east and west. July to December may be regarded in
general as the best time for collecting; but allowance must be
made for altitude and latitude. The Fissidentes may be found
in full fruit as early as April and May, and there is no time of
the year when fruiting specimens of many of our mosses may not
be collected, especially in damp gullies and about the shady banks
of creeks.
