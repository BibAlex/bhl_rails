296 REVISION OF THE GENUS NOTOyOMUS,
]^. suhiridescens may resemble JV. liragerus, SI., but I do not
think it can be identical on account of its larger size and
apparently, from Chaudoir's description, it should have the pro-
thorax more convex, and the elytra more rounded on sides.
NOTONOMUS QUEENSLANDICUS, n.sp.
Elongate-oval, robust. Head small ; prothorax subcordate ;
sides sinuate before base; basal angles subrectangular; posterior
marginal puncture placed a little before base on inner side of
lateral channel; elytra deeply striate; interstices in ^ convex, in
9 depressed; humeral angles strongly dentate. Black; elytra of
a bronzy subviolaceous tint, with ninth interstice and lateral
channel of a bright brassy green or copper colour; under surface
and legs black; antennae piceous-black.
Head oval (2-3 mm. across eyes); vertex lightly transversely
impressed; frontal impressions deep, divergent posteriorly. Pro-
thorax rather small, broader than long (3 x 3-5 mm.), depressed
towards base, faintly transversely striolate; sides lightly arcuate,
more strongly narrowed to apex than base, strongly sinuate
before base; apex (2-5 mm.) narrower than base (2-7 mm.), emar-
ginate; anterior angles distant from head, obtuse; base emarginate
in middle, lightly arcuate on each side; basal angles well marked,
obtuse; median line reaching from base to apex; lateral basal
impressions deep, narrow, elongate; lateral basal spaces lightly
convex, depressed near basal margin. Elytra oval (7"5 x 4 -3 mm.),
truncate at base, widely and lightly sinuate on each side of apex,
lightly convex, strongly declivous to apex, abruptly declivous on
sides ; basal border with posterior margin curving forward
externally, sharply raised and forming a strong obtuse prominence
at humeral angles; third interstice wider than two inner ones,
.sixth narrower than fifth and seventh, narrowed to base, seventh
very wide on basal third, eighth and ninth narrow, convex, equal
in width on basal third, inner margin of ninth interrupted by
the umbilicate punctures, tenth obsolete. Intercoxal declivity of
prosternum flat and bordered laterally; of mesosternum wide,
hardly concave. Length 13, breadth 4*3 mm.
