206 NOTES AND EXHIBITS.
Mr. H. L. Kesteven exhibited specimens, and contributed the
subjoined list, of sixteen species of Mollusca of the Family
Rissoidce from Sandgate, Moreton Bay, Queensland, none of
which had previously been recorded from that State : â€”
Rissoa scrohiculata^ Watson.
,, dissimilis, Watson.
,, flammea, Frauenfeld.
,, salehrosa, Frauenfeld.
,, incidata, Frauenfeld.
,, olivacea, Frauenfeld.
,, contahiilata^ Frauenfeld.
,, australice^ Frauenf., var. ochroleuca, Brazier.
5, atropurpurea^ Frauenfeld.
,, nitens^ Frauenfeld.
,, fraiienfeldi, Dunker.
,, jacksoni, Brazier.
,5 devecta, Tate.
,, cheilostoma, Ten. -Woods.
Rissoiiia lianleyi, Schwartz.
,, fasciata, A. Adams.
All the foregoing species occur in New South Wales and, with
the exception of the first three, in South Australia likewise, so
that the extension of range so far north is therefore interesting.
The BissoidcE enumerated by Tate from Queensland comprised
three species of Rissoa and three of Bissoina. The specimens
exhibited were, it was said, to be presented to the Australian
Museum.
Mr. R. H. Cambage exhibited specimens of EiicalypUhs eximia
from Picton Lakes, Hawkesbury River, and Maitland (Sawyer's
Gully, where it is known as Rock Apple); and he pointed out
that the species did not appear to have flowered last spring at
any of these places, though since January last the trees had been
covered with buds, showing they will flower profusely next spring.
It would seem, therefore, that the drought was not responsible for
the failure of last spring.
