WEDNESDAY, JUNE 25th, 1902.
The Ordiiiaiy Monthly Meeting of the Society was held in
the Linnean Hall, Ithaca Road, Elizabeth Bay, on Wednesday
evening, June 25th, 1902.
Mr. J. H. Maiden, F.L.S., &c.. President, in the Chair.
Dr. F. A. GoDiNG, U.S. Consulate, Newcastle, N.S.W.; and
Mr. A. J. Walkom, Sydney, were elected Ordinary Members of
the Society.
A letter from Mr. J. R. Garland, M.A., thanking the Members
of the Society for their expression of sympathy, was read to the
Meeting.
By the wish of the Council, the President explained to the
Meeting that, in consequence of the retrenchment policy which
untoward circumstances had forced upon the neighbouring
State of Queensland, it was to be feared that Mr. F. M. Bailey's
" Queensland Flora," now in course of publication, would be
brought to an abrupt termination in the middle of the sixth or
concluding Part. An expression of the views of scientific men
in other States would perhaps help to justify the Queensland
Government in making some special effort to utilise to the full
Mr. Bailey's experience and unrivalled knowledge of the flora of
Queensland in completing the important publication in question.
On the motion of the President, it was unanimously
resolved : â€”
That this Meeting desires respectfully to give expression to the
hope that, in the interests of science, the Queensland Government
may see its way to allow^ Mr. F. M. Bailey to take the steps
necessary to complete the " Queensland Flora."
The Donations and Exchanges for the month, amounting to 7
Vols., 32 Parts or Nos., 3 Reports, 1 Separate, and 3 Miscellanea,
received from 35 Societies, &c., and 1 Individual, were laid upon
the table.
