These reactions indicate that the gummy matter which forms
the substance of the asci has relations with the carbohydrates as
well as the proteids, and at first sight might be taken as being a
mucin body. The slimy capsule of some bacteria has been said
to consist of a substance *' related to mucin, or probably identical
therewith."*
Lepierref claims to have obtained a true mucin from cultures
of a fluorescent bacterium. Charrin and Desgrez; obtained a
mucinous body from bouillon cultures of Bact. pyocyaneum. This
body swelled up with water, and was filterable. It was precipi-
tated by alcohol, acetic acid, the mineral acids, common salt and
magnesium sulphate. The acetic acid precipitate was insoluble
in excess, but was dissolved by dilute alkalies. According to the
authors, these properties showed it to be a compound mucinoid,
but as it contained phosphoric acid it was probably accompanied
by a nucleoproteid. A nitrogen determination was apparently
not made.
Although the gummy substance of the asci forms a viscous
solution, and behaves like mucin in some of its reactions, still
<lifferences can be found. The mucins are soluble in lime and
