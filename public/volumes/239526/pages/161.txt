NOTES ON JUNCUS HOLOSCFL^NU% R.Br., AND J.
PBISMATOCARPUS, R.Br.; AND ON CERTAIN
OTHER NEW SOUTH WALES PLANTS.
By Edwin Ciieel.
In his ' Prodromus ' (p. 259) R. Brown described two species
of Juncus under the names of J. holoschcenus and J. prismato-
carpus, which he distinguished chiefly by the following characters :
J. holoschcenus. J. pvUimatocarpus.

Robert Brown had seen both species under natural conditions.
From the study of herbarium material Bentham came to the con-
clusion that R. Brown's distinctions could not be upheld (B.Fl.
vii., 131); he therefore united the species and adopted the name
J. prismatocarpus. It appears to me, however, that these plants
are quite distinct; for they may readily be distinguished in the
field by their different habit, as well as by some very important
structural differences.
J. holoschtfinus is a more dwarf plant than J. prismatocarpus,
producing erect, nearly terete stems from a creeping perennial
rhizome. The leaves are slender and semiterete, of a dark green
colour and quite hollow inside except for transverse partitions of
