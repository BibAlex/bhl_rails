17. Ramularia hordei, n.sp.

lenticular spots, which may run together and become dark brown.
Hyphse ramifying in leaf, septate, branched, and bearing at surface
the conidia. Conidia straight or fusoid, hyaline, acute or blunt
at ends, 1-septate when mature, not constricted at septum,
15-17x3^.
New South Wales (Farrer); on leaves of Barley; Oct., 1900.
There is only one species of Ramularia recorded on Graminese,
viz., R. graminiGola^ Peck, on living leaves of Poa serotiita, Ehrh.,
but the conidia are 25-35 /x long, and spuriously 1-septate, whereas
in this species they are decidedly 1-septate.
18. Ramularia PRiMULiE, Thuem.
Armadale, Vic; on leaves of Primula sinensis^ Sabine; July,
1902.
It forms large pallid areas, with more or less orbicular centres.
The spots on the Primrose leaves are very common in the winter
months, but the fructification of the fungus is rarely obtainable
except from perfectly fresh specimens.

Armadale, near Melbourne, Vic. ; on languishing leaves of
Stellaria mediay Cyrill; July, 1900.
The spots were distinct at first, and then became confluent.
