than S. flavipes. The type was described from Adelaide, S.A.
Nymphes myrmelionides, Leach.

This handsome insect has a wide range over New South Wales.
I have specimens found in the neighbourhood of Sydney, New-
castle and Armidale; also in Southern Queensland. The type
was in Mr. Alexander Macleay's Collection, and was recorded
from Australia, Mr. McLachlan says there is a fine series in the
British Museum.
Length of body 1 ; expanse of wings 3-J inches.
General colour reddish-brown, abdomen darker; eyes grey;
antennas black, reddish at apex, composed of 72 short rounded
joints covered with fine hairs. Wings large, with the extremity
of each blotched with an elongate white mark enclosed with
brown.
Larvae were obtained at Armidale about the end of November,
hiding among rubbish or clinging to overturned logs, so well
€oated with bits of dirt that only the front of the head and
mandibles were exposed; until disturbed they remained jDerfectly
motionless, but moved quickly when touched. In captivity they
took no food, and after remaining for three weeks in a jar three
of them pupated, forming typical, rounded, parchment-like, pupal
cases. From the situation in which they were found they would
probably feed upon wood ants.
Larva. — Length 8 lines; general colour brown, marked with
darker parallel lines on the dorsal surface of the thorax. Head
a,rcuate in front, rounded on the sides, with the hind margin
forming two rounded lobes attached to the thorax b}^ a slender
neck. Jaws longer than head, shaped like a pair of calipers,
with slender points and a sharp pointed thorn in the centre of
