at all; but Bentham, who, I believe, never saw the type of E.
Baueriaiia, is probably referring to certain tropical specimens he
thinks are referable to U. Baueriana.
Mueller (Eucalytographia, under E. 'polyanihema) says : —
" Bentham unites with this \j)olyantheina\ E. Baueriana^ Schauer,
the diagnosis of which agrees sufficiently " [with i)olyanthema\. . .
Bauer most probably obtained his specimens from the
vicinit}- of Sydney, and not from the tropical regions of Australia."
I understand that Mueller never saw a type specimen of E.
Baueriana, Schauer.
E. Baueriana, Miquel (Ned. Kruidk. Arch. iv. 137), collected
by Charles Stuart in Tasmania is E. Gur\nii, Hook, f., var.
acervula.
Synonyms.
1. E. suhrotunda, R.Br. — I do not know whether Brown
described this species. Even if it is a nomen nudum, I think it
right to draw attention to it, for the case of Eucalyptus is a
special one. The nomenclature of the genus is so complex, and
the same species has been distributed amongst first-class herbaria
under so many names, that it seems desirable to draw attention
to some of them as a matter of practical convenience.
2. E. rhomhifolia, Tausch. — A specimen in Herb. Vindob.
bears the label: — "Eucalyptus rhombifolia, Tausch, Hb. Bauer;
Ferd. Bauer del. No. 859." On this label Schauer has endorsed
the words " E. Baueriana, Schauer." I cannot trace that E.
rhomhifolia is more than a name.
3. E. ohtusifolia, Tausch. — A specimen in Herb. Vindob. bears
the label : — " Eucalyptus obtusifolia, Tausch, Hb. Bauer; Ferd.
Bauer." It has leaves rather narrower than those of the preced-
ing specimen. It is E. Baueriana, Schauer.
4. E. polyanthemos, Schauer. — As already indicated, E, Baueri-
ana was both by Bentham and Mueller looked upon as a form of
E. })olyanthemos. It will be observed that in Exhibition litera-
ture and other publications our " Lignum-vitae " is referred to^.
'polyanthemos by other authors as well.
