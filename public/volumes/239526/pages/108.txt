AN ASCOBACTERIUM FROM THE SUGAR-CANE,
WITH NOTES UPON THE NATURE
OF THE SLIME
(Bacterium sacchari, n.sp.)
By R. Greig Smith, M.Sc, Macleay Bacteriologist to the
Society.
(Plate vi.)
During an investigation into the gummosis of the sugar-cane
an organism was met with great frequency ; in fact, so often was
it found that I cannot but regard it as a normal inhabitant of
the cane. In nine cases out of ten it was found in tubes of media
inoculated in the fields from the gum of diseased plants, and also
from the juice of healthy stalks. It was also separated in the
laboratory from the tissue of gummed Rappoe, and of healthy
Malabar and Tanna canes. The organism was peculiar, inasmuch
as under certain conditions it formed asci, which are well defined
masses of capsulated bacteria. The conditions under which these
were produced included growth upon a solid medium and the
presence of a sugar.
The asci were occasionally formed in fluid media, but only when
the layer of fluid was shallow, and the bacteria grew as a ring-
around the junction of the surface with the glass. The solid
medium which was most suited to the growth of the bacterium,
and for the formation of asci was cane gelatine, which is prepared
by dissolving 10 per cent, of gelatine in cane juice, or in strong-
diffusion liquor, and neutralising the medium to phenolphthalein
with dilute potassium hydrate.
