16 STUDIES ON AUSTRALIAN iMOLLUSCA,
Aplustrum brazieri, Angas.
Dlaphana brazieri, Angas, Proc. Zool. Soc. 1877, pp. 175, 189,
pl.xxvi., f. 20.
(Plate iii., fig. .36.)
A specimen specifically identified by Mr. Brazier is here figured.
It is 4 mm. in length and was obtained in sand}'- mud off Watson's
Bay in 10 fathoms— a few hundred yards from where the same
collector found the type. If Mr. Brazier's determination is
correct, which T have no reason to doubt, then Ano^as' fio^ure is
extremely bad. Moreover, I conclude that the species is wrongly
placed in Diaphana, and should be transferred to Aplustrum.
Pilsbry, who remarked how ill the species agreed with Diaphana,
created a section Austro-Jiiaphaiia for its reception,* which might
rank as a subgenus of Aplustrum. A large example of this species,
which I have examined reached a length of 5 mm.
Claxculus denticulatus, Gray.
Gra}' in King's Survey of the Intertropical and Western Coasts.
of Australia, ii., 1827, Appendix, p. 479.
By modern wi-iters this has been treated as a lost species
Specimens were taken at Geraldton, W.A., by Mr. A. U. Henix
which I recognised as the shell described by Menkef as Monodonta
lupina, and afterwards illustrated by Philippi.| Menke, who.
doubtless had good grounds for the belief, ultimately considered^
that his species was identical with Gray's Monodonta denticulata.
This withdrawal of his species escaped the notice of Prof. Tate||
in his revision of Menke's shells. Trochus atropurpureus, Gould,
and T. samoensis, Hombron k Jacquinot, appear to be synonyms,
of Gray's species.
