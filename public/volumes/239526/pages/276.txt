THE BACTERIAL ORIGIN OF THE GUMS OF THE
ARABIN GROUP.
By R. Greig Smith, M.Sc, Macleay Bacteriologist to the
Society.
I. — The Soluble (Arabin) Wattle Gums.
{Bacterium acacice, n.sp.)
While working upon the gums and slimes produced by some
bacteria, it seemed to be exceedingly probable that a few of the
gums which occur naturally or are supposed to be formed during
a pathological condition of the plant, might have a bacterial
origin. Like the mucilages, gums and slimes formed in or on the
higher plants, the bacterial slimes are of a varied nature. For
example, dextran may be considered as a dextrose anhydride,
levan as a levulose anhj^dride, the gums of Schardinger and
Adametz as galactose anhydrides ; the bacterium of Marshall
Ward and Reynolds Green produces a hemi-cellulose, and Brown's
Bad. xylinuni has a cellulose en\ elope. The bacterium which I
separated from the sugar-cane forms a pentosan slime.
Perhaps the most valuable of the vegetable gums are those of
the arabinan-galactan class such as gum arabic and wattle gum;
and when one studies the distribution of this kind, it appears to be
quite within the bounds of possibility that bacteria have more to
do with its formation than would at first appear. Indeed it is
extremely probable. In the first place, the gum exudes from
cracks* or from punctures or wounds made by insects The
* " Wattle gum exudes chiefly during the summer season from fissures
and accidental injuries to the bark. . After careful observation I have formed
the opinion that, as a very general rule, it is a pathological product. I came
to this conclusion long before I was aware of Trecul's observations that
Acacias and the Kosacese yield their gums most abundantly when sickly and
in an abnormal state caused by a fulness of sap in the young tissues." —
