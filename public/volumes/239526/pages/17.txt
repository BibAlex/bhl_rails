TWO SPECIES OF ASTRALIUM FROM PORT JACKSON,
Astralium tentoriforme,Tvyoi\,^l?ii\. Conch, x., p. 240, pi. 53, figs.
41,42, 1888.
Trochus ^fimhriaW.s, Quoy k Gaimard, oj). cit., pi. 61, fig. 9, 1835.
A, tentorifornie.
Fig. 2. — Neanic stage.
Quoy lV: Gaimard {Joe. cit.) speak of a variety "plus epaisse et
plus pyramidale " which w^as evidently the original of their fig. 9.
Philippi quotes this figure as being of his T. urvillei. Fischer
regards Philippics sjDecies as the young of a variety /3, 7\ georgianus,
being presumably the adult; the figure of this is the best represen-
tation of A. tentoriforme as it is known in Port Jackson. The
species is ^ery common in all the fresher reaches of Sydney
Harbour and the coasts of New South Wales.
In literature these two species are more distinct than in life.
Both species are very variable. Specimens of A. tentoriforme
occur nearly as flat as A. Jimhr latum, var. squamiferum, and
almost as fimbriated as var. cucidlatiim (see Tryon's figs. 52, 50)
whilst pyramidal unornamented specimens of A. Jimhriatum. Si,ve
not uncommon. M}'- figures show the differences between these
species in their neanic stage. The best characters for identifica-
tion of the adult shells are offered b}^ the base, and may be
tabulated as follows : —
A. fimhriatum.
(1) Base convex.
(2) Columella ending in a
small tooth
(3) Lower lip joining the
upper lip at the extreme
edge.
A. tentoriforme
(1) Base concave.
(2) Columella ending in a pro-
minent tooth.
(3) Lower lip .set inside the
upper lip
