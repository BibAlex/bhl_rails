439, Nov. 20, 1846, 'Bastard Box of carpenters,'" and the other
"No. 614, Nov. 30, 1846, camp 86."
Then comes Mueller's very full description of E. bicolor, A.
Cunn., in Journ. Linn. Soc. iii. 90 (1859), Mueller being then
ignorant that F. bicolor, A. Cunn., was a synonym of E. largi-
ftorens, F.v.M., described in 1855.
Bentham accepted E. bicolor, A. Cunn., as having priority, in
B. Fl. iii. 214, without comment, reducing^. /an/i/?ore/is, F.v.M.,
to a synonym.
Mueller's own quotation of the sj^nonymy is interesting : —
('Eucalyptographia,' under E. largijlorens, F.v.M.).
" E. largifiorens, F.v.M. (1854); Fragmenta, ii. 58. E. peyidula,
A. Cunn., in Steudel (1840); E. bicolor, A. Cunn., in Mitchell
(1848)."
He proceeds to say : —
'* Preference is here given, in accordance with De Candolle's
code, to the name under which this species was tirst defined, and
chosen as expressive of the exuberance of its flowers. Of neither
of the names bestowed by Allan Cunningham on this species,
timely description was given; the pendulous branches suggesting
the one name and perhaps the sometimes but often pale colour of
the filaments* giving rise to the other unless it was derived from
the coloration of the bark."
I would point out that early descriptions of Eucalyptus and
other plants were often vague, and we have had, in some cases,
bo appeal to herbarium specimens and other less certain, collateral
evidence, to decide what is intended as a species. I frequently
hear that conchologists, entomologists and others are in a similar
.situation. I think it would place a dangerous power in the
hands of any man to enable him to pass over these imperfect
descriptions, especially when they are supported, as in the present
case, by authentically named herbarium specimens deposited
under proper safeguards, in important herbaria.
* The late Dr. Woolls wrote to me that, in his opinion, the name was
given owing to the variation in colour of the filaments.
