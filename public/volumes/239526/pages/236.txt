eighth); third interstice 2-piinctate on apical half, ninth seriate-
punctate; basal border truncate on posterior margin, and joining
lateral border at humeral angles without the slightest interrup-
tion. Intercoxal declivity of prosternum rounded ; of meso-
sternum concave. Length 16-19, breadth 5 -5-6 6 mm.

Differs from N. chalyhaus^ Dej., by head smaller; prothorax
much more convex and differently shaped — the widest part at the
middle, and the sides equally rounded to apex and base — the
apex narrow, with the angles not so wide and nearer the head,
the basal angles far less marked, lateral basal impressions shorter
and deeper; elytra more convex, with the border of both base
and sides less raised, the lateral border being much narrower and
not carinate near the base, etc. All my specimens are black,
without any metallic tinge.

Elongate, rather convex. Head oval: prothorax hardly broader
than long; basal angles subrectangular; posterior marginal punc-
ture at basal angle on inner side of border : elytra oval, deeply
striate; interstices strongly convex, eighth and ninth narrow;
humeral angles dentate; lateral border very narrow, but carinate
near base: prosternum with basal declivity flat and bordered;
metasternal episterna elongate. Black ; elytra (excepting first
interstice and margin) dark purple.
Head large (3 mm. across eyes), elongate, convex; eyes small,
depressed, deeply imbedded in orbits; genjis tumid behind eyes
and buccal fissure; each lateral setigerous puncture of clypeus
connected by a feeble sulcus ; with a fine puncture at each
lateral angle of clypeal suture. Prothorax narrow, very little
