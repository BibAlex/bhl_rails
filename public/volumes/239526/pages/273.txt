ON A NEW SPECIES OF ARDISIA FROM NEW SOUTH
WALES.
By R. T. Baker, F.L.S., Curator, Technological Museum,
Sydney.
(Plate xvi.)
Ardisia racemosa, sp.nov.
A handsome, glabrous tree about 20 to 30 feet high, and 6 to
9 inches in diameter, with a smooth grey bark. It is found in
deep, rich alluvial gullies, generally in groves or clusters similar to
Drimys dipetala and D. aromatica. Branchlets terete. Leaves
measuring up to 5 inches long and 1 inch wide, ovate-elliptical,
acuminate, thin, almost membranous, pale-coloured on the
underside, often becoming channelled near the midrib when
dried; edges very slightly crenate, and in parts are sometimes
undulate. Lateral veins iine, oblique. Oil glands numerous,
fairly distinct. Flowers in short, axillary, occasionally lateral
loose racemes; pedicels filiform, about 4 lines long. Sepals 5,
valvate, about J line long, acuminate, marked (except the edges),
with dark purple spots, glabrous, edges scarious. Petals 5,
about 1^ lines long, imbricated and contorted in the bud,
acuminate, glabrous, spotted similarly to the sepals, edges light-
coloured or not marked, the lower half of the inner surface
covered with dense ferruginous hairs. Filaments exceedingly
short. Stamens opposite the petals. Anthers glabrous, sessile
or nearly so, cordate-sagittate, with subulate recurved points;
valves opening by longitudinal slits from apex to base. Style
longer than the stamens, subulate. Fruits not seen.
Timber light-coloured, close-grained, moderately hard, but on
account of its size could probably only be used for turning, tool
handles, &c.
