multiplication of the microbe. With 0-02% the stroke was
slow to show itself, was alwaj's very scanty, and finally, after
ten days' incubation, it dried up.
The Location of the Bacteria.
Cane-juice has an acidity equal to an amount of tartaric acid
varying from 0*2 to 0-3%, and as the juice is derived from the
tissue we can understand why the bacteria avoid these strongly
acid tissues and inhabit the slightly acid or neutral fluids of the
vascular system.
In view of the fact that in many bacterial diseases of plants,
the microbes are found only in the vessels, and that the bacteria
are very sensitive to the reaction of the contents of the vessels,
it would appear that the immunity of plants disease-proof to
bacterial infection may depend upon a relativel}'^ greater acidity
or alkalinity of the vascular contents as compared with susceptible
varieties.
A peptonised medium similar to that used in testing the
influence of peptone was employed in a small test to corroborate
the general conclusion that had been drawm during the work upon
the bacterium with regard to the temperature, and from the
growths upon the agar it was manifest that a temperature of
30° C. was best suited to the organism.

That the bacterium grows rapidly at 30° C. (86° F.) and not
at all at 37°, serves to explain in part at least why the disease
occurs more frequently in cold, wet seasons. Such seasons check
the growth of the plant, the \ itality is lowered, and at the same
time the bacteria, being under favourable conditions of tempera-
