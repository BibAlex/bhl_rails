than long (5-5 x 7 mm.), about same width (4-7 mm.) at base and
apex; sides strongly rounded, meeting base in an even curve;
border wide, reilexed; lateral basal impressions short, deep, uniting
with lateral channel at posterior extremity. Elytra truncate-
oval (13x8 mm.); lateral apical sinuosities wide; lateral border
wide and sharply reflexed from humeral angle to apical sinuosity;
eighth interstice wider than ninth on basal half, tenth short, well
developed towards apex. Intercoxal declivity of prosternum flat,
but not bordered on sides; of mesosternum concave. Length 24,
breadth 8 mm.
A second specimen (9) with prothorax narrow^er (5-5 x 6*5 mm.),
more narrowed to base (4-3 mm.).

Closely resembling N. (eneomicans, Chaud., but I think distinct.
The following differences may be noted : — Prothorax with sides
more evenly rounded and meeting the base in a curve without
any sinuosity, basal angles obtuse; basal border of elytra with its
posterior margin much less arcuate (sloping far less decidedly
forward to the humeral angles), and only a little raised above the
lateral border (not dentate) at point of junction.

Elliptical-oval, robust, black. Head large (3*4 mm. across eyes),
convex; frontal impressions strongly impressed, divergent poste-
riorly; eyes convex, not prominent (eyes with orbits reniform);
postocular part of orbits greatly developed, protuberant but not
so prominent as eyes. Prothorax smooth, broader than long
(3 '9 X 4 5 mm.), widest before middle, lightly narrowed to base;
apex (3-4 mm.) broader than base (3-2mm.); sides lightly rounded;
base lightly emarginate; basal angles a little marked, obtuse;
lateral border thick, narrow, wider posteriorly, lightly subsinuate
just before basal angles, extending round basal angles; posterior
marginal puncture in the wide lateral channel at basal angle;
