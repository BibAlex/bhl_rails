ON EUCALYPTUS MELANOPHLOIA, F.v.M., AND ITS
COGNATE SPECIES.

This species was originally described by Mueller in 1858 (Journ.
Linn. Soc. iii. 93); and Bentham in the ' Flora Australiensis '
(iii. 220) reproduced this description.
In the above and all later references to this tree in scientific
literature, it is always described or mentioned as having uniformly
cordate, sessile leaves throughout its life ; and such was my
experience of it until the research on Eucalypts recently com-
pleted at the Technological Museum proved that such was not
the case.
It appears now that the original description applies only to one
form of this tree's life-history, i.e , the opposite, sessile, cordate
stage; and this being the only described form up till now it can
be easily understood how, as regards its foliage, it was taken to
belong to that class of Eucalypts having similar leaves. This
includes such Eucal3^pts as E. cordata, Labill., and E. indveru-
lentci, Sims, for Eastern Australia ; and, as far as at present
known, no lanceolate leaves have ever been found to occur on
them.
It can now be shown that E. melanophloia, F.v.M., on a
morphological classification of foliage, must be grouped with E.
dives, Schau., E. Risdoni, Hook, f., E. cinerea, F.v.M., and others,
all of which in the sessile, cordate-leaved stage, bear both buds,
flowers and fruits; and it is a coincidence that all these, as well
as this species, should have been described originally from this
particular leaf-stage. It is now also known that all and each of
