shades of brown, or brown with ash gem mules, an ashy tint pre-
dominating. Whorls ten, plus a three-whorled protoconch.
Sculpture : across each whorl are about twenty-one vertical
rounded ribs, separated by equal and deep interstices; these ribs
cease on either side of the sutures, giving definition to the whorls.
Three equal and evenly spaced spiral cords override both ribs
and interstices, producing gemmules on the former and partition-
ing the latter into deep square pits. An extra gemmule row
runs along the basal angle of the last whorl and appears on the
spire as a sutural thread. On the base is a plain spiral cord.
The first whorl of the protoconch is white, the second and third
coloured, each with two spiral keels, whose interspaces on the
second and third are latticed by wide-set oblique bars, forming
rhomboidal meshes. Aperture subquadrate, anal notch simple,
spur of the lip crossing the pillar, canal produced, straight.
Length 8; breadth 2 mm.
Hah. — Middle Harbour beaches; common as dead shells on the
sands.
Type. — To be presented to the Australian Museum.
Possibly this is the species recorded by Angas"^" as Trijoris
granulatus, Ad. k Reeve, from Botany Bay.
Triphora nocturna, n.sp,
(Plate xxxii., figs. 30, 31.)
Shell large, tall and slender, conical. Colour uniform dark
purple-brown. Whorls fourteen, plus a four-whorled protoconch.
Sculpture : on the base are three plain spiral keels. Last whorl
with three gemmule rows, the uppermost the largest; on the
penultimate whorl the median row is reduced to a nodose thread;
above it disappears, leaving two rows to mount the spire. The
whorls are longitudinally fluted; upon the folds are set the
gemmules, about 20 to a whorl, polished, much elevated, distant
from each other, their interstices roughened and dulled by longi-
tudinal wrinkles. Protoconch : first two whorls smooth, third
