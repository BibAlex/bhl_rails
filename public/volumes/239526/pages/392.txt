Admittedl}'- a very difficult family. Jaeger (Adumbr.) separated
the Weisiacece and placed them first of the Acrocarps. Dr.
Brotherus' publications hitherto have followed Jaeger in this and
in several other respects. Dr. C. Mueller, Mitten, and now Dr.
Brotherus ('Bryales') include Weisia and allied genera under
Pottiacece. CM., in Gen. M., Jaeg., Paris (Index) et al. make
Barhula a comprehensive genus, including Tortula, Tortella, etc.
Broth. ('Bryales, Part i.') forecasts a very complete analysis of
the Pottiacece, wndev the well-known divisions of (i.) Trichostomece
(leaves mostly narrow, elongate, and never broader in the upper
half); (ii.) PottiecB (leaves mostly broad, oval to spathulate); to
which he adds (iii.) Encalyptece, usually regarded as a separate
family. Unfortunately, his complete account of the Pottiacece is
not to hand. To his outline of the generic distinctions of the
subfamily, TrichostoTnece, we acknowledge our great indebtedness.
Our want of descriptions of some of the species, however, and the
absence of material for examination in many cases, make accuracy
in every detail scarcely possible.
