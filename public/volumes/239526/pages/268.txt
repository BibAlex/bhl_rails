AUSTRALIAN FUNGI, NEW OR UNRECORDED.
DECADES I.-II.
By D. McAlpine, Corresponding Member.
Although a considerable amount of attention has been given
to the Fungus-flora of Australia, a large number of species still
remain to be described, at least among the micro-fungi.
These are either new to science or have not hitherto been
recorded for Australia, and since numbers of such are continually-
coming under my notice, it is desirable to render the descriptions
available for other workers.
The introduction and cultivation of economic plants is no
doubt responsible for many of these, but the native vegetation is
likewise rich in new forms, and it will be my aim to record the
indigenous species as well as those which are already known. In
these two decades eleven new species and twelve different genera
are represented.
1. AnTHOSTOMELLA DANTHONIiE, n.Sp.
Minute, black, gregarious pustules on leaves and leaf-sheaths.
Perithecia covered, densely crowded and running in lines, opening
at surface by pore, surrounded by pale ruddy tissue, and occupy-
ing entire depth of leaf, always much compressed. Asci cylindrical
or bulging, slightly pointed and rounded at apex, tapering into
short stalk at base, 8-spored, 140-150 x 19-20 /u, but may reach a
breadth of 28 [x when sporidia are partially two-rowed. Sporidia
monostichous, occasionally distichous, dirty brown, very thick-
walled, elliptical, 20-26 x 15-17 n; paraphyses hyaline individually
but pink in the mass, longer than asci, very slender (0-5-1 /u) with
highly refractive granular contents.
