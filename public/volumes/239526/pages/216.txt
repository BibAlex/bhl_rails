before base ; bcasal angles obtusely subrectangular ; posterior
marginal puncture placed a little before the base on inner side of
lateral channel: elytra truncate-ov-al, deeply striate; third inter-
stice 2-punctate, eighth narrow, convex; humeral angles feebly
dentate. Head black with a purple tinge ; prothorax nitid,
purple-black, violaceous towards sides; elytra dark purple, some-
what opaque, lateral channel bright brassy green; under surface
and legs piceous.
Head oval (2-5 mm. across eyes); vertex lightly transversely
impressed ; front strongly biimpressed, impressions divergent
posteriorly; eyes convex, subprominent. Prothorax broader than
long (3-4 X 4 mm.), widest just before the middle, depressed, very
faintly transversely striolate; sides lightly arcuate, more strongly
and roundly narrowed anteriorly than posteriorly; apex emai'-
ginate ; anterior angles rather prominent, obtuse; base wide,
emarginate in middle, sloping lightly forward to angles on each
side; lateral border widely reflexed, narrower in front of anterior
marginal puncture; median line deep, reaching from base almost
to apex; lateral basal impressions long, parallel, narrow at bottom
(extending almost half the length of prothorax, becoming faint
anteriorly); lateral basal impressions a little raised (hardly convex).
Elytra truncate-oval (7*6 x 4-8 mm.), wide and truncate at base,
strongly sinuate on each side of apex, depressed, lightly declivous
to apex, abruptly declivous on sides; basal border curving very
little forward to humeral angles on posterior margin, raised into
an obtuse subprominent projection at point of junction with lateral
border; this widely reflexed, narrow, close to base; three inner
interstices very lightly convex on disc, third much wider than
first and second at posterior puncture, fifth, sixth and seventh
convex, sixth narrower (especially near base), seventh very wide
on basal third, eighth narrow, a little wider than ninth on basal
half, tenth narrow and feebly developed near apical sinuosity.
Intercoxal declivity of prosternum flat, bordered laterally' ; of
mesosternum wide, hardly concave. Length 13, breadth 48 mm.
