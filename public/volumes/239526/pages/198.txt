the typical form. It seems too near iV. besti to be considered a
distinct species.
J^ote (2). — A specimen {^), from the northern slopes of the
Buflfalo Mountain, near Porpunkah, is in my collection, which,
though closely resembling JV. besti, is perhaps a distinct species.
The differences I note are: — Colour brassy; prothorax more
rounded on sides, more strongly narrowed to base, basal angles a
little more marked, sides hardly subsinuate before base; basal
border of elytra joining lateral border without the slightest
interruption; mesosternum not concave between coxae.
NOTONOMUS HOWITTI, n.Sp.
9. Oval, robust. Head not large ; prothorax broader than
long, a little narrowed without sinuosity to base ; posterior
marginal puncture at basal angle outside lateral channel : elytra
strongly striate; humeral angles rounded; interstices depressed,
third 3-punctate, eighth wider than ninth. Black.
Head convex (3 mm. across eyes); frontal impressions short,
distinct, divergent posteriorly; eyes convex, prominent, strongly
inclosed at base. Prothorax broader than long (3-5 x 4*2 mm.);
base and apex of equal width (3 mm.); sides lightly rounded,
meeting base in a gentle curve; base very lightly emarginate in
middle, almost truncate on each side (curving forward very
slightly to basal angles); basal angles well marked, obtuse; lateral
border narrow, thick, a little wider and more reflexed towards
base, passing round basal angles, thickened at basal angle to
receive posterior marginal puncture; median line lightly impressed;
lateral basal impressions deep, not elongate, space between them
rather depressed. Elytra oval (8*5 x 5 mm.), convex ; sides
rounded ; lateral apical sinuosities lightly marked ; basal and
lateral borders meeting at humeral angle without the slightest
interruption ; ninth stria and tenth interstice well developed.
Prosternum bordered along anterior margin; intercoxal declivity
rounded and narrowed in middle; mesosternum lightly concave
between coxae. Length 14, breadth 5 mm.
