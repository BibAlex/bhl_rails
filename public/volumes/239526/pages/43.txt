THE GUMMOSIS OF THE SUGAR-CANE,
elude that in the suspension the bacteria are inert, and for
purposes of identification of the gum it is unnecessary to
separate them.
In testing the bacterial slime and the cane-gum a number of
reagents suggested themselves, and the results of the numerous
tests which identify the two are shown in the following table.
In considering the tests it must be borne in mind that the cane-
gum at my disposal was very limited, and the solutions con-
sequently were weak, which accounts for the absence of perceptible
precipitates on the addition of dilute acetic acid and a mixture
of acetic and tannic acids.
