AND ON GYROCOTYLE IN GENERAL,

(Plate vii.)
The Monozoic Cestodes of the genus Gyrocotyle ( Ampliiptyches)
are, in the adult condition, parasites exclusively of fishes of the
order Holocephali, and have been found not only in the northern
Cki?ncera monstrosa, but in the southern Callorhynchus antarcticus
and C. argenteus. It is, therefore, not a matter for surprise that
the new species of the former genus trawled by the " Thetis " in
1898, and described b}' Mr. E. R. Waite under the name of C.
Oyilbyi,* proves to be the host of a member of this group. A
few months ago Mr. Waite sent me two specimens in alcohol of
a species of Gyrocotyle, taken from a specimen of C/mnchra
Ogilhyi, recenth^ received by the Australian Museum from Manlv.
In comparing these specimens with the published accounts of
G. 2triia and G. rugosa, and with a preserved specimen and
sections of the latter, a difficulty occurs which has to be dealt
with at the outset. Contrary opinions are held b}^ difterent
observers as to the orientation of the animal. By Wagener (8),
followed by Diesing, Olsson, Monticelli (5, 6), Braun (2, 3), and
others, the end Ijearing the peculiar plicated sti-ucture termed the
funnel is looked upon as posterior. By Baldwin Spencer (7), and
l)y Lijnnberg (4), on the other hand, the funnel end is regarded as
