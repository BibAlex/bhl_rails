618 STUDIES ON AUSTRALIAN MOLLUSCA,
order the gemmules are set in perpendicular rows. On the ante-
penultimate the median gemmules shrink in size, and a few
whorls higher up the median row pinches out. First whorl
dome-shaped; secondMnflated, with two small, sharp, plain spiral
keels; on the third the keels commence to resolve into gemmules,
after which the adult sculpture is assumed. Aperture rounded,
closed on the right by a spur crossing the pillar lip; anal notch
a deep subcircular orifice. Canal extremely short, recurved.
Length 4 "2; breadth 1-5 mm.
In colour and contour this resembles T. ohesula, Jousseaume,
from which the protoconch and anal notch immediately separate it.
Triphora kesteveni, n.sp.
(Plate xxxiii., fig. 45.)
Shell acicular. Colour pale pink. Whorls tw^elve. Sculpture:
on the last whorl four, on the others three, smooth spiral ribs, the
uppermost the largest; interstices punctate. Length 6-5 mm.
Hah. — Ladies Hall Beach, South Head, Sydney; one specimen
(H. L Kesteven).
X y p e. — To be presented to the Australian Museum.
This species so differs in form and sculpture from others known
from this coast that I have ventured to describe it from a single
worn and decollate example.
