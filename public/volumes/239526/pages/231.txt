316 EE VISION OF THE GENUS ^^OTONOMUS,
median line strongly impressed; lateral basal impressions narrow,
rather long; lateral basal spaces convex. Elytra truncate-oval
(8-5 X 5-2 mm.), rather depressed on disc, abruptly declivous on
lateral declivities; deeply striate; sides lightly rounded: lateral
sinuosities of apex feeble; shoulders rounded; basal border slightly
raised above lateral border at humeral angles (hardly subdentate);
interstices convex, third, fifth and seventh a little wider than
others, third 4-punctate, eighth narrow, not as wide as ninth;
tenth interstice and ninth stria well developed. Prosternum not
bordered on anterior margin; basal declivity narrow in middle,
bordered on sides: mesosternum wide, not concave between coxaa.
Posterior tibiae lightly incurved near apex. Length 15, breadth
5 2 mm.
Hab. — Victoria.
A distinct species. I believe it to be Omaseus o'l/Jipalpis ,
Casteln., the only apparent differences from Castelnau's descrip-
tion being that it is a little larger, and the third interstice of the
elytra has four — not five — punctures in both my specimens ;
neither difference appears to me of specific value.

Elliptical, parallel, depressed. Upper surface cupreous; pro-
thorax and lateral channel of elytra brighter than disc of elytra;
under surface, inflexed margins of elytra and legs piceous-black.
Head not large (4 mm. across eyes); front strongly biimpressed
behind clypeus; eyes convex, but not prominent; postocular parts
of orbits rising gently from head, not protuberant. Prothorax
quadrate (5-6 x 5-8 mm.), widest before middle, wider across base
(4*7 mm.) than apex (4*4 mm.) ; sides very lightly rounded
anteriorly, gently narrowed posteriorly and meeting base obliquely
without perceptible sinuosity; basal angles obtuse, but marked;
base emarginate in rbiddle; posterior marginal puncture placed
