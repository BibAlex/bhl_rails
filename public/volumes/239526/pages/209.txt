than apex (3'5 mm.); posterior angles obtuse, a little marked;
posterior marginal puncture on border at basal angle ; lateral
channel and border wide. Elytra truncate-oval (9 x 55 mm.);
humeral angles hardly marked; striae deeply impressed, minutely
crenulate (more perceptibly so in 9); interstices convex (strongly
so in (J, lightly so and rather opaque in 9), third 2-punctate,
eighth wider than ninth on basal half (hardly convex on basal
half in 9), ninth lightly convex, wider posteriorly, tenth distinct
before lateral basal sinuosity. Intercoxal declivity of prosternum
flat; of mesosternum flat. Length 15-17, breadth 5-2-5-8 mm.
Hub. — I*^.S W. : Sydney District [Ermington, Penshurst, Ryde,
Carlton, Auburn (Sloane)], Grose Valley (Fletcher).
Castelnau gives the range of the species as " Queensland,
N.S. Wales and Victoria," but I have seen it only from the
Sydney District. The synonymy is on the authorit}^ of Chaudoir.
