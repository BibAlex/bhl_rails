Clathurella denseplicata, Dunker.
Pleurotoma {Drillia) denseplicata^ Dunker, Mai. Bliitt. xviii.,
1871, p. 159: WeinkaiifF, Conch. Cab. Bd. iv., Abth. 3, 1887,
p. 107, pi. 23, ff. 7, 9.
This species, collected in Bass Straits by a correspondent of
the Godeffroy Museum, and of which the type is probably in the
Hamburg Museum, has apparently been overlooked by Australian
conchologists. From the figure and description I judge this
species to be identical with Clathurella philomence^ Ten. Woods,
over which it has priority.
CocHLODESMA ANGASi, Crosse ct Fisclier.
On a beach near the house of my friend, Mr. W. L. Mav, I
saw for the first time a living animal of this species. The
siphons are not protected by a sheath like those of Anatina, and
can be wholly retracted within the valves. These characters
accord better with Cochlodesma than with Anatina, to which
Angas (P.Z.S., 1865, p. 644) erroneously transferred it.

An example of this shell from Sydney Harbour has l)een
handed to me by the Hon. J. Norton, M.L.C. This species has
not to my knowledge been recorded from the coast of New South
Wales. Dr. Norton's discovery was confirmed by Mr. H. L.
Kesteven, who again collected it at the Inner South Head.
Philobrya crexatulifera, Tate.
Tate, Trans. Roy. Soc. S.A. xv., 1892, p. 131, pi. i., if. 11, Ua.
This species has not been seen so far north as this State. I
can now announce that I found it in a cleft of the cliffs a mile
south of the South Head Lighthouse, where I took Zidora lodder(H,
Tate ife May, Sirius badius, T. Woods, Ccecum aniputatum, Hedley,
and other rarities. During her recent visit to Sydney Miss
Lodder also collected P. crenatulifera at Long Bay.
