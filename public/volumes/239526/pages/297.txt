Head with not very dense punctures. Rostrum the length of
prothorax, sides scarcely visibly incurved to middle; basal third

punctate. Scape inserted slightly nearer apex than base of
rostrum: 1st joint of funicle stouter and slight^ shorter than 2nd.
Prothorax rather strongly transverse, apex less than half the
width of base; with a dense slightly shining seta bearing granules,
becomingveryindistinct anteriorly; with a narrow and distinct but
not quite continuous median carina. Elytra slightly wider than
prothorax; with series of large punctures, each of which is deep
only in its middle; interstices rather densely granulate, the

granules rather less numerous and the setae less distinct than in
C. stigmaticus; median carina continuous to base and almost to
