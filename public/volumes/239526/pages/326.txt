" Apex consists of four polished but spirally threaded, white,
turbinated whorls, of which the first is extremely small and some-
what immersed."

" A four-whorled subcylindrical nucleus; nucleus smooth with
rounded subequal whorls and a rather blunt apex." This pro-
toconch somewhat resembles that of L. vespaceum, but is not so
tapering.
Fossil Species.
One of the most noticeable features of these fossils was the
large number of specimens which had their apices complete (over
70 per cent.). Among recent species I had, like Mr. Baker (3),
found that only about five per cent, retained their apices. Talking
over this matter with Mr. C. Hedle}', he suggested that it was in a
great measure due to their having been inhabitants of deep and
still waters. Though the greater strength of the fossil apices has
doubtless been a contributing cause, an inquiry into the habitats
of living allies has provided support for Mr. Hedley's sugges-
tion. He has (17) in dealing with tlie "Thetis" Pelecypoda
instanced several cases of fossil species or their near allies occurring
off the coast of New South Wales in deep water. My own investi-
gations have disclosed the fact that many of the shells collected
by the "Challenger" in deep waters of high southern latitudes
have near allies in the fossil beds from which the species under
discussion were obtained. It is thus seen that many of the
nearest living allies of these fossils are inhabitants of deep waters,
and it might reasonably be inferred that they themselves occupied
similiar localities. This inference cannot, however, safely be
