for Australia, is in the form of spikes or panicles with numerous,
flowers, whilst in this species the flowers are either solitary or few
(from 3 to 5) in an exceedingly short raceme. The individual
flowers, as well as the leaves and fruits, are all much smaller than
in any of the above species.
It differs from -S'. spicata, Roxb., also in its small, delicate, thin
leaves and smaller and pedicellate flowers. S. Thwaitesii, F.v.M.
and S. paucistamineus have firm, comparatively large, coriaceous
leaves, and numerous spikes of over an inch long. The fruits
are also smaller than those of any of these species.
It also appears to be quite distinct from any Symplocos des-
cribed in the ' Flora of British India ' (Hooker).
It occurs in the rich alluvial gullies of Tweed River, growing
amongst the recently described new plants of that district,
obtained by Mr. W. Bauerlen.
