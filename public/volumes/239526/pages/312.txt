The clothing of the elytra is unusually dense and is of a brick-
red colour.
Tyrt^osus inermis, n.sp.
Dark reddish-brown, antennae and claw-joints paler. Densely
and almost uniformly (except that they are paler on the sterna
and absent on the apical half of rostrum) clothed with soft sooty
scales, feebly variegated with sooty white ones.
Head with dense concealed punctures; eyes large, but not very
close together. Rostrum short, wide and almost straight, sides
very feebly incurved to middle; basal two-fifths coarsely punctate,
elsewhere shining and (except along middle) very distinctly punc-
tate. Scape inserted almost in exact middle of rostrum; 1st joint
of funicle stouter but no longer than 2nd, the others transverse.
Frothorax strongly transverse, sides strongly rounded; with dense,
round, clearly-cut but concealed punctures; median carina absent.
Elytra slightly and not suddenly wider than prothorax and about
twice and one-half as long; striate-punctate, punctures large but
more or less concealed ; interstices convex, the width of but
apparently much wider than striae. Punctures of metasternal
episterna continuous throughout; 3rd and 4th abdominal segments
each with one row. Feinora edentate. Length 4, rostrum |;
width 2. mm.

The clothing, except on the tarsi, is nowhere setose in cha-
racter. The scape is inserted almost in the middle of the rostrum
and the prothoracic carina is entirely absent.
Tyrt^osus corpulentus, n.sp. *
Brownish-black, antennae not much paler, elytra reddish-brown.
Prothorax with a mouse-coloured scale in each puncture, and with
a few small spots of dingy whitish scales; elytra with mouse-
coloured scales and with two fasciae of white (bordered or inter-
mingled with pale ochreous) scales. Under surface with large
soft white scales intermingled on the apical segments with darker
ones; legs mostly with white scales. Head and basal half of
rostrum not very densely squamose.
