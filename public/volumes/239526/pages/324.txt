Apex of one and one-half whorls, light brown, semitransparent,
smooth, shining; covered with a thin light brown epidermis.
LoTORiUM QUOYi, Reeve, sp. B.
(Plate xvii., fig. 25.)
Tritoji quoyi, Reeve; Tryon, op. cit. p. 24, pi. 13, f. 116.
Apex of one and one-half whorls, dark brown, smooth, shining.
No epidermis on the specimens examined.
LoTORiUM NODOCOSTATUM, Tate and May, sp.
(Text fig. 1.)
Lcunpusia nodocostata, Tate and May, Trans. Roy. Soc. S. Aust.,
xxiv., 1900, p. 90; Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S. Wales, xxvi., 1901,
p. 355, pi. xxiii., f. 2.
Apex of three and one-half whorls, perforate, turbinate, white,
semitransparent, polished. The sculpture consists of six faint
revolving lines, of which that on the periphery
is the most pronounced, and of oblique growth-
stride, some of which are stronger than others.
Dimensions: length 5, breadth 3-3 mm.
The large size of this protoconch marks it
as unique among recent species. Notwith-
standing its entirely normal plan of coiling,
it appears to me to be a direct link between the
mammillate, excentric apices of some fossils,
and the normal apices of the recent species.
To Mr. C. Hedley I am indebted for the p^â„¢^ 1
opportunity of figuring and describing this L. nodocostatum,
apex, from material dredged by him from a 'I&te & May.
depth of one hundred fathoms 16 miles east of Wollongong,
N.S.W. The species has been identified by comparison with a
cotype kindly lent me by Mr. W. L. May.
