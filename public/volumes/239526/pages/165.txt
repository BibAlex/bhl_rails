The type is in the Vienna herbarium (Herb. Musei Caesarei
Palatini Vindobonensis). It is in plump bud and expanded
flower. It bears a label, in Schauer's handwriting, " Eucalyptus
Baueriana, Schauer, in Walp. Repert.," and also the words " E.
Baueriana, Schauer," written over a label "Eucalyptus rhombi-
folia, Tausch."
Access to the type has enabled me to settle the identity of
Schauer's plant. Collected by Ferdinand Bauer, it was doubtless
obtained in the Port Jackson district; and it is the Lignum-vitae
or Poplar-leaved Box which was always looked upon by Mueller
as a form of E. jyolyantheinos, Schauer, and w^iich, later on, was,
as will be indicated presently, recognised as a distinct species.
Bentham (B.Fl. iii. 214, under E. polyanlhemos) says: — "The
tropical specimens to which, from the character given, belongs E,
Baueriana^ Schau , in Walp. Pvep. ii. 924, have generally smaller
flowers and fruits than the southern ones, but do not otherwise
diff-er."
I am not clear as to the allusion to " tropical specimens."
There is no evidence that Bauer obtained the specimens, described
by Schauer, in the tropics, or was, in fact, in troj^ical Australia
