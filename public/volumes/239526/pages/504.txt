I would not be understood to advance this theory as a convic-
tion; it is but a speculation of one who has not been able to
examine the organ for himself; moreover, the osphradium cannot
be regarded as functionless, for, as already mentioned, it is
highly innervated.
LlTTORINID^.
The family Littoriaidce has, at my hands, suffered only restric-
tion. The reasons for removing the various genera therefrom
will be found under the families in which I have placed them.
RiSELLID.E.
The family Risellidce has been formed for the reception of the
two unitypical genera Risella and Risellopsis.
I proceed at once to describe the anatomy of Risella inelano-
stoma, Gmelin.
External features : â€” The mollusc extruded from its shell has
been figured by Quoy and Gaimard (18), as also the operculum.
The ground colour of the body is white, reticulated with black
markings, which in places become confluent. Foot white, tinged
with yellow. Operculum paucispiral, corneous, oval. The snout
is not as long as it is represented in the figure referred to.
Tentacles of medium length, carrying the eyes on prominences
at their bases. When compared with Littorina or Lotorium, it
is seen that Risella is twisted half round in its shell. In the
former genera the dorsal aspect of the mollusc is that opposite
to the axial, whilst in the latter, and most probably all genera
possessing trochiform shells, the dorsal aspect is that which is
uppermost when the shell is standing on its base. To make this
more plain, when Littorina is set perpendicularly, with the spire
up, the dorsal face of the mollusc is on the outside of the coils;
with the shell of Risella in the same position the mollusc is lying
with its dorsal face up. This twisting of the mollusc in the shell
has resulted in the descending of the columellar muscle on to the
base of the shell. In the following description I have spoken of
