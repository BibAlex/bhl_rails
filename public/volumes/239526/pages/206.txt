The description given above is founded on a specimen ((J)from
Dunoon. I took it plentifully at Ourimbah and Narrara; the
form from these localities is more elongate and more convex,
with prothorax and elytra proportionately more elongate and less
ampliate at widest part than specimens from Dunoon, but I have
not thought it sufficient!}'- distinct to receive a separate name.
NOTONOMUS EXCISIPENNIS, n.Sp.
Elliptical-oval. Head moderate ; prothorax subcordate ;
posterior angles rounded; posterior marginal puncture a little
before base in lateral channel : elytra truncate-oval, strongly
striate; interstices strongly convex, third 2-punctate, eighth ver}^
narrow. Under surface and legs piceous-black ; head black,
sometimes with a bronzy reflection; prothorax metallic-purple,
brighter towards sides, nearly black on disc; elytra of a dark
purple tint, often viridescent towards suture; purple on lateral
declivities, more obscure near lateral margins.
^. Head rather large (3-3 mm. across eyes); front a little
depressed, lightly biimpressed ; eyes convex, prominent. Pro-
thorax broader than long (3-8 x 4-7 mm.), a little narrowed to
base, hardl}' narrower at base (3-1 mm.) than apex (3.2 mm.);
sides lightly rounded, not sinuate before base ; apex truncate,
angles widely obtuse; base truncate, rounded on each side near
angles, these not marked; lateral border line, narrow, continued
evenly round basal angles to middle of lateral basal impressions;
median line strongly impressed; lateral basal impressions strongly
impressed, parallel, not long. Elytra truncate-oval (9*5 x 5 -5 mm.),
lightly rounded on sides; humeral angles rounded; basal border
meeting lateral border without any interruption at humeral angles;
lateral sinuosities of apex strongly developed. Intercoxal declivity
of prosternum rounded ; of mesosternum concave. Anterior
femora thick and greatly swollen in middle.
9- Head a little larger than in (J; space between ninth inter-
stice and border of elytra very wide and obliquely truncate pos-
teriorly, the lateral sinuosities of apex being exceptionally
strongly developed. Length 15-5-18, breadth 5-6*2 mm.
