betif, wJiicli possibly causes gummosis of the sugar beet, with so
little detail, that it cannot be compared. The same remark
applies to Bad. mori, said by Boyer and Lambert to produce a
disease (gummosis ?) of the mulberry. Of the other bacteria not
associated with diseases of plants, there appear to be none
described which have the general characters of this bacterium, and
although Cobb's description is meagre, there is no doubt that he
intended the name of Bac. vascularutyi for this organism, which
he found constantly associated with the gum of affected plants.
