412 REVISION OF THE AUSTRALIAN CURCULIONID.E,
distinct on the anterior pair, usually slightl}' curved; tarsi rather
short, claw-joint elongate. Elliptic or elliptic-ovate, convex,
striate, moderately squamose, winged.
This genus is very close to Cryptorhynchus; compared with the
typical C. Lajmthi it differs in having the mesosternal receptacle
raised in front and much more cavernous, the prothorax more
decidedly bisinuate at the base, the tibiae sulcate-striate or punc-
tate and the clothing never fasciculate. The two genera, how-
ever, are remarkably close, but it appears to be as well not to
degrade Tyrtceosus into a section of Cryptorhynchus, as the latter
is in anything but a satisfactory state.
The majority of the species occur in Australia or Tasmania,
but several are recorded from New Guinea. All are arboreal and
very homogeneous in their general appearance. The sexual charac-
ters are either very slight or else are so strong^ marked as to
cause the sexes to appear as distinct species. I believe, however,
that they are very slight. The ciliation of the ocular lobes in all
the species is dense, verj' short and silvery, and appears as a
white rim when the head is removed; with head in position it is
traceable only with extreme difficult}^ It has not been made
use of here.
