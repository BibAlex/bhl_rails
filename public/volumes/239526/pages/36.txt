(1793) represent this species, but have never Ijefore been quoted
or identified.
Voluta paUersonia, Perry (pi. xvii., f. 1), an extra-limital
species, is introduced to note that Deshayes apparently erred in
considering (An. s. Vert, ix., p. 402) this to be Cancellaria
reticulata, Linn. Brazier has stated (P.L.S.N.S.W. [2], ii., p. 996),
as I believe correctly, that this illustration represents F. nucleus,
Lamarck. As, however, Lamarck's preliminary description of
that species bears the same date (1811) as Perry's, there is no
need to disturb the accepted nomenclature.
Cyprcea valentla, Perry (pi. xxiii., f. 2), is recognised by Gray
(Zool. Journ. iv., p. 68) as Cyprcea jyrinceps, Gray, 1824. This
species has occurred at Warrior Reef, Torres Straits.
Bulimus carlnatus, Perry (pi. xxx., f. 1), has been recognised
by Pilsbry (Nautilus, xv., p. 8) as Cantharidus peronii, Philippi,
1846. Jay (Cat. Shells, 4th ed., 1852, p. 192) has wrongly
identified this as Bulimus zebra, Miiller.
Bulimus eximius, Perry (pi. xxx., f. 2), has been recognised by
Pilsbry (Nautilus, xv., p. 8) as Cantharidus badius, Wood, 1856.
Cassidea labiata, Peny (pi. xxxiv., f. 1), takes priority over
Cassis achatina, Lamarck, 1822.
Mitra abbatis, Perry (pi. xxxix., ff. 2-3), was described by
Lamarck in the same year as M. pontificalis. The latter need
not be disturbed.
Bulla ferruginosa, Perry (pi. xl., f. 2), is identified by Pilsbry
(Man. Conch, xv., p. 389) as equivalent to Hydatina albocincta,
Hoeven (1839), but he adds that its use is barred by the prior
Bulla ferruffinea, Gmelin (1790).
A7'anea triremis, Perry (pi. xlv., f. 3), is recognised by Deshayes
(An. s. Vert, ix., p. 566) as Murex tenuispina, Lamarck, 1822.
Pyrida undidatus, Perry (pi. liv,, f. 1), is Fusus pyridatus,
Reeve, 1847.
Pyrida australasia, Perry (pi. liv., f. 4), is identified by
Deshayes (An. s. Vert, ix., p. 434) as Fasciolar'ia Jilamentosa,
