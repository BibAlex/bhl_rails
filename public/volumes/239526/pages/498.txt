tradition has tlius identified it, and as the adjective maculosvs
suits it, I conclude that it was to the species above described that
Adams gave the name. But I beg to call attention to the fact
that I am not naming the shell 2\ maculosa (A. Ad., MS.), that
being, as E. R. Sykes remarks, a complicated and cumbersome
process of nomenclature.
Triphora AxMpulla, n.sp.
(Plate xxxiii., figs. 38, 39.)
Shell small, narrowly conical, acuminate. Whorls nine, plus a
four-whorled protoconch, parted by distinct sutures. Colour :
each whorl is chequered by alternate squares of white and choco-
late; apex white, base chocolate. Sculpture : on the tirst four
adult whorls are two gemmule rows, on the tifth a small median
row is intercalated, which increases till on the last whorl it equals
the others; the gemmules are about 18 to a whorl, large and
closely set, linked within the row, but not from row to row; on
the base are two plain spiral keels. Protoconch : first whorl
smooth, remainder bicarinate, crossed by numerous fine bars.
Aperture subquadrate, spur of the lip not reaching the pillar,
anal notch simple, shallow; canal short, straight. Length 5;
breadth 1'6 mm.
Hab. — Watson's Bay; under stones (J. Brazier).
Type. — To be presented to the Australian Museum.
In colour and shape this species is like T. maculosa and T.
festiva. Than the former it is far smaller, than the latter it is
larger and narrower.

This species has been generally misunderstood. I believe that
all references to it in literature subsequent to the original descrip-
tion are erroneous. The late M r. C. E. Beddome, whose eyesight
was not good in his later years, distributed other species, especi-
