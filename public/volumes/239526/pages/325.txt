(Text fig. 2.)
Triton nodiferunij Lamk.; Tryon, op. cit. p. 10, pi. 3, f. 17.
Apex of three and one-half whorls, semitransparent, delicate
pink, smooth, shining.
The large size and bright colour of this apex give it a different
character from any of the others. Although semitransparent, it
has an appearance of strength which
others lack. The epidermal original is
cast very early in the life of the indivi-
dual; a specimen of onty four adult
whorls, obtained alive, shows no sign of
it. That it had an original corneous
mould may be generalh' proved bj'-

remaining.

" Protoconch ovoid, umbilicate, thin, semi-pellicid, shining,
corneous, light brown, variously marked with spots or stripes of
darker colour; consisting of about three whorls, covered with a
very thin light brown epidermis. Transversely sculptured with
very fine growth-lines; the epidermis supplies four ciliated ridges
which encircle the last whorl, the top one of which is continued
on the earlier whorls. . . ."
