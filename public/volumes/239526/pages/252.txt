A pair of this species determined by the late Mr. Oil iff is in
ni}^ collection; and on looking through the ' Rhopalocera Exotica '
I found an excellent figure of the male under the name of H.
purpurea from Sydney and Moreton Bay. The localities agree,
and also the description and figure; and there is no doubt in my
mind that H. purpurea is the same insect. The confusion was
caused no doubt by H. cyprotus being originall}' placed in the
genus Chrysophanus, to which it certainly does not belong. This
species is very local; and I have found only one brood, and that
appeared in Sydney very early in the season, and was on the wing-
only a short time The females are much rarer and of slower
flight than the males. In Brisbane Mr. R. Illidge has taken
larvae feeeding on Jacksonia sp., but as I know of no Jacksonia
nearer to Sydney than Blacktown, there must be some other
food-plant.

This species for many years has passed under Miskin's name of
androdus. By all the authors mentioned above, this species is
compared with the allied form, H. absimilis, Felder. Semper says
the male is greenish and' shining, w^ith a dark arrows-shaped
shadow standing out along the veins in the centre of the fore wings:
