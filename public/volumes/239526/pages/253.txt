334 AUSTRALIAN RHOPALOCERA : LYC.fJNID.E,
in the female the white areas are larger than in absimilis, and in the
hindwing the white area extends to the costa. Thus it will be
seen that when describing II. androdus, Miskin was only renaming
an old species. Miskin does not mention the arrow-shaped
shadow on the forewing, but one of his localities, Cape York, is
the same as Semper's. Regarding //. suhargentea, Mr. R. E.
Turner, who has seen both the type specimen of androdus and
the figure of snhargentea, says that they are identical. The figure
is a very good one, and shows the arrow-shaped shadow on the
forewing, a character, however, not mentioned in the description.
The female is not figured, and the locality given for the male is
Cape York.
Mr. Turner, who has caught many specimens of this species
both at Cairns and Cape York, informs me that the markings on
the underside vary, but that those of the upperside are constant.
A careful examination of the descriptions convinces one that both
Miskin, and Grose Smith and Kirby described a much older form.
It should also be noted that the locality, Cape York, is given by
all three writers.

The three following species of this beautiful Australian genus
have, b}^ all writers, been greatly confused. The insects are all
of a brilliant silvery-blue on the upperside; and on account of
their at one time great rarity they are usually poorly represented
in collections. Also authors knowing only one species, have tried
to make it fit described species with little success. The difficulty
is cleared up, however, when we recognise that there are not one
or two species, as authors have variousl}'' supposed, but three; and
that the commonest and best known, is the one that as yet has
not been named. 1 give the three descriptions below.
