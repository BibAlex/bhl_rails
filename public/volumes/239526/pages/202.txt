Head small (2-6 mm. across eyes), convex ; eyes prominent.
Prothorax hardly broader than long (3-6 x 3*7 mm.), widest before
middle; base and apex narrow, of equal width (2-6 mm.); sides
lightly rounded anteriorly, decidedly and obliquely narrowed to
base ; anterior angles close to head ; base lightl}' and widely
emarginate in middle, truncate on each side; basal angles sharply
marked, almost rectangular; posterior marginal puncture at basal
angles in lateral channel; lateral basal impressions elongate; lateral
border fine, narrow, obsoletely subsinuate just before basal angles.
Elytra truncate-oval (8-2x5 mm.), widest behind middle, a little
narrowed to base; lateral apical sinuosities well developed, wide;
basal border with posterior margin evenly and lightly arcuate;
humeral angles lightly raised (not dentiform) at point of junction
of basal and lateral borders; strise deep; interstices convex,
third 4-punctate, eighth wide and depressed on basal half, ninth
with umbilicate punctures wide apart on sides, tenth very short,
only developed near extremity. Intercoxal declivity of proster-
num rounded; of mesosternum concave. Length 14, breadth

N. bassi differs from N. gippslanclicus (as identified by me) by
colour; facies less elongate, less parallel, less convex; prothorax
more ampliate at widest part, with basal angles more sharply
marked; elytra with basal border more raised above the lateral
border at point of junction, and with the inner humeral angle
acute and far more sharply marked.
One of my Yarragon specimens {$) has the prothorax evidently
wider (3*7 x 4 mm.), with base wider (2-9 mm.) than apex (2 8 mm.),
but presents no other differences from the description given
above.
