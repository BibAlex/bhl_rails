Hah. — Tumbulgum, on the Tweed River (W. Bauerlen); in deep,
rich gullies.
This tree was discovered by Mr. Bauerlen in October, 1897, at
the above-mentioned locality, where it is associated with other
plants only recently added to the known flora of New South
Wales, such as Freycinetia excelsa, F.v.M., Petermannia cirrosa,
F.V.M., Tecoma Baileyana, Maiden and Baker, and other species.
It differs principally in the mode of inflorescence from the three
species of Ardisla described from Australia. A. pseudo-jambosa,
F.v.M., has comparatively large terminal panicles, often over six
inches long, and with an induplicate-valvate corolla; small, shining
sepals and petals, and well exserted anthers — characters that do
not apply to this species.
A. brevipedata, F.v.M., differs from it in having flowers arranged
in umbels on very short peduncles, and in having numerous
flowers, with imbricate, broad and short sepals, and imbricate
petals.
A. 2>ci'ChyrrhachiSy F.v.M., differs from it in its thick rhachis,
more numerous flowers (up to 40) in a fascicle, larger leaves and
flowers.
Its nearest affinity is A. brevipedata, and in botanical sequence
it might be placed between that species and pseudo-jambosa,
F.v.M.
The leaves of all four species are very similar in texture and
shape, and have minute, crenulate and repandulate edges, and
all dry with a wrinkled surface.
The name A. repandula, F.v.M. (Frag. iv. 82), was attached to
leaf specimens only, and was thought by Bentham (B.Fl. iv. p 276)
to be identical with A. brevipedata, F.v.M. No specimen of this
species now appears to be available.
Baron von Mueller, in his 'Papuan Plants,' describes two
Ardisias, A. solanacea var. haplosciadea, from a plant discovered
by W. Bauerlen on the Strickland River in 1885, and A. poran-
thera from a New Guinea plant cultivated in the Sydney Botanic
Gardens.
