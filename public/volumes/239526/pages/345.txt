Obs. — According to Cambridge his specimen had " a very
distinct pattern on the upper or forward side of the abdomen,
formed by lines of pure white, longish, scaly hairs, enclosing
various irregularly triangular spaces of deep chocolate-brown, on
a paler yellowish-brown ground; three of these patches or spaces
are nearly contiguous in the median line, a large one in front,
and two smaller ones immediately behind; some small tufts of
white hairs also occupy tlie sides, hinder portion, and other parts
of the abdomen."*
