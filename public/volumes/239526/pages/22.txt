the other, from the lower and larger of which there protrudes a
slender tongue attached dorsally, but free ventrally. In the

cardinal. Length 20, height 16, breadth of conjoined valves
9 mm.

This species belongs to the Section Jlaclririida; the absence of
plicate sculpture distinguishes it from other members of the
group.

Numerous specimens of a shell taken by Mr. J. Brazier in
Torres Straits appear to be this species. It is an addition to the
Australian fauna; indeed, except for a record from the Persian
Gulf,"^ it seems only known from the original locality, Borneo.
As the original account is rather unsatisfactory, I add a figure
and description of a Torres Straits example.
Shell small, ovate, rather thin, narrowly umbilicate above,
subperforate below. Colour white. Sculpture: faint longitudinal
oblique growth-lines are crossed for the anterior and posterior
quarters by half a dozen lightly incised grooves; the vertex also
radiately traversed by a few delicate raised threads, leaving the
median half of the shell bare of ornament. Aperture amjDle
below, constricted at the waist, narrow above and rising in an
arch above the vertex. Columella broad and twisted. Height
3*5, breadth 2-7 mm.
