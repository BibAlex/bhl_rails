^The full title of his book is : — " Conchology | or the | Natural
History of Shells : | containing | a new arrangement of the genera
and species, | illustrated by | coloured engravings | executed
from the natural specimens, | and | including the latest dis-
coveries I by I George Perry." London, 1811.
The work is post-Linnean, the species are named binomially,
and are systematically'' figured and described. In short, the
nomenclature fulfils the requirements of modern zoological legis-
lation, and must take precedence of younger names. The illus-
trations vary in merit; some are excellent, others are wretched;
but most, if not all, are recognisable.
Gray wrote in 1829 : — " I have ventured to refer to this work,
as T consider that it is just that every author should be quoted;
and this author has anticipated Lamarck, Swainson and Sowerby
in several species."*
Gray put his principles into practice by withdrawing his
Cypraea jyrinceps in favour of Perry's prior Gypraea valentia.
Deshayes did not meet with Perry's book until he had partly
completed his second edition of Lamarck's Animaux sans Verte-
bres. But through the latter part of that work he regularly
quoted Perry, and withdrew his species Fusus laticostatus in
favour of Perry's earlier name of F. variegatns.
Sowerby and Reeve were not disposed to acknowledge any
work which upset their species. They ungenerously denied
Perry's right to be cited, and assailed his nomenclature with
hatred and abuse. f So powerful and evil was their influence that
Perry's 'Conchology' has been practically suppressed by London
writers. Even the brothers Adams, who offended against modern
usage by adopting names from polynomial and pre-Linnean
writers, yet refused to admit Perry's names.
