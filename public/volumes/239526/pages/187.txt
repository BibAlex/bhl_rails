Stems when produced comparatively stout, and not exceeding

Y. Fitzgerald; September, 1898).
Height of plant 10-12 feet; leaves not exceeding ^ inch in
length; pedicels 1^-2 lines; calyx IJ lines, segments 1 line long;
corolla 6 lines with lobes not exceeding 1 line long. Ovulary

to the section including R. Brown's Pholidia.
