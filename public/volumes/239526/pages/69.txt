EUTELIA OXYLOPHA, H.sp.
^^. 29 mm. Head, palpi, antennae and thorax brownish-grey;
thorax with a sharp median crest throughout. Abdomen brownish-
grey, with two or three median dark fuscous dots posteriorly.
Legs dark grey, with obscure whitish annulations. Forewings
elongate-triangular, costa straight, apex round-pointed, termen
sharpl}^ angled on vein 3, oblique ; brownish-groy ; a minute
blackish dot beneath costa at 4; followed by four faintly indicated,
waved, transverse, darker lines; three minute whitish dots on
apical part of costa; a row of dark fuscous terminal dots : cilia
fuscous. Hindwings with termen gently rounded, crcnulate ;
fuscous; towards base pale; three dark fuscous dots on inner
margin above tornus ; a narrow fuscous terminal line ; cilia
fuscous.
Has a general resemblance to Eutelia dilatrix, Gn., but may be
readily distinguished by the ridge-like crest of thorax, which
extends right to anterior edge; and also by the absence of the
ante-apical costal triangle on the forewings of the latter species,
which has a posterior thoracic crest only.
Brisbane, Q.; two specimens taken by Mr. 11. Illidge.
