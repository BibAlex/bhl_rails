This species is one of the commonest in Sydney Harbour, and
extends to Tasmania and South Australia. As the original
description was rather brief, I add the following : â€”
Shell small, regularly conical. Whorls eight, plus a four-
whorled protoconch, parted by deep sutures. Colour light brown,
upper gemmule row paler, base and sutures chocolate, lip dull
white. Sculpture : on the base two plain spiral keels, on the
periphery a keel with incipient gemmules and above three rows
of closely packed gemmules, set about 25 to a row, less than their
own breadth apart. On the lower whorls the gemmules of every
row are equal in size; above the median row has smaller gemmules.
A nodose thread runs along the sutures. Aperture subquadrate,
spur of the lip not reaching the pillar; anal notch simple, shallow;
canal short and straight. Length 4-45; breadth Lo mm.

Shell of moderate size, tapering slowl)', glossy, solid. Colour
buff, with a chocolate base and sutural band, gemmules white.
Whorls about thirteen, parted by distinct sutures. Sculpture :
on the earlier adult whorls are two gemmule rows, on the seventh
whorl a minute intermediate row is intercalated which gradually
attains the size of the other rows. The additional row is nearer
to the upper than to the lower row. Along the suture winds a
small plain thread, which on the last whorl appears as a fourth
row of gemmules. The base has one plain spiral thread. In the
immature stage the species has a flat base. The gemmules are
set their own breadth apart, about 22 to a whorl, conspicuous
