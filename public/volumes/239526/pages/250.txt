NOTES ON AUSTRALIAN RHOPALOCERA.LYC.ENIDjE,
Part i.
By G. a. Waterhouse, B.Sc, B.E., F.E.S.
(Plate xiv.)
It is my intention in this series of papers to publish from time
to time notes on the generic position of Australian species
referred to the Lyccenid(e, so that our knowledge of this family
may be brought more into line with that of other parts of the
world, particularly of the Indo-Malayan region. At the present
time our genera are large and unwieldy, containing many very
dissimilar forms, for which there are suitable genera at hand in
which to place them. The system of classification used will be
that given by the late Mr. L. de Niceville in his ' Butterflies of
India, Burmah and Ceylon. Part iii. Lyccenidce,'' to whom I am
also indebted for many valuable generic notes on Australian
specimens which have been submitted to him. In addition to
my own collection of Australian and foreign Lyccenidce I have
had access to the very fine collection in the Macleay Museum.
In addition I intend giving notes on life-histories, distribution
and synonyms, as well as descriptions of any new species it may
be my good fortune to discover.
Megisba nigra, Miskin.
Lycctiiia nigra, (9) Misk., Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S. Wales, 1890,
V. (2), 36.
Miskin described the female; I now give a description of the
male.
