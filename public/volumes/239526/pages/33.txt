24 STUDIES ON AUSTRALIAN MOLLUSCA,
" Gray's surmise that Lijypistts might be a S3^nonym for his
Separatiata proves correct, and the former name having priority
stands, hence : —
''LippiSTES, Montfort, 1810 [^ Separatista, Gra}', 1847].
"1. L. cornu (GmeL). Type [^Separatista Grayii, Ad., loc. cit.']
(5 carinse).
•* 2. L. seimratista (Dillwyn). Type of Separatista (3 carin^e)
\^ = Turho helicoides, Gmel., p. 3598.
= Turbo separatista, Dillwyn.
— Separatista chemnitzii, Ad.]
" There are, I fancy, more species, but these are for the moment
immaterial."
In view of this information so kindly communicated by Mr.
AVoodward, it will be necessary to transfer the four Australian
species — S. separatista, S. gracileiita, S. torcu^aris, and >S'. gahrieli
— from Separatista to Lippistes. I have noted some remarks b}^
Dall on Lippistes (Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool. xviii., 1889, p. 386-7)
and Separatista (Bush, Trans. Connect. Acad, x., 1897, p. 105).
On Perry's Australian Shells.
Perry's work is of particular importance to Australian natu-
ralists, because he had access to earty collections of Australian
shells, especially to that of Lieut. -Col. Wm. Paterson, who filled
the post of Lieut.-Governor of New South Wales in 1800-1802,
and corresponded* with Sir Joseph Banks.
* Colonel Paterson deserves to be remembered as one of the earliest
Australian conchologists. He arrived in Sydney in 1790 as a captain in the
New South Wales Corps, with a high reputation as a traveller and naturalist,
having already published a work — * ' A Narrative of Four Journeys into the
Country of the Hottentots and Caffraria in the years 1777-8-9," dedicated to
Sir Joseph Banks. He had ample opportunities during two decades for
collecting in Australasia. Besides various journeys in New South Wales, he
commanded the settlement at Norfolk Island and founded that at Port
Dalrymple in Tasmania. An affluent of the Hunter Eiver is named in his
honour, and Robert Brown dedicated the genus Patersonia to him. He
appears to have corresponded with Lamarck, for two Australian shells are
acknowledged — Corbnla tailensis, from a M. Patersoon ; and Buccinum
hrasilkumm, from Madame Paterson.
