Jennings (J. L. Boorman; October, 1901). A new locality for
a rare plant. According to the collector it is a shrub about 6 to
8 feet high, with large blue flowers (not purplish as described in
Moore and Betche's 'Handbook of the Flora of New South Wales,'
from old specimens), growing on dry ridges amongst boulders,
about half a mile from the Queensland border.
The gQiiu^ Kei-audrenia \^ confined to Australia with the excep-
tion of a single species which occurs in Madagascar. This
Madagascar plant is, according to Mueller's 'Census,' identical
with K. Hillii. It seems extraordinary that a rather local
Australian plant should recur alone in Madagascar, but we have
no means of verifying Mueller's statement. We observe (Proc.
Linn. Soc. xx., 104) that Madagascar also possesses one species
of RuUngia (also a Sterculiaceous genus), all the other Rulingias
being natives of Australia.

The specimens collected by Mr. Forsyth in the Warrumbungle
Ranges diifer from Bentham's description of A. mollis, made from
specimens collected by Eraser more than half a century previously
in the same locality (called Arbuthnot Range at that time), in the
lobed ovarium and in the long pedicels. The discrepancy in the
