spengleri, Chemnitz, has rightly been maintained a good species
by Smith (32). Its affinities are with L. labiosum.
"Triton speciosus," Angas.
(Text fig. 3.)
This species is, as Tryon suspected,
a Troplion. I give figures of its oper-
culum and dentition.
LOTORIUM CLANDESTINUM, Chcmn.
This species would be best trans-
ferred to Apollon.
LoTORiUM cosTATUM, Born.
The complicated synonymy of this
species is dealt with at length by
Watson (39). Some of the synonyms
Fig. 3.
Tritoniiim speciosum, Angas.
might advantageously be retained for varieties.
LOTORIUM NODOCOSTATUM, Tate ife May.
(Text fig. 4.)
From the material above referred to I have
drawn the accompanying sketch. From this
it will be seen that New South Wales specimens
'f/^ have a longer canal than the southern form,
unless the description and figure of the species
were drawn from a mutilated specimen. The
co-type lent me by Mr. May has the canal
broken short oif, and is, therefore, of no
assistance on this point.
The length of canal w^ould seem to exclude
the species from the group in which I have
placed it, but the tout ensemble is that of this group.
