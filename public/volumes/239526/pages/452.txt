In the early mammals the condition was probably very similar
to that of the Theriodonts, and this condition is still retained in
a few mammals {Ornithorhynclmis, Miniopterus). In the large
majority of recent mammals the small prevomers have been
replaced by the palatine processes of the premaxillaries.
The principal modifications of the vomer and prevomer will be
