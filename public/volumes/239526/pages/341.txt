DESCRIPTIONS OF SOME NEW ARANEID^ OF NEW
SOUTH WALES. No. 10.
By W. J. Rainbow, F.L.S., F.E.S.
(Entomologist to the Australian Museum.)
Plate xviii.
The present paper contains descriptions of three apparently-
new species, viz., one Storena, one Araneus, and one Stephanopsis.
A species of Celcenia, probably distincta, O. P. Camb., is also
described.
Family ZODARIID^.
Subfamily ZODARIIN.aE.
Simon divides this subfamily into five sections, viz., Hermippese,
Storene{«, Trygetinse, Suffuciese, and Zodariese. The first of these
embraces only one species — Hermippus loricahis, E. Sim. — and
this is only known from Central Africa; the second includes four
genera : Lachea, Thor. ; Storenosoma, Hogg ; Storena, Walck. ;
and Lufica, G. Marx;* this is the only group in the Zodariinse
that is represented in Australia, and this, again, by two genera
— Storenosoma and Storena. The latter, which is one of thej
most polymorphous, has a wide range, occurring, according to|
Simon, in the " Regio mediterranea occid. et orient.; Afric. trop.;
Indo-China; Malaisia; N. Guinea, N. Hollandia, N. Caledonia etj
Polynesia; Amer. septentr. sequator. et australis."
Storena appears to be more numerous in species in Australia]
than elsewhere, fifteen having been previously recorded, and'
all from the mainland. S.Jormosa, L. Koch, which was originally
recorded from Bowen, and which is not uncommon around Sydney,
occurs also in Tasmania.
