216 ON EUCALYPTUS BAUERIANA, SCHAUER,
5. E. conica, Deane and Maiden (these Proceedings, 1899, 612).
— Although different enough at first sight, this is indubitably,
in my opinion, the western or narrow-leaved form of B. Baueriana^
but it insensibly connects with the typical species found on the
coast. The type-species has also more glaucous leaves than the
interior form. This interior form might be known under the
name of var. conica.
6. E. Fletcheri, R. T. Baker (these Proceedings, 1900, 682).—
This is absolutely typical for E. Baueriana^ Schauer.
Affinities.
{a). With E. polyanthemos. — That it is liable to be confused
with this species is evident when it is borne in mind that eminent
botanists have confounded them. Following are some points in
which they differ : —
(1) The bark of E. Baueriana is fibrous, " fuzzy," or woolly;
that of E. polyanthemos being ribbony rather than box-like.
(2) The wood of E. Baueriana is pale brown, and that of E.
polyanthemos red.
(3) The leaves of E. Baueriana are thinner, and the rim of the
fruit likewise thinner than that of E. polyanthemos.
(b). With E. hemiphloia. — The fruits of this species are sub-
cylindrical, not conical as is the case with E. Baueriana. The
western form of E. Baueriana is more likely to be confused with
the western form of E. hemiphloia (var. microcarpa, Maiden),
than are the coast forms. E. hemiphloia has the true box-bark.
The timber of E. hemiphloia is paler than that of E. Baueriana.
(c). With E. largijlorens, F.v.M. — The two species are con-
fused in some herbaria. E. largijlorens is a western species, and
can only be confused wdth the western form of E. Baueriana.
But their fruits will readily separate them; the timber of E.
largijlorens is red. Both species have subfibrous ('"box") bark.
