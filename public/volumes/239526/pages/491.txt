The Thiphop.id.e of New South Wales.
Investigation proves that the well known name of Triforis can
no longer be used at the current valuation If maintained at all,
it must be restricted to a minor group typified by the eocene
fossil, T. plicata, Deshayes.
It has been generally understood (for example, by Fischer,
Man. de Conch., 1884, p. 678) that the genus in question was
first proposed in 1824 as Triforis by Deshayes in ' Descrip.
Coquilles Fossiles des Environs de Paris ' (ii. p. 429). Though
the title-page of this volume is dated "1824," the notice in ques-
tion did not appear till much later. Thus Menke, writing in
1830, knew nothing of " Triforis,''^ and failed to include the name
in his ' Synopsis Methodica Molluscorum.' Xewton states* that
pages 427 to 498 of Deshayes' work were issued in 1834. This,
then, is the date to be assigned to '^Triforis" of Deshayes.
There are vague hints in literature that Basterot referred to
^^Tri/oris" in 1825. A paper by Basterot is contained in the first
volume of the Memoires Soc. Hist. Nat. Paris (1825, pp. 1-100).
This I have been unable to consult, but since no one has claimed
that Basterot established the genus, I shall presume that the
reference was a mere allusion, not of s3'stematic importance.
Blainville mentioned the genus (Man. de Malac. i., 1825, p. 404)
as a division of Cerithium under the French popular names
" Triphore ou Tristome." Certain authors have wrongly received
this as a Latin generic name Tristoma, which, however, would
fall before Cuvier's Tristoma (1817).
Later Blainville regularly characterised the genus under the
name Triphora (Diet. Sci. Nat. Iv., 1828, p. 344) with T. gemma-
turn, Blainville ( = T. tristoma, Blainville) as type. This name
Triphora was noted in the following year by Menke, and in the
year after by Rang.
Later Deshayes published, in 1832, the name Trlphoris (Encyc.
Meth. ii., p. 1053). Finally, as alread}^ stated, Deshaj^es described
Triforis in 1834.
