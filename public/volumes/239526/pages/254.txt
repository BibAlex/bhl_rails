J". Upperside silvery-blue with a faint black edging; the
blue has a slight purplish tint which distinguishes it from the
males of the two following species. The apex also is more acute
and the outer margin straighter.
Underside grey. Forewing with cell crossed by five white
transverse bars; the first small basal, between the second and
third darker grey, between the fourth and fifth almost black and
a dark bar external to cell. The dark discal band straight, from
costa to first median nervule; a dark submarginal band. Hind-
wing with several irregular brown spots surrounded with darker
brown and dark brown submarginal sufiusions.
The male may be distinguished from the males of the two
following species by the totally different shade of blue, the very
small brown margins, the more acute apex to the forewing; and
on the underside the discal band is straight, nor can I find any
trace of blue in the cell as is found in the males of both the other
species. The specimen referred to this species by Miskin"^ is in
reality the male of 0. heivitsoni.
2' Upperside. Foreiving silvery-blue, costal margin brown,
widening beyond the cell, apex and outer margin broadly brown,
a dark bar at end of cell and costa near apex marked with two
white splashes; the apex is acute and outer margin nearly straight
as in male. Hindiving silvery-blue, with brown outer margin,
narrowest at the terminations of the veins, fringes white.
U n d e r s i d e as in male, but the white bars of the cell are
often bordered with silvery-blue. This may be distinguished from
the females of the two following species by the absence of scarlet
in the cell and the straight discal band of the underside. The
upperside is almost identical with that of the female of 0.
