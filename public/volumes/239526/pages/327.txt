466 NOTES ON PROSOBRANCHIATA,
pressed too far, for Tate (35) has shown that man}'- of the species
now inhabiting the tidal zone also occur in these beds. The
tabulation of these relationships would be productive of interest-
ing results.
The protoconchs of Lotoriurti p^'otensutn and ahhotti are similar
to those of the Fusion, the elongate, fusiforme shape of the latter
also recalling that family. It is from this group that I would
suggest the genus Lotoriurti is descended.
A prominent character of all the apices examined is their spiral
sculpture. This, it is interesting to find, exists in two recent
species {L. nodocostatum and L. philomelce)* and is sometimes
found on the corneous originals of other species. On a superficial,
or first examination, the student is apparently presented with two
or three different types of apex. A closer study discloses the
fact that they are morphologically only varieties of one form.
The difference lies in the size of the nucleus, and the extent of
its depression or elevation. A study of the apices in profile gives
the first impression, whilst this view studied in conjunction with
the view from above, proves the correctness of my conclusion.
The following are the apices studied; like those of the recent
species they have been arranged in a graduation; that from the
very eccentric protoconch of L. looodsi to the normal ones of
oligostirum and tortirostris. These two being normal they have
not been figured from above : â€”
