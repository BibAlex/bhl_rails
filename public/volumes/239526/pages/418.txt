NOTES AXD EXHIBITS.
Mr. W. S. Dun exhibited specimens of Conularia inornata,
Dana, 0. Icevigata, Dana, and C. tasvianiensis, Johnston (possibly
an acute form of inornata) from the Lower Marine Beds (Permo-
Carboniferous) of Ravensfield and Harper's Hill, iST.S.W. An
imperfect specimen of C. inornata 21 cm. in length was shown;
a smaller specimen of the same species showed the inbent and
triangular apex of the sides very clearly. The genus is but
seldom met with in the Upper Marine, but is not rare in the
Lower Series.
Mr. Hedley exhibited a series of mollusca lately dredged in
100 fathoms off WoUongong by Mr. Halligan and himself,
including Lotorium nodocostatum, hitherto only known from
Tasmania, Chlamys Jenesirata, Hedley, doubtfully distinct from
a Tertiary fossil, and a species of Dymia lately described by himself
in the " Thetis " Report.
Mr. Stead showed a preparation of the first and only English
Lobster {Homarus vulgaris) to reach Australian shores alive. It
arrived with the shipment of English Plaice recently introduced,
but it did not rally from the effects of the voyage, and died a few
hours after removal to Port Hacking. As it was an ovigerous
female this was to be regretted.
Mr. R. Greig Smith exhibited a young specimen of the Sock-
eyed Salmon affected with Saprolegnia ferax, forwarded to him
from Tasmania. Also various cultures, chemical products, and
microscopic preparations in illustration of his paper on Wattle
gums.
Mr. Baker exhibited a specimen of Ardisia raceinosa, n.sp., in
illustration of his paper. He also offered some observations on the
desirability of collecting data relating to the effects of the present
