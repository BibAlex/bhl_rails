ON TWO REMARKABLE SPOROCYSTS OCCURRINU
IN MYTILUS LATUS, ON THE COAST OF
NEW ZEALAND.
By Professor W. A. Haswell, M.A., D.Sc, F.R.S.
(Plates xix.-xx.)
The parasites which form the subject of the present communica-
tion were found by me last summer in specimens of a species of
Mytilus (M. latus) living on the coast of New Zealand. I am
greatly indebted to Dr. Chas. Chilton, Acting Professor of Biology
at Canterbury College, Christchurch, for subsequently procuring
and sending me a large consignment of live specimens of the
mussel.
The Spokocysts of an Echisostomum.
The Sporocysts, in which the Cercarise are developed, were
found in a fairly large proportion (about 10 per cent.) of the
mussels examined, and always in large numbers. They infest the
mantle-folds and the region immediately in front of the posterior
adductor muscle, and are most abundant in the gonads and
nephridia. In infected mussels this region of the body is coloured
bright red owing to the presence of hundreds of the Sporocysts,
which contain a conspicuous red substance to be referred to
below.
From the fact that such large numbers of the Sporocysts occur
together, it is to be inferred that they multiply actively in the
tissues of the mussel. This multiplication of Sporocysts takes
place not only by budding, or rather binary fission, but also,
though comparatively rarely, by a process corresponding to that
by which in many, if not most, Sporocysts Redia^ are developed.
