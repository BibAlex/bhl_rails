2Q STUDIES ON AUSTRALIAN MOLLUSCA,
The restoration of certain of Perry's names is required by the
rules of zoological nomenclature. After a careful examination of
Perry's 'Conchology,' and guided by the references of Deshaj'es and
others, I have compiled the following list of those Australian
shells which apparently were first described by Perry : â€”
Monoplex cornutiis, Perry (pi. iii., f. 1), takes priority over
Triton exai'atus, Reeve, 1844.
Monoplex formosus, Perry (pi. iii., f. 5), is recognised by
Deshayes (An. s. Vert, ix., p. 635) as a synonym of Triton
clavator, Lamarck, 1822 { = Mitrex clavator, Dillwjm, 1817).
Triton sinensis, Reeve, seems to me to be identical,
Biplex aust7'alasia, Perry (pi. iv., ff. 2, 4), is identified by
Deshayes (An. s. Vert, ix., p. 542) as Ranelia leucostonia,
Lamarck, 1822.
Biiplex perca^ Perry (pi. iv., f. 5) is given precedence by
Deshaj-es (An. s. Vert, ix., p. 556) over Ranelia jndchra, 8owerby,
1844.
Biplex rubicola, Perr}'- (pi. v., f. 5), is identified by Morch (Cat.
Yoldi Coll., 1852, p. 106) as Ranelia granifera, Lamarck, 1822.
Triplex frondosa, Perr}" (pi. vi., f. 1), is quoted by Brazier (Cat.
Murex, p. 60) as equivalent to Murex australis, Quoy tt Gaimard,
1832, and to M. pahniferus, Sowerby, 1840. He overlooked the
fact that Murex australis was preoccupied by Gmelin, 1790.
Triplex denudata, Perry (pi. vii., f. 2), seems to me to be tlie
same species. I recommend the use of Murex denudata, Perry.
Triplex flavicunda, Perry (pi. vi., f. 2), and T. I'ubicunda,
Perry (pi. vi., f. 2), are marked by Deshayes (An. s. Vert, ix.,
p. 574) as synonyms of Mnrex adnstus, Lamarck, 1822. Over
all these names Purpura scahra, Martyn (Univ. Conch. 1789,
pi. 113), has precedence.
Sei^ta parkinsonia, Perry (pi. xiv., f. 1), is obviously identical
with Triton fusiforme, Kiener, 1842.
Septa rubicunda, Perry (pi. xiv., f. 4), is Triton riodijerum,
Lamarck, 1822. Plates i.-ii. of Hunter's 'Historical Journal'
