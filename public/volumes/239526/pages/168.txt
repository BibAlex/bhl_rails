Mr. J. L. Boorman has collected it around Wallaiigarra, on the
New South Wales-Queensland border. He states that it is
abundant in the district, both on the New South Wales and
Queensland sides, so that another species is added to the Queens-
land flora.
The species thus has extensive range, and should be looked for
north of Gulgong and Merriwa, and east of Merriwa and Tenter-
field, wliile further localities should be found in Queensland.
