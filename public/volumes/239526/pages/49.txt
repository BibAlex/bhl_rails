44 THE OUMMOSIS OF THE SUGAR-CANE,
matters, from which we infer that these cannot be utilised. Of
the three sugars, levulose and saccharose are more easily assimi-
lated than dextrose.
The organism does not secrete invertase. This was shown by
the practical absence of invert sugar in the agar cultures. In
testing inversion fluid cultures are preferable, but as this bacteria
does not grow to anj^ extent in saccharose fluid media, an agar
culture had to be taken. The agar was melted and dissolved in
water, after which the solution was treated with basic lead
acetate, etc., as is customary in sugar determinations. Of the
saccharose in the tube originall}', onlj'' 3% had been inverted to
fruit sugar, a quantity which might easily have been produced
through the hydrolytic action of the small quantity of acid in the
medium.
The Most suitable Medium.
From these experiments we conclude that an excellent medium
for the growth of the bacterium and the production of gum would
have the following composition,: —
Peptone ... ... ... ... 0-5
Saccharose or levulose ... ... 5
Potassium phosphate ... ... 0*5
Agar 2-0
Tap water 100
Acidity of 10 c.c. =0*14 c.c. tenth-normal acid.
On this saccharose medium the bacteria grew most luxuriantly
.at the optimum temperature (30°), and since the organisms
grow so well, we cannot doubt that similar conditions as regards
nutrition, acidity, and temperature favour the development in
diseased canes.
