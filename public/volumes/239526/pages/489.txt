604 STUDIES ON AUSTRALIAN MOLLUSCA,
found a specimen (15/vi./02) in a stranded bottle on the rocks
at Middle Head.

This species has never been tigured. My illustration is based
on authentic material obtained by Brazier in the Lane Cove.
Helix subangulata, Pfeiffer.
Those interested in the land shells of Tasmania have for long
been troubled by two large and conspicuous land shells falsely
ascribed to their fauna by Pfeiffer.^ These are Helix bi sulcata and
H. subangulata. The former of these, as Mr. Brazier has sug-
gested to me, is evidently Rhytida be r audi, Gassies.f from JST.E.
New Caledonia.
To the kindness of Mr. J. Ponsonby, of London, lam indebted
for a solution of the second puzzle. At my request he and Mr.
E. A. Smith searched for Pfeiffer's type of H. subangulata and
succeeded in identifying it as the 3^ouug of Flanispira zonalis,
Ferussac, from Halmaheira. Mr. Smith regards this determina-
tion as beyond doubt. This Moluccan species can, therefore, be
erased from future Tasmanian lists.

As the figure quoted is inexact, I supph' another from authentic
material kindly lent by Dr. Cox. The specimen drawn is 6 mm.
major diam., 5-1 mm. minor diam., height 3-3 mm.
