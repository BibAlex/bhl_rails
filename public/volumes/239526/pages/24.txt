with Tate and May^ that it is a Fossarus. It seems to me a
larval shell of the Siimsigera form.
Crossea gatliffi, n.sp.
(Plate ii., fig. 25.)
Shell small, thin, globose-conical, spire elevated, gradate, basal
funicle slightly developed. Colour white C? bleached). Whorls
four. Sculpture : last whorl with fine, close spiral threads of
which every fourth is larger; at irregular intervals incipient
varices traverse the whorl; on the penultimate whorl the spiral
sculpture is more coarse and distant. Umbilicus narrow, bordered
by a slight rib, which continuing to the anterior extremity is
there notched by the pseudocanal. Aperture oval, outer lip thin
and everted. Height 1-16, major diam. 1-1, minor diam. 094 mm.
Hah. — With C. blconica: one specimen.
Type.— To be presented to the Australian Museum.
This species is named in honour of m}^ friend Mr. J. H. Gatliff,
of Melbourne. The thin shell, lack of longitudinal sculpture,
tabulated whorls, and feeble basal funicule distinguish it. C.
striata^ perhaps its nearest all}-, is much larger, with conspicuous
reticulate sculpture and a double umbilical rib.
Teinostoma involuta, n.sp.
(Plate iii., fig. 35.)
Shell small, solid, globose, spire slightly exserted, umbilicus
broad and deep. Whorls 3^, divided by a deeply channelled
suture, rapidly increasing, last whorl broadening and descending
at the aperture. Sculpture : first whorl smooth, the rest carrying
a row of tubercles along the crown and basal edge, on the last
whorl about twenty above and fifteen below. The intervening-
space is obliquely traversed by fine, close irregularly waved riblets,
narrower than their smooth interstices; these may fork or end
abruptly, but at either end of their course usually unite in bundles
of twos or threes to form the upper or lower tubercle. Their
