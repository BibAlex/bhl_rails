THE GUMMOSIS OF THE SUGAR-CANE,
The Conditions of Gum-Formation.
Having proved the relationship of the gum to the bacterium,
there remained the determination of the conditions under which
the gum is formed. The slime had been first obtained in
quantity by growing the bacteria upon cane-juice agar, i.e., a
solution of 4% of agar added to an equal volume of neutralised
cane-juice; and although the growth was very good, yet there
appeared to be room for improvement. The best medium is
undoubtedly very faintly acid cane-juice gelatine, but, unfor-
tunately, this cannot be employed when the slime is wanted for
chemical investigation, because the medium is slowh^ liquefied.
The first experiment was made upon cane-juice agar, and had for
its object the question of the improvement of the agar by peptone
and, incidentally, the eflfect of a temperature of 30° as against
22° C. Previous tests had shown that no growth occurred at
37°. In this and the following experiments the numbers
indicate the order of merit of the cultures at the time of observa-
tion ; 1 being the most luxuriant growth, 2 the next best, and
so on.

This experiment showed that more slime was formed when the
cane-agar contained 1% of peptone, and when the culture was
incubated at 30°. There, however, is the doubt that 1% peptone
is too much, and to test this point various quantities of a 10%
peptone solution were added to 10 c.c. portions of a faintl}^ acid
medium containing glucose 10%, sodium phosphate 0-2%,
potassium chloride 0-5%, agar 2%, and the bacteria were inocu-
lated upon the sloped surface of the portions. Cane-agar was not
used on account of the unknown nature of the constituents.
