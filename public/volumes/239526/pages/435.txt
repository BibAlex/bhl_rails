6.— ON EUCALYPTUS BICOLOR, A. Cunn.*
By J. H. Maiden.
E. bicolor, A. Cunn., was first alluded to in a published work
in the following passage : —
" E. hicoloi\ A. Cunn., MS., a species closely allied to E.
hcemastoma, Sm., but the marginal nerve is not so close to the
edge of the leaf (this is the ' Bastard Box ' of the carpenters) "
(Hooker in Mitchell's ' Journ. Trop. Australia,' 390, 1848). I
hardly think this can be taken, by itself, as an adequate descrip-
tion for purposes of priority.
I have, however, examined the following specimens, and it
becomes a matter for consideration as to how far herbarium labels
shall be taken as evidence of publication. I have seen all the
specimens, and as regards those in Cunningham's handwriting, it
may be pointed out that he died in 1839 : —
1. " Eucalyptus bicolor" in A. Cunningham's handwriting and
bearing the label "New Holland, A. Cunningham, Hooker, 1835."
This specimen was given b}^ Sir William Hooker to Bentham.
2. '' E. bicolor, 1846. Sub-tropical New Holland, Lieut.-Col.
Sir T. L. Mitchell."
The above are from Herb. Kew.
A second specimen from Herb. Melb. of No. 2 labelled " No. 446
of Nov. 1846."
There are two specimens on one sheet in Herb, Cant, ex herb.
Lindl, both from sub-tropical New Holland, Lieut. Col. Sir T. L.
Mitchell, and both labelled " E. bicolor, A. Cunn.," by Cunning-
ham himself. One label carries the additional information *'No.

A. Cunn.)." These Proceedings, 1899, 621.
