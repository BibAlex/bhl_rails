Comparing Chaudoir's note on ]\\ inridilimhatus with my note
on X. cyaneoclnclus, leaves but little doubt in m}' mind that these
two must be conspecific.
NoTOxoMUS DARLiNGi, Casteln.
Feronia (Pterostichus) darlingi, Casteln., Trans. Roy. Soc. Yict.
1868, viii. p. 216 ; N. darlings Chaud., Ann. Mus. Civ. Genova,
1874, vi. p. 591.
Unknown to me in nature, but the following features from
Chaudoir's note on it in his ' Supplement ' seem to thoroughly
differentiate it, and should render it easy of recognition. Much
resembles iV^. nitidicoUis, but the elytral striae are densely and
distinctly crenulate; head larger; prothorax a little less elongate,
wider anteriorly, more rounded on sides, which are similarly
sinuate before the base, basal angles equally sharp; elytra wider,
interstices more depressed, third similarly punctate, eighth not
so narrow. Head of an obscure copper colour, prothorax metallic-
violet, elytra obscure violet, with the two lateral interstices and
the marginal channel of a shining coppery-purple-violet. Length
15 J lines.

NoTONOMUS SUBOPACUS, Chaudoir.
Ann. Mus. Civ. Genova, 1874, vi. p. 586.
Elongate. Upper surface of a dark bronze colour; head black
with slight bronzy reflections; prothorax metallic; elytra rather
nitid in ^, opaque and darker in 9.
Head rather large, wide (2 -7 mm. across eyes), a little con-
stricted on each side behind eyes ; front depressed, faintly
biimpressed. Prothorax a little broader than long(315 x 3'6mm.),
widest before middle, not ampliate at widest part, of equal width
at base and apex (2-6 mm.); disc lightly transversely striolate;
sides lightly arcuate, lightly narrowed to apex, lightly narrowed
to base in an even curve without any sinuosity; anterior angles
obtuse, not prominent; base emarginate in middle; basal angles
