Some little time ago Mr. Hedley drew my attention to the fact
that the description given by Dunker under the above name could
not apply to Lotorium bassi, Angas, as
stated bySchmeltz,"^ Tryon and others. It
subsequently occurred to me that the
diagnosis described Tate's Sipko (?) minieti-
cus. Thanks to the courtesy of Dr. Verco,
who has very kindly sent me specimens
^ . , , -Tk 1 to study, I am enabled to oive the follow-
L. Jraterculum, Dunker. . •" °
ing note on the subject : —
The specimens do not harmonise perfectly with Dunker's
description, his statement that his specimens had a short canal,
in particular disagreeing. The description is, however, fairly
detailed, and, but for this, applies to the examples before me, the
measurements and proportions fitting exactly. Mr. Hedley agrees
with me that, on the whole, the species had best be known under
Dunker's name. It is a true Lotorium, though it cannot be
referred to any of my groups, and has a faint resemblance to the
parkinsonianum-gvow'^, but from these its rather long canal
separates it.
This species has a most striking resemblance to Stre2jtosip>hou
porphyrostoma, Ad. & Rve.f The apex also bears no little
resemblance to that of the family to which Streptosiphon belongs.
The dentition, however, shows the species to belong to Lotorium.
