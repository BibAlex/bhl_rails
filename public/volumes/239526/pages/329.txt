470 NOTES ON PROSOBRANCHIATA,
LoTORiuM TORTiROSTRis, Tate, sp.
(Plato xvii., fig. 8.)
Triton tortirostris, Tate, op. cit. p. 123, pi. v., f. 7.
Apex normal, of three whorls, polished, nucleus very slightly
depressed, the anterior whorl ornamented by a median spiral
ridge, and a very slight thread midway between this and the
posterior suture, transversely obliquely striate, defined by the
acquisition of the adult sculpture.
Compare with this the description of the protoconch of L.
parkinsonianum, Perry.
LOTORIUM TEXTILE, Tate, sp.
(Plate xvii., fig. 9.)
Tritort textilis, Tate, op. cit. p. 120, pi. v., f. 12.
" Apex acute of three rounded Urate whorls, ending in an acute
upward-curved point."
The above is Tate's description; none of the specimens I have
examined possess perfect protoconchs. The sculpture on the
anterior whorl of the specimen figured consists of six revolving
threads and rather distant fine growth-strise. This apex is not
clearly defined; its termination seems to be indicated by a slight
transverse swelling (an aberrant varix ?), and the ending of the
polished surface. Judging from the material to hand it seems
probable that Tate counted from the first varix.
The apex has rightly been considered a feature of systematic
importance by most recent writers. Unless, as is evident we
should do, we regard all the apices here discussed as varieties of
one generic type, the division of this group will present some
extraordinary anomalies. If the group is to be split up into
various genera it will be impossible to disregard the form of the
apices, now that we know so much about them ; and we shall
have such dissimilar species as L. costatum, Born, and L. cornutum,
Perry, in the same genus, and species so absolutely alike as L.
