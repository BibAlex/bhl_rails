608 STUDIES ON AUSTRALIAN MOLLUSCA,
rected by those having access to the types, or to go by guess, is
the dilemma of the student of our Triphora. Electing the latter
course, I note that some of Adams' species were reported with
corroborative detail as from Sydne3^ Assuming that these
species are contained in the large collection before me, I have
applied his names to the species which best fit the descriptions.
The material dealt with was gathered around Sydney by the
late Mrs. Starkey, Messrs. J. Brazier, H. L. Kesteven and mj^self.
I have to gratefullj^ acknowledge kind assistance from Dr. J.
C. Yerco, Mr. A. Morton and the Rev. H. D. Atkinson.
This opportunity is taken of adding that the shell I described
from Funafuti as Triforis torquatus, Hedley, is probably identical
with the prior T. ustidatus, Hervier, (Journ. de Conch, xlvi., 1898,
p. 298, pi. xvii., f. 4), whose memoir did not reach me till my
account had appeared.
Triphora regina, n.sp.
(Plate xxxii., fig. 21.)
Shell narrowly conical, solid. Colour white, a narrow orange
line along the lowest gemmule row of each whorl and an orange
tip to the canal. Whorls about twelve. Sculpture : on the base
are three simple keels, on the last whorl three equal sized
gemmule rows, of which the median diminishes on the penulti-
mate and gradually fades away as it ascends the spire. Length
5 mm., breadth 1*5 mm.
Hah. — Balmoral Beach, Middle Harbour; one specimen (self).
Type. — To be presented to the Australian Museum.
I venture to describe this species from a single specimen,
mutilated at each extremity, because the orange thread on each
whorl will render possible the recognition of any fragment. The
contour and sculpture are also sufficiently distinct from any
species known from this coast.
Triphora innotabilis, n.sp.
(Plate xxxii., figs. 23, 24, 25.)
Shell small, slender and very narrow. Colour brown, gem mules
dull white. Whorls ten, plus a five-whorled protoconch. Sculp-
