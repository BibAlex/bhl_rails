at the ends of the branclilets, entire, linear-terete, on short
petioles, erect, slender but rigid, pungent-pointed, closely refracted
along the margins, doubly grooved beneath. Racemes very short,
almost umbel-like, axillary or terminal; rhachis densely invested
with appressed white silky hairlets. Flowers comparativel}' large,

characters. The foliage is not unlike that of some forms of G
nematojihyUa, F.v.M.
