474 NOTES ON PROSOBRANCHIATA,
Group of L. tritonis.
L. tritonisj Linn. L. ovoideum, Tate.
L. rubicundum, Perry. L. variegatum, Lamk.
L. saulice, Reeve. Z. australe, Lamk.
L. bassi, An gas.
The following species are not conveniently referable to any of
the above groups : â€”
L. subdistorlicm, Lamk. L. tumulosum, Tate.
L. cyphus, Tate. L. protensum, Tate.
L. clandestinum, Lamk.f L. fraterculum, Dkr.
Species incertse sedis.
L. gramdatum, Dunker. L. contabulatum, Anton.
L. birostoinum, A. Ad. L. tringa, A. Ad.
L. papillosum, A. Ad. L. nodoliratum, A. Ad.
L. dorsuosujii, A. Ad.
This arrangement, which is similar to that adopted by Pilsbry
for the species of the various genera of Helices (28), and Simpson
for the Naiades (31), has advantages possessed by no previous
arrangement of the genus. None of the sectional names are
([uotable, and are, therefore, not additions to an already over-
burdened nomenclature. As the}'- consist of essentially similar
species a reference to one of these groups should at once convey
to the reader a tangible type; they should, on that account, be
of service to the specialist and to the general conchologist when
describing new forms. A monograph arranged in this way should
greatl}'- facilitate identifications. Since I have worked to some
extent from figures and descriptions only, some of m}'- groups
may contain species which break their uniformity.
Miscellaneous Notes.
Wliile at work on this paper I have made miscellaneous notes
of interest, and arrived at conclusions at variance with Tryon's
t Vide post, p. 479.
