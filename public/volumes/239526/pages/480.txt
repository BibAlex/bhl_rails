NOTES AND EXHIBITS. 593
Eucalypts do not sucker at all. The term " sucker " as used in
Australia is a colloquialism applied to adventitious growths from
stems and branches of Eucalypts.
Mr. Cambage exhibited herbarium and timber specimens in
illustration of his paper. He also showed fruiting branches of
the form of Pitto>^porum undulatum, Yent., which bears flowers
with long stamens, from AVaratah and Burwood. In the neigh-
bourhood of Sydney, however, it is quite a common occurrence to
find the species in a dio3cious condition, only the form with rudi-
mentary stamens setting any fruits.
Mr. Maiden exhibited a type specimen of Eucalyptus hicolor,
A. Cunn., which was originally presented by Cunningham to Sir
W. J. Hooker and presented by Sir William Thiselton Dyer to
the exhibitor. He also showed a drawing of a properly authen-
ticated type specimen of E. polyanthemos, Schauer, from the her-
barium of the University of Cambridge. Also a specimen of
Distegia Ledehouri% Greene, from California, belonging to an
anomalous genus of the Compositse.
