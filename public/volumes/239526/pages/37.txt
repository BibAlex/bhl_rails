28 STUDIES OX AUSTRALIAN MOLLUSCA,
Lamarck, 1822. But it seems to me to be a variety of Fasciolaria
fusiformis, Valenciennes (1840), whose name it should replace.
Pleurotoma acuta, Perry (pi. li\'., f. 5), is quoted by Deshayes
(An. s. Vert, ix., p. 352) as equivalent to Pleurotoma tigrina,
Lamarck (1822).
Tellina aurea, Perry (pi Iv , f. 2) is evidently T. vulsella,
Chemnitz, = T. rostrata of other authors than Linne, not T.
{Phylloda) aurea, Schumacher (1817). Since by Hanley's showing
(Ips. Linn. Conch., p. 38) the Linnean name has been generally
misapplied, and that of Chemnitz was not binomial. Perry's name
should be utilised. I collected this species at Dunk Island,
Queensland, last year.
Venues disjecta, Perry (pi. Ivii., f. 3), is beyond doubt identical
with Venus lamellata, Lamarck (1818). This name of Lamarck's
was preoccupied by Linne (1767). The species should be quoted
as Chione disjecta, Perry.
