whorl sculptured with two or three spiral threads, and very fine
transverse striae. This apex is absolutely undefined. I agree
with Tate in considering its termination to be a little anterior
to the first appearance of sculpture.
LoTORiuM CYPRUS, Tate, sp.
(Plate xvii., fig. 6.)
Triton cyphus, Tate, op. cit. p. 119, pi. v., f. 11.
Apex of one and one-half whorls, polished; nucleus slightly
mammillate, but placed centrally; the anterior whorl sculptured by
a distinct median and two postero-median spiral threads, and by
transverse growth-striae.
This protoconch is defined by the acquisition of the numerous
spiral lirse with which the adult shell is ornamented.
LOTORIUM ANNECTANS, Tate, Sp.
Triton annectans, Tate, op. cit. p. 121, pi. v., f. 3.
" The protoconch of this species is similar to that of L. torti-
rostris in being somewhat elevated, roundly turbinate, and spirally
striated; it is composed of three and one-half to four whorls, and
the striae, which are four in number, equidistant and very pro-
nounced, decrease in size on being traced backwards; the top of
the larval shell is extremely minute and central " (Harris, I.e.,
p. 192, pi. vi., f. 7).
LoTORiuM OLiGOSTiRUM, Tate, sp.
(Plate xvii., fig. 7.)
Triton oligostirus, Tate, op. cit. p. 126, pi. vi., f. 7.
Apex normal, of three polished whorls, nucleus slightly de-
pressed, first two whorls smooth, thence an ornamentation of four
spiral threads and oblique growth-striae is gradually developed.
At the termination of the embryonic shell the structure changes
completely.
Compare with this Watson's description of the apex of Lotorium
