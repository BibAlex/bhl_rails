374 AUSTRALIAN FUNGI,
Ardmona, Vic. (Robinson, 284); very common, on both surfaces
of the leaf-blades but mostly on outer or lower, and sheaths of
Danthonia penicillata, F.v.M., Sept. 1899, and May, 1902.
This is a true and destructive parasite, causing the leaves to
become dried up and brittle. The black elongated pustules
arranged in lines give the appearance of 'black rust' and the
aeneral resemblance to a rust is heightened by the occurrence of
ruddy spots, which is characteristic at the commencement of the
development of perithecia. While Z>. penicillata was severely
attacked, other species adjacent were quite free.
2. Camarosporium dolichi, n.sp.
Perithecia gregarious, erumpent, black, dark golden-brown b}'-
transmitted light, globose, membranaceous, with rotund papillate
mouth. Sporules olivaceous, oblong, 4-septate, muriform, with
median septum very distinct; 16 x 9 /x.
Armadale, near Melbourne, Vic; on leaflets of Dolichos lablab,
L.; July, 1901.
3. Camarosporium nigricans, n.sp.
Perithecia very minute, globose, black and golden-brown by
transmitted light, numerous, membranaceous, seated superficially
on mycelial threads, no apical pore observed, 50-57 /x diam.
Sporules olivaceous to golden-brown, elliptical, generally 3-septate
and constricted at septa, with occasionally 1-2 longitudinal septa,
13-15 X 61 /x.
Croydon, Vic; on apple twigs; June, 1902.
It differs from C. mali, Ell. &, Ev., in the much smaller
perithecia, and in the sporules not being 5-8 septate; the specific
name is indicative of the blackening of the twigs by the fungus.
4. Capnodium (?) CASUARiN^, n.sp.
Forming black, soot-like incrustations all over branches and
branchlets, not readily separating. Hyphse creeping, septate,
branching, fuliginous, firm, thick-walled. Cerato-pycnidia yellow-
ish-green to dirty green, very elongated, irregularly shaped.
