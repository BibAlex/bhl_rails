46 THE GUMMOSIS OF THE SUGAR-CANE.
Ordinary luitrletit-agar stroke. — A slow-growing thin, yellowish
white glistening stroke.
Glycerine niitrient-agar stroke. — A thin, broad, translucent
white, moist, glistening growth, with turbid condensed water.
The colour deepens to a primose-yellow.
Saccharose {lOy^Yj'yeptone {0'iy^)-agar. — A thin white fluid
growth, which gravitates into the condensed water, in which
there is a yelloAv sediment.
Potato. — A primrose-yellow, moist, glistening growth, some-
times raised and restricted, at other times flat, watery, and
spreading over the surface. Compared with agar or gelatine,
the growth is rapid.
Carrot. — A raised, slimy, yellow growth, at tirst restricted, but
eventually covers the surface and gravitates.
Turnip. — As on carrot.
Sugar-cane. — No visible growth.
Nutrient houillon. — Slights turbid fluid, with faint indol re-
action.
Nitrate bouillon. — There is no reduction of the nitrate.
Siveet ivort. — No growth.
Cane-juice. — No growth.
Milk. — Unaltered ; neutral reaction.
The Affinities of the Bacterium.
Since the organism does not form colonies on gelatine which
throw out processes from the margin, it is not jBact. gummis to
which Comes ascribes the gummosis of the vine. Bad. ajni, said
to produce a disease in celery, is larger, and grows more slowly
upon potato, but otherwise there are points of similarity in the
appearance of the colonies on gelatine, which, however, are
white as against the j'ellowish colour of Bact. vasculanim.
Basse's bacteria produce gas in glucose media, and otherwise
differ. Bact. tracheiphilus, a bacterium which causes the wilting
of some of the C^icurbitacece by plugging the vessels, differs in
colour (white), and by forming very ropy cultures in fluid media,
especially when old. Arthur and Golden have described Bact.
