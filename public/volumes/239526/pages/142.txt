swinging coast south of the island backed up by lagoons and
lagoon-marsh meadows.
Criteria of the adolescent stage in coast formation appear to
be frequent, while maturity is still far away in point of time, as
is shown b}'' the presence of numerous irregularly shaped islands
and headlands with attendant unfilled lagoons, bays and harbours.
From a consideration of the plateau and coast features, there
appears to be no reason for assigning an age later than Pliocene,
possibly late Pliocene, for the movement of elevation which
carried the Tertiary and Cretaceous peneplains 3,000 feet above
their former positions and resulted in the formation of the canons
and upper valleys of the coastal area. The subsidence which
determined the present Barrier Reef may be referred to Pleisto-
cene times on topograjDhical grounds, while the latest epicycle or
vibration of coastal elevation may be referred to the historical
period.
