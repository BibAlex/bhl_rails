grow disease-resisting varieties, as has been previously recom-
mended, not only for gummosis, but for other diseases. In this
relation it may be mentioned that there are one or two well
known varieties which have never been known to develop gum-
mosis. The best known of these sound varieties is Tanna, a stout
heavy cane, hard in the rind and containing a high percentage of
fibre. The sugar content is, however, not so high as it is in some
of the varieties which are liable to gummosis. Fields which have
yielded badly diseased crops, have, when planted with Tanna,
produced perfectly sound canes.
In order to form a gum as it undoubtedly does, the bacterium
probably requires a carbohydrate, and although saccharose has
been employed and found exceedingly useful, yet it does not follow
that it is necessary, or that saccharose is the best carbohydrate.
Other sugars might give a better yield of gum. To test this
question, about half a gramme of various substances was added to
10 c.c. portions of a faintly acid medium containing peptone
0-5%, sodium phosphate 0*2%, potassium chloride 0*5%, agar 2%,
and after sterilisation of the tubes, the sloped surfaces were
inoculated and then incubated.

This experiment showed that either dextrose, levulose, or
saccharose are absolutely necessary for the free growth of the
organism and the production of gum. The bacteria did not
grow in the presence of the other sugars and carbonaceous
