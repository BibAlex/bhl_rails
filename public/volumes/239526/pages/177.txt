A GUM (LEVAN) BACTERIUM FROM A SACCHARINE
EXUDATE OF EUCALYPTUS STUART IAN A.
[Bacterium eucalyjHi, n.sp.)
By R. Greig Smith, M.Sc, Macleay Bacteriologist to the
Society.
(Plate xii.)
A sweet exudate from a species of Eucalyptus was upon exami-
nation found to contain a quantity of gum precipitable by alcohol,
and, as several gum-forming bacteria had been under investigation
in the Society's laboratory, the specimen was tested to see if the
gum could possibly have a microbic origin. Plates of saccharose-
gelatine* were infected in the usual manner, and upon these there
developed the dome-shaped colonies so characteristic of many
gum bacteria.
The exudate was a pale straw-coloured syrup, very similar in
appearance and consistency to honey or golden syrup, and had
fragments of bark, Eucalyptus capsules, etc., scattered throughout
the mass. When dissolved in water and separated from woody
debris, a portion contained : â€”
Non-reducing but hydrolysable sugarf calcu-
lated to saccharose ... ... ... 1*1 grm.
Reducing sugars ... ... ... ... 2-5 ,,
Crude gum ... ... ... ... ... 0*8 ,,
* Saccharose 10, peptone 0*25, potassium chloride 0"5, sodium phosphate
0*2, gelatine 10, water to 100. Acidity to phenolphthalein 10 c.c. =0'1 c.c.
tenth normal acid.
t This is probably raftinose, the sugar of Eucalyptus manna. The reducing
sugars probably consist of a mixture of levulose and melibiose.
