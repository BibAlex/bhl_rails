136 NEW GENERA AND SPECIES OF LEPIDOPTERA.
crimson; termen near apex ochreous-tinged; a few fuscous scales
at end of cell; three or four subterminal fuscous dots opposite
mid-termen; cilia brownish-ochreous, a fuscous dot at apex, at
tornus crimson, on inner margin whitish.
Brisbane, Q.; in March; one specimen at light (Central Rail-
way Station).
The bright crimson hindwings make this an exceptionally
distinct and brilliant species.
HyBL^A SYN.EMA, n.Sp.
Differs from Hyhlcea puera, Cram., as follows : â€” Size smaller,
26-30 mm. (as against 33-40 mm. in ^:>we?Yt). Antennae of male
slightly thickened, and with slightly projecting scales on upper
surface (in puern they are quite smooth). Forewings narrowei-;
markings brighter and clearer; usually with a conspicuous black
discal dot ; an outwardly curved oblique whitish fascia from
dorsum at ^, narrowing to a point at mid-disc; the oblique sub-
apical line preceded by a whitish suffusion. Hindwings with
spots yellowish, not or only slightly tinged with red.
I owe the discrimination of this species to Mr. F. P. Dodd,
who has bred both it and puera from the larvae. H. synoima is
extremely constant in the markings of the forewings; in puera
these vary much, but never have the whitish markings so well
developed. On comparing a long series of both species their
distinctness is evident, and if any doubt remained the structural
difference in the male antennae (though slight) w^ould be sufficient
to remove it. H. puera very frequently goes greasy; synoima does
not
Townsville, Q. ; in January and February; a series received
from Mr. F. P. Dodd.
The larvae of syncenia were found on Tecoma australis, and
were, I am informed, much darker on the dorsal surface than
those of puera which were found on Vitex trifolia.
