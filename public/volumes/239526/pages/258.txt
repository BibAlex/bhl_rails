This species was described from a specimen collected at Port
Stephens, N.S.W. It is not so common as the former species,
but specimens of it are to be found about Sydney in midsummer.
It differs from G. jndchellus in having the parallel markings on
the forewings much more defined and dai^ker, and only one black
irregularly rounded blotch near the tip of the hind wings. The
general colour is also much darker without any yellow markings.
In structure, size and form of wings there is very little difference,
except that the wings are a little more slender and pointed at the
tips.

1814.
This distinctive lace-wing was also figured and briefly described
in Griffith's ' Animal Kingdom ' (Insects, ii. 1832, pi. 105, p. 327).
I have a specimen collected at Grafton, Richmond River, that
agrees with the wing-markings of this last figure; but Dr. David
Sharp, Curator of the Cambridge Museum, to whom a duplicate
specimen was forwarded, thinks it is a distinct species. I have
examined several in the Macleay Museum, and find that the
black spots and markings are very variable; in the hindwings of
one specimen the wing on one side bears five spots and its fellow
only three.
Length of body 1|; expanse of wings 2^ inches.
Head, prothorax, centre of meso- and metathorax and thighs
rich reddish-orange; antennte, tibiee and tarsi black; eyes large,
hemispherical, projecting on the sides, slate-grey; remainder of
thorax and abdominal segments greyish-brown. Wings large,
hyaline; forewings ornamented with three parallel rows of black
spots, the first and second consisting of 9-10 and the third of two
