he then arrived at to keep the forms to which he referred under
E. polyanthe7nos was sound.
1. E. polyanthema, Schauer, var. glauca, R. T. Baker.
Mr. Baker does not under E. 'polyantheraos (p. 448) name a
variet}^, but at page 431 occurs the following passage: â€” ."The
most valued timber is perhaps ' Slaty Gum,' E. polyanthema var.
glauca, var.nov., and I consider it a distinct gain to the botany
of the colony to have the correct botanical sequence of this
valuable tree made clear."
Glaucousness being a character of the species, it seems to me
that to call one form glauca would be inconvenient and could not
be carried out in practice.
2. E. DaiDsoni, R. T. Baker, these Proceedings, xxiv. 295, 1899.
" Slaty Gum." Type localities, " Ridges on the Watershed of
the Goulburn River (R.T.B.) ; across the Main 'Divide' at
Cassilis, and north-west to Pilliga " (Professor Warren).
3. E. ovalifolia, R. T. Baker, these Proceedings, xxv. 680,
1900 (pa7^tim). .
" Red Box." Type localities given are Bathurst, Rylstone and
Camboon (R. T. Baker); Hargraves, Mudgee to Wellington (A.
A. Suttor); Gerogery (L. Mann).
Mr. Baker (loc. cit.) speaks of " the typical E. polyanthema,
Sch., of Victoria," but the type comes from Bathurst, N.S.W.,
like that of E. ovalifolia. See p. 533.
I am of opinion that some confusion has arisen in regard to
Mr. Baker's species. Some bud-bearing twigs kindly presented
by Mr. Baker are those of E. Baueriana, Schauer, var. conica,
Maiden (these Proceedings, 1902, p. 216), or rather one of those
intermediate forms which show that it is impossible to separate
E. Baueriana from its variety. Mr. Smith's report on the oil
(these Proceedings, xxv. 682) in which he says that " there is
very little difference in the constituents of this oil and that of E.
Fletcheri, Baker " i^E. Baueriana, Schauer), bears out my view.
