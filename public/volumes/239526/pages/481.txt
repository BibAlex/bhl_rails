Symplocos Baeuerleni, sp.nov.
A small, glabrous, delicate shrub, about 6 to 9 feet high.
Leaves ovate, acuminate, or lanceolate, terminating in a sharp
point, glabrous, pale on the underside, membranous or chartaceous,
irregularly toothed or entire, slightly shining on the upper surface,
about 2 inches long and under 9 lines wide ; principal veins
distant and more distinct on the underside, pale-coloured, slightly
oblique, not always parallel; petiole about 1 line long.
Flowers small, solitary in the axils or 3 to 5 in an exceedingly
short raceme; petiole slightly under a line long. Bracts few,
small, minutely hirsute. Calyx glabrous, lobes exceedingly short
and broad. Petals glabrous, imbricate, broad, about 1 line long.
Stamens united at the base of the petals, indefinite, numbering
from 20 or more. Pistil about as long as the stamens. Stigma
slightly bifurcated.
Fruit ovoid, bluish-black, under 4 lines long, 2 lines in diameter,
contracted at the top and crowned by the calyx lobes.
