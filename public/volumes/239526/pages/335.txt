476 NOTES ON PROSOBRANCHIATA,
** convergence of development " rather than a real affinity; for if
the species of this group have been evolved from ancestors orna-
mented with a complex sculpture, it was at an earlier period than
that at which L. parkinsonianum was evolved, since none of them
show any sign thereof on their early whorls. Further, two species
belonging typically to the tritonis-grow^ occur in Tertiary strata
— L. ovoideum, Tate, from Australian beds, and L. nodi/erum,
Lamk., which has been recorded from Mediterranean beds by
Hoernes and Auinger (is).
LoTORiUM PiLEARE, Linn.
For this species Linnaeus quoted figures of two species, and
described a third. Hanley (14) says his type, on which his
description was founded, was the Triton corrugatus of Lamarck,
and refers to Reeve's figure in the ' Conchologica Iconica' (pi. v.,
f. 15). The first of these three species to be recognised as distinct
was Lotorium costatum by Born in 1780. Lamarck, in dealing
with the species, unfortunately bestowed a new name on Linnaeus'
type, and retained the name pilearis for the species, which has
since been known under that name.
The principles of nomenclature, however, require that in
eliminating from an heterogeneous group, the name originally
bestowed thereon shall be retained for the type when that t3'pe
is available.
The synonymy of these two species will, therefore, stand thus : —
