14 STUDIES ON AUSTRALIAN 3I0LLUSCA,
<ippearance is suggestive of a continuous rib split into riblets for
most of its length but holding together at top and bottom.
Aperture very oblique, narrowly ovate, pointed above; peristome
double and massive, intruding a broad free lobe into the umbilicus,
and clinging to the umbilical edge with a lesser lobe. Umbilicus
broad, perspective smooth and excavated within the string of
beads which bounds it. Height 1'3, major diam. 1-34, minor
diam. 1*2 mm.
Hah. — Off Darnley Island, Torres Straits, in 10-30 fathoms;
one specimen (J. Brazier).
Type. — To be presented to the Australian Museum.
This species resembles certain forms of Liutia such as L. devexa^
Hedley, from the same region. The assignment of it to Teino-
stoma is governed by the umbilical tongue, a rather artificial
character. As I have previously indicated, outlying forms of
Liotia so approach some species of Teinostoynri that it is difficult
to allot to each its species.
Liotia corona, n.sp.
(Plate ii., figs. 21-23.)
Shell minute, discoid, not nacreous; spire sunken, umbilicus
wide and shallow. Whorls three, last half-whorl scarcely in con-
tact with the others, suddenly and deeply deflected. Colour
white C? bleached). Sculpture: last whorl ringed by 16 thick,
projecting, distant ribs which fade above and below at the sutures,
these ribs continuing on the suture for about half a whorl.
Interstices of the ribs faintly spirally scratched. Aperture very
oblique, circular, fortified by a varix. Height 028, major diam-
82, minor diam. 0*66 mm.
Hah. — With Crossea hiconica; four specimens.
Type. --To be presented to the Australian Museum.
Liotia incidata, n.sp.
(Plate ii., figs. 18-20.)
Shell depressedly globose, rather solid, perforate, flattened on
the base. Whorls three, margined at the suture, last slightly
