sideroxylon^ E. afflnis, E. Woollsiana, E. Camhagei (?), and E. tere-
ticornis var. dealhata.
E. sideroxylon, E. ajfinis, E. macrorhyncha, and trees which
appeared to be E. Camhagei were on a ridge between Frampton
and Bethun^ra.
Between Junee and Narrandera the following trees and shrubs
were seen from the train : — Sterculia divei^sifolia, Cassinia Theo-
do7'i, Exocarpus cuiyressiformis, Casuarina guadrivalvis, C. Lueh-
manni, C. C unninghamiana (only seen at Narrandera on the banks

A. pendida was only noticed in two localities, near Grong Grong^
where it is locally known as Boree. In going from Sydney on
the Southern line, this is the first place at which this species is
met with, while on the western line it is first seen from the train
near Narromine.

— E. meUiodora, E. Woollsiana (both continuing all the way), E.
tereticornis and v^ar. dealhata, E. hemiphloia var. alhens (not
noticed past Coolamon) and E. rostrata.

tereticornis and var. dealhata, E. conica (only in the northern
part), E. populifolia (not plentiful), E. dumosa, E. melliodora, E.

E. hemiphloia var. alhens, E. Camhagei, E. Bridgesiana and a few
trees of Ironbark-Box not definitely identified.

pendida, A. homalophylla, A. dealhata and the green variety, A.
hakeoides, A. doratoxylon, A. cardiophylla, A. Osivaldi, A. rigens^
