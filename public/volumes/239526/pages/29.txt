STUDIES ON AUSTKALIAX MOLLUSCA,
EuLiMELLA PULCHRA, Braziei'.
Exdimella imlchra, Brazier, P.L.S.N.8.W. (2), ix., 1894, p. 170,
pi. xiv., f. 6.
Eulimella tricincta, Tate, Trans. Roy. 8oc. S.A., xxii., 1898^
p. 83, pi. iv., f. 4.
Although I prepared both of the illustrations mentioned I did
not recognise that they ajDplied to one species. Brazier's example
was young. On re-examination of authentic material I can affirm
their identity.
CyclostrExMA porckllana, Tate k Ma3^
Tate cfe May, Trans. Roy. Soc. S.A. xxiv., 1900, p. 102.
Specimens of this were collected in Sj^dney Harbour b}^ Mr.
H. L. Kesteven, whose determination of them was confirmed by
Mr. W. L. May.
Marginella subbulbosa, Tate.
Tate, Trans. Roy. Soc. S.A., i., 1878, p. 86.
This species is a new record
for ]S^ew South Wales. Mr.
H. L. Kesteven, who drew my
attention to it, has kindly
prepared sketches for the
accompan3'ing figures of it
and M. stranger. Tate and
May latel}' united these, but
the outline sketches here
M. suhhitlhosd. |, resented will demonstrate the difi'erence and
validity of each.
Trophon goldsteini, Ten. Woods.
Ten. Woods, Proc. Roy. Soc. Tas. 1875, p. 136.
Mr. R. L. Cherry, in finding this shell on the beach at Catherine
Hill Bay, has added another species to the fauna of New South
Wales. "
