NOTONOMUS MACOYI, n.sp.
(J. Elongate-oval, conv^ex. Head moderate; prothorax broader
than long, narrowed to base; posterior angles marked, but wide :
elytra oval, strongly striate; humeral angles rounded; interstices
convex, third 4-punctate. Black; under surface piceous-black,
legs and antennse piceous-red.
Head rather large (4-1 mm. across eyes); frontal impressions
distinct, short, divergent backwards; e3^es protuberant, postocular
part of orbits large. Prothorax broader than long (4 x 4*7 mm.),
widest a little before middle, roundly narrowed to base; apex
(3-5 mm.) wider than base (3-2 mm.); sides lightly rounded, falling
on base in a gentle oblique curve; base narrow, emarginate in
middle; basal angles lightly marked, obtuse; posterior marginal
puncture placed on border at basal angles; lateral border narrow,
wider towards base, passing round basal angle on each side of
base: median line strongly impressed; lateral basal impressions
wide, deep, parallel, linear at bottom. Elytra oval (9x5-6 mm.),
convex; lateral apical sinuosities wide, but decided; basal border
joining lateral border without interruption; ninth stria and tenth
interstice well developed towards apex; interstices convex, not
carinate on apical declivity, eighth wider than ninth on basal
half, anterior puncture of third placed about basal fifth. Inter-
coxal declivity of prosternum narrow and rounded in middle; of
mesosternum very lightly and widely concave. Length 16-7,
breadth 5 -4-5 -6 mm.
Hah. â€” Vic. : Marys villa (Sloane).
In facies resembling N. kiyigi, Chaud., but differing by its more
transverse prothorax, third interstice of elytra 4-punctate, &c.
Two specimens {$) from the same locality are in my collection; one
has the prothorax more evenly and more lightly rounded on the
sides, and therefore less ampliate (3-9 x 4-5 mm.) than the type.
NOTONOMUS BESTI, n.Sp.
Elliptical-oval. Head rather small, eyes very prominent; pro-
thorax subquadrate, lightly narrowed to base; basal angles obtuse;
