518 ox EUCALYPTUS B [CO LOR, A. CUNN.,
Many of Sieber's names have been accepted from herbarium
labels only. Schauer adopted Cunningham's names and described
the plants, rectifying Cunningham's omission. It is etiquette not
to suppress a herbarium name when it is proved to be valid, and
in 1859 Mueller's act in fully describing E. bicolor, A. Cunn.,
shows that he had no wish to suppress Cunningham's name.
I therefore, after the most careful consideration, have decided
to follow Bentham in adopting the name £J. bicolor, A. Cunn.
(B, Fl. iii. 214). It is proper to state, however, that this is a case
in which, all evidence being available in regard to the two names
in question, it is not absolutely decisive in regard to the adoption
of either.

a. E. bicolor, Woolls (' Contrib. Flora of Australia,' 232); also
R. T. Baker.
In the WooUsian herbarium, which is m}' property, there is a
specimen in Dr. Woolls' handwriting bearing the following
label :—
" Yellow or Bastard Box. Half-barked when young, nearly
smooth when full grown. Hard wood. Height 120 feet. Cab-
ramatta. E. bicolor. ''
On another occasion Dr. Woolls labelled a similar specimen
from Cabramatta ''E. larcfi/lorens."
There is no question as to the identity of this tree, even if his
specimens did not make it quite clear. It is E. Bosistoana, F.v.M.,
is typical for the species, as determined by Mueller himself, and
the assumption that Woolls' determination of the tree as E. bicolor
was correct has given rise to the following ingenious mistakes.
(It will be shown that E. i^endxila is a nomen nudum).
