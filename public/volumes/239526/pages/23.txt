10 STUDIES ON AUSTRALIAN MOLLUSCA,
Pyrgulina perspectiva, n.sp.
(Plate iii., fig. 33.)
Shell small, solid, conical. Colour white. Whorls five, besides
a prostrate heterostrophe apex of three turns, flattened, separated
by a deeply channelled suture. Sculpture : the last whorl has
above a series of about twenty straight oblique bars, about their
own breadth apart, confluent at their lower margin but not on
the ujjper one, both margins sinuated by the projecting ends of
the bars. Below these bars is a deep groove succeeded by a
narrow peripheral rib. On the base are a few fine spiral threads
intersected b}^ growth-lines. The hollows between the bars are
crossed Ijy fine spiral threads. The series of oblique bars ascend
the spire ; the bars do not correspond across the suture.
Periphery of the two topmost whorls slightW constricted. Base
somewhat hollowed. Aperture broken in the specimen studied,
but a prominent tooth on the columella remains. Height 2 •2,
breadth 1-08 mm.
Hah. — With P. senex: one specimen.
Type to be presented to the Australian Museum.
From those that most resemble it, this species may be dis-
tinguished by the smaller size and striated interstices.
Pykgulina senex, n.sp.
(Plate iii., fig. 31.)
Shell small, solid, subcylindrical. Colour white. Whorls three
and a half, besides an elevated, median, heterostrophe apex of
two turns, shouldered abruptly and separated by a deeply
channelled suture. Sculpture : the last whorl has above two
spiral keels joined at intervals by about 14 short perpendicular
bars, beaded at. the points of intersection and enclosing square
meshes. Anterior to these are six widely spaced spiral keels,
gradually diminishing and approximating as they recede. One
plain and the two ornate keels ascend the spire Delicate
oblique growth-lines occur in the hollows of the prominent
