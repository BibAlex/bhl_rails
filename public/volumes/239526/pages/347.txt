492 DESCRIPTIONS OP SOME NEW ARANEIDiE OF N.S.W.
Sternum normal, yellowish, surrounded with a fringe of rather
long coarse hairs; the surface very finely granulated, and closely
clothed with short adpressed hairs.
Abdomen somewhat obovate, slightly overhanging base of
cephalothorax, moderately arched, yellowish-brown with dark
brown markings, the surface being finely tuberculated and granu-
lated; anterior extremity sinuous; at about one-third its length
from anterior extremity there are two large but shallow discular
depressions, and these are separated from each other by a space
equal to about once their individual diameter; at about the centre
there are two others, equally as large but wider apart, being
separated from each other by a space equal to twice their indi-
vidual diameter; sides yellowish, marked with dark wavy granu
lated lines; ventral surface much smoother, dark yellowish-grey,
and marked at the middle with two lines of punctures rather
widely separated; these commence just below the epigastric fold
and run in a tolerably straight line for two-thirds their distance,
and then converge inwards towards the spinnerets, but do not
meet; those near the spinnerets are much the closest together; in
addition to these there are a few smaller lateral punctures
scattered promiscuously.
