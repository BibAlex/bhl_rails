This species has not yet been illustrated. The specimen drawn
is part of Brazier's original series; it is 4*1 mm. in major diameter,
3*3 mm. in minor diameter, and 1-8 mm. in height. Prof. Tate is
responsible for the above synonomy.

The specimen drawn was kindly identified for me by Mr. W.
F. Petterd; it measures 2*3 mm. in major diameter, 2 mm. in minor
diameter, and 1 -5 mm. in height. It was presented to me by
Mr. T. S. Hall, who collected it at Fern Tree Gully, Victoria.

The present is the first illustration presented of this species; it
is derived from an authentic specimen 3*6 mm. in major diameter,
3 mm. in minor diameter, and 2 mm, in height.
The drawings of this and the last three species were made
about seven years ago, but their publication has been delayed by
constant pressure of work. I owe apologies for their tardy issue
to many friends who have kindly contributed material for study.
