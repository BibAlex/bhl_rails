This insect was originally described from Adelaide, S.A. My
specimens were obtained at Condobolin, N.S.W.
Length of body 1 ; expanse of wings 2 inches.
General colour dark brown, with face, legs, base of wings and
marks on abdominal segments yellow; the whole insect thickly
clothed w4th fine long greyish and brown hairs. Eyes large,
rounded, light chestnut, mottled with black. Antennae composed
of 30 joints of equal length standing straight up above the head;
ver}' slender, with a hollowed spoon-shaped club at the apex.
Wings of uniform length, transparent, with a clouded parallel
stripe down the front margin.
Specimens of the larvae of this lace-wing were found under the
bark pulled otf the trunk of a dead sheoak (Casuarina) at Condo-
bolin, N.S.W., on the 9th of September. They were resting
against the trunk, and did not move until touched. When placed
in a box they rested against the side in a similar manner, with
the head pointing upwards and the ventral surface flattened
against the wall, apparently never moving in the day time; nor
did they eat any flies or other live insects placed in the box.
They remained in this state a few days over a month, when one
pupated, forming the usual round, parchment-like cocoon, about
I inch in diameter, from which the insect emei-ged on the 9th
January.
