gular extending to posterior border of mandible, lateral gulars
mostly covered by median gular; six branchiostegals; dermal bone
ornamentation weak to strong; origin of dorsal fin at fourteenth
scale row; gradual change from rhomboidal to narrow flank scales
in first five vertical scale rows.
Referred specimens. — From the Shuttle Meadow Formation,
Durham, Connecticut: AMNH 575 (type), AMNH 669, MCZ 6254,
WU 907, WU 865. From the Shuttle Meadow Formation, North
Guilford, Connecticut: AMNH 4519, AMNH 4676, AMNH 4677,
AMNH 4713, AMNH 4714, AMNH 4715, AMNH 4718. From the
Brunswick Formation, Watchung, New Jersey: YPM 6283. From
the Brunswick Formation, Boonton, New Jersey: YPM 6272. From
the ?Bull Run Shale, Midland, Virginia: AMNH 4808, AMNH 4810,
AMNH 4811, AMNH 4812, AMNH 4813, AMNH 4814, AMNH
4815, AMNH 4816, AMNH 4817, USNM 21288, USNM 21289,
USNM 21290, USMN 21840. From the ?Bull Run Shale, Hay-
market, Virginia: USNM 18323. The specimens listed above were
the most useful in this study because of their well-preserved
morphological details. In addition, there are several dozen cata-
logued and uncatalogued specimens of P. marshi at various
institutions.
Description. — Approximate measurements of the more
complete specimens of P. marshi on which this description is based
are presented in Table 1. The specimen sample includes fishes of
relatively modest size and slender body (figs. 1, 2). An average of 28
per cent of the standard length is occupied by the head and
opercular apparatus. It is not possible to obtain an accurate
measurement of the maximum body depth (which occurs in front of
the dorsal fin), but it is estimated to be less than the length of the
head, including the opercular apparatus. The dorsal fin is triangular
and originates near the middle of the body. The anal fin is slightly
smaller in size, is similarly triangular, and is situated about halfway
between the pelvics and the caudal. The pelvic fins arise behind the
termination of the dorsal and are much closer to the anal than to
the pectorals. The hemiheterocercal caudal fin, supported by a
stout caudal peduncle (AMNH 4813) is robust, equilobate, and
moderately cleft.
The endocranium, seen in NMNH 21289 (fig. 3B), is dorsoven-
trally compressed and difficult to interpret. It is typically
palaeonisciform and shows no evidence of subdivision into separate
centers of ossification. The ethmoid region is about twice as broad
