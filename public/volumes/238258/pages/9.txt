specimens of a new fossil fish at his well-known locality near
Durham, Connecticut. The specimens were presented to Professor J.
S. Newberry, who recognized them as a new species of the genus
Ptycholepis, previously known only from the European Triassic and
Liassic. Newberry (1878) named this species P. marshi and later
provided a more complete description of it in his monograph on the
fishes and plants from the Triassic of New Jersey and the
Connecticut Valley (Newberry, 1888).
Although additional specimens were collected at Durham and
other localities in the Connecticut Valley, subsequent discussions of
P. marshi (see, for example, Lesley, 1889; Woodward, 1895;
Eastman, 1905, 1911) added little to the knowledge of the species, in
part because of poor preservation and inadequate preparation
techniques. Between 1942 and 1949, two amateur collectors, F. M.
