seems qxiite convinced that the collections represent a good species.
It would be quite helpful if achenes from such "forms" could be
procured and germinated so as to see if the resultant plants breed
true.
As to the origin of Chrysanthgllum gy^illum, I favor a
relatively old introduction from some extinct pcpulaticnal source not
too unlike C^ indicum var. mexicajaaB . It has the chromosome number
(2n = 8 II), reduced habit, and small, narrowly winged achenes of
th'at taxon. In addition, highly "sterile" disk florets and
tuberculate achenes are found in related taxa frcan the region where
C.. indicum occurs, suggesting that southwestern Mexico was the
ancestral area from whence it dispersed.
