1988 Bunting, New Venezuelan Araceae 475
(0.8 as long). Venezuelan material of this affinity has narrower
leaf blades 2-3(-3.5) times longer than wide, with a petiole to 1.5
times longer than the blade.
There are also differences in the inflorescences. In subspecies
sabulosum, the inside of the spathe tube is red or wine, while the
limb is white becoming rose dotted with wine. No red coloration has
been reported in the spathe of the typical subspecies. The stam-
inate flowers, which are mostly 4-stamened in subsp. sabulosum , are
apparently identical to those of subsp. remifolium , judging from
the fine illustration accompanying its original publication, not-
withstanding a statement to the contrary in the description.
The known area of distribution of subsp. sabulosum in Venezuela
(Rios Atabapo, Guainia and Negro) is separated from that of the
typical subspecies in southeastern Colombia by more than 350 km,
but it is unknown if this represents a disjunction or only a lack
of botanical collection in the intervening region.

A member of sect. Pteromischum, this species is separated from
other Guayanan species of this group by its distinctive leaf. The
blade, which is narrowly ovate in outline (2.5-3.8 times longer than
wide), is somewhat inequilateral as well as lightly falcate - both
characters accentuated at the acuminate apex. It has only ca. 6
primary lateral veins on each side, and these are scarcely discer-
nible on the adaxial face. Moreover, the wings of the petiole do
not extend beyond the base of the geniculum. This taxon is close
to £. guttiferum ; unfortunately, the latter, as presently construed,
is either very polymorphic or, more probably, a collection of sev-
eral different species.
