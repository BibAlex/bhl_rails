412-4i3l' 1972." TYPE: MEXICO. Michoacan: Summit of Canon el
Marques, ca. 8 km N of Nueva Italia, imgrazed hillsides in &3uteloua
grassland, 450-500 m, 19 Sep 1958, McVaugh 18030 (holotype MICH!;
isotypes ENCB!, LL!, MICH!, NY!).
Slender, delicate, erect, glabrous annuals, 10-40 cm tall.
Leaves, 2-9 cm long, pinnately dissected with narrowly linear
divisions. Peduncles, at maturity, 7-12 cm long. Heads 1.2-1.8 cm
across, 6-8 mm high, subtended by 3-4 bracts ca. 2 mm long; involucre
double, an outer series of 5, scarious-margined, lanceolate
phyllaries, 4-5 mm long, 1.5-2.0 mm wide, an inner series of 5(8)
similar phyllaries. Ray florets 8-15, "orange", the ligules 5-7 mm
long, ca. 2 mm wide, 4-5(6) nerved, obtuse or emarginate. Disk
florets 20-30, brownish-red, "sterile", the tube 1.0-1.5 mm long,
limb 3-4 mm long, 5(4) lobed. Ray achenes clavate, slightly
incurved, 3.5-4.0 mm long, abaxially, 6-8 sulcate.
DISTRIBUTION. Known only from the type collection, cited above.
As noted by McVaugh in his original description, the species is
quite distinct, being closer to Oiry sa n thel lvp americammi than to C,
^ndicum. Actually, with the exception of C^^ keilii , C. f iliforme ,
with its 4-5 nerved ligules, pinnately dissected leaves and somewhat
incurved achenes, seems to stand closer to C^ jjivolutum than it does
to ^ michoacptnum . its closest taxon among the C*^ americanum^ complex.
The relationship of Cj_ f j.lifojme to C^ keilii is discussed under the
latter.

Slender, erect, glabrous annual, 20-50 cm tall. Leaves, 3-15 cm
long, pinnately dissected with narrowly linear divisions. Peduncles,
at maturity, 7-18 cm long. Heads 1.0-1.5 cm across, 6-B mm high,
subtended by 3-5 bracts ca. 2 mm long; involucre double, an outer
series of 5, scarious-margined, lanceolate phyllaries, 5-6 mm long,
1.5-2.5 mm wide, an inner series of 5(8) similar phyllaries. Ray
florets 21-32, orange, the ligules 4.0-6.5 mm long, 2.0-3.0 mm wide,
4-nerved, obtuse or with a small notch. Disk florets 20-40, brown,
mostly fertile, the tube 0.5-2.0 mm long, limb 2.0-4.5 mm long, 5-
lobed. Ray achenes strongly incurved, 4-5 mm long, ca. 1 mm in
diameter, rugose and 2-4 sulcate along the outer surface, the inner
surface smooth; disk achenes somewhat spoon-shaped, 3.5-4.0 mm long,
the body black, ca. 1 mm wide, smooth and glabrous on the outer
