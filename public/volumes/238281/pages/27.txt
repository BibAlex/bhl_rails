the presence of well-developed wings on the ray achenes. In
northoentral Argentina populations occur in which individuals have
both ray and disk achenes essentially monomorphic or heteromorphic
(i.e., disk achenes winged and the ray achenes unwinged). Indeed,
the development of wings on ray achenes should not require much of a
genetic change and I suggest that the considerably polymorphic
variation which I found during my own field work in this region is
due to such variaticai. In any case additional work will be needed to
show that C^ argsaitatiJii is an isolated gene pool growing within the
bounds of Q^ indicum var. af rcgLm j ericanui'" â€¢ Personally, I suspect that
the former are weakly differentiated populations in which only a few
genes for wing expression on the ray achenes have become partially
fixed. Experimental crosses and progeny studies will be needed to
resolve the problem.
Brazilian populations are also quite variable, especially the
disk achenes, which often possess very narrow, ciliate, ccurtilaginous
margins similar to those found in var. mexiccmum . Similar forms also
occur rarely in African populations; expression of this character is
apparently regulated by a relatively simple genetic system. The
larger heads, more numerous flowers, and the occurrence of
individvials within these same populations with winged achenes typical
of var. gif roeunericapuni , show that the origin or closest affinity of
the Brazilian populations must lie with the South American-African
taxcn and not var. mexicanimn . Considering its weedy nature cind the
paucity of material collected in the Brazilian area it seems likely
that these populations were introduced into this region from Andean
populations in relatively recent times.
Wild (1967) and Milne-Redhead (1948) treated the African
specimens of Qy- ysantj^ljLvgq If KJi ^ cum as ^ americanum , as did workers
before them. They report collections from the countries of Malawi,
Mozambique, Rhodesia and Zambia. In December of 1975 I examined
African specimens at BM and K and in December of 1982 from MO. The
earliest year of collection is given in parenthesis for the following
countries :
Angola (1857) Kenya (1915) Southwest Africa (1907)
Burundi (1972) Malawi (1974) Sudan (1929)
Cameroun (1964) Mozambique (1944) Tanzania (1932)
Eritrea (1902) Nigeria (1899) Uganda (1912)
Ethiopia (1838) Rhodesia (1912) Upper Volta (1972)
Guinea (1949) Senegal (1938) Yemen[Arabian Peninsula] (1977)
Ivory Coast (1967) South Africa (1906) Zaire (1950)
Thus, if introduced into Africa during historic times,
Oyysgnti^llijTi jjidicum probably found first-footing in the Abyssinian
highlands of East Africa, subsequently spreading to the more western
and southern lower montane regions. Indeed, populations from
Ethiopia eire exceedingly variable and sane of these with small heads
and nearly wingless achenes could as readily be annotated as var.
