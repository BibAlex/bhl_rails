1988 Neson, Synopsis of Chaetopappa 455
CHAETOPAPPA HERSHEYI S. F. Blake, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington 59:47
1946.
Endemic to the Guadalupe Moutains of southern New Mexico and
adjacent Texas, rocky (limestone) walls, ledges, and banks in
canyons; 1500-2400 m; May-Aug. Chromosome number, n=8 pairs.
CHAETOPAPPUS IMBERBIS (A. Gray) Nesom (see description and discussion
above )
CHAETOPAPPA PARRYI A. Gray, Proc. Amer. Acad. Arts 16:82. 1880.
C. keerlioides Shinners
Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, and San Luis Potosi. Mexico,
rare in south-central Texas (Brewster Co.); chaparral or areas of
oak, oak-juniper, oak-pine-fir, or pine woods, moist stream sides,
steep slopes in crevices or talus; 1400-3000 (-3600) m; May-Sep
(-Oct).
Chaetopappa keerlioides was described by Shinners (1946) as
differing from C^ parryi by larger cauline leaves, but with more
collections we find that the range of variation in this character is
continuous. According to Shinners, achenes of C^ parryi sometimes
bear 1-5 bristles, but this must be very rare because I have never
observed bristles at all.
CHAETOPAPPA PLOMOENSIS B. Turner, Sida 7:22. 1977.
A distinctive species known only from the type collection:
Coahuila, Mexico, La Cuesta del Plomo on the Musquiz-Boquiilas
highway, steep limestone slopes and canyon, encinar/izotal; Sep.
CHAETOPAPPA PULCHELLA Shinners, Wrightia 1:79. 1946.
Chihuahua and Coahuila, Mexico; matorral or chaparral, commonly
with Larrea; 950-1750 m; (Mar-) Apr-Oct. Chromosome number, n=8
pairs.
