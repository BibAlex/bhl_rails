DISTRIBUTION (Fig. 3). Mostly montane or moderatly elevated
regions of South America and Africa where it occurs as a weed along
paths, in gardens and disturbed cureas generally; possibly introduced
into Africa from South American in relatively recent times.
Flowering most all seasons, depending upon rain.
An exceedingly variable, weedy taxcxi, especially on the eastern
side of the Andes in northern Argentina, Bolivia, and Peru where it
is undoubtedly native. (I l^ry s ant h^l lum tuberculatum is a sporadic
form of the variety possessing tuberculate ray (and often disk)
achenes; such plants occur throughout the American region. Cabrera
(1973) correctly noted the relationship of the South American
material to be with ^ ffldi ^ cum and £^ mexJcan um and not Cj^ american yjm
where most workers positioned these plants.
The Peruvian ^ webej^bau i eiri is a form with squat, much-
thickened, sanewhat tuberculate ray achenes, but otherwise sceircely
different from typical pt f ro a mericranum ; individuals of the latter
occur in the same region with the former suggesting that this
character is quite polymorphic. Indeed a similar, but not so
striking, variability is found in African populations in which the
ray achenes may be smooth or tuberculate, etc. Also noteworthy in
both African and South American plants is the occasional occurrence
of poorly developed, but distinct, awns at the apex of the disk
achenes, much in the manner of Bidens or I sp stiqma .
Ariza and Cerana recognized ChrysantJ^ e llum eircientinum largely by
