422 PHYTOLOGIA Vol. 64, No. 6
Annual, glabrous, often succulent herbs, 5-30 cm tall, at first
rosulate but soon forming prostrate branches. Leaves simple,
oblanceolate, finely to coarsely toothed from above the middle.
Peduncles 5-15 cm long at maturity, swollen just below the head.
Heads 8-12 mm across, 5-8 mm high, subtended by 4 or subulate
bracts, 3-4 mm long; involucre double, an outer series of ca. 5
elliptic to ovate, scarious-margined phyllaries, 5-6 mm long, 2-3 mm
wide, these alternating with a similar inner series. Receptacle
convex, the pales linear, ca. 2/3 as long as the disk florets. Ray
florets yellow, usually ca. 34 but often up to 55, the ligules
bidentate, 5-6(7) mm long, 1.0-1.5 mm wide, 2-nerved. Disk florets
ca. 35, yellow, (4-)5-lobed, "sterile", the tube ca. 1.5 mm long, the
limb 3-4 mm long. Ray achenes clavate, 3-4 mm long, prcÂ»ninently 8-10
grooved, or mcirkedly 8-ridged, at maturity.
Chromosome number undetermined.
DISTRIBUTION (Fig. 5): States of Veracruz, Oaxaca and Chiapas
in Mexico; Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama. Reportedly
common locally in full sun on wet clay soils at lower elevations
(from sea level to 200 m). Flowering, Jul-Nov.
In spite of its locally weedy nature, the species is apparently
relatively rare, to judge from the sparcity of collections in
herbaria. Only one or two collection sites are known for each of the
following: Veracruz (GH, NY), Chiapas (MICH), Oaxaca (ASU, MICH,
TEX), El Salvador (F, MICH) and Honduras (F). While Guatemalan
collections were not seen in the present study, it must surely occur
in that country and perhaps other Central American Republics, for it
appecirs to be quite common in Panama.
Alexander inexplicably treated this as a variety of
Chryganthellum americanum . The two taxa are distinguished by a
number of vegetative and floral features, occupy different habitat
types, are largely allopatric, and do not intergrade. The
relationship of C^ integrifolium is almost certainly with C
michoacanum and recent collections of the former from Oaxaca by
Professor Keil seemingly reveal intergrades, ( 1555,5 , ASU, ENCB, TEX)
and additional study might justify treatment of Cj. michoaqanyim as a
localized vairiety of C^ illtegrifolium .
