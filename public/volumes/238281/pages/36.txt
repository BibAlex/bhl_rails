Exploration of Cerro Espina, a site near Pachutla, Oaxaca, well-
known for its concentration of endemic taxa, has revealed the following
novelty in Melampodium. It is related to the delicate annual, M.
tepicense . but amply distinct.
MELAMPODIUM NORTHINGTONII B. L. Turner, sp. nov.. Fig. 2.
M. tepicensi B. L. Rob. simile sed foliis glabris, pedunculis 10-23 mm
longis, et flosculis disci numerosioribus (10-14) differet.
Annual herb to 30 cm high. Stems erect, 1.0-1.5 mm diameter,
puberulent to nearly glabrate. Leaves mostly 20-35 mm long, 10-20 mm
wide; petioles 5-8 mm long; blades rhombic-ovate, broadly obtuse at the
base, acute to obtuse at the apices, the upper surfaces sparsely strigose,
the lower surfaces glabrous or nearly so, the margins obscurely crenate.
Heads 2-3 mm high on peduncles 8-28 mm long. Involucre cupulate, 3.5-5.0
mm across; outer bracts 5, elliptical, somewhat connate at base, ca 2.5
mm long, 1.0-1.5 mm wide, rounded or obtuse at the apex. Fruits (body)
ca 2 mm high, ca 1.5 mm across, the lateral surfaces with a vertical or
oblique tuberculate ridge across an alveolate face; apices mostly without
appendages (however, a few abaxial, flattened, appendages up to 2.5 mm
long occur on a few fruits). Ray florets 5; corollas yellow, the ligules
1.5-2.0 mm long, 0.5-1.0 mm wide. Disc florets 10-12. Palea obovate, ca
1.5 mm long, 0.5 mm wide.
TYPE: MEXICO. OAXACA: southern lower slopes of Cerro Espina, ca 9
mi N of Pachutla. 23 Aug 1980, B, L. Turner 80A-26. (holotype TEX;
isotype MEXU).
The species obviously belongs to the section Serratura of
Melampodium and will key to Nl tepicense B. L. Rob. in Stuessy's (1972)
treatment of the genus. The latter species occurs along the Pacific Coast
from Nayarit to Michoacan (Fig. 1). Melampodium northingtonii can be
distinguished from Nl tepicense by its much longer peduncles, nearly
glabrous leaves and more numerous disc florets. It is also close to M.
dicoelocarpum B. L. Rob. but the latter has longer, more acuminate,
leaves, longer peduncles, larger heads, longer rays and fruits with
different sculpturing, etc.
Melampodium northingtonii might, with some validity, be treated as a
variety of either Nl tepicense or Nl dicoelocarpum but it appears as
distinct from both of these as does ML sinaloense Stuessy. Indeed, it
appears somewhat intermediate between these several taxa but, overall,
