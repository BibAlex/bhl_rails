florets fertile or functionally staminate throughout.
Ray corollas pistillate, fertile, mostly yellow, 2-8
nervate. Disk corollas 4-5 lobate with well-marked tube
and limb; often of 2 types, an outer, mostly yellow,
series ca 1/2 the size of the inner florets, the latter
usually with brown or reddish-brown, corollas. Anthers
small, the appendages well-developed and acute. Style
branches of ray florets filiform, acute, those of the
disk well-developed with penicillate appendages 2-3 times
the lengths of the stigmatic lines when fertile, or fused
and merely bifid when sterile. Achenes dimorphic, those
of the ray mostly clavate, epappose, unwinged, straight
or variously recurved or coiled; disk achenes, when
present, flattened, prominently winged, epappose or very
rarely with 2 deciduous awns. Base chromosome number,
x=8 or possibly x=4 .
