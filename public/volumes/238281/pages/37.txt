It is a pleasure to name this species for Dr. David Northington,
currently Director of the National Wildflower Center, Austin, Texas, who
worked on the composite genus Pyrrhopappus for his doctoral thesis at
the University of Texas, Austin. He also participated in the field work
that led to the discovery of the present novelty.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I am grateful to Dr. Tod Stuessy for a critical appraisal of the
manuscript; to Dr. Guy Nesom for the Latin diagnosis; and to Doris
Tischler for the illustration.
