Erect to ascending (rarely subrosulate) glabrous, annual herbs.
Leaves bi-or tripinnatisect, up to 12 cm long. Peduncles, at
maturity, 6-15 cm long. Heads 4-16 mm across, 6-7 mm high, subtended
by 2-4 linear bracts, 2-4 mm long; involucre double, an outer series
of ca. 8, elliptic to oval phyllaries, 4-6 mm long, 2-3 mm wide, an
inner series of ca. 5, linear to cfclong phyllaries, 4-5 mm long, 0.5-
1.3 mm wide. Ray florets 18-21, yellow, the ligules 6-7 mm long, 2-3
mm wide, 4-5 nerved and bidentate. Disk florets yellow, "sterile",
the tube 0.8-1.0 mm long, limb 2.8-3.1 mm long. Ray achenes
circinate-involute, the outer surface rugose and nerved at maturity,
the inner surface smooth, ca. 0.8 mm wide, 2-3 mm in diameter.
DISTRIBUTION (Fig. 6). Limestone hills in states of Mexico,
Michoacan, and Guerrero. Flowering, Aug-Sep.
The species was originally known frcan only 7 Hinton collections cited
by Wilson in his original description, duplicates of which cire widely
distributed. An excellent drawing accompanying this description
depicts nicely the important features of the plant, except that of
the functionally staminate florets, which is commented upon by Wilson
as "peculiar for the subtribe Corecpsidinae as the disk florets are
always sterile." Actually, completely sterile disk florets were
recorded for Chyysanthellum irvfceqrifolium nearly a century earlier by
Steetz (1856V in his' original description of that species. It is
also found in several additional species, some of which are quite
closely related to species with fructiferous disk achenes (e.g., Cj.
filifgrme and ^ keilii ).
The only collections of C^ ;Lnyolutum, besides those of Hinton
mentioned above, are those of Kgil 15368, 15371 (both from the
vicinity of Arcelia, Guerrero, 6 Sep 1981, ASU).
Cl'p r ysan ^ thi^llum i n vqlu tum superficially resemble ^ indicum var.
mexiganum but its closest relationship is presumably with C.
tarnaulipengg f which is vegetatively similar to C^ involH,tHnj and
possesses circinate ray achenes, but has at least some of the disk
florets in each head quite fertile. This is not so for C^ invplutuin ,
as determined by my examination of 100 or more heads frcÂ»ii 50 or more
plants.
