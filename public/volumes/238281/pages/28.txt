Jones ^ 77^ (holotype POM). As noted by Morton (1945), Sherff was
the first to relegate this to synonymy under this taxon.
Similar to, but differing from, the var. jLpdj i ^ qyn in possessing
longer peduncles and longer leaves but especially by the somewhat
larger disk achenes with narrower, more ciliate, cartilaginous
margins. As noted by Greenman in his original description, var.
pi g g^< f^num bears a close resemblance to var. indicum ; this was also
recognized by Cabrera (1973). I agree with both these authors and
after excunining a broad suite of specimens from throughout the world
find it most reasonable to treat the largely continental isolates as
weak, but distinct, varieties, most of which are sufficiently
differentiated so as to be accorded the rank of subspecies.
DISTRIBUTION (Fig. 4). Mostly montane or moderately elevated
subtropical regions of Mexico and Guatemala where it occurs as a weed
along paths and roadways, especially in shallow wet depressions.
Flowering, Jul-Oct.
