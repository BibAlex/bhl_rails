treatment for the North American Flora, recognized, or
was familiar with, but two of these, C_^ americanum and C .
indicum .
Mexico is especially rich in Chrysanthellum taxa, 10
of the 11 species are known to occur there. Steetz
(1853) described the first mainland species for North
America, C_^ integrif olium ; this was followed by Greenman
(1903) who added C^ mexicanum {reduced to a variety of C.
indicum by Turner); P.G. Wilson (1962) added C .
involutum ; McVaugh (1972) added C^ f ilif orme ; Strother
(1976) added C_^ pilzii ; and I have added the remainder of
those recognized in the present paper.
At the present time I recognize 11 species in the
genus: 1) a widespread pantropical weed, C^^ indicum,
with 4 regional varieties; 2) C_^ americanum , itself a
highly variable weedy taxon, largely confined to the
Caribbean Islands, and much-confused with C_^ indicum; 3)
C . pusi Hum , an endemic of the Galapagos Islands; the
remaining 8 species are native to the mainland of North
America, mostly narrow endemics of the Pacific slopes of
Mexico.
