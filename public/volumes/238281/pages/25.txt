Occasional specimens of var. ^ndicurn (Pplun ;Ln et ajj. ,5 81 ,2' BM;
£IarKg 2_4§19 > BM) occur which have heads as large as those of var.

the indicum -type. suggesting that the suite of subtle characters used
to distinguish among the several infraspecific cataegories are
relatively well-fixed, genetically speaking.
5b. CHRYSA NTHELLUM INDICUM var. MADAGASCARENSE B. L. Turner, var.
nov.
Cjirysanthellum indicum var. indicum accedens sed marginibus
cartilaginis acheum debile evolutis, foliis parvioribus minus
dissectis, TYPE: CENTRAL MADAGASCAR. "Bessileo: an Strotknen
Stellen der, Flugel." Mar 1881, J^ ^ Hildebrandt ,^,^43 (holotype
US!; isotype K!).
Additional specimens examined: MADAGASCAR. Angavo, 19 Oct
1931, M^ R^ Becary 7285 (K, US); Ankatso, 2 Feb 1921, Dec^ry 240 (K).
DISTRIBUTION (Fig. 3). Known only from a few, mostly poorly-
preserved specimens from the highland regions of Central Madagascar
where it reportedly grows prostrate, although one collection ( Deoarv
24fl ) shows the plant to be at least weakly ascending. Flowering,
Feb-Mar.
As noted in the discussion of var. indicum , oollecticxis of var.
madaqascaraxse available to me appear quite distinct and additional
material might show the taxon to be deserving of subspecific
recognition .
Subsp. AFROAMEEIICANUM B. L. Turner, Phytologia 51: 291. 1982.
Similar to the subspecies indicum but differing in its larger
fruiting involucres (4-6 mm long); disk achenes with more prcxninent,
well-developed, cartilaginous wings or corky margins, 0.2-0.4 mm
wide; and ray florets mostly 13-34 (very rarely 8).
Chromosome number, 2n = 16 II.
The subspecies is comprised of but a single variety.

hard dry soils", w/o date, ^ Twggdie 1107 (not 1109 as cited)
(lectotype K!). In the original description a collection by Gillies
from Cordoba was also cited; I choose to typify the name with the
Tweedie oollection.
