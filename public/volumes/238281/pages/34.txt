1988 Turner, Taxonomy of ChrysanChellum 443
Prostrate glabrous einnual herbs. Leaves bipinnatisect, 2-6 cm
Icaig. Pedxaicles slender, at maturity 4-12 cm long. Heads 12-15 mm
across, 5-6 mm high, subtended by 2-4 linear bracts, 2-4 mm long;
involucre double, an outer series of 5, narrowly ovate, scarious-
margined, phyllaries 4-5 mm long, 1.5-2.0 mm wide, the inner series
similar but somewhat smaller. Ray florets ca. 21, yellow, the
ligules ca. 6 mm long, 1.2-2.0 mm wide, 4-nerved, obtuse or
indistinctly notched. Disk flowers yellow, at least some of them
quite fertile, 5(4)-lobed, the tube ca. 1 mm long, limb ca. 2 mm
long. Ray achenes circinate, the abaxial surfaces rugose at
maturity, the inner surfaces smooth, ca. 0.8 mm wide, 1.8-2.0 mm in
diameter. Disk achenes narrowly elliptic, ca. 4 mm long, 2 mm wide,
bordered with conspicuous, erose, often ciliate, corky wings.
Chromosome number, 2ji = 8 II.
DISTRIBUTION (Fig. 6). Known only from the holotype and one
additional collection (Tamaulipas: 2.4 mi N of Aldama, 16 Sep 1964,
Strother 544 . TEX).
The species is undoubtedly closely related to Chrxsanthellum
jjivplljtum but is readily distinguished by its smaller, less
petiolate, mid-stem leaves, generally smaller floral parts and
especially by its quite fertile disk florets. In all these
characters Cj. jatnaulip^se approaches ^ ii^.qum but its circinate,
mzirginal achenes and 4-nerved ligules place it nearer C^ involutum .
