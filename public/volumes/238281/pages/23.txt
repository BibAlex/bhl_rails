2-4(5) mm long, ca. 1 mm wide, with 2, or rarely 3, conspicuous
nerves. Disk florets (4)5-lobed, most of them fertile, corolla
orange-yellow to yellow (rarely white), ca. 1 mm long, the tube ca.
0.2 mm long; limb ca. 0.8 mm long, lobes acute, ca. 0.2 mm long. Ray
achenes 2-3 mm long, oolumnar-clavate, with 3, or less often 2 sulci
on the ad- and abaxial surfaces. Disk achenes linear-oblong, 2-3 mm
long, ca. 1 mm wide, the faces bordered by a prominent, often rugose,
cartilaginous, ciliate margin.
Chromosome number undetermined.
DISTRIBUTION (Fig. 5). Cuba, Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and
Haiti) and Jamaica Islands; also Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and
southernmost Mexico (Chiapas) in continental North America. Mostly a
weed in grassy fields and waste places at various elevations in the
island areas but usually in pine and oak-pine woodlands and meadows
of the lower montane regions (300-2000 m) on the mainland.
Flowering, all seasons, according to rains.
This species, though quite distinct and fairly restricted in
distributions, has long been confused with C^ indicum . Itie latter is
nearly pantropic but its range does not overlap that of C.
amerjccinum .
The island populations of Chrvsanth ellum were probably derived
from relatively recent introductions from Central America, to jiidge
from their morphological similarities, but it was presumably already
established on Jamaica and Cuba at the time of European ventures into
the region, for abundant, widespread, collections were <±»tained on
these two islands by early collectors.
5. CHRYSA^^^HELLUM INDICUM DC.
Erect to prostrate, glabrous or nearly so, annual herbs up to 30
cm tall. Leaves bi-or tripinnatisect, 1-8 cm long. Peduncles 0.5-
6.0 cm long, smooth or bearing scattered tuberculae. Heads 3-6 mm
across, 2-6 mm high, subtended by 1 or 2 (rarely more) linear bracts.
Involucre doi±)le, an outer series of 5(8) linear-ovate, phyllaries 2-
5 mm long, 1-2 mm wide, the inner series similar but somewhat
smaller. Ray florets 5-34 (modes at 5, 8, 13, 21 and 34), yellow or
orange-yellow, the ligules usually bidentate, 1.0-2.5 mm long, 0.2-
0.5 mm wide, 2-nerved. Disk florets fertile, 4- or rarely 5-lcA)ed;
corollas yellow, 0.8-1.3 mm long, the tube 0.2-0.3 mm long, limb 0.6-
1.0 mm long. Ray achenes 2-4(5) mm long, compressed to columnar-
clavate to cuboid, often corky-winged at maturity, smooth to ribbed
on all faces, less often tuberculate. Disk achenes flattened,
linear-oblong to oval, 2.3-5.0(6.0) mm long, 1-2 mm wide, the faces
bordered with a narrow to broad callous margin (rarely absent), this
being variously ciliate, tuberculate, erose or cor)cy.
